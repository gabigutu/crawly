		<shortDescription>Delivers Intelligence &amp; Great Acting with its Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie. I won't dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can. Marvel needed to get in to the solo movie making business long ago. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves. Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film! This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level. Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by "Marvelizing" characters and making them more believable. The Spider-Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau has done the same thing here but I think he's done it even better. Raimi intentionally threw in a little cheese. Favreau adds nice bits of humor but not too much. He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality. I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.The amazing yet realistic action is paced by the plot and characters that keep you interested from start to finish. What absolutely blew me away were the phenomenal special effects. I know they built a practical, working armor. What I loved is the use of CGI was used to augment the real life armor and not create something from scratch. Most all CGI constructs feel fake somehow but the stuff in Iron Man didn't seem fake even for an instant. As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot. Sure the concept is wild but it's all presented so that you really believe it could happen. I doubt anyone will find fault with this movie unless they went in trying to dislike it.This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2008, quite possibly the number one film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film That Lives Up To Its Hype And The Expectations Of Comic Readers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid reader of the Iron Man comics, I was excited but also very scared that this movie would flop.While Robert Downey is not the biggest name in Hollywood, he plays the part perfectly and I was greatly impressed by how he portrayed Iron Man so well.The humor works well for this film also. It's well-written and has a great cast.What impressed me the most was the CGI! They're breath-taking, but aren't distracting enough to let you miss the finer points of this movie.In conclusion, while not perfect, Iron Man lives up to its hype and my expectations as a reader of the comic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fortunately, I'm not one easily influenced by some users' negative comments. These people should try to restrain their bias opinions and try to review the movies as neutrally as possible.Now I would say that this movie has slow but steady momentum-building. It is a movie for people who has never known Iron Man in the comic series. The characters are given names and personalities, true to their comic book counterparts.Acting was among the best comic-turn movie I have seen so far. Effects were believable and not overwhelmingly CGI, except for the tank scene.This movie, however, has sequel written all over it. We know that because there are many scenes that could have lead to more.It's well worth its ticket price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Well Done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the world premier of Iron man to regular movie going audiences happened to be here in Seoul Korea on an army installation. I got to check it out and I was delightfully surprised.Much against the hype, I thought this movie would have been torrid trash acting mingled with cheesy fight scenes. I mean Robert Downey Jr as an action superhero? But I am glad to admit that I misjudged the movie completely. Downey played a very good Tony Stark, in generally every way. From his jokes to his obnoxious lifestyle he looked and walked the part very well. His banter with his right hand assistant Ms. Pepper Potts isn't mind numbing and actually found myself laughing aloud at some of the wit.The movie itself moved at a very good pace. Mixing action, comedy and some drama to just about the right proportions. As with most superhero movies, its rather predictable, but in all the right ways you'd want a superhero movie to be. The animation used was almost seamless, and of course the Iron Man costume was kicking major ass.My only gripe with the movie was the fact that several characters were thrown into the mix with little behind them other than 2D character attributes. Leslie Bibb's character, Christine Everhart, is pretty useless other than the two or three lines she has. Hardly worth a hardbody like Leslie Bibb to play. Several other characters didn't feel fleshed out at all. Raza (Faran Tahir), Obediah Stone (Jeff Bridges) , and even Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard) feel hollow in the fact that they have little justification for many of their actions.So All in all, I'd give this movie an 8.3. Fun for the whole family, great pacing, and a Superhero movie to give the next Batman movie a run for its money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, very impressive !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW WOW WOW.This is the movie I have been waiting for for a very long time. I am an avid Ironman reader. I have collected the comics all my life (from #1 in 1968 to the latest in 2008)...40 years of Ironman. Since I was a kid, I used to say to my friends that they should make an Ironman movie, but everyone laughed and said that the special effects would look ridiculous...mind you, that was back in like in the early 1980's. But, now we are in the age of CGI, and what an age it is. Just for you Ironman fans, to see him come to life with such spectacular graphics is reason enough to spend your hard-earned $10. The plot is also pretty well thought out, and the acting is just fine. What better pick could you have for Tony Stark than Robert Downey Jr.? (just wait for the sequels when they can delve into his alcoholism...Mr. Downey has been there and beyond...that's probably why they chose him for the role...fore-thought)The rest of the cast is right on par, as well. The pace is brisk, and the whole thing works as a great addition to the Marvel Universe in the Cinema!! Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste it?Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property. It was in the guise of director Jon Favreau. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Favs, but when I heard he was helming a big budget comic book flick?let's just say I was a little worried. Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation. Thankfully, after finally seeing the finished product, I was not disappointed in the least. With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider-Man and X-Men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight. We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor. Favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with gags and poorly written jokes. Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.Favreau seems to have had an idea to get an origin story out while not boring us with long drawn out backstory. His ability to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated, showing Tony Stark in his basement creating while the TV in the background explains what is happening in the outside world of the Middle East and inside his own company. We as an audience are allowed to put the pieces together amidst the witty banter of Stark and the wonderful special effects. By the end of the film it is quite amazing how much information you will realize you now know, all culminating in a decent final battle, but more importantly a segue into the inevitable sequel. We are allowed entrance into the character evolution of Stark as he goes from war profiteer to man of action and cause, all while seeing the technology improve and advance before our eyes. Much like Batman, we have a hero here that needs help in fighting crime. He has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat of magic. Every stage is shown, every failure and success. It's quite the ride in and of itself, but when you add onto it the threat of global war and destruction, it can only get better.The real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over-40 to be a superhero. This takes guts, because no matter how appropriate it is, most studios would have said, "no, change the story and make him younger so we can churn out as many of these babies as we can." I don't know how he did it, but Favreau got Marvel to get Robert Downey Jr. to play Stark, a sarcastic lothario with the brain capacity of Einstein. I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene. I'm sure there was some ad-libbing, but even if not, his comic delivery and ability to switch on a dime to a sincere seriousness at will shows his masterful craft.As for the rest of the cast, they all do well. Jeff Bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-top, but appropriately so; Terrence Howard is nice as the friend and military liason, not given much to do, but definitely sowing seeds for the future; and Gwyneth Paltrow is good as the sweet assistant Pepper Potts who at times seems a little underwritten and more female prop than anything else, but comes through with some nice moments in a very comic sort of way. I also really liked Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Stark's savior, and Clark Gregg as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Good to see Favreau giving another actor turned director props, (Gregg's directorial debut comes out later this year in the form of Chuck Palahniuk's Choke). I just wish he would have shied away from putting himself in the film. It's one thing to be seen split-second, (like Stan Lee), but its another to give yourself a thankless role with multiple scenes, just adding fuel to the fire on people's opinions of egotism stemming from the drinking game created off of the TV show "Dinner for Five" and how many references to Swingers was made each episode. I'll forgive, though, because, once again, I'm a big fan.One can't forget that this is an action film above all else, so we can't just praise the actors; every effect is also quite brilliant. Those scenes of Iron Man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer seemed really lame, but when in context they deliver. The suit itself is amazing as well, through every mach stage right to the end. My main highlight, however, was with the computer systems that Stark utilizes. The multiple screens, instant holographic reproductions, and ability to actually interact with those 3D representations is stunning. We can create them in fantasy, but it's just too bad we can't yet in real life.Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation. What it is, though, is a fun, comic actioner that should light up the box office. The final showdown is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the backstory and machine creation; a crucial element is saved from destruction in the one contrived bit of screen writing, (not quite utilized in the way I thought, although still for the same means); and some moments seem a tad campy rather than witty, but otherwise this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen on the big screen. I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a little tinge of shame and regret, my rare dalliances with the Iron Man character stemmed from a few one off comic books, as well as occasions during the teenage years of spending time in the arcade with those Marvel games, where Iron Man was one of my preferred characters because it came together with his incredible arsenal of weapons from repulsor beams to this gigantic cannon which accompanied the execution of some complex combo moves. There's something sexy about the red and gold suit of armour, and having an array of weapons at the disposal of a player, makes perfect sense for variety in dispatching your enemies.This may irk the fervent fans of Iron Man, but face it, the superhero belonged to Tier B where superheroes are concerned, languishing behind easily recognizable peers who already have movie after movie being made. But thanks to the advancement in digital technology, bringing Iron Man to life no longer consisted of the prospect and worrying thought of having a man running about in a rubber suit passing it off as metal, the way Ultraman would have been done, complete with mechanical clicks and whirrs as sound effects to try and fool the visual sensory. Here, we have a very detailed rendering of the entire design from scratch to final modification, and we're in at every step of the way, with many cheeky and sometimes a tad implausible scenes just for cheap laughs thrown in.I thought Iron Man the story worked because of stark (pardon the pun) similarities with Batman Begins, also an origin story which took its time to dwell on the man behind the suit, nevermind at the sacrifice of having less action sequences, or by not giving the fans what they want through the showcase of more than the basic powers. Advanced capabilities can always find room in the sequel, and as the first movie used to establish its characters, I felt that it succeeded, given too that it had a cast of capables (just like Batman Begins had) to pull the movie through without resorting to over the top and campy performances, starting of course with the lead in Robert Downey Jr.In a nutshell, Downey is Tony Stark through and through. His affinity for the character shines, and no doubt it bore some parallels between his own personal, and Stark's life in the narrative future when he hits the bottle. He was allowed to become a Two-Face of sorts, on one hand being and later acting out his flamboyance self whose mission in life was the continuation of his father's legacy of Stark Industries, a weapons conglomerate, versus his personal mission in ridding his own weapons from the hands of the bad guys, now updated to be freedom fighters in the Middle East. The dialogue contained within each scene of Stark's, except perhaps during captivity, is full of one-liners done in double quick time, you probably would think it boiled down to a whole host of natural ad-libbing.But while Starks spends significant amount of time in his unsecured basement building his masterpiece, his human interaction come in the form of faithful secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who actually, for the first time I admit, looked really good on screen as Stark's most trusted aide, bringing about some serious spark of sexual tension and chemistry between the two characters of opposite sex, more so than any other comic book movie I have seen. And good friend from the air force Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard) complete the circle of trust who knows of Stark's secret identity, and you'd be keeping your fingers crossed at the toss of a teaser of a certain War Machine appearance should the sequel be out. Who's the main villain in the movie? It points the finger at Corporations, or at least here, the weapons manufacturers and the shady deals that go through in the name of profit, the sole objective for any corporation's existence. And Jeff Bridges, in a rare villainous role, got to personify that greed and wrestle for absolute power just like the trailer already suggested. While his performance is refreshing as he disappears behind the ball head and bushy beard, you could see his motivation and how the plot would have been developed to introduced the ultimate fodder for Iron Man to duke it out in a, sad to say, ordinary finale which any audience would probably be able to stay a step ahead.As mentioned earlier, there are plenty of similarities with the Dark Knight of Gotham in Christopher Nolan's reboot, but more so because of properties inherent with the likeness between Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark. Both are incredibly wealthy to devote time outside of the day job to pursue their "hobby", both have to suffer personal tragedies in order to wake up to the cruel world, and in the movie, both fall prey to the corporate raider type, spend time perfecting their suit of war, have assistants they would trust their lives with, and of course save them from impending doom, and a finales set at their facilities.But Iron Man is still a special effects extravaganza offering a thrill ride especially when he goes into battle mode, and without a doubt, Robert Downey Jr probably should be credited for raising the profile of this once Tier-B character, to perhaps becoming more recognizable now, and obviously, expanding the fan base of this weaponry filled suit of metal, which of course, in this origin movie, we were only given a glimpse of its potential. can everyone now spell sequel and clamour for more please? Iron Man has set the bar for the other upcoming comic book movies to try and surpass this summer season!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hits a High Standard of Excellence... GREAT Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark with such power that it resonates above all others. Mark my words, Iron Man is such a movie. I've been privileged enough to view an advanced screening and, honestly, it's the best big budget movie that I've seen in many years. It hits a high standard of excellence for mass audiences by combining humor, a smart plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, betrayal, forgiveness, love and puts it all together in one amazing package. The special effects and CGI are probably the best I've ever seen in terms of relatable effects. They're not over the top and don't overwhelm your senses. What's even more remarkable is this movie will surprise a lot of people with its depth while sacrificing none of the fun. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of Tony Stark. Stark's indomitable charm mixed with his flawed character makes this hero more interesting then most. Iron Man delivers action with great emotional moments and a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.The cast is obviously stellar but that doesn't always mean greatness. (American Gangster, Street Kings anyone?) I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Downey himself delivers one of the greatest performances in a comic adaptation film EVER. Maybe it's because the character itself is one of the most complex and intriguing that any genre has to offer but that doesn't diminish just what a home run Downey has hit. They took the character seriously but still remembered to include fun and humor. I almost can't convey how much I enjoyed his performance.Minor SPOILER....My only real complaint is the rumor of a Sam Jackson cameo was not fulfilled. He is even listed here as playing the character of Nick Fury. He did not appear in the cut that I saw. After browsing, it's been offered that his cameo was probably just removed for the early screenings. I hope that's true and they put it back for the final cut. This means I'll just HAVE to see this movie again. LUCKY ME!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the big Robert Downey Jr show - and I like it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first moment Robert Downey Jr comes on screen as Tony Stark, you know that this movie can't go wrong. We are in some desert in Afghanistan and wisecracking Stark tells something about his playboy life to some soldiers. Yes, this ain't no nerdy Peter Parker or tortured Wolverine. Our hero is a person who generally enjoys life (and women) and has no second thoughts on how he lives it. Without any doubt, of all the superheroes that exist, Tony Stark is the coolest person there is! But of course his bubble bursts when Stark is kidnapped by terrorists and forced to reproduce his killing missile, the Jericho. The sacrifice of a fellow scientist makes him humble and after his spectacular escape Stark decides to better his life. No more manufacturing of weapons for Stark Industries. From now on Stark wants to help his fellow men. Although this decision impresses some (like Stark's secretary Paltrow) it also infuriates others (like Stark's partner Jeff Bridges). This all leads to a action-packed finale in which Iron Man must face a deadly enemy...Iron Man is the big Robert Downey Jr. show. Downey not only brings humor and flamboyance to his role, he also manages to make you believe that an egocentric person can indeed change into a real humanitarian. The scene in which he realizes that someone is willing to make a sacrifice in order for him to escape is even a moving one. Well done. Downey is really a great actor with great charisma.But there is a lot more to Iron Man. There are four or five big action scenes. The first four are so great (the escape from the cave and a sequence involving an Afghan village) that the last one - the big finale - disappoints a little bit. But that's okay. There are also a lot of smaller scenes to be enjoyed, focusing on the relationship between Downey and Paltrow and the development of the Iron Man armour. Jeff Bridges is always great to look at, although his role could have been played by several other actors. Maybe his storyline is the weakest of the film. His betrayal is no surprise, but his early involvement in this is hard to believe. Iron Man is a spectacular and funny popcorn ride that not only has great action scenes, but also some great actors. Hopefully it will do very well at the box office, because I can't wait to see Iron Man 2. Enjoy!PS: no Samuel Jackson in this version either!8,5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavy boots of lead, fills his victims full of dread, running as fast as they can, Iron man lives again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man, the huge kick off to the big summer blockbusters of summer 2008, a great start. I have to say that originally I had my concerns, when I saw the trailer, this movie looked way over done and Robert Downy, Jr. as the hero? The guy is a great actor, but as a super hero? I wasn't so sure, but I was able to see Iron Man today and all my doubts were put behind me as I watched. This is one of best comic book adaptations put to film in a very long time, since the original Spider Man I think. The effects were not actually too over the top, only when needed, but it gave that extra feel of a comic book. Robert Downy, Jr., I couldn't believe how well of a performance he pulled off, there still is a little question of his casting, but he pulled off Tony Stark seamlessly. This is a very entertaining action film and is such a great blockbuster that is sure to please any film buff.Tony Stark, rich, handsome, incredibly wealthy, has it all. He also creates war weapons, when he goes to Afghanastan to introduce a new missile, he is captured and told to create the missile for the terrorists. But Tony has other plans, he creates a metal suit and escapes, he goes back home and announces that he wants to retire and close down Stark industries due to the violence he saw. But when he learns that the weapons of his are in the wrong hands, he realizes that maybe he could re-create a metal suit and become Iron Man, the incredible machine to save man kind.Iron Man is a sure fire hit that I'm sure you won't want to miss. It has everything you could want for a comic book film: action, humor, a great cast, romance, and ultimate effects that just get you excited. Even the soundtrack gets you pumped up and ready to root for Iron Man. The only complaint, as much as the action was cool, I wish it wasn't the war on terrorism they used, I know it's part of the story, but it hits so close, that it may seem inappropriate. The climax, a little cliff hanger, but I'm already smelling a sequel for next year probably. But Iron Man is a fun movie that all ages could enjoy, Iron Man is the new Spider Man for 2008! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Move Over Superheroes, Iron Man Is Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until May 2008, the few releases this year that I've seen ranged from below average to downright rubbish with the exception of two movies. One being 'Iron Man'. This is the movie we have been waiting for this year. So does it match up to expectations? Hell yes! On the surface, 'Iron Man' isn't very different from other superhero films but on the other hand it isn't like any other superhero movie. This one has rich characters, it perfectly blends humour, drama, action and it has heart, all of which are presented on screen in a wonderful way that keeps the viewer staring at the screen right till the end. The writing is great as 'Iron Man' sticks to the main story all the way. I liked how Downey Jr's Tony Stark grows from this carefree business-minded tech-tycoon who's only concern is Stark Industries to a man with a mission to save the world and in the process he still stays the same person as he maintains his sense of humour, his courage and his integrity. The dialogues, especially Starks's one-liners are sharp, witty and funny. This movie is an introduction to the famous title character thus those expecting only action from start to end (like 'Transformers') may be disappointed to an extent. But for me there was enough action along with substance to make it a hugely enjoyable experience.Jon Favreau is proving to be a more versatile director and his impressive filmography, both as actor and director, prove that he's experimented with different kinds of cinema. 'Iron Man' wouldn't have been an easy film to direct but Favreau does a magnificent job. The CGI is excellent as I loved how much attention was given to detail and how the viewer is shown every step of the making of Iron Man. Of course, there's some humour added to lighten up the mood instead of technologically overloading the viewers.'Iron Man' is just the movie that Robert Downey Jr. needed and it couldn't have come at a better time. At a time, when this talented actor's performances were hardly getting enough notice, 'Iron Man' brings him back to recognition. After seeing him, one would conclude that the part was made only for Downey Jr. His dialogue delivery seems so natural that it would be hard to tell whether he was acting, if the scenes were taken out of context. I don't think Gwyneth Paltrow has ever looked better. Though the role does not allow her to really stretch her acting, Potts isn't just a typical superhero's dame. She is Tony's confidant and the one who supports him through thick and thin. Paltrow provides the necessary charisma, sex appeal and soul that makes Pepper Potts shine and she shares a sizzling chemistry with her male lead. Terrence Howard has a smaller role as Tony's good friend but there's a hint that he might have a more prominent role if a sequel is made. Finally, there's Jeff Bridges as the villain. An odd yet brilliant choice as the actor is refreshing and like his costar, he too needed an 'Iron Man' to give his career a boost.I noticed that some people were complaining that Muslims/Middle Easterners were portrayed as bad guys just like in any other American movie but I would like to state that this is no 'Vantage Point'. Here, these people weren't portrayed as terrorists working on their own but as men hired for a specific reason (I won't say more to give away spoilers). So I just thought to briefly clarify that this is no anti-Islamic or anti-anything (except, well okay, anti-weaponry) movie. It's a movie for everyone.Perhaps the story itself isn't anything novel which is what makes it somewhat similar to other superhero movies, but the treatment of it and its execution is quite unique. Add to that a fine cast and dazzling special effects among many things, this is the summer movie experience I've been waiting for in 2008. I wonder what else this summer has to offer as I doubt that it would succeed in providing anything close to the sheer entertainment of 'Iron Man'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man is everything a summer movie should be, and more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This first big popcorn movie of the year is also the best summer movie since Spider-Man 2.What I liked is that there's a serious subtext to the story and it leaps out of the very first moments of the film. The playboy, hard-drinking, fast-talking arms merchant goes to Afghanistan to show the military Stark Industries' cool new toy. Events unfold and he sees, first hand, what his ordnance and his creations do to real people.The movie gets just about everything right but maybe its number one strength is the casting. Downey brings not only his real life baggage and winning personality to play as Stark; he finds his pathos, too. Jeff Bridges certainly has the acting chops to hang with Downey and is the perfect foil and perfect villain because this is no mustache twirling, one dimensional character. Terrence Howard is perfect as the military man and old college buddy. Gwyneth Paltrow's character adds to the casting perfection. She's every bit the wise yet sexy assistant whose a match for her womanizing boss. The interaction and the relationships all work well and is even one one the highlights of the entire movie itself. Most Superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. Troubled, brooding characters, black leather and anger rule the day. Here, Iron Man's creators mix everything so well. It leans away from dark but touches on it just enough. Maybe it's the character or maybe it's because they had Downey's talents to play with but Downey's performance leads to more clever banter and genuinely real dialogue than most comic-book movies have ever delivered. So much of the humor works because of this and all the dramatic beats really click. Downey's Stark is glib and even obnoxious at times but he never loses his likability and grows in to something more. That's true character establishment and development in a comic book film, people. Even the flirtation between Stark and his assistant has the undertow of lonely romantic longing and implications. What's also rare for any popcorn movie is that every death carries real emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix great acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable summer movie. Oh yeah, did I mention that Iron Man kicks butt and is loads of fun too? That you could tell from the flood of action clips seen leading up to the movie. The CG is perfect and the action is intense and very well done. That's no shocker. What was a pleasant surprise was that Iron Man is a complete movie.(PS- It also includes the funniest Stan Lee cameo he's ever done)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike pretty much all the superhero movies out there other than the Hellboy movies, I found "Iron Man" improved on second viewing. I'd go as far as saying that it's the best superhero film to date, although I'd have to see "Hellboy II" again before being sure about it. This film is near perfect as a summer entertainment. Light and largely insubstantial, but still not dumb in the slightest, and actually featuring some interesting writing for Tony Stark. The standard-issue moral dilemmas are handled well, without the stifling seriousness and heavy-handedness which sometimes let down the Nolan Batman films. We care about the dilemmas not necessarily due to their nature but because Tony Stark is such a convincing character.I'm going to be drawing comparisons to "The Dark Knight" throughout this 'review'. I do so not because I dislike "The Dark Knight" (in fact until a few hours ago I thought I liked it a tad more than "Iron Man"), but because I'm attempting to make a case for "Iron Man" as the best summer blockbuster released in 2008, and the best superhero film to date. "The Dark Knight" is often praised for being more adult and darker than any other superhero film to date. First off, 'more adult' and 'darker' aren't necessarily the same thing. "The Dark Knight" is, on paper, really not all that more ludicrous than "Iron Man", nor is it a better story, nor are the characters more interesting. Bruce Wayne barely exists in "The Dark Knight", Rachel Dawes isn't up to much, Harvey Dent's transformation isn't all that convincing.Beyond just that, the film is stiflingly dark and humorless, almost to a fault because, well, it is about a guy walking around in a batsuit and fighting a maniac in clown makeup and a guy with half a face. The dialogue is often of an obviously expository nature. Where "The Dark Knight" is better than "Iron Man" is in the visual style. It also boasts a better villain. On the other hand, "Iron Man" is a straightforward superhero movie. It's odd, after so many superhero films, to finally see one which really feels like reading a superhero comic. I am not a fan of Iron Man or Marvel in general, but have read some good Iron Man comics in the past, and this film so wonderfully captures the nature of a superhero comic. Sure, Jeff Bridges' villain isn't great, but he fits very nicely into the story of the movie. The story's really very good too. The real heart of the film though is with Iron Man himself. While I give a lot of credit to Robert Downey Jr., who gives a performance which, like Heath Ledger's in "The Dark Knight", is well beyond the standard for popcorn fare. The complaints about the film having no character development are also pretty unwarranted. Granted, Pepper Potts isn't up to much, but what really matters is Tony Stark himself and I found him not only convincingly portrayed but quite excellently-written as well. The film is concerned with the origins of Iron Man, not with the origins of Tony Stark. We hear about his father, we see what he was like before being in captivity, but the film doesn't bother with the usual clichéd approach which basically usually means the character is defined by two, maybe three if you're lucky, big, clichéd events in his life. All we need to know for this specific film (there's more to come from Iron Man, let's not forget) is who Tony Stark is NOW, and what went through his head after being in captivity and building the suit. With that in mind I felt "Iron Man" provided a well-rounded lead character, much more interesting than Bruce Wayne in "The Dark Knight" and more substantial than Hellboy or Peter Parker or pretty much most of the rest with specific regard to the movie incarnations of the characters.The screenplay's wise approach to the origin story means it can focus on the story. It's all pretty standard-issue stuff but done well, and while not insightful or deep or anything it certainly isn't a totally lunkheaded approach to the subject matter: the impact of weapons technology and advancements in the field on the world. Also what really matters is that it's a tight, lean screenplay, and while the climactic battle is a little underwhelming (and unfortunately starts feeling a bit like "Transformers"), it is at least very well-shot, with a sort of clarity which helps all the action scenes here shine. The film is a well-made, tightly-constructed movie which is as long as it should be, and one which strikes a solid balance between character and story. Robert Downey Jr. is a big part of the film's success, no doubt, but credit should go to director Jon Favreau and the writers as well, because they really managed to deliver a movie that's a hell of a lot of fun, and one with easily the best central character in any superhero movie to date, and I say this as someone who definitely doesn't count Iron Man as their favorite superhero as far as comics go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Marvel superhero film done with class</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to ranking the Marvel superhero(live action) films, Iron Man is for me up there with the better ones. It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron man fires on all thrusters; and does NOT disappoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is that rarest of summer movie experiences; an effects-heavy actioner that actually delivers solid characters that give it real heart (and not a bunch of blank-slate 20 year-olds staring at green-screen effects). As director Jon Favreau might've said a dozen years ago in his movie 'Swingers', "this movie is SO money!" Robert Downey Jr. plays millionaire/playboy weapons manufacturer Tony Stark, who learns after a life-changing experience in the deserts of Afghanistan that his legacy is NOT what he's been led to believe. His convoy is attacked, and Stark is critically injured with shrapnel (from one of his OWN missiles) to the heart. He awakens a prisoner, to find a fellow captive named Yinsin (played by Shaun Toub, doing a Ben Kingsley-in-Schindler's List kind of role); who's patched Stark up with an awkward magnet in his chest to keep the nearly fatal (but non-removable) shrapnel from killing him. Stark learns he and Yinsin are being held by Afghani warlords (some of Stark's invisible 'customers') who want them to build for them a Stark specialty; a copy of his new super-weapon. Stark seizes the opportunity to engineer an escape plan by building a giant, bulletproof suit of armor with weapons and crude flight ability (hey, it's based on a comic book; ride with it!). Stark eventually escapes (with the sacrifice of Yinsin, sadly) and is rescued by his fellow Americans. At that point, his mind is made up; he's giving up the arms trade, much to the dismay of partner/former mentor, Obadiah Stane; an evil, bald Jeff Bridges in a great turn of smarmy villainy. At this point in the movie, surprise is not critical to the proceedings; you KNOW Stane is double-crossing Stark. You watch to see how BADLY, and so you just go along with it! So with his eyes now opened, Stark decides to set things right with a refined version of the prototype Iron Man suit that enabled his escape. Stark's only true allies in his Howard Hughes-style quest are his faithful, sweet assistant Pepper Potts (a wonderfully smart and charming turn by Gwyneth Paltrow), his fully-automated household computer system and his military attaché buddy, Jim Rhodes (Terence Howard). And off he goes; with the film striking a tone somewhere between 'Robocop' and "The Rocketeer" (not as severe as the former; not as lightweight as the latter). It all leads to a no-holds barred showdown between Stark's Iron Man and Stane's "Iron Monger" (another Iron suit; only MUCH bigger...like 'Iron Giant' on steroids!). That's the gist of the story. But what truly MAKES this film is not the mechanics of the story or even the Oscar-caliber (not to mention giddily fun) visual effects; it's the almost literal human heart you see up on the screen (and not just Stark's electromagnetically powered one!). Downey has so much FUN in the role (both as the playboy and the eccentric, not entirely-infallible inventor) that we the audience have just as much fun WATCHING him! Glad to see Downey back in a wonderful star vehicle that breezily exhibits his dramatic and comedic range (Downey's always been a major talent). And Paltrow is the perfect blend of 'Superman's' Lois Lane and a bit of 'Batman's' Alfred, but with a charm and warmth ALL her own (and I thought she was going to be wasted in the role! OK, I was wrong!). It's with its humanity that Iron Man really fires on all thrusters. And director Favreau (also cameoing slyly as Stark's loyal chauffeur) sets a stopwatch, no-fat-on-its-bones pace. The story takes its time to unfold, but NEVER lags; an editing miracle. I've seen it twice over three days and would LOVE to see it again; and I haven't felt compelled to do THAT in a very long time! And if you haven't seen it, make sure you stay until AFTER the credits for a cameo that sets up a potential off-shoot franchise. But for me, I'd rather let Iron Man fly solo at least once more, before you saddle him down with a "Super-Team" (please heed the lessons of Joel Schumacher's awful Batman movies!). Iron Man is a solid summer entertainment (overflowing with star power). And for the first time in a long while, a big summer movie exceeded my expectations in a huge way! IRON MAN gets it just right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stan Lee must have a big grin on his face, seeing his Iron Man on the big screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A really, really good comic book action movie. The snappy dialog, good acting, and good directing make all the difference.I've always enjoyed Robert Downey Jr., even in his TV roles, and here he carries the movie as Tony Stark, boy genius and inventor who after his father's death gains control of the biggest corporation making missiles and other machines of war. Tony continues what his father had built, and takes it a few steps further with his own inventions.Another actor I always like is Terrence Howard, and here he is long time friend of Tony's, and a military officer, Rhodey.Tony's right hand man in his company is Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane. He had run the company while Tony was still growing up and seems to want to continue his expanded role.Good as Tony's trusty personal assistant is Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts. She is not only a loyal employee but also a sort of "pal" to Tony, yet it seems that she wishes there were more between them.The story centers on an incident where Tony had travels to a war zone to demonstrate to the US military their newest weapon. But there is a motorcade attack and Tony gets imprisoned, with the demand that he develop the new weapon for them. Instead he invents something new, a rather crude iron man suit that he eventually uses to break free. But the experience changes him, as he sees that even the enemy have weapons that his company makes. His big decision when back home is to quit making weapons and instead concentrate on helping humanity.SPOILERS: When back home Tony works hard to perfect a sleek new Iron Man suit, one that can fly anywhere and even at supersonic speeds, and that has exotic weapon and navigational capabilities. In the process he has Pepper track down through company records how enemies were getting weapons. It turns out to be Obadiah, who is trying to get Tony killed so that he can run the corporation and enrich himself further with illegal weapons sales. The climax comes when Obadiah gets into a larger, more powerful iron man suit, and he and Tony battle. With Pepper's help he overcomes Obadiah, and in a conference reveals that he, Tony, is indeed the Iron Man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes we want pure entertainment, that's what Iron Man is but... with some brains! Robert Downey Jr. uses is charisma to portray the (at the beginning of the movie...) irresponsible billionaire Tony Stark, a genius inventor and a playboy, and only then... comes the Hero. This is the first big blockbuster for "bad boy" Downey Jr. and he makes a terrific job! Jeff Bridges is the bad guy, and is great as always! Terence Howard is good as Tony Stark military "buddy"; and Gwenneth Paltrow, the love interest, is good but... not great.Director Jon Favreu made an intelligent summer blockbuster. Very well directed, with good action scenes and a message to weapon manufacturers: guns will always end in the wrong hands.Ps:At the end I thing I prefer Iron Man to any of the Spiderman movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best superhero movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The inspired casting which allowed Robert Downey Jr. to play the title character was a masterstroke of genius. Downey Jr. always dispenses the right amount of wisecracks and barbs in his roles, and when added to a fun action romp, becomes totally enjoyable for the family. It also helps that finally, a superhero movie gets some brilliant actors to elevate the story, and solid support is displayed by Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard.The story is full of typical superhero movie clichés, but there's a freshness and a spark to the story that makes it all seem so original. It still, IMHO, cant surpass The Dark Knight or X-Men 2 but it comes pretty close. And wayyyyy better than the lame Spider-man movies, and the obnoxious Fantastic 4 movies.Tony Stark (Iron Man's alter ego) is at first a military weapons developer, and the filmmakers make it all relevant to modern-day dilemmas, when Stark finds out that his weapons are being used by the very terrorists the U.S Military are supposed to be fighting. This revelation and his capture by terrorists at the beginning, helps to change his outlook on life and thus begins his plan to not just fight crime, but to tackle greed and terrorism (since they seem to go hand-in-hand).The action scenes are crisply shot, and the movie features some of the best special effects of the year. The CGI effects seem so real that it's so easy to accept what you're seeing on the screen. And if you're wondering if there'll be a sequel on the way, the very last line of the movie practically gives you your answer. A fantastic action spectacle, with good actors, great story and brilliant visuals. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good comic book film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is truly one of the best comic book films out there. Robert Downy Jr. was a questionable choice to many to cast as Tony Stark. Rob has proved them wrong as RDJ's performance is the best part of this film. Tony Stark a cocky, full of himself, multimillionaire has made billions on selling weapons. But when a trip to the middle east goes wrong, Tony finds out just how " good" his weapons are doing to the world. Tony builds a suit of armor to escape capture and when he gets home vows to change himself and the company. What ensues is a vicious power struggle against Obidiah Stane ( Jeff bridges) and the creation of Iron Man. The special effects are very well done and believable. One complaint is that there isn't very much action, but there are several well done scenes. The supporting cast is very good especially Gwenyth Paltrow. The dialog is smart and funny. The reference to SHIELD and Samuel Jackson after the credits are very exciting. Although my favorite comic book movie still goes to Batman Begins, iron Man is a very good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man - Almost Super</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A genesis story, Iron Man answers the question, "Where did Iron Man come from?" Laughter dots the super hero backdrop that is visually fun to watch but lacks the lift off to be a classic super hero movie.Like the wise one says, "necessity is the mother of invention" and Tony Stark's mother birthed the crude chrysalis of Iron Man in a cave in Afghanistan. While demonstrating the Jericho Missile, spoiled, womanizing, arrogant weapons manufacturer and brilliant engineer Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr. ) is kidnapped by the Ten Rings terrorist group led by Raza (Faran Tahir). He is seriously injured during the attack. They hold him captive with a kidnapped doctor, Yinsen (Shaun Toub), who saves him from further death by attaching a device to his chest. Yisen and Tony work together to escape alive. Instead of recreating the missile for the terrorists, Tony develops the beginnings of Iron Man, emotionally and mechanically.Iron Man is studded with easily recognizable names camping it up for the story. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Tony Stark's assistant Pepper Potts. She runs around in four inch heels, maternally tending to Tony's needs. Her dialogue is fun but a little grating at times because she is a deep as a teaspoon. Terrence Howard plays Jim Rhodes, Tony's friend in the Air Force. He puffs his chest in ways that would make a Marine commercial blush.Iron Man isn't a huge modernized Rock-em Sock-em Robots revision, nor is it a strict superhero movie. It deals with the very beginning of the Iron Man legacy, so it is more Tony's personal development story. He begins as a self absorbed, uncaring, skirt chasing billionaire dilettante with no regard for the consequences of how his money is made. By the end he is a self absorbed, skirt chasing billionaire dilettante who cares about the people around him, where his money comes from and what people do with his weapons.There is no shortage of scenes meant to make you laugh that add nearly nothing to the plot of Iron Man, including one with stripper flight attendants. The scenes meant to evoke laughter sometimes force the audience into an uncomfortable giggle, like a chuckle one might give their unfunny uncle. It isn't all middle aged relatives; some of the laughter was well earned. His machines are fun, his mistakes are entertaining and his arrogance earned more than a few smiles.The scenes where Robert Downey Jr. is Iron Man are exhilarating. I found myself clapping for flame throwers; how often do you get to do that in real life? I was fond especially of the learning scenes where Tony was trying to perfect Iron Man's suit.The computer generation of the suit is flawless. I did not have to set aside belief because the light was wrong or the shine was too perfect. The only problem I had with the Iron Man suit was the inside of the mask, which seems like it is the size of a space suit when the camera looks in it at Tony. If one was to judge the size of the entire suit as it relates to the space in the mask, one would think it was designed for a couples naked high-altitude romp.I found Iron Man enjoyable but, unfortunately, my socks remained firmly on my feet. I couldn't really escape into it but I didn't mind watching it either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite possibly the best comic movie ever, hovering around the level of the first Spider-Man (before Raimi lost his mind). Robert Downey Jr was as perfect a casting job as we've been expecting, Bridges plays Obidiah Stane that you won't even think of him as The Dude, the CG doesn't suck,and it doesn't try to cram too much...(read more) in (the runtime of just over two hours feels just right). Any worries I had about this film went right out the window, and they'll stay out the window when I go again... and again... and again. Just remember to stick through the credits, because if you know anything about Marvel (and even if you don't) you'll find the wait worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the top, my all time favourite superhero movie is the 1989 Batman, and my second favourite was the 1994 Alec Baldwin superhero movie "The Shadow" (the other ones seem to lack a certain formula that doesn't appeal to me very well).Not trying to be picky, but for a superhero film to work, isn't quite necessarily based on the excitement, the colours, the special gift our hero possesses or the colourful villains. It's fundamental priority is centered around the person behind the costume, the humanly characteristics our hero portrays. That in itself lures me into watching superhero action films. The superhero persona is only the frosting on the cake as to what drives the person behind the goals the character wishes to accomplish and the tactics he/she possesses and the dangers they encounter along the way of their quests."Iron Man" is an inspiration of how superhero movies should be made. The man behind the robot, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) suit represent raw emotion, real characterizations and a drive behind his motives. In addition to that, he is fun-loving, intelligent with just the right amount of quirkiness that is over-blown serious or overly silly. A great trait about the movie is that it isn't forced or rushed into the action scenes right away. "Iron Man" starts with the story behind Tony Stark and gradually it builds up the action. That way, it makes room for more further development as the story progresses. We can easily observe the dilemmas that Tony Stark is faced with and what he plans t do to overcome the obstacles that are upstaging him. Unlike other superhero films with cheesy dialog, in "Iron Man" the acting is surprisingly excellent. Downey is born to play this complex character, and succeeds rather well with his usual wit and low-key acting. It is by far the best I've seen since Michael Keaton in "Batman" and that was almost 20 years ago. His Tony Stark and the hardships he faces is convincing enough to sympathize with.Gwyneth Paltrow turns in another compelling performance as Tony Stark's loyal aide Pepper Potts. She provides a certain kind of charm and kindness that isn't just the female lead. Her facial expressions of concern and bewilderment speak more volumes than her voice (though her dialog was excellent too). Terrence Howard shines as Col. Rhodes, but I would've liked him to have more air time and better interactions between him and Stark, that might be my only criticism there. Plus Jeff Bridges is wonderful as the villain Obadiah Stane. The special effects are amazingly stunning in a way that it doesn't usurp the dialog like in many superhero moves. It succeeds in it being even balanced and avoids the cheese factor immensely. Last year I went to the theaters expecting to see another cheap-thrilling superhero action blockbuster, boy it was one of those rare moments where I was glad I was wrong. It was everything I ever hoped for in a superhero movie. Especially the development of the man behind the suit rather than the Iron Man himself. Stay tuned next year folks, the long-awaited sequel is coming soon. Get your tickets while they last. Get that camera rolling Jon Favreau.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is one of the better superhero movies. It's based off the popular Marvel comics. On one of the reviews, I was shocked to see that the person liked the new Hulk better. I agree that Hulk is a great movie, but Iron Man is 100 times better. Tony Stark, a popular weapons company owner gets kidnapped by a cult called "Ten Rings" in the Middle East. They want Stark to build a weapon for them. Instead he builds his Iron Man suit. He eventually escapes and later becomes Iron Man. Will he have revenge on the cult and it's surprising leader? You'll have to watch to find out. The acting is better than expected in this film. Robert Downey Jr. did such a unexpected great job. Gwyneth Paltrow did well as her role of Pepper Potts. I also liked Terrence Howard as Rhodey. The special effects were great as they are with superhero movies. The plot has its share of intriguing twists. I believe that this Iron Man is original, but that is my opinion. I rate this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

It was witty, crisp, and not lacking in the least. When I watch a movie, lame dialog is one of the worst things a movie can inflict upon me.

		<fullReview>Marvel comics has unleashed superhero movies from The Spider-Man Trilogy, The X-Men Trilogy, The Hulk films, The Fantastic Four films, The Punisher, Blade, and Ghost Rider, where now the metallic superhero Iron Man makes his screen debut.To be honest, I didn't know too much about Anthony Stark and his alter ego Iron Man since I was into Spider-Man, the X-Men and Hulk. But once I slipped on the DVD, I got more than I bargain for.Robert Downey Jr. portrays smart technician billionaire and media lover Tony Stark who's gone off to Iraq in showing the army the latest weapons he created until being captured by the enemy. While being a prisoner, he must make the weapons or else he'll be killed off; his heart has been transplanted by a ball device where if it's taken off his chest, he'll die instantly. As a prisoner, Tony gets help from another prisoner by creating a metallic suit to shield himself as he escapes from the underground caves and later thinks about how with his inventions he can get rid of evil after learning that his weapons were not only used by the U.S. army but by the Iraq soldiers as well.It's fun to watch Downey Jr.'s character as Stark trying to reinvent the machine and at the same time learning from his mistakes that nobody's perfect. His performance is a balanced of comedy and serious technique like watching Bill Murray in Ghostbusters. Tony Stark/Iron Man is a good comeback for Robert Downey Jr. who's really had a bit of ups and downs in the past years of his career, but he finally found the right character at last.Jon Favreau (Swingers) directs the film balancing a sense of reality along with mixing humor, action, a bit of romance, adventure, screw-ups, and thrills along the way. Other than Downey Jr. in the film, Gwyneth Paltrow portrays Stark's assistant Pepper Potts who isn't a damsel in distress compared to most leading ladies but a tough cookie who knows everything about her employer and speaks the truth. Terrance Howard plays Stark's friend Col. James Rhodes who'll back him up in anyway while making sure that the billionaire doesn't do anything to screw up. And there's Jeff Bridges who plays Obidiah Stane, Stark's business partner with a few secrets of his own.To conclude, Iron Man rocks in every way! Just be sure to stick around after the credits to see Samuel L. Jackson's cameo performance as Nick Fury.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpected blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gotta admit, like most other people I was not a big fan of Iron Man comics or Robert Downey Jr, but after seeing this movie I have new respect for the actor and the character. With his drug/alcohol problems of the past it seemed like Downey would be the perfect guy to portray someone who went through a similar experience and cleaned up his act. Now with Spider-Man being Marvel's mascot, I was very surprised that they made me want to see more of a character that wasn't exactly a house hold name. Big congrats to Favreau &amp; co. for pulling this off. So which makes me wonder how incredible major properties such as Fantastic Four, Hulk &amp; Captain America could have been with the right people on the projects. This movie was so good it's hard to even watch earlier superhero films because they will not be at the level this one is. The actors, especially Downey did a fantastic job and were believable in their roles. As Stark, he perfectly captured the self serving smart ass as well as the guy who redeems himself by using his weapons for good. The story &amp; CGI were amazing especially the origin sequence &amp; the unveiling of the final version of the Iron Man suit. Only gripe is that maybe there could have been more action or a more major villain from the comics, but hey they're just getting started. I am definitely looking forward to the sequel and hope the same quality continues for this new franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Iron Man* is a steel-belted planet-crusher of a film; alloy feet on the ground, red-and-gold armor streaking for sub-orbital skies. Based in a reality close to current, like the shrapnel lodged in Tony Stark's chest, we feel it close to our heart? technology, physics, corporate backbiting, intimate asides? and a self-made hero that speaks in tongues to our wild fantasies of power.Not just for 14-year-old boys.Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, all-American, arrogant, insouciant, egomaniacal billionaire playboy weaponry wizard, who sustains a shrapnel wound in Afghanistan (comic book lore tells us a land mine in Nam; movie places Stark in a *current* non-essential conflict), imprisoned by generic Arabs and forced to make a WMD for them, instead designing an armor suit, first for escape from his oily-complected captors, and then as avenger (wink wink) *against* his own weapon creations and the corporate back door deals that cede those American weapons into oily-complected hands.Departing considerably from comic book canon, all the familiar characters are here, but tweaked: Jim Rhodes (excellent Terence Howard) is not just Stark's pilot, but a high-ranking air force officer; Pepper Potts (moderately cute Gwyneth Paltrow) is Stark's yearning Girl Friday, who sees the parade of fluff through Tony's bedroom as a prelude to her ultimate spanking; Obadiah Stane (an uncharacteristically sinister Jeff Bridges) is not a corporate competitor but in Stark's trusted inner circle, making his betrayal all the more treacherous? Directed by Jon Favreau (Vince Vaughn's wife) and screen played surprisingly well by its four writers, *Iron Man* takes its time focusing on the man inside the metal, rather than the mayhem the metal man musters. (Can I have a prize for that one?) In captivity, a fellow prisoner, Yinsen (Shaun Toub) creates an electromagnet to keep the shrapnel from entering Stark's heart, which Stark refines into a glowing "reactor" or something, forever to remain his albatross - and simultaneously a cool superhero chest-piece.Yinsen turns Stark from unrepentant war dog to humanitarian avenger by telling him of his "life's work in the hands of these murderers." Let's get the "murderer" definition straight: when Stark shows off his death-dealing toys in callous arrogance ("Respected or feared? I say, Why not both?"), he merely echoes the stance of the Amerikan Military War Machine, who also believe the "best weapon is the one you only need to fire once." Who are the murderers again? Secondly, a business genius like Stark should know how the supposed "enemy" market is the house of sand the Amerikan military economy is built upon. When it comes to killing for profit, Amerikan ethics are quite, quite plastic. The first taste of the crude, silver armor is magnificent. Though the '63 comic book version now looks like a clown suit next to his red-and-gold juggernauts, the movie gussies up the suit with mechanical ganglions to lend it cave-cred. And in this roughshod mechanical man, Stark escapes the Arabs like a runaway tank.Back in "civilization" Stark turns his focus from corporate warfare to one project ? his new armor. Meanwhile, Jeff Bridges scares us with his shaved head.Seeing Stark create and test the powers of his technological marvel is half the fun of this origin tale - and when the full armor suit is eventually revealed, it is the sexiest beast this side of Optimus Prime! CGI is used as sensibly as Ridley Scott used it in *Gladiator* ? to enhance the story rather than to blow our minds with cheap shots. Seeing Iron Man out-fly combat jets and take on tanks is action enough ?AND - the worst part about Doctor Doom in *Fantastic Four* was his voice remaining the fruity scientist's drawl even when he donned the mask ? but when Stark slams on his iron man ? yeeees! - he has a Vader thoom! We have CGI to thank that Favreau didn't put Downey in a rubber suit and dub in clanking foley. And with the armor's complexity, it is only logical a machine should suit him up - and only CGI could render that machine, rather than having to see him pull on his gleaming jeans one pants-leg at a time.The CGI only falls overboard once, when Stane dons giant armor to battle Iron Man in the final scenes, the movie suddenly turning into *Transformers 2: Electric Boogaloo* for a bad second. In the final cut, no one will notice the ethics paradox ? it's not for this movie's target demo to tangle with. *Iron Man* is still one of the great superhero movies.IRON MAN opens with AC/DC's *Back in Black.* And we're played out by Sabbath's *Iron Man*! Not just for 14-year-old boys. But it'll sure make you feel like one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I had expected...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From all the hype I heard about this film, I decided to see it. I thought this would be another superhero movie disaster that has too much CGI and no plot, but I was proved wrong. Most superhero films don't have an academy award winning script, but "Iron Man" pulled off with a decent story that has no holes. I was very impressed by it, particularly with a surprising anti-gun/war message delivered nicely by Robert Downey Jr.To my surprise, Downey did a pretty good job as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He's funny, entertaining, and a hero that could easily be liked. Terrence Howard as the amusing Jim Rhodes and Gwyneth Paltrow (beautiful as ever) as Iron Man's assistant are pleasant additions to the film. Jeff Bridges wasn't a bad villain, although I did not find him to be in the caliber of Jack Nicholson as "The Joker" or even Willem Dafoe as the "Green Goblin".The one thing that I did not like about the movie though was the lack of romance. Whether it is Batman or Spider-man, the good guy always had a girl. Gwyneth Paltrow's character can be considered a damsel in distress at the end, but the relationship never grows between her and Iron Man. I'm not trying to sound like I am a lover of chick flicks, but in my opinion, a good superhero should always have a girl, or at least someone to love.Overall this is a great film with a solid plot, decent acting, and wonderful CGI that is not overdone. For you popcorn lovers, this is your ticket. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ironman, huh? Never heard of the premise.... though I assume it was a Marvel comic at some point. So I had no expectations going in other than I like Downey Jr and Jeff Bridges... so it had that going for it already. And it looked fun.Fun it is. The acting from these 2 guys was good. I caught myself hearing hints of The Dude in Jeff Bridges sometimes, but any Big Lebowski fan is going to pick that out..... it is unavoidable! He pulled it off excellently. Jr did very well with his part and was mostly very believable. I was impressed with Paltrow. She usually doesn't do it for me, but she looked unbelievably sexy in this role, especially the charity event scene with the backless dress (you'll see). Oh, and she did a good job with the acting also.The story is pretty good.... and like I said... fun. There are parts that dragged on a little bit, especially at the beginning. I thought the movie would have been better had it been about 20 minutes shorter. There were parts when I was thinking... okay, I know what's going on, let's just move on to the next scene already. However, like I said... more towards the beginning. Once the story gets rolling it keeps you interested. There are some great action scenes, you just have to put aside your logic for the flying stuff... but... it's a comic book so....On the Gargamel scale it gets 1 for story 1 for acting 1 for car chase (but it's more of an air chase, and it's cool) 1.5 for guns/explosions and 0 for the nudity score... there is not full nudity but there is some implication that is pretty sexy.. wow, so that's a 4.5 which equates to a 9 on the IMDb scale. I'm surprised myself..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had I been the producer of this film I would never have cast Downie in the role of Tony Stark, and what a mistake that would have been. Robert Downie Jr gave an amazing depiction of Stark that was totally true to the character as envisioned by his creator and along with Jeff Bridges and Gweneth Paltro to name a few the cast did a brilliant job of bringing the Iron Man story to life. The story line was well thought out and flowed like a mountain stream, the balance between action and humour was as close to perfect as could ever be wished for, the entire film was engaging from start to finish even the music couldn't be faulted and as for the props, I really want an Audi R8 of my own now. This was one film that left the viewer begging for more and the last line (pre credits that is) no-one could fault that one. Brilliant work, lets hope the sequel is as good but the bar has been set pretty high by this first outing. The Commander</fullReview>

I really like the concept of superhero ironman: its like a do it yourself robocop-vigilante style,but all in the coolest way possible. What can I say, hands down on everything about this movie: the cast does an awesome job, the director very competent, the story is very compelling, special effects of superb quality. I believe Downey Jr's carrier was brought back from ashes with this flick, and am glad to see he still has what it takes.Maybe even more than the ironman tune, this movie ROX! 9/10 only because I envy its coolness...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comic book movies of all time!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Iron Man on Saturday afternoon. I truly believe that this is one of the best superhero movies ever! It certainly is an improvement over some of the other comic book movies to come out of Marvel's lineup, like the disappointing Spider-Man 3.Robert Downey Jr. makes one of the greatest performances ever as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He is hysterical and is the best part of the whole movie. It's almost non-stop laughter with him, except of course when he is in danger and when he gets into fights with the bad guys. The rest of the cast is also very good. Jeff Bridges is amazing as the villain of the movie Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger. The character is wicked, and Daniels does a great job at playing the role. Terrence Howard is good as Jim Rhodes, while Gwyneth Paltrow proves to be a good love interest for Downey Jr. as Stark's assistant Virginia "Pepper" Potts.The special effects are incredible and the action is fun and awesome. Sometimes I couldn't tell when the suit was real or not. The comedy is very good, way better than I expected it to be. I do agree with critics who are saying that the one thing to complain about is the length of the movie: WHY DIDN'T THEY MAKE IT LONGER!? Hopefully Jon Favreau will release an extended edition when the theatrical cut comes out on DVD or shortly after that.Great job Jon Favreau! You proved yourself to be a great director when it comes to comic book movies. Do another one! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that the filmmakers did an excellent job.Robert Downey Jr. brings the perfect performance for Tony Stark making him believably both conceited and compassionate (though usually not at the same time). He makes the hero a very human character.Both the ending and the beginning come across slightly shaky in their storytelling aspects, but the middle of the movie more than makes up for it. The action is well shot and there is a good pacing. It's interesting to see the evolution of the Iron Man suit from the very utilitarian origins to the more finessed version that emerges in the end.The special effects are very well done, merging practical effect work and physical suit shooting with CG very seamlessly. You never find yourself being distracted by an obviously inserted special effect plate or having to force yourself to overlook certain aspects of the visual that don't quite blend well enough.And it was definitely refreshingly different to see Jeff Bridges play the heavy. He does it very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Listen if you're looking for an enjoyable, fun to watch movie this is well worth it. It isn't earth shattering, it isn't groundbreaking, but it is well made, well acted and loyal to the source material. Iron Man avoids the dark brooding that has developed in superhero movies of like (batman begins and spider-man 3) and focuses on what made the comics great in the first place, high paced action with witty banter. RDJ is Tony Stark, period. He perfectly captures the essence of the character as well as the character's short comings. Yes the actions scenes are more brief than I would have preferred but the pacing of the movie never seems to drag. Many will claim that the plot is thin...i say to them, shut up, its a comic book movie not a sprawling life changing epic. Take it for what it is and stop bashing. There is realistically nothing wrong with seeing this movie and enjoying it. It is also far better than the last few superhero movies that came out. Go see it, you'll like it trust me. If you don't email me and we'll argue about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the way action movies should be done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Stark is a proud product of the military/industrial complex, a technological boy wonder who has risen to become CEO of the world's premier weapons-manufacturing firm, Stark Industries (started by his dad, who met an untimely end at an early age). A world-renowned bon vivant and jet-setting playboy, Stark comes replete with a jumbo-sized ego and a cynical quip for every occasion. He is also utterly indifferent to the fate of all those innocent civilians around the world who have fallen victim to his weapons (he doesn't mind being referred to as a "merchant of death," but he balks at being called "the Da Vinci of our time"). Yet, after he's kidnapped by a band of terrorist rebels in Afghanistan, Stark finally gets the chance to experience life at the other end of his death-dealing product. After a hairsbreadth escape from his captors, Stark returns to the States a radically changed man - not only newly cognizant of the harms he's caused over the years, but transformed into a superhero via an indestructible suit of armor he was able to design and manufacture while in captivity. Stark now plans on using his technological prowess for good rather than evil, protecting the innocent and vanquishing the wrongdoers."Iron Man" soars into the top echelon of superhero movies thanks to a witty screenplay (by no fewer than four writers), fast-paced direction by Jon Favreau and top-notch special effects by a veritable army of CGI wizards. But the real secret of the movie's success lies in the brilliant, multi-layered performance by the great Robert Downey, Jr., that, if there's any justice at all in Hollywood, will garner him a Best Actor nomination come Oscar time. He is the true heart-and-soul of this movie, and no amount of money lavished on the technical aspects of the production could have made "Iron Man" what it is without him. Gwyneth Paltrow has rarely been more appealing and less mannered than she is as Pepper Potts, Stark's loyal Girl Friday who becomes the better half of one of the sweetest romantic couples in recent memory. These two fine actors create a wonderful chemistry together that once again proves that less is definitely more when it comes to generating genuine romantic sparks on screen. James Bridges and Terrance Howard are also excellent in key supporting roles.Unlike in so many multi-million dollar, effects-driven extravaganzas, the action scenes in "Iron Man" - as pulse-pounding and jaw dropping as they are - never come to dominate the movie. It is the characters and their interactions with one another that provide the real fun of the film. And that - as we keep saying over and over again, much to our hoarseness - is as it should be. It's nice to see that somebody finally got things right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now THIS is how you start a movie franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the last couple of years, comic book based super hero movies have had a mission to accomplish and thats kick starting a franchise.The likes of Fantastic four, batman begins, daredevil and hulk to name a few, were made to be the start of a series. Iron man is no different, but where many of these sorts of films fail, Iron Man succeeds because it not only gets the series started but its a damn good film in its own right.Exciting, funny and well acted, iron man is an all round great effort that sticks surprisingly close to its source material. The high octane sequences where iron man soars through the air and kicks bad guys asses are awesome to watch but thankfully this is a film where things are just as interesting to watch when no one is blowing anything up and its all thanks to the Jon Favreau careful direction. The plot, in which billionaire tony starks turns from brash playboy to amour clad hero, is engaging and enthralling and favreaus eye for great acting ensures some great naturalistic performances.There are two stand out performances, the first and most important being Robert Downey Juniour as Tony Stark. Junior makes this role his own, injecting Tony Stark with a sense of cool, arrogance and an Errol Flynn like swagger that makes him really fun to watch and get behind as a leading man. The second (which surprisingly doesn't get as much praise as Downeys stark) is Jeff Bridges as bad guy Obadiah Stane. Although he could have played the role as a scenery chewing , typical villain, Bridges injects the role with a sense of realism and imposing menace, making for a convincing antagonist.Iron Man is what a marvel comic book movie should be- a mix of great story ,exciting action, and a faithful representation of a classic character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the deal: I had never heard of Iron Man prior to seeing the trailer. But gosh dern it I thought it looked cool. So I want and saw it. And yes, it was cool.I thought the acting was topnotch, especially Downey Jr.'s snarky performance and Paltrow's demure presence as a his girl Friday character--very good for a classic comic feel.I liked the story. It was fun, to-the-point, and surprising inspirational.I liked the special effects. They weren't over-the-top (I've seen superhero movies with shiner, fancier things) but they were suitable to the story and, if I can say so, fairy realistic and down-to-earth. Nothing splashy, just what was necessary.I like the idea. Iron Man is an awesome superhero.So no, I really can't compare it to anything, but for all intents and purposes I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was NOT expecting this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen the trailer, and thought it to be 'just another movie' cashing in on today's trend of superhero films. I was never into those kind of movies either. However, pretty soon the name 'Iron Man' was popping up everywhere. In conversation, internet chat-rooms, everything. So, when some people I knew were off to see it, I thought I may tag along. Just to see what the hype was about... I was quite surprised when I walked out of the cinema that day. There are many things that makes this movie highly entertaining - the first, it must be said, was the amazing performance of Robert Downey Jr. as the main character 'Tony Stark'. He played the role of rich American playboy very well. The actual character Tony Stark was someone who I really empathized with I felt sorry for him as the movie progressed, for reasons I won't spoil here. As for the storyline, it's very engaging. For the most part, I found it realistic and believable. Tony Stark didn't have magic or super powers. For me, this was a refreshing change from the typical 'bitten-by-something-radioactive' story. Though I highly enjoyed this film, I found the beginning quite slow. Which brought down it's mark a little. It did take a little while for me to become immersed. Secondly, I felt the character Obadiah Stane (antagonist, played by Jeff Bridges) could have been explored a lot more. However, these minor points pale in comparison to the high points of this very fun film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was awesome! Big ups to Robert Downey, Jr., he did an excellent job and looked so healthy, I was so proud of him (I'm obviously a big fan of his and was quite concerned over the years of his substance abuse) he was fantastic. He was convincing, but I wasn't surprised by that, he's always been a great actor, he was funny, believable and sincere is his transformation from money grubbing war machine builder to humanitarian. Jeff Bridges was great too and it took me a few seconds to recognize him. I recognized his voice before I recognized his face. As an avid movie goer I knew he was the villain right away and was hoping against hope he wasn't. I didn't do any research before it came out and I don't know the Iron Man story that well so I wouldn't have known who he was in advance anyway. The scene on the plane when Terrence Howard's character is so upset with Robert's character is hilarious. The story was very well played out and the relationships were introduced well with plenty of room to grow in the sequels (I'm hoping for at least 2 :-D). Action scenes were great, the humor really really good, loved his line "yes, I can fly" and even quite a few touching scenes. Excellent film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Iron man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie does live up to my expectation. Iron man is one of the best movie in 2008. It is good to see some rising star such as director Jon Favreau, who directed Elf and Zathura and acted as the sidekick of Matt Murdock in Daredevil, now directs a big marvel movie and I am glad that he manages it well. The acting is good, CGI is good too and there are couples of intense scenes. Not much of a disappointment. Even the few action scenes are managed well so as we would not feel bored or felt that its CGI make up for the few action scenes.The story: Tony stark is rich, a Playboy and a genius. He is having his perfect life until when a group of terrorists captures him and force him to make a powerful weapon they want. Shortly, Tony decides to build an amour to protect him while escaping. He escapes, he decides to upgrade the amour and uses it to protect people. Robert Downey Jr is a good choice to play Tony Stark. While all the others are good too. CGI is amazing, it makes Iron man flexible. It is one of the most intense marvel movie I saw and that is what that makes it good, awesome. There is pretty much humour too even when fighting.Overall: As I says, Iron man is one of the most intense marvel comic movie I ever saw, it is worth watching it in cinema. The CGI and the battle scenes are worth it and it makes up for the few action scenes. The story is intense. It should be the 1st at box office and will. This will leave you craving for more, it feels quite short although it is 2 hours and will want Iron man 2. This will be added to my best movies which includes Transformers. Now CGI is really realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Downey flies high!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that there was going to be an Iron Man movie, I was skeptical. Some of the recent origin story comic book movies have been mediocre at best. The Fantastic Four and Hulk are the first two that come to mind. Batman Begins, Spider-Man and Superman were a few of those rare treats where it was done well. Iron Man is one that is difficult to do because of all of the technology involved, not only in the Iron Man suit himself, but because of the fact that the story deals with state of the art technology developed by billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.).Director Jon Favreau hit this one out of the ballpark, making Iron Man an overnight sensation to those who were not familiar with him in the first place. This film is also the first movie to be released under the new Marvel Studios banner. Before, Marvel worked in concert with studios like Warner Bros. and Paramount to produce their properties, but this is the first to be solely made by Marvel, and then distributed by a major film studio, in Iron Man's case, Paramount Pictures.This is one of the first superhero comic book movies that I can think of where a well-known actor who is playing the title role, actually does a good job. Does anyone remember Daredevil, or dare I mention again, Hulk. Besides Downey playing the title character, Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow round out the cast. Paltrow actually gives a decent performance as Stark's secretary Pepper Potts, and isn't too annoying like both Katie Holmes was in Batman Begins, and Kate Bosworth in Superman Returns. Howard plays Stark's best friend Jim Rhodes, a military officer who eventually finds out about Stark's 'new toy' and covers for him when his own fighters accidentally engage him, thinking he's an enemy bogey. Just from some of the events in the film, it appears evident that Howard might be back for the sequel, possibly dawning the second suit to become War Machine.Jeff Bridges plays Obadiah Stane, Stark's mentor and partner in Stark Industries. Not only was he a friend of his father, but he helped Stark build his empire by selling weapons to the U.S. military. Of course Stark doesn't know that someone has been selling his weapons to third world nations as well, to use against the U.S. military. It is partially because of this that Stark starts to build the Iron Man suit and help get his company's weapons back in the hands of the U.S.The battle between the large Mark I and the Mark III (red and yellow suit) is pretty good. It doesn't get dragged out too long and it keeps you entertained. The film has lots of elements of humor, all used in appropriate places. Most of them revolve around Stark's sarcastic attitude to his friends and his inventions (he talks to his machines in his lab).There are plenty of shock and awe fanboy moments as we see the armor for the first time on Mark I, and then the machine that puts the Mark III suit on Stark in his lab. It is probably one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Plus, be on the lookout for several agents from S.H.I.E.L.D. The ending is fantastic, with Stark saying probably the most anticipated line in the whole film, easily setting the stage for the eventual sequel.</fullReview>

There is really nothing to say bad about this film except one thing, and it's minor. I believe there should have been more action sequences, not a whole bunch, just a little more and I would have given this movie a perfect 10. Overall, Iron Man is the best superhero movie to date, great actors, excellent visuals, and best of all, the amazing script to this film. I haven't seen such an outstanding script in years.

		<shortDescription>A superhero who isn't a pussy is a refreshing change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is not like other superhero films we have come to know. Unlike, batman, superman and spider-man, Iron Man does not suffer from mental illnesses. He doesn't stalk his girlfriend, pine over his dead uncle, or wish his parents hadn't got shot when he was a kid. Iron Man, just wants to kill bad guys. Another flattering aspect of Iron Man, is his lack of an alter ego. We don't have to watch in panic as Iron Man quickly gets on his iron suit before someone sees him changing. Instead, he boasts "I AM IRON MAN". Another very enjoyable aspect of the Iron Man film, is the setting. Not in a fictional city where the crime rate needs to be high, but in Afghanistan where it actually is. Bottom Line, Iron Man kills people. Nuff said. When did Spiderman, Batman or Superman last kill someone? Pussies! Iron Man is not a pussy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the overblown Spider-Man 3 last year; and the special effects driven Transformers, I was beginning to think that Hollywood didn't know how to make a decent comic book movie anymore. Then Jon Favreau directed Iron Man. The first thing that he does right is casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. He brings a presence to the character that only he could and has the greatest one-liners that would even put Spider-Man to shame. Jeff Bridges, Terrance Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are also great in their supporting roles. I loved the banter between Pepper and Stark. However, some fans may be disappointed by the lack of CGI and action scenes but I think it works for the better. It's grounded in reality and unlike Transformers, this film has realistic special effects and the CGI seamlessly blends in with all of the practical effects; most notably the Iron Man suit. And after watching Stark tinker around with his first two prototypes (watching the scene in which he tries to fly is priceless), it's a real payoff when after an hour we finally get to see him in action. This makes more sense than other comic book adaptations because we get to see the suit in three different stages. And besides all the action it's the most fun I've ever had watching a movie. There are so many scenes that end with a punch you won't regret watching this with a large audience. Not to mention that it ends on a great note. Also, comic book fans will dig the hints at a sequel and especially the post credit scene. Fans in our theater went crazy. (I won't spoil it for you.) Bottom line, Iron Man Delivers what a good comic book film should. It may not have the brooding darkness of Batman Begins, or the over the top special effects of Transformers, but it's a fun movie that has a terrific blend of humor, a great story, and not to mention some kick-ass action to go along with it. In the end my score is 8.5/10 "B"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Iron Man" the Stark Superhero of Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JJ Rating: A+ Billionaire Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) of Stark Enterprises visits Afghanistan to show off his new weapon. Upon being attacked by rebels he sees his weapons were in their hands. They kidnapped him and wanted him to make them a weapon, but instead he creates a suit that will evolve him into Iron Man.It's another billionaire hero. In this case one that is more deviant than the Bat and far wittier than the Spider. Iron Man is exactly that: he's a man's man. He sleeps around, he drinks and he is cockier than necessary and he doesn't even get paid millions to play a sport. Well he gets billions to create inventive weaponry for America.Iron Man was never my cup of tea. But when I heard that Robert Downey Jr. was going to play him I was sure that if there ever was a thing like cinematic perfection, that that was it. From that point on I was excited to see the film. What would I want more from this film? I can't really think of anything. It's not perfect but what movie is? It's just really good. I wanted to see the Black Widow somehow but that was not going to happen. I'm really pleased with the after credits scene. STAY AFTER THE CREDITS.What did I love about the film? Iron Man's suit. That suit was so freaking cool. I loved the way it looked, how it was put on, what it looked like in flight, how it sounded when it moved about, how it looked when it was damaged. It was just wow. I liked how Iron Man was just intelligent and figured out to do the practical thing without taking too much time to moralize everything. I like the wit of Tony Stark and how Robert Downey Jr. just perfectly fit the role as if he were born to play it.Terrence Howard mad a great Rohdey. As-a-matter-of-fact there were several scenes that just make a comic nerd giddy. Count them off, if you can. Jeff Bridges was intimidating and imposing as he needed to be to play Obadiah. Gwyneth Paltrow was Pepper Potts and had the charm and smile to pull it off. I liked the way she walked to. It might have had something to do with her shoes, but still it seemed so intentional for the character and it worked.The story progressed at an even pace and allowed for the development of the entire story within the allotted time. Jon Favreau (who also played the driver who, in the comics, becomes Pepper's love interest) did an iron clad job of directing. He knew what he wanted and executed it and it came out beautifully.The C.G.I. work was eye candy for the super soul. That Iron Man get up was just marvelous. The battles between Iron Man and anyone else was done well. There was not too much and there was not too little. Just like baby bear's porridge. The C.G.I. even helped with some humor moments that were littered throughout the film either by visual gags or witty lines; humor was not missing from the banter heighten Stark.Iron Man, the superhero, is a fine balance of cocky, womanizing, billionaire war mongrel with a touch of heroics all rolled into one likable man. It is simply a work of art. Normally such a person is the villain and not well liked, but not only is he liked in the comic books he's liked in the movie and that is thanks to Robert Downey Jr's portrayal.I was impressed. This is the first movie that Marvel has financed themselves and let's just say?it works magical wonders for them to have more power.There is no question that I will get Iron Man when it comes out on DVD. There is also no question that this will be the number one movie of the weekend and I even guessed that it would make a little over the amount of money it cost to make it. So I'm going to guess about $165 million dollars. Though because of Grand Theft Auto 4 it might be lower, a lot lower or so the nay sayers would scream. Iron Man is the nity-gritty hero, the one that is all bare on who he is and what he wants; he is Marvel's Stark Superhero and Iron Man is the start of a beautiful movie franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By way of introduction, I have no background at all with the Ironman comics or character. I also have very little experience with the "superhero" movie genre, and most of the little I've seen was not that good. Thus, all of this was totally new to me so I was able to see the movie through "unbiased" eyes and with relatively low expectations.I loved it! A fabulous movie from start to finish. Downey's characterization of Stark was superb, with just the right mix of humor and obnoxiousness to make him endearing, rather than annoying (I especially liked the first twenty minutes or so when he was really over the top). Jeff Bridges was so heavy as to be almost unrecognizable, but played his part well. Everyone else seemed credible in their roles; the Gwyneth Paltrow character was even properly subdued and the chemistry between she and Downey was realistically uncomfortable.I guess that the best praise I can give to this movie is that it did not feel like a "superhero" movie. Everything was driven by at least superficially-plausible earthly technology, rather than the usual range of superpowers.My only regret is that it's probably a bit too intense for my seven-year old; perhaps in a few years. I'll look forward to seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything one could hope for in a superhero blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With comic book films becoming an increasingly common component of the summer blockbuster season, the question emerges: how to make a mark as unique in the midst of so much superpowered competition while still holding true to the elements which made the originals such successes in the first place? It would seem director Jon Favreau has found the answer. From the opening chords of AC/DC's "Back in Black" it becomes instantly apparent that Iron Man is going to be a different kind of comic book movie. Instead of the filmmaker's usual aspirations to have the source material adapted as darker and grittier than its comic book origins could ever have been, Favreau is not afraid to embrace a very much needed sense of fun without descending into the rampant silliness which consumed Tim Story's Fantastic Four. As such, Iron Man essays a superb balance between embracing every last enjoyable detail while maintaining the gravitas and complexity of its original story and characters, a seamless melding of intelligence and action clout. What really sells the film is its intelligent script, with a series of astutely crafted lines a far cry from the usual clunking variety which could have been conceived by the average six year old boy. Favreau's Robert Altman influence also leads to some highly enjoyable improvisations on top of the scripted material (Downey Jr.'s exchanges with his robotic helpers are priceless). Similarly. by updating Stark's backstory from Vietnam to a more topical Afghanistan, the film has added political poignancy, making some intriguing tongue in cheek comments about the American military. While the occasional lapse in realism and occasionally conventional character motivations may prove problematic to some, such are easily excusable considering the medium from which the story is faithfully adapted, and Favreau's solid directing outweighs such inconsequential concerns with a sheer unabashed sense of enjoyment and unfiltered movie magic. Though the bulk of the story is dedicated to the usual origin tale, Favreau by no means skimps on the jaw-dropping action setpieces, generating some genuinely gripping and tense sequences (Stark's capture in Afghanistan is visceral and engrossing) as well as the requisite adrenaline pumping exhilarating ones - Stark's testing of his Mark One armour to escape captivity is full throttle entertainment and the final showdown is easily the show stopping setpiece of the year thus far. The film's flawless special effects are perfectly executed, used to full effect without ever swamping the picture. The Iron Man armour itself both looks and sounds brilliant, a clanking cacophony of assembled parts coming together for a heart pumping streamlined exterior. Similarly, the musical score, while not the most original, provides some suitably heroic themes and proves enthralling in its own right. Enough praise cannot be bestowed upon Robert Downey Jr., who, overcoming every last inch of apprehension over his casting, is by far the key element to Iron Man's standing out from the waves of other superhero films. Delivering one of the strongest performances in his formidable career, Downey Jr. effortlessly inhabits every last contradictory inch of Tony Stark like the pristine suits the character himself dons. Putting his own unorthodox spin on the character through his wisecracking, motormouthed energy, Downey Jr. still stays true to the spirit of Stark and his darker overtones, even making the transition from callous, arrogant billionaire weapons vendor to iron clad humanitarian feasible through his extraordinary charisma and gleaming, passionate intensity. To say that Downey Jr. is perfect for the role is an understatement; a testament to the use of quality actors for bringing immortalised comic book figures to life instead of ham-handed fresh young faces chosen for looks over talent. While the rest of the cast cannot quite match up to Downey Jr.'s dynamo of a performance, all prove equally adept in adapting their comic book incarnations in a plausible fashion. Terrence Howard delivers an appropriately curt dignity to Stark's military ally Jim 'Rhodey' Rhodes, adding the perfect clipped acerbic deadpan to the character. Similarly, Gwyneth Paltrow makes a surprisingly convincing potential love interest as Stark's personal assistant Pepper Potts, her natural charisma and share of icy comebacks easily proving a superb foil to Downey Jr.'s livewire of a performance. Jeff Bridges moulds his usual laid back image into one of a despicably greedy businessman concealing his shockingly selfish dealings under a veneer of oily respectability, his unconventional performance easily overcoming the trappings of his otherwise conventional villain figure. Shaun Toub is charming as Yinsen, the mysterious scientist who saves Stark's life in Afghanistan and helps him construct his first suit of armour, with Toub's irreverent edge preventing the role from becoming a stock "mentor" figure. Simply put, Iron Man is everything a comic book movie could hope to be: a perfect balance between the grittily serious and exuberantly enjoyable, flawless special effects and a roster of incredible performances. Iron Man proves an example of the quintessential blockbuster: one not afraid to think while simultaneously bludgeoning with entertainment - for those in search of entertainment without jeopardising brain cells, Iron Man should prove just the thing. -10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action film which doesn't put special effects ahead of character development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the script and worked on this film, so I'm probably prejudiced. But I'm also not a fan of action adventure films which are low on character development and high on endless special effects. Thankfully, this isn't that kind of film. This is probably the most character driven superhero film since Christopher Reeves' "Superman". Downey was born for this role. You could see that in the original screen test (which they should include as a bonus on the DVD release). Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges are also very strong and although Terrence Howard comes off a little soft, director Jon Favreau cut out his weaker moments. The music is great, both in the needle drops chosen and in the original score. Lots of humor peppered throughout the movie and the film makes some good moral points as well. This should be the model for every superhero movie to emulate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Two Hours Of Nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, this was a very entertaining movie.Despite the movie running a little long for an intense, action movie, overall it was still very interesting and fun to watch because the pacing was so good. Neither the action segments nor the lulls, the robot scenes or the soldier scenes nor the very low-key romance is overdone. It's all in good proportion. It's not an innocent based-on-a-comic character film but, frankly, what movie is nowadays? There's always some profanity and sexual innuendos that don't belong in a "kids" movie made today. Thankfully, that kind of stuff was a lot lower in content than the recent "Transformers" film I viewed.The scenes with "Iron Man" a.k.a. "Tony Stark" (Robert Downey Jr.) in his suit and demonstrating his spectacular skills were - no surprise - the most fun to watch. (If you have a chance, catch this on Blu-Ray as the transfer is terrific). At the end of the film we get another robot, piloted by the corporate bad guy "Obadiah Stane" (Jeff Bridges) and that huge Iron Man-clone is fun to see, too.Some complain the film is not really all that "smart" and it's a bit too predictable, but it's fun ride of escapism that offers a good two hours of diversion thanks to very good special-effects and mostly-likable characters. Speaking of characters, it wasn't easy to recognize Bridges with a bald head and full beard but once I heard his distinctive voice, I knew who it was. Gywneth Paltrow played a sweet role as Stark's loyal secretary, "Pepper Potts." (Nice name!!). The Afghanistan villain was credible. Actually, I liked him better than the obnoxious Liberal news reporter, who was annoying.The "moral" of the story the screenwriters preach is that military might as a deterrent to fighting terrorists can easily backfire as companies which manufacture arms for the U.S. could also be acquired by bad guys (because of greedy and corrupt U.S. businessmen). This is naive Liberal propaganda, the kind I would expect out of the movie industry, whether in Hollywood or Europe. Sadly, there will never be a shortage of bullies and evil people, who will then crush an unarmed foe as the people in this film attempt to do. It's also implausible any company like the one shown in this movie could so easily travel to a hot spot like Afghanistan and deal with terrorists. It's unrealistic, but that's today's movies for you. Also, despite the nonviolent message in the story, the good guy sure wipes out his share of people with a variety of weapons! For someone preaching peace, he sure didn't hesitate in killing opponents.Iron Man's metal suit is definitely very cool, equipped with about anything you'd need to fight an army of terrorists, or anyone else. The suit - and his super pacemaker - turn him into a Superman-type guy in that he can fly pretty high and pretty high. The latter part - how high he could fly - makes a nice conclusion, by the way, regarding the good guy's battle against the "bad Iron Man."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Stark - playboy, technological genius, and CEO of the world's largest defense contractor - is about to have a major change of heart. Inexperienced in the reality of war and arms trading, Stark is about to become a prisoner of of a terror cell in Afghanistan. The experience will change everything for him. To escape, he must exceed his greatest technological achievements, and in so doing, he envisions a new way to live for him and his firm.Iron Man is, far and away, the best film adaptation of a comic book 'origin story' that I have seen adapted to film. Marvel is certainly on a roll at the movies, but the real genius here is not just in the original material. The casting, script and directing make Iron Man a thorough-going success. The film has the pace of a military thriller (though it is more of an action film), the visual appeal of a well-crafted sci-fi spectacular (though it never sacrifices story to spectacle), and an abundance of talent (although star power does not drive this film).Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges (Obie Stane) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper) own the screen, and are nicely supported by Terence Howard and a number of talented character actors. Downey is a perfect Tony Stark - flippant, too-smart-for-his-own-good, utterly dedicated and - at times - hilarious. While the film is far from a one-man-show, Downey's performance could have made this a great comics film even without the fine work by the rest of the cast.I was also pleased by the appearance of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the film, and hope that their appearance is a foreshadow of things to come, not just a cameo.Highly recommended for fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravo Favreau!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the start (perhaps even beforehand) I was expecting this to be quite special. As usual entertainment is my only requirement of a film for me to like it and this was fabulous. There are so many elements that make it work. In terms of the storyline, there is at least just enough of everything to make it hang together well: enough background to qualify Stark's naivety and arrogance (plus enough of Downey Jr's boyish charm to make him a believable celebrity industrialist!) besides his genius; enough of the water torture scene to make his submission acceptable (and enough visible anger to both drive and carry his deception); there is enough chemistry between Downey Jr and Paltrow to hint at the relationship that never quite blooms; and finally there is enough left hanging to betray a sequel possibly already on the table. Downey Jr largely carries the film in terms of the acting; Paltrow is on fine form but hardly used to her full potential (for a rare but wonderful glimpse of this I recommend "Proof"). Favreau's almost Hitchcockian cameo is downplayed sufficiently for it not to seem either contrived or haphazard. Ultimately, though, I think my hat is off to Jeff Bridges as possibly the most hate-able villain of the Marvel franchise so far.The use of heavy metal-esquire music for the soundtrack is quite appropriate given the title! And to conclude, the transformation/revelation of most of the characters is remarkable: Stark from self-involved to regretful, Potts from indulgent and condescending to affectionate, Stane from colleague to nemesis. I recognise the possibility of a sequel justifying it, but this didn't quite get to 9 for me purely because the ending is a little too unclosed. That tiny thing aside, this was magic; enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel Studios scores in its first shot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It'll take another viewing to confirm, but we may possibly have reached Nerdvana with this movie (incidentally, we got a trailer for The Dark Knight, but it was the teaser they initially released; meh; also, there was the Incredible Hulk teaser, which people seemed to like). I got into comics through the animated adaptations of things like Spider-Man and X-Men, so I only knew of Iron Man from his appearances in the 90s Spidey cartoon for a while. Recently, though, you can't throw a rock in the Marvel Universe without hitting Tony Stark, and I've been following the excellent current run by Charles and Daniel Knauf, as well as his appearances in other titles like Captain America, and reading the collected editions of his classic stories.Looking only at the plot, this is a pretty standard origin film; we get the modern version of Tony's beginnings as detailed by Warren Ellis in "Extremis" (with Afghanistan instead of Vietnam), and Pepper Potts is Tony's Girl Friday, though otherwise this is strongly influenced by the Layton/Michelinie period, particularly the presence of James Rhodes as the lead male supporting character, the main villain, Obadiah Stane (he doesn't last enough to be christened the Iron Monger formally, though he uses the term in conversation earlier), and Tony's immediate motivation for becoming a superhero, which is modelled heavily on "Armour Wars". But it's the execution, the details, and, yes, the Downey Jr., that make all the difference. Robert Downey Jr. owns all, no doubt; he's utterly fantastic as Tony Stark. Jeff Bridges is very strong as Stane; he's up there with McKellen and Defoe as realizing the best film villains of the current revival. At first I was a bit put off by Terrence Howard's voice as Rhodey (softer than I had imagined; in my head he's always been more of a Dorn/Haysbert type), but he's good; Paltrow does a good job too.The film is peppered with setup for future stuff: SHIELD (and, if you stay after the credits, ole Nick himself, talking about his "Avenger Initiative"), an expansive terrorist network referred to as the "Ten Rings" (of the Mandarin), and, my favourite, Rhodey vowing "next time, baby" on seeing a silver-grey suit of Iron Man armour.Mild criticism might be that the final defeat of the Iron Monger is vague and not especially climactic, but it suits the purpose well enough, and the preceding fight between the two armoured knights is awesome.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>supreme comic-book entertainment; it's also more jaded, and funnier, than most in its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is about as close to perfect popcorn entertainment as we can expect in this beginning of the summer season. But at the same time perfect in a certain sensibility of entertainment for its audience. One should know what Tony Stark's as a character not exactly the usual 'with great power come great response-yada-yada-yada' thing. He has a more jaded attitude, slightly more cynical than your typical man-of-steel (wait, sorry, iron, or alloy as it is). I'm almost reminded a little of Bill Murray from Ghostbusters, only with the catch of him being like Bruce Wayne without the grieving dead parents aspect.He has lots of money, lots of technical know-how as a wonder-kid/multi-millionaire, and he drinks and gambles and sleeps with whomever he wants. We as the audience don't identify with him as average Joe- some of us would want to be him for all the hedonistic perks available. And, when the time comes, he can whip up a technological breakthrough under the most dire of circumstances (i.e. under pressure of death to make a weapon for terrorists and instead making his quintessential suit).But at the same time, when Tony Stark becomes Iron Man, he does have a level of conscience from the start, realizing that the company that is under his name (if not one he entirely runs) has been manufacturing big-time weapons of mass mayhem (dont want to put destruction in there, though it's pretty much that), and wants to not want this any longer. Instead, basically, he takes matters into his own hands as some fantastical figure; instead of some army to take out insurgent terrorists in Afghanistan, he'll come and wipe em out in a jiffy. In this sense it's pure escapism, but also hitting on current issues (in the comic books it was similar terrain with him practically taking out Vietcong every which way). True, it might be much to imagine, but in the realm of a comic book movie, where we're already on the train of massive entertainment and being along for the ride of this character who can do what he does because he's that damn good.It's a thrill-ride, and it's very funny for much of the running time. And not unintentionally so like in, for example, Ghost Rider. It's genuinely hysterical to see certain things that make sense for Stark but are still wildly over the top in delicious ways (i.e. the strippers on the plane, yeah you read that right), or in just little things with how Robert Downey Jr. plays it. And make no mistake, this is pretty much a textbook example of perfect casting for a tricky character like this to cast. You want the charisma and appeal of a leading man, but can he also have something to him that speaks of the moral ambivalence and seedier bits to the character? You can't do it with a George Clooney, but with Downey Jr. it's a match made in not-guilty-pleasure heaven. He's able to bring the audience for the ride as a strong hero, but also hint at the fact that he's playing this character for what he is, and not cheating or skipping around the edges. Without him, it wouldn't work anywhere near as well.But to give director Favreau some more credit where it's due, also should be noted the near coup of casting Jeff Bridges as the villain - and as a character who is, basically, the "anti-dude" as it were - a dastardly figure who runs all of the shady dealings of Stark Industries and reveals his hand at wanting total domination of Stark's technology for his own means. His is a performance to relish among the great comic-book villain turns. But also noteworthy are supporting players: Gwyneth Paltrow, where'd she come from for this part that works this well? Terence Howard as well, and a couple of other supporting parts, they all seem to click just as well.Which brings me to the director, who should get credit where it's certainly due; coming from work as an actor/writer, going up through Made, Elf, and the recent bomb Zathura, it's a remarkable achievement to pull this kind of work off. While it goes without saying the script is already set for him to go, he doesn't tinker with it or his style to make it any more aggressively stylish than it needs to be. His is slick, efficient film-making, and even with witty moments to match up the bigger audience laughs (watch how he keeps the camera still through the POV of the lens Stark has up filming his botched 'test' in his rockets). For all the praise that Downey (very rightfully) will get for his work here, Favreau's is probably just as noteworthy in mixing rousing thrills and blockbuster entertainment and action while shamelessly delivering on the cynical side of the story. Just the final line, and how its delivered and in the context, is worth the price of admission.Oh, and by the way, stay through the end credits. If you're geeky about anything Iron Man (or awesome actors in eye-patches), you'll leave with a huge grin from ear to ear.</fullReview>

If you're looking for the perfect superhero movie, skip past all those Superman films and pick this up.

		<fullReview>Just saw this; now I know why it's such a popular film. Robert Downey Jr. seems to get better and better as an actor. Age suites him well. I don't know if it's partly because he picks better roles or if he is mastering his craft that much better. He captures the character of Tony Stark "Iron Man" masterfully and that makes the movie. Likewise Terrence Howard and Shaun Toub were great in their roles. While it is cheesy in spots, overall it has a great theme. Starting with a reminder of the reason we are at war. It was easy to forget it was based on a Marvel comic book. I think by far the best Marvel movie to date.Could Be Spoiler****** It displayed taking a man seemingly focused on money, fame, and a fast life and showed the importance of focusing on more important issues. A bit of a realistic look at a tough subject matter of war and politics. Some reviews felt it was more adult oriented; I think it is well suited message wrapped in a great script for all ages.Looking forward to Iron Man 2; glad it's out this month. Had I known this was so good, I would have gone to the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is an awesome film with great special effects! Everybody did a great job and all the actors were casted perfectly. A billionaire inventor named Tony Stark is held hostage in Afghanistan for months because terrorists want him to build a bomb. Instead, he builds an armor suit so he can escape. He is rescued and and while he is back home, he tries to reinvent the suit. He makes it and tries to figure out how to work it. His sexy beautiful personal assistant, Pepper Potts doesn't really him to do it, because she thinks he might die, but he tells her that he must do it to save lives. I love all of Iron Man's gadgets. Soon, some military people think Iron Man is a threat, so Tony asks his friend Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to stop the planes from trying to kill him. His other friend, Obadiah Stane betrays him and builds his own iron suit. If you love action, and comic book movies, you'll love IRON MAN!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly everyone trashing the video has a completely wrong view of the movie and has probably never read an Iron man comic book in their lives.The way this movie was made, actor wise, was a perfect representation of the "playboy" Tony Stark and Iron man when he first became it. There are a few problems in the movie but they are very minor. The biggest problem in the movie is that all the explosions look EXACTLY the same (the same person probably did the CG1 or explosives or w.e).As for anyone making references to racism in the movie. It's bogus, it isn't the usual devil horned villain killing everyone with the good ol' hero coming in saving the day. It tells it how it is with the military-industrial complex of underhanded arm's dealing. And how some Afgans are tormented and some are the tormentors. Maybe if all of the Afghans in the movie were evil then I might agree, but they aren't.Overall: Good movie, wouldn't look for the next Batman. But it does a good job with having a on the edge of your seat experience while Iron man is pounding the snot outta all the bad guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I actually liked this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm often a very cynical, skeptical, pessimistic SOB when it comes to movies, having been horribly disappointed by virtually every comic book movie adaptation to date, so when Iron Man came out, I was prepared for another long camp-fest full of impressive special effects and the sound of Stan Lee stroking himself in the background.Boy was I wrong! Iron man is at times gritty, and at times beautiful, and it blends together so seamlessly you wouldn't think this was a superhero movie. In fact, it's not a super hero movie, it's a movie about a flawed character who realizes he's been a total dupe, and a complete ass, and is so horrified by the consequences of his own ignorance and arrogance that he sets out to try and change things. This is the sort of story that's at the heart of every Marvel Superhero, really, but it's often told so badly that you never really get the point.Spider Man and Spider Man 2 got very close to this, and even went so far as to show that most people are complete ingrates when you go around saving their lives, especially in New York, which might be why Tony Stark lives in Malibu.Robert Downey Junior, a functional alcoholic, falls into the role brilliantly, what with the role being that of a functional alcoholic, and his performance is both charismatic and gripping, making you care about a man you also want to punch out.Jeff Bridges plays Obadiah Stane, read: The Bad Guy, and he's got smarmy, greedy bastard practically tattooed on his forehead from shot one. But that doesn't detract from the movie, actually, it feels perfectly natural. Plus he gets points for zooming around on a segue at one point, in a segue scene, oh Jon Favreau, you cheeky son of a...All in all, this is a great movie. It's not Oscar winner material or anything, but I'll watch it any day, over and over, than six minutes of the Phantom Menace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from The Dark Knight, but one of the best ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is a cool, smart, and funny comic book film that is one of the best ever made.I will come out and say this. THe Dark Knight is better. You have to agree with me because The Dark Knight has brains, it's serious, and it's amazing. Iron Man is one of the best films ever, but The Dark Knight is the best film ever. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark, a cocky weapon builder who is held captive. He is forced against his will to make a weapon called The Jerico. Instead he builds a suit which is his one way ticket out of there. So he returns to L.A. and decides to shut down his business. Because he saw tons of people murdered by his weapons. His friends Pepper(Gweneth Paltrow), JIm Rohdes(Terrence Howard)and Obideiah(Jeff Bridges) are all surprised. Tony begins experimenting with his iron suits. He soon fights crime as Iron Man. Iron Man has amazing visual effects. To think it's directed by Jon Faverau. Everyone in Iron Man is great and I think Robert Downey Jr. deserved an Oscar nomination for this and his role in Tropic Thunder. This film boosted his career back up. Robert Downey Jr. is here to stay for a while. Iron Man 2 will be out on May 7, 2010 and I can't wait til it comes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I know, the title to this review is a quote from Richard Donner's Superman The Movie, but there's a reason for that, and I am going to get to it, so bare with me.In a summer dominated by the darkness of, well, The Dark Knight, it may be hard to remember than a month of or two before it we were all basking in the universe of another comic book character, a multi millionaire, too, and, what a coincidence, a character who uses his quite considerable wealth to turn himself into a superhero. All similarities end there (don't worry comic book fans, this is not a review of compare and contrast proportions). For as The Dark Knight falls into a darker and darker pit of despair, terrorism metaphors and increasingly dark plot twists and even darker cliffhanger ending, Jon Favreau instead creates a world of blue skies, brightly coloured costumes (well, for the hero anyway), witty dialogue and, above all else, a lovely atmosphere of fun. Iron Man is, pure and simple, unadulterated fun, amazing when you consider that a good half hour of the film takes place in war torn Afghanistan, with the lead character in the hands of characters who are essentially terrorists. Of course, if the film was in other hands, this would lead to many a darker moment, probably using the comic book genre and lead character as a means to explore modern day warfare in the war on terror. Not Favreau. God bless Jon Favreau because what he chooses instead to do is have fun, lots of it.I have a confession to make. I didn't get to see this film until recently. At the time of writing I only watched the movie on DVD for the first time the night before. Another thing, I loved The Dark Knight. I levelled some mild criticism at its darkness, but loved the movie nevertheless, but here, we get something that is positively giddy, funny and very, very enjoyable. I can't believe I missed it on the big screen, because this is great, and as a sci-fi adventure/comic book adaptation, it's got everything that I love to see in a Hollywood blockbuster of this nature. Imaginative action, funny dialogue, humour whilst retaining an ability to keep the film serious so it can remain engaging and great acting. The latter is particularly impressive. I know it has been said by many elsewhere, but let it be said again, primarily because I want to say it, Robert Downey Jr is fantastic. If played right this should be a comeback of John Travolta/Pulp Fiction proportions. He was always an actor that I liked (please check out Hearts and Souls if you have a chance) and here he brings that cheeky, comedic quality he always has, but filters it through a wonderfully engaging heroic complex. Quite simply he plays Tony Stark in such a way that you want him to be a hero, you want him to make the right choices and by God you want him to save the day. There are no Christian Bale style brooding moments here. Tony Stark is a lot like the movie itself, it's a hell of a lot of fun.I still haven't mentioned Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges or Terrence Howard, but they all put in good work too, particularly Gwyneth, the will they/won't they chemistry between her and Robert is lovely and played almost in a 1940's screwball comedy way. Did I mention she is gorgeous throughout, not that it's important. She is though.And the final scene is brilliant. I want another one and I want it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first of all, let me just state that this is by far not the best superhero movie ever. neither is it the best action film ever.the focus of this film lies mainly on Tony Stark's changing opinion after (what the write up calls it) a life threatening situation. he is forced to fight for his life and the loss of someone he held as a true friend leads him to question the morals of his company.thus in order to escape, he builds his prototype iron man.he later goes on to improve on this and become a "better person" by using this technology to fight those who want to: A) harm America's interests B) hurt innocent civilian lives the majority of this film is focused around the design and building of the suit. as a previous reviewer stated, it DOES have sequel written all over it.And i can't wait for it :) well worth watching if you feel like something that has a bit of action, a bit of a laugh and something pretty awesome.could have been a better film and maybe it didn't deserve quite as much hype as it received but it is still a very enjoyable film and i would recommend it with an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony Stark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is a Marvel Film that is better than many other Marvel Films that I have seen recently.Tony Stark is kidnapped while he is over seas demonstrating some new weapons for the military. Once captured, he is forced to build a bomb but instead he builds a suit that he uses to escape from his kidnappers. As he returns home Stark decides that he must stop his company from manufacturing weapons and also begins to build a new suit that he can use to fight against evil.A major strength to this film is a strong lead character who plays the role greatly. In Spiderman I felt that they could have chosen a better actor to play Spiderman but I think that Robert Downey Jr. is great at portraying Tony Stark. Stark comes off as intelligent, funny, and in complete control in this film. Downey Jr. was a great choice as Iron Man and I look forward to seeing him in the sequel.The Iron Man suit in this film is awesome. The effects are phenomenal and outstanding at the same time. Especially the scenes where Iron Man is flying around. This really is some of the best special effects that I have seen in a film and it makes every scene involving Iron Man marvelous.I think the story is good as well. It is not too complex like another super hero film that came out the same summer. (Dark Knight) THe story picks up right away and the main conflict is upon the audience very soon. Also I like how you do not go through all of Tony Starks life and how he is given a brief back story at the beginning. This helps the story to get going.A few minor problems. For one, you really have to wait a while before Stark makes the real Iron Man suit. However I do understand that this is the film where they needed to show how the suit gets built and so on. You just have to wait a while to see Stark in the final awesome looking suit.Also I think Iron Man could have been in it a little more. It is cool seeing Tony Stark a lot, but it would have been nice to see him in the Iron Man costume more.The action is good in this film, but nothing too special. The final battle at the end is OK, but it left something to be desired.Also the supporting cast was nothing special. TOny Stark was awesome but the rest of the cast was OK. I can see why a lot of the cast is going to be changed for the next film. Sorry Terrance Howard.So this film is a lot better than the Fantastic Four films, X men films, and the Hulk FIlms. ALso I think it is better than SPiderman 2 and 3. It has a great leading actor, great effects, and a strong story and conflict. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hyped for the movie when it was on the internet as news. I wasn't the biggest fan of Iron-Man at the time, but I always liked Robert Downey Jr., because he's a phenomenal actor. Not only that, but having Jon Favreau on board made me want to watch this film even more. He's a great comedic actor, and would seem like a cool buddy to hang out with.So I went in there with high expectations and I came out very satisfied at what I just had seen. I couldn't think of anyone else who could play Iron-Man better than Robert Downey. Thanks to this film, I put Iron-Man at the second spot in my favorite super-hero list. Blade comes first.Of course I bought the blu-ray version of the movie, watched all the special features and it was great. The action was great, it was planned out where it was needed. Jeff Bridges also did a great job on his character, acting as a mentor and then as Iron-Man's enemy. He didn't like to put up with the selfish rich guy, I get it, no one likes that.Overall, a 10/10 for creativity. Now, I'm anxious for the sequel, and you know what they say about sequels, they're always the best ones in the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot complain about their first hour, Jon Favreau next to an inspired Robert Downey Jr. they adapt the origin of the superhero very well alternating the spectacular effects with an incomparable sense of humor. However it is deflated a little at the end when the plot becomes serious and he/she plays to conclude with the infaltable it fights final. It is almost the same case that the first delivery of Spiderman where the mejorcito happened when the hero didn't dress the suit. Robert Downey Jr, their character builds to the perfection, I cannot imagine a more appropriate actor to interpret Tony Stark. The rest of the allotment is very correct although to Terrence he lacked Howard a little more than presence (that am sure it will be compensated in his more than probable sequel). That more Stan's cameo Lee and the music of AC/DC and Black Sabbath ends up transforming it into one of the best adaptations that the Marvel has carried out (and the fans already needed it after &#x201c;Spidey 3&#x201d; and &#x201c;Ghost Rider&#x201d;).</fullReview>

This film succeed beyond everyone's expectations, no one thought that Robert Downey, Jr. could carry this movie, much less alone portray a hero that's been in our consciousness for over 40 years. But amazingly he pulls off an outstanding performance that's sure to make you accept him as Iron-Man for years to come, this movie is exciting, daring, funny &amp; witty and is a perfect treat for comic book fans alike. Iron-Man is still and will always be one of the best hero's out there hands down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man! I don't believe it's too overrated but still...OK we start the movie with Tony Stark, a multimillionaire playboy, alcoholic, weapon making genius. He's not carrying what happens until something comes about that changes his mind and makes him make a super suite to combat world terror. Thus Iron Man was born.This is yet another great action film with predictable plot and a big fight at the end. Comic book fans will like this movie as it is fairly accurate to the story of Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent with the part of Tony Stark I doubt it could have been played better. The only downer of this movie is the fact that it's still just another blockbuster with predictable plot but I'm fine for more of the same but it won't get above an 8 no matter how cool it looks or is acted out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is one movie that was way better than i thought it would be.it's not just an action movie.it's also a smart,cleverly written movie,with some great dialogue.it also incorporates real global problems,serving as a sort of commentary on our times.it's not preachy,it just shows how far we've progressed.or maybe regressed as a society.there is also the theme of redemption in the movie.i mentioned the good dialogue.an example of that is the witty banter between Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.)and his assistant Pepper Pots(Gwyneth Paltrow).beyond that though,Stark is generally witty.i liked the origin story of the film,though i can't say whether or not it's accurate to the comic book.naturally,there are some great action sequences,especially the flying scenes and the combat scenes.and that suit is very impressive,both in looks and functionality.as to the cast,Downey is very good as Stark/Iron Man.Paltrow is very likable as Pepper Potts.Terrance Howard is good as Stark's military friend Rhodey,but i feel he was underutilized.oh well,maybe the sequel will rectify that.i heard that Howard is being replaced in the sequel by Don Cheadle.nothing against Cheadle,but i think they ought to stick with Howard,since he originated the character in the film.but the best actor in the bunch,in my opinion is Jeff Bridges,who gives a William Hurt type performance,understated,yet simmering with passion and charisma.that's just my opinion.anyway,,the movie is fun and engaging,but it's no empty headed action movie.not that there's anything wrong with that.no,this is a smart movie with heart and soul.my vote for Iron Man: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Iron Man for the second time my views have not changed on this superb movie. A lot of hype has been building up to the release of this film and Jon Favreau did not fail to provide us with an action-packed, well written script and a very involving plot. With brilliant acting from Robert Downey Jr as the quick-witted Tony Stark and a good performance from Gwyneth Paltrow they seem to hold the movie together and with great results.One thing that stood out for me in this film was the amazing CGI and effects. It is noticeable that they squeezed everything that was available in the CGI and it shows with awesome fighting and high speed flying scenes.I am not going to give anything away about this movie but it is definitely a must watch and possibly a must own.Well Done Marvel!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining origin story which bodes well for franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan's "Batman Begins" fundamentally changed the superhero genre and became a gold standard. What it delivered was an often dark character piece with action to match and it was a blockbuster that art-house filmgoers could enjoy. When he came to direct "Iron Man", Jon Favreau had Nolan on his mind and has cited that film as a key inspiration. Favreau has not matched Nolan's achievement, but he has delivered a terrific piece of entertainment, which is not without depth and is superbly cast and well made.The central character of Tony Stark has to work if this film is to be at all successful, and he does, thanks to a snappy script and an absolutely excellent performance from Robert Downey Jr. Stark is similar to James Bond in one respect. You're happy to admire him as smooth and suave on screen, but know that, if he were an actual acquaintance of yours, you would probably loathe him. Despite his gambling, womanising, smug playboy nature, Stark is likable because Downey Jr. makes him unbelievably charming, funny and engaging. Added to this, Stark's character has an arc. Its progression doesn't span the whole film, and it isn't particularly original, but it does provide a point of connection with the character which makes Stark, and indeed Iron Man, a success.The pitch-perfect casting doesn't end there. Gwyneth Paltrow is far less annoying than she could have been and does make the ludicrously named Pepper Potts sympathetic. Terence Howard does a decent job with little to work with (his role is a place-holder for the inevitable sequel). However, the real star of the supporting cast is the ever-excellent Jeff Bridges, whose former-mentor Obadiah Stane is a treat to watch whenever his inversely-haired visage is on screen.The action is done very well. ILM's special effects are flawless and Favreau has a grip on the sequences which are thrilling and entertaining. The final sequence misses the mark a little but still has its moments. The rest of the film is humorous, entertaining and not a minute too long, which suggests that more time could have been spent on character.All-in-all, this film is a decent and entertaining set-up for what could be an interesting franchise. With this cast and the apparently safe hands behind the camera, we should be in for more superb entertainment in the inevitable sequel.4 Stars out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron man great film. It is more faithful to the comic book that inspired it. Robert Downey JR is the film he hits the ground running from his first scene and never stops running, RDJ plays Tony Stark like a lazy Howard Hughes/James Bond wannabe with a little bit of Hugh Hefner tossed in. He does not lack confidence and he almost has a childlike naive way of looking at life. Until a life altering and threatening accident places him in the hands of terrorists who demand he create a weapon for them. Stark creates something but not for them he creates a Armor with enough weapon power to take out an army which he proceeds to do. once home he realizes that he must take account for his actions his company makes weapons of mass destruction he must make amends thus is born Iron man a avenger out to protect the world from those who terrorize and commit atrocities on a massive scale. Jeff Bridges is superb as Stane, Stark's partner who betrays him and creates the Iron Monger a suit more powerful then Iron man's. the battle scenes are breath taking and suspenseful This movie delivers on all cylinders and fulfills any Iron man fan they even play Black Sabbith's IRON MAN and you know the movie is going to be fun when it pokes fun of itself by playing it over and over again specially in the background. One thing I must admit is this . the director made a movie better then the comic from which it came. This movie is a family movie deep down in it's iron plated heart it delivers action some romance some development in the form of Tony Stark as he grows from a spoiled man who does not take any accountability whatsoever for his actions to a Iron Plated hero out to not only take responsibility for his actions but those of others as well. This movie left me wanting more Iron Man and hopefully soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the genre of superhero movies , Iron Man defines a change in the perception of what a superhero is. Iron Man was the one which showed that a superhero movie isn't just one liners and action sequences , that it goes deeper than that.Saying Iron Man is your run-of-the-mill superhero movie is a crime in itself. Right from the first scene where Tony Stark is captured to the end credits , the movie holds on to you. There is no cliché dialog , no forced romance and most importantly there is no unbelievably good hero who is perfect in every way.The best thing about this movie is that you see Tony Stark undergo a metamorphosis of sorts. He goes from a billionaire playboy who doesn't give a crap about anybody to a person who gives importance to life and wants to correct his mistakes. All this while remaining the same funny and witty dude with awesome charisma. This was truly a second beginning for Robert Downey Jr.Even the support cast do a great job keeping the whole situation authentic. The writing , acting and dialog are all top notch . A must watch.As a good movie as this is , it is significant for one more reason . This was the first movie in what has now become the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The first time an audience waited till after the end credits to see an extra scene , to get a glimpse of the future and what it holds.The moment we saw Samuel L Jackson with that eye patch introducing himself as Nick Fury was pure ecstasy. The line that followed "I want to talk to you about the Avengers initiative. " will be written down in history as one the most iconic lines . Since then Marvel has created an interconnected empire of movies that both boggle the mind , as well as touch the heart. And it was all possible because the base of it was a masterpiece named Iron Man</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Following Review Will Contain Spoilers! Iron Man from the year 2008 marks the first film in a series of Marvel films. This series is now known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Is it the first universe on film? Of course not, but so far the people behind the scenes have crafted something amazing. Iron Man was the first piece in this puzzle. It was a big risk for Paramount at the time, but it payed off into something so big, that Disney had to buy it. The following is my review of Iron Man.Iron Man was written by Matt Holloway, Art Marcum, Hawk Ostby, and Mark Fergus. Fergus and Ostby had actually worked together a few times in the past on some smaller films, and even the 2006 film Children of Men. Since Iron Man was made in 2008, they have worked together on Cowboys &amp; Aliens. Holloway and Marcum also worked together on the 2008 comic book film Punisher: War Zone. A favorite of mine. So they all some good experience before coming on board with this film. Some better than others, but even still.The story follows Tony Stark, a weapons dealer for the United States government. Tony is in the Middle East showing off his new Jericho missile. On his way back to base, his crew is attacked, and Tony is taken hostage. The terrorist leader who had him kidnapped wants Tony to build him one of these Jericho missiles. Tony turns this around to build his first Iron Man suit, and thus escapes back home. During his time in the middle East as a hostage, Tony has second thoughts on selling weapons that kill people. This is where the story really picks up. I don't want to give away the entire story, but the film features some great twists and turns. The villain of the film Obadiah Stane(Jeff Bridges) is still one of my favorite MCU(Marvel Cinematic Universe) villains. His character was written greatly, and Bridges was the perfect fit for the role. One of my major issues with the story, is what comes at the end. Again this will be a major spoiler. Tony Stark reveals at the end that he in fact is Iron Man to the public. I did not like this part, and would have liked it more had they gone the traditional route. Either way, the story ended up being amazing, and was a great start to this huge universe. The story writers here deserve big credit.The film was directed by Jon Favreau. Favreau not only directed this film, but also came back to direct the sequel. He is also known for films like Elf, Zathura: A Space Adventure, and Cowboys &amp; Aliens. The film is visually amazing. Though there are times that the CG looks cartoonish. The action scenes are fun, but this is not a big action blockbuster. For about the first forty five minutes or so, there is only light action. Even the final battle between Iron Man and Stane only lasts about five to seven minutes. The story and the characters really carry this film. Which leads me to this fabulous cast of actors. The film is lead by Robert Downey Jr., and co-stars Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, Faran Tahir, and so many other actors in smaller roles. After having seen this movie many times since 2008, I still enjoy watching it for the amazing chemistry all the actors had together. Faveau delivered amazing action when the film called for it, it mostly looked nice, and he brought together this great cast of actors and had them make this great film.The film was composed by Ramin Djawadi. He is now known for his amazing score on Pacific Rim. That score is still one of my favorites to this very day. This score however for Iron Man, well it just wasn't that great. It does add some nice depth to the overall film, but it is just a good score, and not a great one. Some may disagree with me on this aspect, but I stand by my opinion. Again, it wasn't bad, just not great as some of his other work.In closing, this is just a fantastic start to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Iron Man is such a fun and entertaining film that the whole family could likely enjoy. The film has amazing acting, and a great story. There are some aspects to the story and I didn't care for, but nothing that hurts the film. Those wanting to get caught up on the MCU, this is where it all began, and this is a great beginning. It should not disappoint the average movie fan.8/10I will be back to Review the next MCU film in the series, The Incredible Hulk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now it's not always a movie based off a comic book would do it justice however Iron-Man hit all the right notes.Iron Man begin a series of films based in has been called The Marvel Climatic Universe.This film centers around the origin of Iron Man as Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr) as he wants to rid the world of weapons after being taken hostage. This leads Obadiah Stane (Played by Jeff Bridges) to begin questioning his mind.With help from Pepper Potts (Played by Gwyneth Paltrow) his assistant to help keep his affairs in order at Stark Industries along with his best friend Rhodey (Played by Terrence Howard).The plot of the film is one of the strong holds to Iron Man as it explain how Tony Stalk would become Iron Man and any fan of Iron Man would appreciate itWhile I wasn't sure much about Robert Downey Jr but after watching Iron Man it was clear he was born to play this role his performance in this film shows you can pull yourself out of a jam and become better and this film show case his talents as a actor because he brought Tony Stark to life on the big screen.Jeff Bridges went so far as to shaving his head bald like Obadiah in the comic books because he wanted to make sure he made the fans happy by looking like the character from the comics which is true to honoring the craft of acting.Gwyneth did pretty well as Pepper as in terms of her services to the role. The acting in the film is pretty strong as you see the cast pulling out the best of their talents to the film and there is a good bit of humor in the film.Action for this film is some of the best ever done in a film and some of the most creative as well you have to see the film to appreciate it Music wise is pretty awesome as it include Black Sabbath "Iron Man" along with other original music to tell the story of each scene.The Special effects in the film are top notch the suits for Iron Man are very well design and detail as it shows the power of how C G I can be done for any film.Iron Man does a very well done film with story telling, acting and amazing special effects if you want to appreciate a good comic book movie watch Iron ManI give Iron Man an 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rock-solid beginning to Marvel Cinematic Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Please, no gang signs. Nah, I'm kidding. Throw it up." Thus begins Iron Man, the Batman Begins of the Marvel cinematic universe. Tony Stark is, in his own words, a "billionaire genius playboy philanthropist". While demonstrating his newest weapon, the Jericho Missile, to the U.S. Army in the Middle East, the group is attacked by terrorists and Tony is kidnapped. With the aid of a fellow captive who happens to be brilliant, he successfully builds an iron suit and escapes from the prison. When he gets back to the U.S., he decides to stop selling weapons, as they are being used by terrorists to... well, terrorize. This will cut back dramatically on profits, so his partner decides to take him out, and even goes so far as to join up with the terrorists. Choose your friends wisely, kids. But, on to the review. In all reality, I was not too excited about seeing this movie. Let's face it. It's a movie about a billionaire playboy who just so happens to be a genius, gets captured by terrorists, builds currently impossible technology in a cave with a box of junk, makes a suit in a cave with a box of junk, attaches flamethrowers to said suit, and makes an epic escape. Ah, yes. I forgot. The suit also has jet packs in its feet, enabling him to fly. But hey, it's a superhero movie. If it weren't for such cheesy feats, the movie would have utterly failed. Thankfully, it did not. It succeeded. Amazingly. In ways it should not have. The truth is that Iron Man is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. It goes without saying that Robert Downey Jr. nails the role of Iron Man incomprehensibly well. He was born for this role. The supporting characters do well in their roles as well, but it's obviously Iron Man who steals the show here. The music is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Ramin Djawadi has created the definitive interpretation of Iron Man. This is what an Iron Man soundtrack should sound like. The directing, editing, and cinematography were perfect. The ultimate question is: why on earth does this movie work? I don't know, but it does. Maybe it's the fact we get to see Tony Stark journey from spoiled jerk to hero, or maybe it's the fact the movie's just... fun. Regardless, this movie was a brilliant start to the legendary Marvel Cinematic Universe. In fact, I would go so far as to say it still hasn't been surpassed in quality by any Marvel movie, except for possibly Captain America: The Winter Soldier. I'm giving it 4.5 out of 5 arc reactors. Also, shout-out to Tony Stark for inventing arc reactors. Now I know what I need to buy if I ever have heart trouble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man Burns Bright In Red &amp; Gold!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marking the commencement of Marvel Cinematic Universe, catapulting Robert Downey Jr. into the league of Hollywood's biggest stars &amp; also announcing the arrival of Marvel Studios into motion picture filmmaking for it is their first fully-financed project, Iron Man not only succeeds as a quality blend of style &amp; substance but is also amongst the best origin stories cinema has come up with for a comic book superhero.Iron Man tells the story of genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist Tony Stark who, while on his tour to war-torn Afghanistan for the demonstration of his new weaponry to United States military, is ambushed &amp; taken hostage by a terrorist group. Working with another captive, he designs an exoskeleton to get out from there &amp; after returning to US further refines his design. The plot covers the change his captivity brings in his entire personality.Stylishly directed by Jon Favreau, Iron Man aims for the same grounded approach Nolan applied in Batman Begins &amp; succeeds amazingly well for the most part. The screenplay is brimming with energy, wit &amp; charm, and is brilliantly written &amp; narrated. Production design provides it a very modern feel, Camera-work is vibrantly carried out, Editing briskly paces the whole story which also benefits from Ramin Djawadi's fitting score as well as clever use of existing songs.Coming to the acting department, Iron Man features a star-studded cast in Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges &amp; Terrence Howard but the film belongs to Downey Jr. who blazes brightly in red n gold with a performance that's absolutely fantastic, effortlessly charismatic &amp; downright polished. Overshadowing the input of the rest &amp; fitting the suit perfectly, this is one role that couldn't have gone to a better actor &amp; how this gifted talent renders Tony Stark on screen is a further proof of that.On an overall scale, Iron Man has enough power in it to please both fans of the comics as well as newcomers. Sure its third act isn't as impressive as the first two but the positives eclipse the negatives by a huge margin. Balancing its storytelling aspects with big budget extravaganza to triumph as a work of quality in the eyes of viewers n critics alike, Iron Man is a highly refreshing, wildly entertaining &amp; largely satisfying crowd-pleaser that's hugely responsible for the foundation on which Marvel Studios stands today. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, Iron Man is truly awesome! Every scene was great and there was almost no boring parts in the movie. Iron Man is the best out of the three. Iron Man 2 was boring and Iron Man 3 was just disappointing. Iron Man was a part where the Marvel Cinematic Universe began. And yes, it was a good start. But the sad part is the last 2 movies left a legacy of mediocrity. At least it had the chance to redeem itself through the movie The Avengers. Maybe, Iron Man would redeem itself again on Avengers Age Of Ultron.In conclusion, Iron Man was great! A good start to the franchise and the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow what could I possibly say about this movie that hasn't already been said. Let me say this is the very beginning of the Marvel golden age of movies. Phase 1 of introducing all the Characters from the Avengers which starts with Iron Man. Tony Starks played brilliantly by Robert Downey Jnr is a wonderful teleplay adaption of the comic hero suit of iron. Just everything fits well. The chemistry of the cast, the good balance of comedy and drama and FX is not blurred, rough cut. It's very smooth and watchable. Overall Marvel have the best of times ahead with the next phases and see everyone eventually meet up and join forces to end the ultimate of evil. Sit back relax and enjoy the ride in what could be the greatest run of movies via marvel the world will ever get to see in a lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Beginning for the Marvel Cinematic Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not the first movie to feature characters from Marvel Comics. The 2000's saw the "X-Men" franchise, a "Hulk" movie, two "Fantastic Four" movies, and the Toby Maguire "Spider-Man" trilogy. However, all of those movies were films that Marvel outsourced to various companies--notably Fox and Sony. "Iron Man" is the first film to be made in house by Marvel Studios, and as such it's the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, i.e. the first film that will come to interact with characters from other films that are not direct sequels. For this reason, "Iron Man" is worth watching if you happen to be a fan of any of the other MCU movies, especially "The Avengers" series. "Iron Man" begins the process of building continuity across different Marvel films, and for the true nerds amongst us there are many tidbits of information in this movie that are beneficial to understanding the rest of the MCU films. Still, the main reason to watch this movie is not its place in the MCU, but its value as a standalone film. Marvel Studios set out to prove themselves with this movie, and they delivered a hit. The film is a solid two hours of thrills that features a robust and engaging storyline and fantastic acting. Robert Downey, Jr. defines the role of Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, and Jeff Bridges all turn out dynamic performances. Bridges especially shines as Obadiah Stain, and contributes much to the movie. That said, I give this film nine out of ten stars. It's one of the best in the comics movie genre, and I only stop myself from giving it a ten because I try to reserve that score for movies I see as not only great, but perfect. "Iron Man" comes mighty close to that, and I'm sure you'll agree that it deserves high marks. Oh, and don't forget to watch the post-credits scene, which foreshadows the rest of the MCU!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What comic book movies should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this for the third time, I can't believe I had never realized how incredible this movie is. Iron Man is amazing, probably the second or third best superhero movie ever. It has great acting, incredible effects, great directing from Jon Favreau, and of course, freaking Jeff Bridges. The acting in Iron Man is really good, Robert Downey Jr. is amazing in this movie, after this movie, when you think Tony Stark, you'll think Robert Downey Jr., he really is Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow is great as his assistant, Pepper, Terrence Howard does a very good job as Rhodey, I prefer Don Cheadle, but that's just a matter of opinion, they're both really good as Tony's best friend. And of course, the amazing Jeff Bridges is in this movie. That guy is really an incredible actor, he is great as Obadiah Stane, the only problem I had was that he's the bad guy of the movie, Jeff made a great villain, but I like him way better as a good guy. This guy is great, even as a power-hungry maniac, he's really awesome, obviously, because he's Jeff Bridges.The writing in the movie is very good, the characters were well written, the jokes are great, the movie's funny, witty, and action- packed. I really liked how they chose to play this origin story, I mean, half of the movie he's in captivity, the first time he flies is about 1 hour in the film, and that really worked.The special effects of the movie are really amazing, seriously, him suiting up in the Mark III for the first time was incredible, it gave me goosebumps. Everything is so cool here, the technology in the universe is awesome, but what I think is the coolest thing, is that it's actually believable. That's what makes this movie better than the others, in my opinion. Iron Man 2 and 3 have really ridiculous technology, it's very cool and all, but it makes no sense, Iron Man 2 has those unbelievable holograms, and Iron Man 3 has suits that assimilate on the user, and the Mark 42, which is attracted by microchips in Tony's body. So yeah, the technology of the movie is great because it doesn't seem far away from where we are right now. Also, it has a lot more Iron Man action than the others, and some of the coolest ones, I mean the Middle East parts where freaking amazing, when he said "My turn" and blasted the terrorists with his flamethrowers, that gave me goosebumps. The directing by Jon Favreau is great, he really made some exhilarating action, once again, the Middle East scenes were first-rate. But the final fight, wow, that was amazing too, Obadiah hitting Tony with a motorcycle, that was awesome. Also, the soundtrack is perfect, it goes incredibly well with the movie, ACDC with Iron Man, perfect combo.Iron Man is a great movie, in my opinion, it's what comic book movies should be, they need awesome action, good characters and acting and humor. The Dark Knight is great, and it doesn't have that last item, but in my opinion it's a great movie, not just a comic book movie, if you know what I mean, I don't think you did, but whatever. Watch this movie, it's awesome. I give it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great kick-start to the Marvel Cinematic Universe full of awesome action, awesome visuals and awesome characters. This is one movie that cuts to the chase in a manner that can entertain comic and non comic fans alike. Moreover, Obadiah Stane finds the fact that Tony gives the world its best weapon ever by trying to rid it of weapons really ironic. Well that isn't all that meets the eye, trying to order a hit to have Tony killed leads to Obadiah building a hero out of him, which is even more ironic and awesome at the same time. Heroes aren't born, they're built. Moreover, what this movie did different was that it skipped the origin story and started with the important part. Director Jon Favreau and actor Robert Downey Jr put in their best to satisfy the audience in this action packed, must watch comic book movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title: Iron ManCondensed Storyline: A billionaire, playboy, weapons maker called Tony Stark is kidnapped and held captive in the middle east, so he has to escape. He does so with his new battle suit, but there is a traitor close to him Notable Acting: This movie was the movie which secured Robert Downey Jr in Hollywood, after having a troubled life prior to this movie, filled with substance abuse and poor acting roles. But when it came to the 2008 movie Iron Man this made him an overnight success as it was his first blockbuster movie and paved the way for his acting career. He fits the role so perfectly, because he is able to act pretentious and stuck up like his character of Tony Stark is. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the secretary/love interest of Pepper Potts, her character was enjoyable, but felt more like a secondary character compared to that of a primary character. The same could be aid about Jeff Bridges who plays the big bad of Obadiah Stane in this movie. Costume: The costume of Ironman was made with a stunning mixture between CGI and practical effects, and in all honesty, that is the bet way they could have done it. Because if they had done it with all practically effects, it would have looked lacking of sorts. And if it was done with all CGI it possibly would have looked cheesy. So I think they got it as good as could be. Incorrect Science: The arc reactor is used to keep the shrapnel out of Tony's heart, yet Yinsen talks about the arc reactor running his heart, feels like a nudge to the audience there. US soldiers are trained to never stop while ambushed in a convoy. All US army HMMWVs are armoured, the shots shown in the ambush scene go right through the door and window, they wouldn't do that if it was armoured. They would also give such a wealthy man added protection if he was visiting a warzone. Ironman encounters icing on his first flight with the MK2, but with no visible moisture in the air or on Ironman, so the air around him would have to be around -30 to -40 for icing of that magnitude to form. Overall Feel: Before this movie Ironman was in the B-list heroes group, the guy normal people wouldn't know. But the nerds or fans of the Avengers comic would know him. But after this movie, he was thrown right up there with the best. I used to watch the Ironman cartoon in the 90's and I can say that this did it justice, they stayed close to the source material and made some adaptations here and there, but it was a great movie which allows Marvel to get a foot hold for their cinematic universe. Before this they only had Blade in the late 90's and Spiderman in the 2000's. But even Spiderman could have ruined this movie, by ending it's trilogy on a bad note with Spiderman 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My personal favorite comic book superhero flick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1000th review!!! Spoilers, though!The 2008 Iron Man movie is one that I consider to be one of the best of its genre. I mean, you've got the laid-back, smooth direction of Jon Favreau, a GREAT villain played by Jeff 'Lebowski' Bridges, a tight, yet simplistic but hard-hitting plot, and to top it all, the charisma and nuance of Robert Downey Jr. as billionaire Tony Stark, aka Iron Man. Pepper all that with fantastic special effects and CGI.I've doubted Marvel in the past, I thought Daredevil was pretty bad, and the Fantastic Four and Ghost Rider movies were bad. Also, the third parts of the X-Men and Blade movies sucked. But they nailed it with this one. I can't really explain how I instantly fell in love with it. It's like some of the 80s kids and the '89 Batman movie. It just has that sort of charm!Speaking of Batman, this movie came out as the same year as The Dark Knight. While TDK is clearly the better film, I still prefer this one over it. Maybe it's because Batman acted like a p*ssy following TDK, and went into 'exile'. Whereas, Stark publicly announces that he's Iron Man in this movie.Thank you, Marvel, for starting off the stellar Avengers universe with this fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a big fan of superhero movies every since I was 8 and the first Spiderman movie came out however I was not much of a movie fan overall until The Avengers was released in 2012. So that being said when Iron Man was first released I didn't really care. I did however see the Hulk because unlike Iron Man I had heard of him before because of the 2003 Hulk movie. I finally saw this movie in 2010 right before the release of Iron Man 2 nd have been a fan ever since. I actually did not know that all of these Marvel movies were part of the same universe until about 6 months before The Avengers was released and ever since finding that out I have been immersed into this amazing movie world that Marvel has set up.Everybody knows the plot to this movie so I don't need to go into detail. Tony Stark is taken prisoner by terrorists he creates Iron Man and escapes and beats the bad guys. It's really awesome to see Iron Man just flying around. In 2008 especially because there had not really been anything like it in a superhero movie before. The way it looks when it flys or in combat it's like watching an actually piece of advanced weaponry entering a war zone. One thing in particular that is really cool to see in this movie is Tony Stark using every possible available resource including his own mind to his advantage. Everything from first building the Iron Man suit to actually using it does a great job showing that Tony Stark is a genius. He proves even this early on in the MCU that he is Iron Man with or without the suit.The acting like everything else is of course great especially form Robert Downey Jr. Which was of course a big surprise considering he had been on the down slope for at least 10 years prior to the release of this movie. Gwyneth Paltrow did a good job as Pepper Potts though I don't particularly like her as an actor. I don't have anything against her I'm just not a big fan but with that in mind she did a good job throughout the entire trilogy as well as in her short appearance in The Avengers. Her and Robert Downey Jr. work really well together and have a good believable relationship in these movies. Terrence Howard did an OK job as Rhodey but I personally like Don Cheadle a lot more. Of course you can't go wrong with Jeff Bridges in anything so I don't even need to talk about him but I will say he makes a great villain.So overall Iron Man is a great and really entertaining movie as well as the start of an amazing universe of movies. If you've somehow managed not to see Iron Man yet... why? Between all the easter eggs from comics and other movies the tie ins and the superhero awesomness there is no reason for any comic book or movie fan to be left out of this truly amazing world that Marvel has created.I give Iron Man a 10/10</fullReview>

It has a really strong sense of cohesion and grittiness throughout the movie which really draws the viewer in. They really do a good job of making you love and hate Tony Stark, all at the same time. The special effects are awesome, especially on Blu-Ray.Iron Man 2 was pretty good, 3 was rubbish (in my opinion.)

		<fullReview>Outstanding movie and possibly the best Marvel's done to date, at least as far as their shared universe films go. Let's cut right to the chase: Robert Downey, Jr. makes this movie work. I'm not going to say he's the perfect Tony Stark because Downey's Stark is really very different from how he has always been in the comics. But it works far better this way and is a huge point in favor of deviating from the source material, which is the eternal struggle between Hollywood and anything it adapts. This is one case where the changes they made worked out great. The rest of the cast is terrific, all following Downey's lead very well. His enthusiastic performance is a joy to watch. I'm sure it must have been a ball for Paltrow, Bridges, and the rest to act with him as they all seem to be having a great time in their scenes together. Jon Favreau does a praiseworthy job of directing, especially when he hadn't really done this type of movie before. The action and special effects are great. The script is smart and funny, though a lot of the humor comes from the ad-libbing of Downey and co-stars, so I'm not sure how much credit I can give the script for that. It's really a wonderful piece of entertainment without being mindless or crude. One of the best superhero films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a masterpiece to truly kick off the marvel cinematic universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's quite funny that were almost near the end of phase 2 in the marvel cinematic universe but iron man the first film is still the very best solo marvel film. The premise sees a billionaire weapons merchant who is on the verge of death and kidnapped by terrorists until he creates a suit to escape. When he gets home he changes his philosophy and decides to become the superhero iron man. Robert Downey jnr was saved by this performance and it really has changed his career for the better. His dialogue is funny and witty and the smart thing the film did was as he changed you still loved him because of his whit and I love his character. The supporting cast is also fantastic especially the relationship between Downey and Gwyneth paltrow who plays pepper Potts. I have thought that this is the best romance in a comic book film franchise ever and their chemistry in this film is great and a big part of the film. There has been allot of controversy over Terrence Howard's involvement as James Rhodes but he is great in the role and his relationship with Tony is a big part about the mortality of the film. Jeff bridges plays obediah stane and he does well in his villainous role and his chemistry is really good with Tony. The story is really good as it shows a man change and decide to do what is right. Also even though this film is called iron man I believe that it is clear that this film is about the man and not the suit. The only negative I have ever heard about this film is that the film slows down when we get the cave scenes. However, I believe that these are great and they are real character building scenes for the lead. The script is really good especially with downeys dialogue feeling natural and is just hilarious. Everybody has great pieces of dialogue that really works for this film. The style is great with the look and the designs for the suit looking great. Also the action scenes are really smooth and slick which allows you to see it all. Overall it is fantastic and a great film to start the mcu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jon Favreau's "Iron Man" brings the superhero genre to a rock star status.&nbsp;Frankly, it needs it.&nbsp;It is a breath of fresh air after the Superman and Batman pictures which have been so vapid and overproduced that they forgot to be fun.&nbsp;This movie overcomes all the handicaps that have kept the others down including the labored weight of the origin story.&nbsp;Yes, Tony Stark builds and Iron Man suit and becomes a superhero, but the script isn't belabored by getting all the pieces in place.&nbsp;This is a fun movie that allows it's hero to learn from his mistakes.What makes "Iron Man" work is that Favreau and his writers realize that a man in an iron suit can only be interesting as far as the special effects can carry it.&nbsp;So, their movie is heavily weighted toward the performance of Robert Downey Jr. who, as Tony Stark, is given free range over his best gift, his mouth.&nbsp;Stark is old money, a billionaire whose company builds on the legacy of his late father, building weapons to ? quote ? keep the peace ? end quote.&nbsp;As the movie opens, he's in a convoy in Afghanistan, drink in hand, headed to a presentation of his new weapon system.&nbsp;You don't have to have superpowers to guess that his convoy is ambushed by members of a terrorist cell who want the famed metallurgist to build them a missile.&nbsp;What does he build instead?&nbsp;Well, just look at the title.What a guy this is.&nbsp;He has enough many to keep a small country in luxury for decades.&nbsp;He can build anything with a hammer and welding torch.&nbsp;He lives on a vast mountaintop estate in Malibu, California.&nbsp;He has jets, cars, and even a robot butler named J.A.R.V.I.S. whose voice sounds suspiciously like Paul Bettaney.&nbsp;He's also got a Barnum-like gift for salesmanship, selling arms around the world to keep things in line.&nbsp;This is caused him grief.&nbsp;He's been called a Merchant of Death, a man whose company deals in making war profits.&nbsp;He argues vehemently that his company helps keep the world at peace by fighting back against those who bring about war.&nbsp;That builds the bulk of the movie as Stark builds the Iron Man suit, his company.After an incident in Afghanistan, he decides to shut down the weapons division and focus on building his iron suit.&nbsp;That doesn't sit well with his second-in-command Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), and therein lies our villain.&nbsp;Bridges makes a good one.&nbsp;He's familiar to us as a nice guy, but here he proves that he can convincingly play a villain.&nbsp;It's not just a standard evil villain.&nbsp;There's something about Stane that gives he fuel to want what Stark has.&nbsp;It's a good performance.Also good is Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Starks's personal assistant and love interest.&nbsp;She could have been stuck in a thankless role, but Paltrow has been given something much more substantial to work with.&nbsp;She isn't all lips and glossy eyes.&nbsp;She has a brain and she tires of her employer's wreckless personality, that is, until she falls into his arms.&nbsp;The chemistry between Paltrow and Downey is something special.Yet, the greatest gift here is Robert Downey Jr. who's on the comeback trail.&nbsp;He's a wonderful actor who fell into a personal crisis but now seems to be on the road back.&nbsp;Recently, he's been turning in magnificent work in "A Scanner Darkly", "Zodiac", "Tropic Thunder" and the little-seen "Lucky You."&nbsp;He has a God-given talent and it's nice to finally see him getting back to great work.&nbsp;He gives a better performance here might seem necessary.&nbsp;He could have done a lot of posturing, but he gives Stark a personality that is light-hearted.&nbsp;It's a joy to watch.So is the movie.&nbsp;Jon Favreau has created a film that is exciting and fun.&nbsp;The script gives us more than we might expect, and it isn't all rock-em-sock-em crash and bash (though the movie employs those things).&nbsp;It isn't overwhelmed by marketing.&nbsp;This is a smart movie, with a lot of energy and style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I am Iron Man"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world needs more comic book movies like these; but if we must have one more, "Iron Man" is a blueprint for said films. Not only is it a good comic book movie (smart and stupid, stirring and silly, intimate and spectacular), it's winning enough to engage even those who've never cared much for comic books or the movies they spawn.Tony Stark (played brilliantly by Robert Downey Jr.) not only makes the character memorable, but also makes it special. Downey's performance is intriguing, and unexpected. He doesn't behave like most superheroes: he lacks the psychic weight and gravitas. Tony Stark is created from the persona Downey has fashioned through many movies: irreverent, quirky, self-deprecating, wise- cracking. So comfortable is Downey with Tony Stark's dialogue, so familiar does it sound coming from him, that the screenplay seems almost to have been dictated by Downey's persona.But a great hero can only be good as it's villain, and Jeff Bridges gives us a great and memorable performance. It would be so easy to make him a stereotypical villain; but instead, the character of Obadiah Stane plays both the voice of reason for Tony and also the cunning villain that does deals under the table. Instead of being the villain that is so obvious to the audience, he adds charm and personality to the character to make him unique and charismatic.But what also makes the movie work is Stark's relationship with everyone in the cast: not just Obadiah Stane, but also Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). She plays his caretaker/butler, but there is this connection to these two. It would've been easier to make them love interests from the beginning, but they play with that cliché. Also, I like his relationship with Rhodes (Terrence Howard). They bicker a lot, but they also help each other out in a playful way. It's very genuine these relationships that Stark has with these characters, and they don't feel forced. They feel like it adds character to who he is outside of being a snarky tech-wise genius.Everything that Jon Favreu has made a fantastic comic book movie that is not only pleasing to comic book readers, but also people who are not fans of comic books. At the end of the day, it's Robert Downey Jr. lifts up, and brings this character to life through character interaction and through legit drama that makes him go through a legitimate story arc. By building on that, Favreau found his movie, and it's a good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intelligent, Entertaining Superhero Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man was coming on TV today and since me and my friends are going to 'Iron Man 2' sometime next week, I watched it to recall the characters and see if I still liked it like 2 years back. I am very happy to say that the second time I loved it even more. John Favreau directed this amazing movie which is one of the best superhero movies ever. I am keeping my fingers crossed, that Iron Man 2 will be a truly worthy successor to this amazing gem. Also, if anybody has a lifestory to tell, Downey Jr. has the ultimate comeback tale to tell. After all those stints in rehab and prison, he came back revamped in a new avatar and 2008 and 2009 were his years. He has become on of my favorite actors now.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is rich, handsome, intelligent, quick witted, incredibly wealthy and a playboy. He is the owner of Stark Industries which specializes in making warheads for the US military. He is kidnapped by an Afghanistan terrorist group who forces him to help them make his new, modern missiles. But Tony Stark, along with another Afghan scientist who is kidnapped, builds a suit of iron and escapes from their stronghold. Unfortunately the scientist is killed and he returns to his home. He has now seen that his weapons are in the hands of the bad guys and wants to stop the production of the warheads. But Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) advices him against this, because the consequences will be too great. Stane was his father's best friend and a business partner and he is now a major player in the Stark Industries and a close confidante of Tony Stark. Will Tony Stark make a difference in the world with his Iron Man? This is kind of a breath of fresh air to the superhero genre. It doesn't have all the baggages of other superheroes. Tony Stark is a man who enjoys life and he is a ladies man. I thought, what were they thinking by casting a middle aged man like Downey Jr, but that was before I saw the movie. After watching and being enthralled by the story, I accept that Downey was really born to play the role of Iron Man. The underplayed romance between Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Tony Stark works well for the story. Tony Stark changed his views about weapons after seeing what it did to other people who were in the line of fire. He wasn't a born justice upholder like other superheroes and he is a man behind all that metallic gear. This is what makes Iron Man so much more endearing. If the character of Obadiah Stane was played by any other actor other than Jeff Bridges, it would have been simply awful. I didn't even know who Jeff was before this year's Oscar, but I still remember hating his evil persona character back when it released. Terrence Howard plays Stark's best friend Rhodey, who is an officer in the US military and his character is under written. But, I thought he would get a chance to display his acting in the second movie, but they have put some other man in his part and it is so sad that he won't be a part of Iron Man 2. The banter of Stark with his robotic assistants, the freezing of the Iron Man suit and everything except the final battle is brilliant. The final battle is supposed to be like that, so I can't hate Favreau for that.The background score is awesome and the cgi effects seemed insanely real. Iron Man 2 released here yesterday (so sad its releasing late here) and I hope it will be awesome :) 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth my 25 year wait...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1984, when I was 9 and living in Texas somewhere, my Dad asked what I wanted for my birthday. We where pretty poor and I knew it, but I had seen these kids reading comics at school and I wanted to know what the deal was. So I told him I wanted some comic books and he seemed relieved because back then they where only like 40 cents to a dollar. So he took me to the nearest 7-11 and my eyes almost immediately locked on to 2 titles, Teen Age Mutant Ninja Turtles #1 and Iron Man #180. The TMNT license never panned out to what I wanted. Other than the comics themselves, I was subjected to wave after wave of shittastic cartoons and half-witted movies. While, IM did have some cartoon exposure over the years, it was just never that good. I also knew that the cinematic technology of the time would not lend itself well to a live action IM movie. So I waited. Patiently. Watching the progression of CGI and costumes and feeling conflicted on what medium I wanted to see my my favorite superhero portrayed in. I'll admit, I'm a fan of CGI and had been hoping for an IM movie in the vein of the Final Fantasy or Appleseed style animations. So, when I herd that IM was going to be live-action, I was worried to say the least? ?I was shockingly and joyfully surprised to have my worries dashed against my doubt. At the risk of sounding like a mewling fanboy, I have to say this is the best superhero movie I have ever seen. Almost 25 years I have been waiting for an Iron Man movie. Now that it has arrived, I could not be happier. There where legions of nay-sayers when RDJ was announced as Tony Stark. I was not one of them. He was a great choice and he somehow managed to tap into my imagination and deliver the performance I was hoping for. The witty, over the top confident, sarcastic pimp that I prayed to Kirby for was delivered in full. John Favreau, an admitted fan or IM, did the license justice with out going over the top in character expression or over stuffing the plot. The acting complemented the writing in a manner not expected from most movies of this sort. Well, not by me anyway. The Three Headed Monster of Stan Winston, ILM and Sky Walker Sound kicked the living guts out of anything I have seen previous to this movie. Not once did I get that CGI lag or clunky costume feeling. They blended the live-action and CGI very well and I truly believed. A+ to Iron Man and all involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really understand the love for this film the its a movie that builds and builds for a horrible boring ending. Robert Downey Jr is born for the part arrogant and selfless as he is in real life. Qualities i don't see for someone to be a hero and he acts the same in every movie. The explanation that why he turned into a hero, is completely retarded for a guy who is a genius and people saying to him "hey your weapons are sold in the black market" with his logo and everything, he goes "I didn't know now Im going to be a hero". In the end this movie its over hyped for the fact that avengers is coming and nobody wants to say how bad it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie (only) for kids...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, not nearly as good as everybody says. In a nutshell, a very good movie, but suitable only for kids (but rated PG13...?)Why, one would ask? Well, for starters because of its moronic plot and one-dimensional characters. Granted, I am not a fan of superhero pictures (I think that they are much better printed in comic books, where they belong), but having said that, there are some outstanding movies based on comic books out there that are far, far better than Iron Man (the Batman and Spiderman franchises come to mind). Iron Man's story is so simple, so childish, I am certain even many kids will find it uninteresting.But then again, what do I know? The majority of the critics and an overwhelming part of the viewing public loves the movie! It's probably just me again, I just don't get it... As usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man (2008) is the best original Marvel Action superhero film of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man (2008) is American Marvel Superhero Action film and the best one in the trilogy. It is my favorite best superhero film that I love to death!!! The film has awesome Action sequences, it is Entertaining with full suspense, it is intense and it is fast paced. The film is not boring or lame it is brilliant and awesome. You have to put brain in this film. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man did a wonderful job portraying a comic book superhero. I love the Action sequence, the Drama, the genius and brilliance of Tony how he was so brilliant as to build those missiles for Military but get's caught by the terrorists and he is hold as hostage in the caves of Afghanistan, against his will he has to build more missiles for the terrorist, but he builds for himself a suit and he escapes from the caves, he returns home. Tony shut's down the factory and than he starts building an red yellow armor suit and he turns him self in to a vigilante to an red yellow armored suit ultimate superhero "Iron Man". He goes back in to Afghanistan and destroys all his weapons and he defends the weakest people. He also has a blue heart in the chest because the shrapnel hits him. He finds out he was betrayed by his dad's partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who turns him self into Iron Monger on the end there is an ultimate showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane did a wonderful job portraying a super villain in this film. Gwyneth Paltrow did a beautiful terrific performance as Pepper Potts, Tony's assistant and his love interest. I love this film and is one of my favorite Marvel Superhero action films. Everything in this comic book film is in here. The CGI Iron Man are believable and terrific I have ever seen. They aren't bad, they are good. Jon Favreau did a wonderful and amazing job as directing this film and playing Tony's bodyguard as Harold 'Happy' Hogan the same time, that was amazing!! This film is brilliant I love how it shows Tony's tests scenes when he is building the armor suit, I love how Shows that Tony isn't self selfish centered jerk, he is a good heart person and he wants to do the right thing. To defend an innocent people from his weapons that he build and that his weapons got in to the wrong hands. It is an awesome how he redeem himself and how he had a conscious what was he done when he was building those weapons and how many people had to die. The original film is very good :) One hell of a film. The chemistry between Tony and Pepper is great, this film has a heart. The acting was great and the story was really good! This was definitely one of the best origin stories out there and the ending was fantastic! The fight scenes between Iron Man and Iron Monger was weary intense and awesome kick ass battle between those two super villains and heroes. I went into this film with an open mind and what we got, we got an fantastic comic book film. Paramount pictures sends a strong message to film comic book fans. So Iron Man is one of those movies. Jon Favreau did an amazing job of bring Iron Man to life. He so took the comic and make it look like we just watch this first time. The writing work so well with the actors with their roles. There's a lot of development into the writing and made relate to the comics. But of course the main that people loved this film is Robert Downey Jr. He killed it as Tony Stark and Iron Man. I couldn't see any other actor to take the role. He brings so much development and emotions into Tony and make you relate to him real easy. The rest of the actors did very well, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Palltrow all did an amazing job with their roles.After surviving an unexpected attack in enemy territory, jet-setting industrialist Tony Stark builds a high-tech suit of armor and vows to protect the world as Iron Man. Straight from the pages of the legendary comic book, Iron Man is a hero who is built - not born - to be unlike any other.Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures.1 It is the first installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was directed by Jon Favreau, with a screenplay by Mark Fergus &amp; Hawk Ostby and Art Marcum &amp; Matt Holloway. It stars Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub and Gwyneth Paltrow. In Iron Man, Tony Stark, an industrialist and master engineer, builds a powered exoskeleton and becomes the technologically advanced superhero Iron Man.Iron Man is one the most surprise and best superhero films of all time with it's great story, amazing acting and great writing. If you people want a fun superhero film, then this is the one for you. Iron Man (2008) is my favorite best Marvel Action superhero alongside Batman, Captain America, Spider-Man, Thor and Superman.

		<shortDescription>A very fun and exciting superhero film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this is a very fun and exciting superhero film which served as a great introduction to the title character. Although there are some pacing problems, the script is generally strong and it is well directed by Jon Favreau. I have been planning to watch the MCU films and TV series in full from the beginning for the ages and I finally took the plunge today. The only entry in the franchise that I have previously seen is "Captain America: The First Avenger" when it was first released in 2011. First of all, I should say that I have never really been terribly interested in Marvel and my knowledge of its characters comes almost exclusively through adaptations and by osmosis. I say "almost" since I think that I have read three Marvel comics in my life. As an indication of my Marvel ignorance, I had never even heard of their version of Thor or the Guardians of the Galaxy before their films were released. As such, I will be reviewing these films on their own merits since that it is all I can do, really.Robert Downey, Jr. gives a wonderful performance as Tony Stark, a playboy genius industrialist whose hugely successful company has made weapons for the US government for decades. He is dismissive of any suggestion that his work is in any way immoral. However, after being severely wounded by one of his own weapons and escaping from the clutches of an Afghani terrorist group called the Ten Rings, he sees things from a different perspective and announces that Stark Industries will no longer manufacture weapons. Over the course of the film, Tony goes from being a self-obsessed businessman primarily concerned with drinking and gambling to a true hero of the old mould. However, the characterisation is so good that this transition seems entirely realistic, even with all the sci-fi trappings. I think that Tony was always a very good man. He just needed his eyes to be opened to the problems of the world around him and what he could do to fix them. He finally realised that creating weapons of mass destruction was not the way to solve said problems. Downey is never less than entirely convincing as Tony, who manages to keep his composure when others would be in a state of panic and has a sardonic remark for most situations. I love quirky, self-deprecating, conflicted characters and he is a great example of that.Gwyneth Paltrow is a good actress but she has certainly been better in other films where she had more interesting characters. Pepper Potts is in the film to be Stark's love interest and that's about it. She doesn't have many characteristics beyond the fact that she loves him and her major contribution to the plot is the requisite, though very entertaining, damsel in distress scenes. She is not a very strong character, I'm afraid, which is a shame as she is the only female character who appears in more than a few scenes. Theirs is also a pretty tepid romance. Jeff Bridges is excellent as Obadiah Stane, bringing his great talent to bear as the Stark Industries manager. While much of Stane's storyline was admittedly predictable, it was handled extremely well and there is a terrific sense of tension between Downey and Bridges for most of the film. Terrence Howard is great as Tony's best friend and military liaison Colonel James Rhodes and it is a shame that he did not return for any of the sequels. Shaun Toub gives one of the best performances in the film as Stark's fellow captive Yinsen - I thought that the character would be a villain when he was introduced but he turns out to be one of the most honest, decent characters in the film - while Farah Tahir is suitably creepy as the Ten Rings' leader Raza. As the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Paul Bettany has some great lines and his wry wit is a nice complement to Stark's. I loved the Stan Lee and Samuel L. Jackson cameos. Lee is such a legend that I have great affection for him even though I don't read Marvel Comics! The strongest scenes in the film are the ones in which Tony is held captive by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan and creates a rudimentary Iron Man suit out of scrap. I loved these scenes both because they were the perfect illustration of Tony's intelligence and resourcefulness and because Tony and Yinsen worked so well together. Speaking of Afghanistan, I really liked the manner in which the film handled the War on Terror. Its exploration of the morality of Tony's weapon systems was also very good. On the negative side, the film has some pretty serious pacing issues which last from Tony's rescue until his return to Afghanistan as Iron Man, which is about half an hour. Admittedly, these scenes were necessary for later on in the film but they were not terribly good or interesting. I often found myself bored during them, if I'm honest. However, the film rollicks along at a great pace from then until the end of the film. The battle scenes are hugely impressive, "edge of your seat" stuff, which is exactly what I want from a superhero film.Overall, this is an extremely good film which could have been an excellent one if it had not been for the aforementioned problems. I look forward to watching the rest of the films in the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man (2008): Dir: Jon Favreau / Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Shaun Toub: Explosive action adventure about the unstoppable. Tony Stark is a genius weapons manufacturer whom is kidnapped in Afghanistan during a missile demonstration. In captivity he builds a suit of armor that would become his Iron Man persona. Director Jon Favreau establishes a plot that flows without pause. Favreau previously sprung success with the Christmas comedy Elf. Robert Downey Jr. plays off the sarcasm of Stark. He is wealthy yet intelligent as he must survive several months of captivity as well as confront a corrupt mind that was formerly on par with himself. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his loyal assistant who rises above being a standard damsel. She is instrumental in his recovery as well as becoming a safe source for his ideas. Jeff Bridges plays the villain whom uses Stark's weapons against him. They were friends at first until he becomes corrupt and musters into something of opposite proportions to Stark. Only Terrence Howard seems cardboard in his standard military role and friend that hardly elevates beyond routine. Shaun Toub plays a captive of Stark's but the character is apparently changed from his comic book identity. Tremendous special effects using Iron Man's initiation as a weapon as a statement regarding arms forces. Score: 9 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Weapon mogul Tony Stark is thrown off his ivory tower when he gets badly injured while kidnapped by a terrorist group and MacGyvers his way to health, freedom and a career in superheroics. Uh, it's Iron Man. Why should we care? Well, mostly because this movie takes a second banana (or, if you prefer, neglected) Marvel character, brings it to the spotlight... and the result is greatness! Iron Man has never been so popular as, let's say, Spider-Man or Wolverine... till now. The reason is, of course, casting. Simply put, Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man. Period. Downey brings a quirkiness to the character that exudes humanity. Stark is egotistical, full of defects but decent enough to care about what really matters. When the aforementioned terrorists go genocidal on a small village, he rises to the occasion and rescues the villagers. Of course there's a villain, in this case it is the Dude himself, Jeff Bridges, but we do not care much, because in this movie the main villain is Tony Stark. And the hero, too. Tony Stark has to best himself to become a real hero. That is why his final statement is so important. When he declares to the world, 'I am Iron Man', we get to know who finally won.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 2008, there were already a bunch of Marvel movies on the market, all presented as a big mixed cluster of varying quality and quantity. After pulling itself together as its own studio, Marvel kicked off Phase 1 of its new movie-making universe with Iron Man.From start to finish, this is one cool film. It is very sharply-made, with a very slick and high-quality look and feel. It's evenly-paced, with equal parts color, comedy, and action. And when the action hits, it is really cool stuff, without going too far overboard. Among Iron Man's heroics, my favorite scene shows him rocketing to the other side of the world, to use his high-tech suit to beat up violent extremists to protect the innocent (blowing up a tank in the process, before being pursued by American jets in a great high-speed air chase scene). The film's climax features an all-out fight between two high-powered suits, during which there's plenty of mass destruction. Even when there aren't guns and rockets going off, the film is still a blast with its colorful inter-character exchanges, funny suit-testing scenes, tense inter-corporate conspiracies.The story this film tells is a great one. The origins of Iron Man is inherently compelling, as it takes a greedy, narcissistic arms dealer and flips him on his head to turn him into a hero. The film does so by plunging the character into the heart of the very problems he's created (in a war-town part of the world nonetheless). Once Tony Stark dedicates himself to being Iron Man, the conflict shifts to him confronting everybody else around him. Through all the struggles he endures, the film lays out rich characterization and interesting thematic material worth exploring.This film looks splendid, with quality photography and editing. Acting is quite spot-on: Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as the title character, and he remains iconic through every other Marvel project he's in from here on out. Gweneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Shaun Toub, and everybody else is great to watch as well. Writing is pretty good and sharp. This production uses spectacular-looking sets, props, and costumes. Most special effects hold up well, and are awesome to behold. Ramin Djawadi's music score is pretty cool too.The first Iron Man film has everything you can ask for in a superhero film: thrilling action, amusing humor, a decent story, and characters we can care about. Even after having numerous other Marvel films come out since, this is still the biggest must-see of the lot.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)</fullReview>

(Sort of) The characters are very fun and funny, and have a lot of life to them. And the acting is top notch with RDJ as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Terrence Howard as Rhody, and Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane. Something that makes this movie just outstanding is the action. The visuals in this movie are pretty good and the Iron Man suit looks amazing. Then the end credit scene booted up the franchise.THE BADNot much, but I think that they should have explained a little more about how Obadiah was able to fly the clunky Iron Man suit without any problems. But that's it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great comic book film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man was the first film from Marvel to be in what is now known as the Cinematic Universe and as such, it was a great way to introduce things. By now we all know what the plot of the film is but to refresh your memory, the movie is about Stark creating his own suite of armour after being held captive in an Afghan cave to fight against evil. That's pretty much all you need to know about Iron Man, it's not a complicated plot but it's good enough for a movie like this because you don't need an award winning story. Iron Man is one of the best comic books film of all time and I think it even stands alongside Spider-Man 2, it may not pack as much of a punch but it's right up there. The movie has great characters and a strong if simple plot that manages to be both fun and serious at the same time, it balances everything perfectly. It's been almost ten years since this originally came out and it still manages to hold up, even after the world of comic book films have changed and are finally being taken seriously. Marvel struck gold here because Iron Man managed to be both a great comic book film and just a great summer blockbuster in general and it's the sole reason why we have the Cinematic Universe. Jon Favreau's direction with the film is one that works and never becomes a bit too much as in some other films in the action genre, I'm looking at you Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen. Iron Man is Favreau's strongest and best film to date, it captures everything in a comic film but yet still manages to have heart and great character development which is hard to come across in some of these films. Iron Man's action sequences are directed with easy and proves that you don't need shaky cam to make an action sequence work, it's never hard to watch and the action sequences always manage to be fun. Had Iron Man been directed by somebody else then we may not have gotten a great comic book film but instead something that just okay at best, Favreau was the best director that Marvel could've gotten for a project like this. I do have some minor gripes with the film though, they're only minor but I still need to address them in this review. While I said that the movie has great characters, there are still a few characters that are underdeveloped and or serve no purpose to the film other than to pass time. The character of Coulson could've used some more development other than to serve as somebody working for shield and to get Stark to be a part of the team, I like the character but he is criminally underused here. The character of Yinsen is also underdeveloped and unfortunately serves no real purpose to the film other than to help Stark, though Star could've had easily done everything himself. Iron Man is a great comic book film that manages to avoid all the clichés that you come to think of in these films. 4.3/5 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The correct way to build a universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone remember the days when Marvel studios wasn't a mammoth technical market and didn't feature Norse gods and talking raccoons? I figured that because i am finally going to see my most anticipated film "Avengers Age of Ultron" tonight i would revisit the very start of the Marvel cinematic Universe and get to know Tony Stark all over again. This film really stood out to me back in 2008 as one of the best films i'd seen, not just in the superhero genre but in general. To this day the film still stands out to me as the best standalone film and the perfect way to start the universe we have all grown to love. Iron Man was very much more grounded in reality, i mean sure none of the things that Stark creates and uses can be replicated, but at the time going from this to Thor seemed like it wasn't possible. Oh, how times change.The plot follows Tony Stark, who as you all know by now is played with absolute perfection and flawlessness (is that a word) by the very talented Robert Downey Jr. He is given an electromagnet to prevent shrapnel from entering his heart and killing him from what was an explosion by his own company's weapon. Instead of building a missile that terrorists demand from him Tony builds an arc reactor and a suit of armour that he uses to get his own back. This causes Stark to order all weapons stop being made and he develops a high-tech suit to use and becomes the hero we all love, Iron Man. Jeff Bridges is also very good and uses an accent that isn't Texan cowboy with throat cancer as Obadiah Stane (Iron Monger) who has his own plans for Stark Industries and the final showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger gives us what is one of the most spectacular from phase one. Marvel has never had a strong point for villains, Ronan from Guardians of the Galaxy is a prime example. But when they get a villain right they get it very right! (Think Loki) and Obadiah Stane in this movie is one of the best the MCU has to offer.Watching Gwyneth Paltrow in this movie felt weird too. She was very much just Tony's assistant and acted a lot differently to the way she does in say, Iron Man 3. This is some really good development for her character and she of course does a great job as Pepper Potts. We also have Terrence Howard as James Rhodes which looking at it now felt out of place since we have all gotten used to Don Cheadele. This isn't to say he did a bad job, in fact he did a very good job but it would be nice to know why he didn't appear in any subsequent films after this. A particular scene featured Rhodes looking at Tony's Mark II suit (War Machine prototype) and saying "next time, baby". Sorry Terrence, not next time.In the end Iron Man is absolutely the best way to kick off a universe of characters and he will always be the Avenger that sticks with me as a result of this movie. Downey Jr. Made the character his very own and i cannot imagine another actor taking his place. Robert is Iron Man and is the best casting since Hugh Jackman as WolverineI give Iron Man a perfect rating as it is a film that i have grown to love more since i first saw it and it will be a part of my collection until the very end. Definitely check it out if you haven't already. Plus we got our first scenes with Coulson and our first post-credits scene which is still the best one today. All this and more, it not only stands as one of my favourite superhero movies but one of the best of all time. I will be reviewing Tony Stark's latest adventure with Avengers Age of Ultron tonight so stay tuned for that! And yes.. i am so excited that if i wait any longer i will self destruct.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Start of a brilliant and amazing franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Iron Man came out in 2008, I didn't know much about the character except that he was a Marvel comic book character created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. After watching the movie, I fell in love with Iron Man. He became one of my favorite comic book superheros along with Batman and the X-Men. The movie is the reason why I started collecting comic books and graphic novels. Iron Man 1 is an awesome start to what has become an amazing and well-loved franchise, the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Iron Man is a modern take on the origin story of Tony Stark and how he became Iron Man. Stark is the CEO of Stark Industries, a company that creates weapons which he inherited from his father, Howard Stark. Tony is a self-describe "genius, playboy, billionaire, philanthropist." While in Afghanistan, he is captured by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings who want him to build weapons for them to use. With the help of fellow prisoner, Yinsen, Stark creates a primitive suit of armor with some weapons and escapes. Because of his escape, Tony has a chance of heart and sets out to become a new hero called Iron Man.The movie does a brilliant job of keeping the audience entertained. It has a great cast. Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect choice to play Tony Stark/Iron Man. He does such a good job that it's hard to separate the character from the actor. Iron Man has a great supporting cast like Jeff Bridges, Gwenyth Paltrow, and Terrance Howard. The movie has a great soundtrack, story-line, and special effects.Iron Man is one of the best superhero movies that I've seen in years. Everything about this movie is brilliant. It never gets old over time. Iron Man is starts the MCU with a bang. Definitely a comic book movie that everyone should watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite superhero films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being captured by terrorists, billionaire Tony Stark creates a high tech suit of armor to escape and return home. Once home, he decides to make another suit, but more improved and uses it to fight terrorists and other evil.As I've said on a previous review, I've never read the DC or Marvel comics; I've only seen some of the movies and shows. When I first saw this, I was unaware that there were going to be more films after this and how they would lead up to "The Avengers". Either way, I was impressed.The acting was excellent; I'm pretty sure Robert Downey Jr. was the perfect choice for Tony Stark and of course Gwyneth Peltrow, Terrence Howard, and Jeff Bridges were good for their roles. This was, of course, the first appearances of Agent Coulson and Nick Fury and I like them both. I also like Jarvis (Tony's A.I.) I was surprised to hear that some of the dialogue was actually improvised and not scripted; they did well with that. The special effects were fantastic, especially with the suits and explosions. I loved it when Tony is testing his flight suit and he keeps on blasting himself into a wall; pretty funny. Also he crashing through the roof and being sprayed by his fire extinguisher was humorous. He shooting a rocket at a tank and just walks away as it explodes was quite amusing.I enjoyed the action scenes, such as Tony escaping his captors, Tony attacking the Ten Rings in his new suit, and of course the final battle with Obadiah. There were a few parts that I thought were kind of slow. Not boring, just kind of slow. I enjoyed the last scene: "The truth is???..I am Iron Man." And then everybody goes crazy."Iron Man" is probably one of the best superhero movies ever. It was a good way start off the "Marvel Cinematic Universe" and one of my favorite superhero films. I give it an A-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for a First Installment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most superhero movies turn into franchises, unless you're talking about the two different Hulk movies, and the first of the franchise usually mildly entertains and provides a formulaic origin story. Iron Man is an exception - it is wildly entertaining.I think Robert Downey Jr. nails his role as Tony Stark. So he can get an Oscar nomination for Tropic Thunder but not for this? Johnny Depp can be nominated for Pirates but RDJ can't be nominated for Iron Man? Robert Downey Jr successfully brings Tony Stark to life in this live-action film, showing a big ego along with insecurities such as his on and off feelings for Pepper and his realization that he must sometimes depend on the help of others.There are plenty of humorous parts in the film as well, a lot of them revolving around Tony, but who can't laugh at such a great portrayal of a jackass? The funniest part for me had to be when a scientist apologizes for not being Tony Stark.Towards the conclusion of the movie some aspects do not add up, especially involving Obediah. He has Tony's suit recreated and just happens to know how to run it properly on his first go? Tony is directly over the blast Pepper starts in order to finish off Obediah, and is hardly affected? The third act is everything when it comes to an action film, and it is sad to see some movies take shortcuts to develop a good third act instead of a great one. However, the third act is redeemed so to speak with the iconic ending of Tony Stark admitting he is Iron Man.Fun first installment with an okay third act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvel Studios Never Looked Back After this Tremendous Artistic and Commercial Success. It's Probably No Surprise that the Comic Book Company Knew Just What To Do with Their Own Creations. Although, Nothing in the Movie Universe is a Certain Thing, the Studio Certainly Worked Wonders with This, One of Their Second String Characters.The Casting is Brilliant with Robert Downey Jr's. Perfect Embodiment of Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and the Rest Contributing to the Fun. The Director, Jon Favreau, was a Risk. Hardly Known for Big-Budget Action Movies, He Captures the Spirit of the Comics and Turned in an Absolutely Brilliant Film from Top to Bottom.Fans of the Silver-Age Comics will No Doubt be Impressed. When Iron Man First Appeared in "Tales of Suspense" #39, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were in the Embryonic Stages of Reinventing Comics and the Marvel Super Hero Line was Being Tested and No One At the Time (except maybe the Fans) had a Clue What They Were Witnessing. In the Origin of Iron Man and for a While, the Character was this Hulky, Bulky, Tank-Like Hero, in a Clunky Iron Suit. Not the Sleek Hot Rod Red Iron Man to Come Later. In the Film, this Likeness can be Seen in the Opening where Tony Stark Creates the Character "in a cave with a box of scraps", as Obadiah Stane Says. This is a Spot-On Recreation from the Comics Origin Issues and it is a Great Insider's Inspiration and a Fine Tribute to the Movie's Paper Origins.This is Just One of the Charming Things About Iron Man, The Movie. The Thing is Full of Wonder and Wit. A Great Comic Book Movie. One of the Best. Nuff Said.Note...Thanks Jack Kirby wherever you are. Thanks so much for your Art and your ability to bring so much joy to the world. You are the best and truly "The King of Comics".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's second golden age begins here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having never read the Iron Man comics as a kid and having never seen this film when it first came out in '08, I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch it. Would it be dark and complex, overly campy or a fun action romp? Well, I can say Iron Man totally blew me away from its action and visual effects to its acting and writing. After watching this, it's hard to imagine what the MCU would have been without this movie.We start off in the deserts of Afghanistan where a military convoy is escorting millionaire playboy Tony Stark to show off his new "Jericho" missile. The convoy is then attacked and Tony is significantly wounded by one of his own weapons. Tony is then captured and imprisoned by a terrorist organization called the Ten Rings. Stark discovers that an electromagnet has been embedded into his chest to prevent shrapnel from reaching his heart and killing him. The Ten Rings Leader Raza then offers Tony his freedom in return for Tony building a Jericho missile for the group, but Stark has no intention of keeping his word. With the help of fellow inmate, Yinsen, Tony builds an arc reactor to charge the electromagnet and a suit of armor. Following his escape from the cave and returning home, Stark shows up at a press meeting and announces that his company will no longer make weapons after what he witnessed earlier in the film. He also builds an enhanced version of the suit plus a new arc reactor. Now, Tony must fight his inner demons as well as putting his talents to making the world better.While superhero films have become an everyday factor in the summer blockbuster season, one question always comes up: how does one make a comic book film stand out in the middle of so much superhero completion while remaining faithful to the comics? It seems John Favreau has that covered. Right from the opening chords of "Back in Black" it becomes obvious that Iron Man is a different kind of superhero movie. Rather than go the Christopher Nolan route by making the movie as darker and grittier than its source material ever needed to be, Favreau isn't afraid to welcome a much needed sense of fun without diverting into outright silliness. In the process, Iron Man essays an outstanding balance between welcoming every entertaining element while preserving the seriousness and difficulty of the origin story and the characters. Also by modernizing Tony's backstory from Vietnam to Afghanistan, the movie adds a touch of political tragedy, making a few tongue in cheek remarks about the US military in the process.The script is one of the things that really sell this film, with a string of intelligently written lines, a far cry from some of the more overused Hollywood writing that could've been thought by your ordinary six year old. Robert Altman's influence on the script leads to several humorous ad-libbing on top of the written material.Favreau doesn't hold back when it comes to the action and the visual effects, resulting in some enthralling action set pieces such as a fight in an Afghan village and a final show down between Iron Man and Iron Monger, not to mention some truly edgy scenes as well as the adrenaline pumping scene of Stark testing his Mark 1 armor during his escape. The special effects are flawless and are carried out perfectly without overwhelming the movie's overall story. Iron Man's armor looks stunning, a clinking mass of machinery that come together with a heart beating exterior. The same can also be said for the musical score which delivers some aptly heroic themes.Of course, this movie wouldn't be half the movie it is without its cast and what a cast: Gwyneth Paltrow is surprisingly believable as Pepper Potts, her charm and cool comebacks easily being an excellent foil to Tony's livewire performance and brings some serious-minded glow of sexual tightness and interaction between her and Tony. Jeff Bridges molds his normal laid-back look into a wickedly conniving businessperson hiding his self-centered dealings under a façade of decency and while it was interesting to see Bridges play a villain, he did a great job, Terrence Howard provides an appropriately brisk aroma of self-respect as Tony's friend, James Rhodes, enhancing his performance with just the perfect amount of deadpan delivery, but the real star here is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. I can't praise his performance enough as he is the key element to making Iron Man stand out amongst other comic book films. Easily the best performance in his career, Downey fluently makes every single inch of Tony his own and puts an unconventional spin on the character through his wisecracking, smart mouthed dynamism while still staying true to Stark's character, even making the shift from an arrogant playboy to a humanitarian wearing an iron suit possible through his personality and his shining, zealous strength. There are some obvious parallels between Tony and RDJ's personal lives when it comes to the excess and women. Downey plays a bit of a double-faced role here as Stark and Iron Man, on one hand being his lavish self whose duty is the maintenance of his father's company vs his own mission to become a better person. The dialog given to Robert in every scene is full of one-liners finished in quick time. To say that RDJ was born to play this role is an understatement; he is and will always be Iron Man. Even Samuel Jackson has a brief appearance as S.H.I.E.L.D agent, Nick Fury who sets the scene for later events in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Iron Man is a perfect superhero movie. I really don't have any issues with it, it just rocks all around. So do yourselves a favor and give this film a watch, you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lot's of action, comedy and really cool effects. Iron Man can keep the whole family entertained with action for the parents, a superhero for the kids and an action packed adventure with a superhero for the adults who still think they're kids. With a refreshingly underused plot Iron Man brings something new to the movie table and Robert Downey Jr's cocky portrayal of Iron Man keeps you laughing throughout. Some may be scrutinising this film if they know the Iron Man story well but I am not familiar with them and find it a 10. These people may rate it a little less but if you love explosions, bust ups and superheroes I don't see how you're experience could go much differently to mine :DFor me the best part about Iron Man is the fact he becomes a superhero almost by accident and the film deals with issues the world faces a lot like terrorism and evil. Potts is your typical love interest of a superhero and may seem a little cheesy at times but Gwyneth Paltrow works so well with RDJ that it slips your mind most of the time anyway. Overall Iron Man is a fantastic film that I will watch over and over again :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the first 'Iron Man' again recently, I can't believe how far the MCU has strayed from this. The one that started it all, and it is hard to believe it takes place in the same universe as other Marvel movies - such as Guardians of The Galaxy.Although 'Iron Man' definitely has its fantastic elements, it is all grounded into a deep level of realness. And in keeping it real lies the refreshing bit. The realness makes the funny more funny, the amazing more amazing, and the emotional more emotional. And due to how much the movie is grounded in reality, you'll believe a man can fly.Arms-manufacturer Tony Stark is captured by terrorists, who appear to own several of his creations. After his escape, Stark turns a new leaf, shutting down the weapons department of his company. Instead of building weapons of destruction, he becomes a vigilant knight in shiny armor (with lasers and repulsors).All in all, it is a very good origins story. The acting by Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Palthrow, Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges is outstanding - the witty dialogue alone makes for a good movie.Not only is 'Iron Man' the start of an Iron Man franchise, it is also the birth of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie brings up a lot of key elements for the later to appear Avengers movie: Enter Iron Man. Enter the Arc Reactor. Enter Agent Coulson. Enter S.H.I.E.L.D. And do stay and watch until the end of the credits, for something that created massive nerd-gasms back in the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit, I was expecting this to be dreadful but I was wrong, its amazingly very good. The usual obvious origins story line of course with everything you tend to expect when a super heroic legend begins. The first thing that hit me was the suit, its sex on a stick for sure! it looks so so damn cool. The way it attaches itself to Downey and locks in place, the HUD display in the helmet, the weapons on the arm sections, its fantastic, finally there's a competitor to the Stormtrooper armour.This is what I wanna see for the next Robocop, but with a more violent tone of course. This movie shows what can be done if done right, how 'Transformers' could have looked, its very impressive indeed. Not only are the actual Iron Man suits extremely well made for real in certain sequences, but the CGI is top notch in other outlandish sequences. I'm no fan of CGI I won't deny but even this shocked me, I fully expected this film to look bad obvious plastic and fake, but bugger me if the CGI wasn't fudging amazing! Best damn CGI I've seen in ages, I loved the new shiny looking suit effects but I loved the battered scratched used CGI effects even more. It could of been so easy to keep everything looking nice sparkly and new, but like Star Wars the used universe works wonders and a beaten up Iron Man suit looks brilliant.The first action scene where Stark gets back at the terrorists that captured him is excellent, really action packed and gets you right into the action and wanting more. You really get behind Stark as he powers the terrorists through walls and takes them out with tiny missiles, superb intro for the suit with an awesome and highly grounded action sequence (wouldn't blame you for thinking any action was gonna be hokey).The finale battle with bridges character is a little silly and kinda loses that realistic feel, really goes into the comicbook realms and almost looks a bit like 'Transformers' at times *shudders!*. Its still handled well and of course looks excellent, much better than Bay's robot film as you can actually make out what's going on. Plus its not too over the top, it just about remains reasonably sensible...well as sensible as a comicbook action flick goes anyway.The cast is also spot on for once, Downey is great as Stark, his humour is dry witty sarcastic and does raise a giggle for the older audience members. Bridges does look powerful and evil as the bald villain, he has that deep thick voice which serves him well, didn't see quite enough of him being evil here. Paltrow was also OK, a little annoying with her screams all the time but I guess that's what heroines do in these type of films.There were a few bits I didn't get on with too well, when he's captured by the terrorists he makes his initial suit very quickly, a little too quickly maybe. At the end he refers to himself as Iron Man but this is never mentioned throughout, it just pops up at the end which is weird. Why does he tell the world he is Iron Man at the end? did he make up the name there and then? and why does he show the injury on his chest with a circular glow? surely that's just asking for trouble. Maybe these are things you know if your a fanboy. I would like to ask for no more bloody Stan Lee cameos, Jesus!...yes you made up the characters, we get it, get of your high horse already.Anyway, yes this was a great fun film for everyone to enjoy. Still very surprised it turned out so well and with such good looking CGI! Would have laid money on this being a childish poor looking mess. For once I am looking forward to a sequel.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very super, but quite heroic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Iron Man' is the surprise superhero hit from Marvel Studios which charts the tale of billionaire weapons manufacturer, Tony Stark, to the flying metal superhero 'Iron Man.' It seemed that, despite its impressive budget, no one quite imagined this lesser (when compared with the more famous ? and bankable ? superheroes such as Spiderman, Batman and Superman) hero to become quite as bigger box office draw as it turned out. And it definitely isn't 'wall-to-wall action' which drew the crowds in.To be honest, there isn't an awful lot of 'Iron Man' in Iron Man the movie. Our hero, Tony Stark (expertly played by Robert Downey Jr) only gets inside his costume about three times in a two hour movie. Therefore, don't expect a load of 'Michael Bay-style' explosions every few minutes.You have to get the 'origins' side of Iron Man out of the way here, showing how he transgresses from playboy billionaire to concerned citizen, prepared to put his life on the limb to save the world. So a lot of the story is taken up with HOW he becomes the titular character.However, don't let any lack of action fool you into thinking this isn't going to be one hell of a ride. Somehow, everything just works and the two hours fly by faster than Iron Man outrunning some jet fighters.You don't have to love comic books or superheroes to appreciate that this is a really fun film. It's nowhere near as dark as Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and sticks to its upbeat and colourful comic book roots. It's a great popcorn film for all the family and even having Gwyneth Paltrow in it doesn't detract from the fun element *miaow! http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

Barely alive and escaping from terrorist group is not one could think about it, what's more building an armor suit to fly from the terrorist hideout and to be saved once more.In Marvel Comics, Tony Stark was also saved by Dr. Yinsen but set during the Vietnam War instead in Afghanistan (prior to Afghan war-torn).There are many changes in comparison with the comics and movie. Movie tries to make things as interesting as possible for the new and unknown audience.Comic geeks like myself would have to conclude that this is the Iron Man we all knew but in the different era and technology.But I'm pretty much amazed how Favreau managed to make the suit alive.</fullReview>

Truthfully, I believe if Robert Downey, Jr. had not done the marvel-ous job he did portraying the "genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist," then we would not even be talking about a MCU.Downey's brilliance is in his one-liners, those quips he delivers so perfectly they stick in your head for days afterward. You know what I'm talking about, like when he first dons the original Iron Man armor and absorbs all that AK fire, then turns around and says, "my turn".Or, the ultimate one-liner, the one that really sold the movie and made everyone like Black Sabbath again, "I am Iron Man".One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Tony gets Pepper's small hands to help him switch out mini-Arc Reactors. When she yanks that copper ring out, I almost fell off the couch laughing.And, yeah, OK, we've got to suspend disbelief for the scene to work, but so what? This is a superhero movie, it's all about suspending disbelief.Speaking of Pepper Potts, this movie did more for female supporting actresses than anything I can remember in a long time. She's more than just a damsel in distress. Not only does she help Tony Stark do everything (including remember his Social Security Number)--which, incidentally, is nearly identical to the relationship I have with my own wife (sans the whole billionaire playboy thing)--but she plays a major role in this movie. She becomes even more important as the Iron Man trilogy goes on, but we see shades of that in this first movie, where she even helps Iron Man defeat the Iron Monger at the end. So, yeah, I say, give Pepper her own movie! I'd watch it.My other favorite scene from Iron Man is when he goes back to Afghanistan to blow up all of the Stark Industries weapons. First off, I'd like to point out how much better the Tony Stark in Afghanistan origin story is than Tony Stark in Vietnam or Tony Stark in the Gulf. The creators of this movie took Stan Lee's original idea of having Iron Man be the anti-communist and updated it to make him the anti-terrorist. Secondly, it's always fun watching the movie and telling people, "hey, Bagram Air Field, that's where I was for 6 months" and "yeah, Konar Province is a real place, and it's really bad".But, yeah, how badass is it when Iron Man shoots his little missile and then turns around, with the tank blowing up behind him? Hard core.One thing my wife spotted in Iron Man that I completely missed was the Ten Rings flag.This is the same terrorist organization that the "Mandarin" would go on to "lead" in Iron Man 3. I can't believe I didn't notice this before! By calling this organization the "Ten Rings", Marvel was setting up the villain for the third film way back in 2008 when the first one came out. Just another example of why I love the MCU and Marvel's Master Plan.I love how pretty much every movie in the MCU culminates in a Final Battle. Iron Man started this trend, and I love it! In Iron Man we get two giant robots fighting on the streets--how awesome is that! The Iron Monger hits Tony with a motorcycle, smashes him through a bus, and flies him into inner-space, all while taunting him in that great Jeff Bridges Evil TRON Supervillain voice. And it ends with anti-damsel Pepper blowing up the Arc Reactor with a Big Badda Boom that can be seen from space.Finally, we get to the Deleted/Extended Scenes, which I watched for the first time on this viewing of Iron Man. Unlike most movies' deleted scenes, I was actually glad they cut almost all of what they did. If I had seen those Airmen doing their Parade Deck Rifle Drill in the original movie, it probably would've made me hate the thing. The one Deleted Scene they probably should've kept showed Obadiah Stane actually falling into the Arc Reactor before Pepper blew it up. They left him getting blowed up implied in the original movie, which is always dangerous because it leaves things open for one of those comicbook revivals they like to do.Overall, Iron Man was a fantastic movie, one that kicked the whole MCU off. I'd say it, with Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance, is one of the most important superhero movies ever made. Overall, I'd give it a 9 out of 10 stars.Oh yeah, we can't forget the obligatory Stan Lee cameo! In Iron Man, he appears as none other than the original Playboy, Hugh Hefner</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man and the character of Tony Stark redefines coolness in every way. You just want to be him. The visuals and the soundtrack is amazing.The actor wears a suit that makes him invincible - this is the kind of character all man want to be - kick-ass suit like a second skin, no shame, 110% confidence, billions on the bank and a brain Einstein would envy.What else you need?The script is ambitious and wise enough to make you beg for the second episode.Full on 10 stars from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RDJ is Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a hard playing billionaire genius. He is captured in Afghanistan after demonstrating his newest weapon. He is forced to create new weapons for his captor. Instead he makes an armored suit to escape. He also makes an arc reactor to keep his heart going and shrapnel from killing him. Once back in the States, he moves his company to concentrate on arc reactor technology and stop weapons manufacturing.This is all RDJ. He and he alone makes Iron Man work. It's doubtful if anybody could have done it better. It's certain that he's made it next to impossible to replace him. Director Jon Favreau has built around him the dazzling array of tech fun, and Gwyneth Paltrow as his Girl Friday. It is RDJ's fast talking, quick wit, and personal history that makes him the perfect Tony Stark. Great character, fun movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say that hasn't already been said? RDJ nailed it in a hilarious portrayal of Iron Man. Gwenyth Paltrow was great (and great-looking) as Pepper, and Jeff Bridges played a pretty good villain. The first time I saw this movie I was shocked at how he turned from Tony's mentor to nemesis without even thinking about it.Also, Favreau did an excellent job with the story, which I won't spoil here. Would have been nice to see more of Tony's past, but they left that for future films. Still the best Iron Man movie; Marvel could not have started off their Cinematic World in a better way.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well here we start, I always was a fan of Marvel so when "Iron Man" came out in cinemas I went and saw it. I think "Iron Man" is the best of movie of this trilogy maybe because was the first and it starts this trilogy. I also think that the two others which followed has lost this kind of magic that had the first one.Robert Downey Jr. made on of his best interpretations in this movie played as Iron Man and Tony Stark. I think the selection of him was the point of culmination together with the visual effects of the movie and the plot. Finally I want to tell you that Marvel has to show us more than this and we have to expect more from them. Future will show us, we need to be patient for it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Action movie full of Special Effect. Keep It Up Marvel !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This amazing and mostly a kind of realistic movie is set by the plot in the way to keep you involved from beginning to the end. The most fascinating part that blew my mind off was the extraordinary special-effect. Don't be uncertain, this Iron Man is an entirely wonderful movie. I won't write any spoilers ti its reviews and would urge to watch this movie possibly if you still haven't watched it. Marvel must have made these types of movies long ago.As the name of Robert Downey is not amongst the biggest names in the Hollywood, he still played his role flawlessly and intimidated me how he represented Iron Man so greatly. Also the humor worked well in this movie. The script is perfect and it carries the wonderful cast.I was largely impressed by the CGI. They were magnificent and are not disturbing to make you miss great scenes of this movie. It is not possible to forget that this is an Action movie, so it's not that just the stars have to be congratulated; each individual effect was also fairly wonderful. The fighter jet scenes seemed very lame in Iron Man's trailer, but when I watched the full movie, it satisfied my expectations.This amazing full of special-effects Iron Man film has to offer you a thrilling ride particularly when it comes to the battle part. And no doubt, the credit for uplifting its ranking goes to Robert Downey who once an unknown character now a familiar personality. I like the technology of Iron Man which has the quality to avoid targeting people.The second half is full of pure action. The well-written script and enough twist-scenes are well delivered to keep you tighten with your seat till the end. This remarkable movie pleased everybody succeeded greatly. The whole 2.5 hours playing of this movie offers you latest action hero for the CGA sated appreciation. The best use of the amazing leather jackets has been made in this movie, especially by Robert Downy as Tony Stark in this movie. Until now, I was wondering if I could find one of those hangar scene leather jackets outside the Stark industry. Finally, I have found the solution to all my Hollywood style leather jackets needs. Desert leather is the wonderful online website that offers all Hollywood celebrity style genuine leather jackets at an attractive price with free shipping all across the USA. They are the exact replica of the leather jackets worn by the famous celebrities like the one in this super-hit Iron Man.Tony Stark also made the weapons for war, so when he goes to Afghanistan, he introduced a new missile for the terrorists. He finally got to know that the weapons were not in the right hands so he created metal suit and became Iron Man and shut down the Stark Industry when he saw all the violence. Ultimately Iron Man set the record of success for the comic book movies and finally went beyond this summer season. In its wrap up, I would say that Iron Man will make publicity and my outlook is great as a comic book reader.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, simply beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This stands in my personal ratings as one of the best superhero movies of all time, if not as one of the best movies of all time. It's that good.What makes the movie stand out from its brethren is, first of all, the sheer quality. Everything in this film feels just right. The character of Tony Stark is dead on. I believe that even the most hardcore Marvel nerd would agree that Robert Downey Jr. was perfectly cast for this role. He epitomizes the character beautifully, from the raw charisma to the brilliance of mind to the witty comebacks to the vulnerability of alcoholism. The movie would work just because of him (which the sequels will show), but luckily we get even more for our money. We get special effects that defied all of our expectations, we get a fetching origins story, we get Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Cane (one of his best recent roles) and Gwyneth Paltrow as the perfect Pepper Potts. This is very heavily a character film, which I don't mind at all when the characters are as good as this. Sure there are great action scenes and it's a nice film visually, but it works and it's so good because the characters work off each other so well. You can feel the underlying tension whenever those three share screen time.I could nitpick here and state that perhaps the whole film felt a bit rushed because they had to cram to much material into a single film, or that the final battle could have been slightly better (mostly because of the villainous gloating cliché), but all these minor complaints pale in comparison to the film as a whole. I love this film. It's a brilliant character study, an even more brilliant action film and one of the best superhero movies yet made. See it, love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Find the Man in the Iron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2008 when Iron Man was the insane box-office smash, truthfully never bothered to see it in theaters. I had no interest in the film, no matter how positively the reviews read. It was released on DVD at the beginning of Autumn, I did rent it to see if I would fall under the spell of Iron Man...I didn't. I thought it was neat, but my heart wasn't in perpetuated with it. I was astonished that people compared it to the Christopher Nolan masterpiece,The Dark Knight, released that same year. When Iron Man 2 was released, the same situation occurred (almost like deja vu), where I rented it, didn't care for it (though I did take interest in the stunningly beautiful Pepper Potts). Fast-forward to 2013, days after of the Iron Man 3 release. Gwyneth Paltrow had become my celebrity obsession, Iron Man 3 was denting box-office, and reviews were pouring in claiming part 3 outgrew its predecessor. I saw it twice in theaters, enjoyed it, but found the entire experience to be polarizing. After living my infatuation with Gwyneth Paltrow for months, I decided to revisit the films and found my opinions to have morphed into new thoughts.IRON MAN (2008)I'm not a fan of superhero-origin stories, but with the original Iron Man, I never felt like the filmmakers woke up and said "Let's Make a Superhero movie!" What the film implies the director and stars felt like when they started each day of filming is "Let's make the best movie we can make." Iron Man doesn't meander in scenes that are purely self-serving to remind everyone we're watching a superhero movie. Though it has its comic-booky undertones, Iron Man instead is an impacting, polished, and enthralling film about a man who finds redemption in an unconventional way. It's not about the "superhero", it's about the process of becoming a hero. It's enjoyable spectacle, but also has a lot to offer its genre intellectually and creatively. Iron Man fits together as tightly as Gwyneth Paltrow's calves and is as clever as Downey's comebacks. While never feeling established as a genre picture, it fulfills every expectation you could have going in. Rating: 8/10Grade: A-I couldn't discuss the Iron Man films without paying respect to the comparison between this series and Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight series. I find the original Iron Man to introduce the story and develop it's characters better, even if it may lack the craftsmanship of Batman Begins. Nolan got the more impressive sequels, however. Contrast. Anyone can tell you that Robert Downey Jr.'s screen presence is what guided the series to the popularity levels it reached. Downey's effortless charm is so believable, it makes you wonder if he's really putting forth the effort in his acting or if he's playing an exaggerated version of himself. He has superlative chemistry with his co-star Gwyneth Paltrow and together, they are the pillars that ground the series. Both actors excel in the entire trilogy making the acting the most dependable aspect in the series. "I watched the Iron Man movies to see Gwyneth Paltrow" said no one in history other than Ryan C. Showers.Even with two sequels that didn't live up to the standard set with the shining original film, it's a movie series that is a fun ride. Tony Stark is just as an amusing character as you will find in the action hero category today. The special effects are always worthy of our attention and the actors pull together something that may have been ambiguous on the page. Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Iron Man 3 are blockbusters with a little more than you could hope for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Superhero Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid I loved superhero movies. As an adult, I do too. It's really the story that drives any movie to me. So a superhero movie that is just all special effects and action really does nothing for me. Iron Man, like the original Superman and the Tobey McGuire Spiderman has a great story. Tony Stark, played in avery likable way by Robert Downey, Jr, is somewhat of an egotistical, rich kid with a great mind, but he is endearing, even from the beginning of the movie. You can tell he has aheart, but flaws like any person. After he is captured by villainous terrorists, it's exactly his heart (or damage to it) that allows him to create a mechanical suit that turns him into a superhero. So he's not a superhero, at least in his physicality, like Superman. his great mind and circumstances of his life allow him to turn himself into a superhero.Gwyneth Paltrow is superb in this film, and "love" story between her and Downey (Iron Man) is intesne, and so felt, though they never get together (I guess like every real superherp movie, you really are pulling for them to make out). Also, Jeff Bridges was great in the film, as usual. Fine directing by Swingers creator, Jon Favreau.One point: as good as Downey was, I'd rather have seen someone else in the role. Really, a junkie playing a superhero? Sorry, it just doesn't fit right.Ending the movie with Black Sabbath's "Iron Man" was just awesome!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man***1/2 (out of 4)120 mins/ 12Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, Gwenyth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, Paul Bettany, Jon Favreau, Clark Gregg, Shaun Toub, Faran Tahir, Leslie Bibb, Bill SmitrovichDirector: Jon FavreauPlot: After weapons dealer, Tony Stark, is forced to build an iron suit to save his life, he decides to use it to fight back against evil powers.JJ's Verdict: Iron Man is probably the coolest film to grace our screens since Oceans Eleven did in 2001. Iron Man introduces us to charming, playboy, billionaire, and tech-genius; Tony Stark. He is irresponsible and forgetful and would rather spend his time flirting with ladies in casino's than working or receiving a world peace award at a up-town dinner event. However, while showcasing his new weapons, he is captured by Arab terrorists and forced to build an iron-plated suit to help him escape his captures. This makes him more responsible and wary of the world, which leads him to becoming 'Iron Man'. Robert Downey Jr. plays his role so cool and carefree that you almost feel his is playing himself. This isn't a bad thing though as this is an inspired piece of casting from Marvel as the script seemed to almost fit RDJ's blueprint. Gwyneth Paltrow, who plays Stark's loyal assistant Pepper Potts, not only puts in a great performance, but has brilliant, buzzing chemistry with her Downey Jr. Terrence Howard makes a decent buddy to Stark and Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane, although a predictable character, is good as the demanding foster-father to Tony. Also in the cast are relative unknowns Shaun Toub and Clark Gregg who might have just become overnight stars. Toub plays Yinsen, a doctor who aids Stark in his building of the suit, and Gregg, who plays S.H.I.E.L.D agent Phil Coulson.The film itself is actually very good. The film mixes humour with action to great effect. The technology and effects created are marvellous. From the construction of the suit, to the software at Tony's 'bachelor pad' and the dazzling action sequences. The suit itself is well designed and has uses its many functions brilliantly ? and thats just the prototype. The music syncs well with the fun action scenes and is in especially good use when Stark flies through t he night sky to the backdrop of L.A. Jon Favreau (also playing Stark's bodyguard) directs this very well considering all his previous directing efforts have been comedies. Although, while trying to be realistic, gets too far-fetched and the film's pacing is poor; Iron Man is one of the best entertainments you'll get in a long time! And also watch out for a brilliant, well worth the watch, post-credits scene with the world's smoothest actor (of course lining it up for a sequel).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Super hero films out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Avengers saga truly hit the ground running. Iron man set great expectations for the upcoming films. Throughout the film you focus on Tony starks emotional journey as both a Super Hero and a person. He starts off as an eccentric billionaire but (as most super hero films fail to do) develops his normal life as well as his heroic side. It tells the story of how an event happens in his life which means that he has to make sacrifices but if it weren't for this "event" he wouldn't have come out as the super hero we all know and love.Also, Robert Downey Jr., who else could both act an eccentric billionaire but then switch to a man who has his future set to justice but still hold the jolliness of the man that we see at the beginning.I'd love to go on and say more but I don't think you should spend your time sitting here reading my review, go and watch the film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Downey, Jr. IS Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Iron Man movie? I was worried! How could they make this work? Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark? Jeff "the dude" bridges as the villain? I couldn't wait to see how this turned out! When I left the theater, I was so thrilled! A new superhero movie to watch over and over again. Robert Downey, Jr. was perfect casting. So darn witty, funny, charming, smart, cocky, vulnerable, fun, tough. He did a great job in the dramatic moments and brought the laughs in the lighter moments. There is a real change in the character throughout the movie. Gwenyth Paltrow is beautiful and her Pepper Potts is wonderful. The chemistry between her and Downey, Jr. is fantastic. Terrence Howard does a good job playing Colonel Rhodes. You can tell Rhodes and Stark are best pals. There's a nice little tease here dealing with Rhodes character and an Iron Man suit. Jeff Bridges as the villain? So great! One of my favorite actors for sure! Paul Bettany as the A.I. (good choice) Jarvis? Another genius idea.Jon Favreau did a wonderful job with this movie. He actually managed to pull this off, making The Avengers movie possible. Iron Man is a total blast! Favreau trusts his actors to really give their all, keeps the pace up, and the tone light. He even gets to play a role in the film, nice one Jon! There are so many great moments: watching Tony Stark escape in the Mark I, building his signature suit, saving people's lives, battling Iron Monger, every scene with Tony and Pepper! The special effects in this film are amazing. The final fight between Iron Man and Stane was not on par with the rest of the movie though. Maybe not epic enough, too short? Iron Man flies by. It's a great time! Action packed, funny, great special effects, great performances especially Robert Downey, Jr. And that ending- "I AM Iron Man." Woah!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying I love this movie, I must have watched it at least 20 times, maybe more. The story was well written and covered life, death, self exploration and rebirth. This was an action movie that took the time to build the story and not rely solely on slam-bam action to keep the audience's attention. Anyone who tells you that they were not moved by Yinsen's death scene is probably not telling the truth. We the audience got to know two Starks, the self indulging, selfish person and a morally correct one. Some questioned his change, others wanted to bury him for it.There is plenty of action but the story is what really raised the bar from average to above average. We see Stark slowly become Iron Man after surviving a few hilarious mishaps and fire extinguisher assaults. We see him struggle with moral conflicts and finally deciding to make a difference. The antagonist twist was nicely done, we are lead to believe that the obvious villain is the main antagonist. Nope, a more sinister character lurked in the background which made the story much more interesting and satisfying.Of all of the "Avengers" prequel movies (eg: Thor, Captain America and The Incredible Hulk) this is the best in my opinion. Grab a big glass of your favorite beverage, prepare some microwave popcorn, sit back and be prepare for a couple hours of great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few flaws but great nonetheless!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hands down one of the best superhero movies ever made. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic as Tony Stark/Iron Man and the rest of the cast is great as well. They give life to the characters and are all amazing actors. The action sequences were done really well also. This movie has humor, drama, action, romance, intensity, and is told well. The only real issue with the plot itself is that there are a few major plot holes towards the end. For example, how is Obadiah able to see what Pepper downloaded from the computer, check on the progress of his own suit, and then get to Tony's house before Pepper even has a chance to call Tony? Another thing, how does Obadiah get into Tony's house so easily in the first place? Wouldn't you think a genius billionaire like Tony Stark has a halfway decent security system or that Jarvis would've notified Tony? Lastly, how is Obadiah able to master the nuances of his suit immediately without having any trial phase? It took Tony quit a while to master his suit's various functions and yet Obadiah was able to do this right away. These things take away from the movie and prevent it from being a perfect 10/10 but the film was still great. If you're willing to overlook a few flaws then you'll enjoy this a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best pre-Avengers effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems strange to think that this was considered a big gamble back in 2008, when Marvel Studios finally began putting into place the ensemble of superhero films that would lead to the fantastically entertaining The Avengers. They hired a relatively rookie director in Jon Favreau who, up to this point, had made the shoddy Made (2001), Will Ferrell vehicle Elf (2003) and kiddie-flick Zathura (2005), and cast Robert Downey Jr., an actor that was still trying to piece together his career after years of drug and alcohol abuse. After all, Iron Man is basically a story about a rich genius who fights crime in a flying metal suit, and had it not being given the necessary thought and care, this could have been a disaster. Thankfully, it's anything but, thanks to Downey Jr.'s infectious performance, a razor-sharp screenplay by Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, and Favreau's confident direction.Weapons manufacturer and playboy Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) travels to Afghanistan with his good friend Lt. Colonel Rhodes (Terrence Howard) to show off his new weapon of mass destruction, the Jericho. He is ambushed and taken hostage by a terrorist group that call themselves the Ten Rings, who seriously wound Stark, causing shrapnel to lodge dangerously close to his heart. An electromagnet is developed by fellow captive Yinsen (Shaun Toub) to keep the shrapnel away from his heart, and the two are forced to build the Jericho from parts of Stark's stolen weapons. He instead builds a prototype metal suit, which he uses to all but destroy the terrorist group and escape back to America. After calling a press conference where he announces that Stark Industries will cease war profiteering, Stark builds his Iron Man suit with the help of his assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Seeing stocks falling and the potential collapse of the company, Stark's business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) wants the technology for himself.The main problem that faces most superhero origin films is having to combine the protagonist's development into the hero of the title with a villain capable of giving the hero a genuine threat to face, as well as blending them together to form one cohesive storyline. Marvel in particular have had trouble with their super-villains, with only Thor's multi-dimensional Loki, played with a thespian quality by Tom Hiddleston, proving successful. Iron Man suffers here too, only it seems almost irrelevant. Obadiah Stane does eventually don a gigantic metal suit for a big showdown at the climax, but Stane's menace comes from his corporate greed, offering only slight hints at what goes on in the big, bald dome of his, while coming across as a trusted friend to Stark.It is Stark's personal development that takes centre stage, and it's a true joy to watch it. At first, he is cocky, smarmy, and filthy-rich, and after he gets a wake-up call, he is still cocky, smarmy and filthy- rich. Only now he understands the devastation his weapons program is inflicting of thousands of innocents, who up until now, Stark has casually viewed through the safety of his television. In the wrong hands, Stark could have been a disaster, apparently caring little for the ramifications of his actions, buying priceless works of art he'll never see just because he can. Downey Jr. injects the same energy he's been putting into his characters throughout his entire career - fast- talking and wise-cracking, almost comically narcissistic. But Downey Jr. is best at giving his characters an underlying sense of damage beneath the cocky exterior, perhaps a reflection on his long-standing problems in real-life, and this helps give Stark an undeniable depth, and therefore making him effortlessly fascinating to watch.Iron Man is most entertaining when showing Stark at work - bashing various parts together, interacting with his robots and his house computer Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany), and testing his newly acquired powers. His first flying trial has him hovering uncomfortably and struggling for complete control, destroying his hoard of expensive super cars in the process. It's a funny, exciting scene, rounded off with "yeah, I can fly". It's rare for a superhero film to be so successful in portraying the development of its character, whether having to experience a mutation, an experiment gone wrong, or facing childhood fears, this proves that simply building a metal super-suit is far more entertaining. This is still Marvel's best pre-Avengers effort, including it's vastly inferior sequel, and Tony Stark was the best to watch amongst the massive ensemble when the giant ego's finally came together. But that's all down to the care given to this film, which is quite simply a massive hoot.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the Iron man film so many times and I would like to say that I never got sick of the film. What I also liked about this film was that the director had used the original intro just like the comic book series in the 60's. I also like the Iron man mark 1 Armour I just loved it even thought it was only in the film for like 5-10 mins I still think it was just amazing. I also loved the actor that played Tony Stark a.k.a Iron man. He was funny and just perfect for the role of Iron man. I thought the plot was interesting and I thought the villain (Iron Monger) was also interesting and what I was surprised with was that his outfit was Silver and not blue from the comics and in the Iron man 2 figures number 35 you can see the classic Armour of the Iron Monger.Overall I thought this movie was great and I would Highly recommend people to see this film especially for fans of Iron man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man? Hell Yeah!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before this film, Iron Man was only known amongst comic book fans. This film did a great introduction to Iron Man. Iron Man's origins is based very closely on the comics and done very well.Robert Downey is perfect for the role of Iron Man. Without the suit, its basically Robert playing himself. The film took its time and did not rush through its plot. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane was pretty well done too. This film was a great set-up and showed that it is a great idea to introduce more less-well-known superheroes among the public. The film took its time to show Iron Man learning to use the suit like Spider-man, but in its own unique way. It does a great job of foreshadowing future plots like "The Ten Rings" and Rhodey looking at a suit and be like "Maybe next time". The comedic elements supported the plot well. In conclusion, this film lives up to its expectations for comic book fans, and introduced a new character, or specifically, a new franchise to movie fans/non-comic book fans. Though not as epic as Nolan's Batman films which have a darker tone, this is a good family film and it is very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's something I like to call 'the Sherlock effect'. It basically says that Sherlock Holmes is a genius is is not allowed to be wrong ever. It's how they explain some (or most) of the things he does. It's quite a lazy way to go about the plot, but Robert Downey Jr. is such a phenomenal actor that I let it slide. And the same thing can be said about Tony Stark being everything all at once to everybody. No human could ever handle all that, but Tony Stark is more than human, and combine that with RDJr. to get the perfect person. Not perfect in that he has no flaws, but perfect in that you see past them and accept him for who he is, no matter what crazy things he does.All this talking can be summarized by me saying that RDJr. is brilliant and amazing in whatever he does and that this movie is completely worth it. I hope that many more are made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adrenaline-fuelled fun and a pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Typically Iron Man is not the type of superhero movie I would enjoy, the only 'light' superhero movies I have genuinely enjoyed in the past being the first two Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies. With Christopher Nolan's dark realistic Batman movies paving the way of example to other films in the superhero genre, director Jon Favreau embraces a realistic tone whilst keeping the movie far lighter and more humorous in tone than Batman. And like most, I was pleasantly surprised with Iron Man, and despite its notable flaws, the film has made its way to being one of my favourite superhero films of all time. The film is, first and foremost, a long title sequence telling the origin story of Iron Man, the film's key fundamental theme being about realisation and ? for past sins. In this case, the sins of billionaire playboy Tony Stark, played by the perfectly-cast Robert Downey Jr. Tony Stark is an arrogant, but made very likable due to Robert Downey Jr.'s fine performance, who is kidnapped by terrorists using the weapons he created, and imprisoned in a cave where he is forced to build a deadly weapon- The Jericho Missile- to help the terrorists in their plot. During this time, Stark is given a wake-up call in which he realises he must take responsibility for the power these terrorists hold, having previously been blindingly ignorant to what is being sold on the black market. There is a bittersweet irony in, not only the realisation that the terrorists gained power through his creations, but the fact that Tony's heart was injured by one of his own weapons- an injury which requires him to wear a power cell-like 'arc reactor' to keep him alive for the rest of his life. This makes not only for an interesting story, but a great motivation for Tony Stark to fight this evil, and a motivation the audience can feel equally enthusiastic about. As the films progresses and Tony returns to his home in America, the story continues the same concept by revealing more about how Stark's company has supplied these terrorists with weapons, but refuses to go in any other direction. For a summer blockbuster the storyline is lacking in fuel to keep itself going, the current story- that feels more like a concept, designed as an excuse to put Tony in the Iron Man suit and place a few action scenes in the film- wears down quickly, leading to a messy Transformers-like climax which feels out of tone with the rest of the film. The action scenes themselves were impressive, with incredibly realistic CGI on the Iron Man suit, beautiful cinematography and were genuinely adrenaline-fuelled fun, with exception to the clunky finale. However, the scenes were rationed throughout the films, appearing as a quick 'rush' in the film's pacing, before reverting back to a regular movie. Appreciating Jon Favreau's comfort zone and experience lies in the field of comedy, it was a good safe decision to ration the action scenes like he did, but the fact that they were so fun to watch and well-shot left me wanting more.The strength of the film really lies in Tony's physical and metaphorical transformation into Iron Man and the chemistry between the three central characters- Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark, Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges villainous Obadiah Stane. All three give top-class performances, and prevent the movie's pacing from falling flat. Composer Ramin Djawadi's score for the film is also highly commended, giving a suitable mixture of modern and orchestral, reflecting the film's swapping between Tony Stark and Iron Man/ smaller scenes and action scenes. Ultimately it feels very special, adds a good dose of humour and enjoys itself whist taking the core themes seriously, features great acting, but really could have done with a better ending than two people in suits engaging in a fist-fight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is a brilliant with a very well written plot and an outstanding cast. Tony Stark is just a terrific superhero and I could not imagine anyone doing any better as the womanizing billionaire than Robert Downey Jr. He is able to be both dramatic at times and humorous, it's a great example of perfect casting. Tte only thing I felt was lacking in the film was the twists, which were all, admittedly, very predictable, there was not anything that surprised or shocked me. It is an action packed, thrilling adventure, it had me at the edge of my seat many times as we genuinely care for these characters. Iron Man is a great movie that I would recommend to all Marvel fans.Billionaire Tony Stark's life changes after he is kidnapped by terrorists and builds a robot which he uses to escape, the machine is able to fly and shoot bullets.He builds a better version which he then decides to use to fight evil and calls himself Iron Man.Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is one our most beloved superheros, so it was no surprise that he was brought to the big screen, and this one is easily one of the top 5 super hero movies ever made. It's that good.All the actors are great. Robert Downey Jr. was perfectly cast as Tony Stark, and Jeff Bridges does a great job as Obadiah Stane (Kind of a stupid name if you ask me.) They do a great job at fleshing out how and why Tony Stark became Iron Man. He became the bionic superhero based on his own traumatic experiences, and the fact that he wants to protect the people he put in harms way because of his company and his work, because Tony Stark was originally a weapons designer whose prototypes fell into the wrong hands.The action scenes are great. Every bit of action in this movie was great and keep me on the edge of my seat throughout. They all made me wonder what was going to happen next, and would it be bad or not, and that's exactly what an action movie should do.I have to admit, the beginning leading up to Tony Stark becoming Iron man moved a little slow, and the final climactic fight should have been a little bit more climactic, but those are mild criticisms at best. Iron man is a fantastic summer movie and a fantastic superhero movie. It's well worth a watch for anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best superhero film of all time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man stands in my mind as the greatest super hero film released thus far. With a phenomenal mix of fantastic acting, near-perfect special effects, humor, and story, this film simultaneously gave me hope that future Marvel movies might actually be good, and brought the wonderful Robert Downey, Jr. back into the limelight. As a character, the protagonist, Tony Stark, is in every way the perfect vehicle for Downey, Jr. as he assuredly inhabits the role and plays it out to its limit. Pushing social boundaries at every turn, Stark is a chauvinistic, rich, pompous ass of a man. However, unlike his would-be DC counterpart in The Dark Knight, he is actually more entertaining to watch in many respects than his superhero alter ego. Stark manages to be both funny and endearing throughout the film- a brilliantly written script from Fergus, Ostby*, Marcum, and Holloway makes every scene both witty and often-times hilarious, without being overly campy. I found myself eagerly awaiting Downey, Jr.'s next impeccably delivered line as much as I looked forward to seeing the suit. An all-star cast play their respective parts well, with solid performances from both Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, and Gwyneth Paltrow, even if Bridges and Howard were a bit under-utilized. In addition, the special effects are top-notch, realistic, and compliment instead of impede character development. I also enjoyed the fact that this movie also adhered pretty closely, if not entirely, to the comic universe while updating it to a more contemporary setting. At the very least, they captured the essence of major Marvel superhero and made him appeal to the general public. Additionally, in a nice little tribute to avid readers, Iron Monger is portrayed in this film as the main antagonist. Unfortunately, I would say where Iron Man trips up the most is towards the end. The climax of the film, though mostly satisfying, leaves something to be desired. This is because prior to this action sequence, there are brilliant set pieces that are used in other battles, and the final fight doesn't match up quite as well as one might hope. However, the scope of the action in a film matters significantly less than the emotional meaning and story behind what's going on, and in this respect scene succeeds. And finally, following that, the last few moments of the movie last wraps up the movie beautifully and leaves us wanting more... unlike a movie starring a certain Caped Crusader. All in all, it's a wild ride from start to finish that is worth seeing again and again. This movie isn't just good as fan-fodder- it's a good movie, period. Verdict: Movie Win IMDb Score: 100% ~ S?ren *Fergus and Ostby were also the scribes for the excellent sci-fi film Children of Men.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite being a huge hit and a definite crowd-pleaser, Iron Man is actually quite a shallow, unexciting movie. It's not something you can make a night out of watching once you've seen it once. I'd classify it as a movie you can have on while doing the ironing or something. It's a pure cheeseburger movie with no substance at all.Tony Stark (Downey Jnr. in a star-remaking role) is one of the top genius minds on the planet, but when he's captured by generic Arabs he secretly creates a robotic armor costume to break free. Impressed by the suits potential and abilities he refines it upon returning to safe, sunny Malibu. As soon as the suit is ready to go he jets off to Arabistan to kill/subdue the enemy with lots of safe, bloodless action. Beneath this flimsy plot his right-hand man Obediah Stane conspires to steal Stark Industries from right underneath him.There is no depth to Iron Man. The plot involving the Arabs is resolved fairly quickly and the succeeding plot feels like a last-minute afterthought. The Arabs have no mentioned affiliation or motives, since we don't want to scare the kiddies. The action is just a little too cartoonish, and Iron Man himself just looks like a video-game character. There's no tangible edge to this film and very little of it feels real or credible.The ending features the hero and villain inside robotic armor, one lean, one monstrous, clobbering eat other until one of them falls over and doesn't get up again. I'm sure I saw they exact same thing in a movie back in 1990. What was it called again? There's a scene after the credits that sets-up the long, long, long in-development Avengers movie, which I honestly could not care less about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As long as Downey Jr and Favreau are aboard, so am I.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that it is fairly well documented by now, but apparently Robert Downey Jr wasn't supposed to play Tony Stark / Iron Man, now that I've watched it a couple times I can't imagine anyone else having a crack at it.I'm not a comic book guy, I read comics as a kid, but more Donald Duck vs the Beagle Boys stuff. I never got into The Phantom or Captain America stuff, in fact everything I knew about Iron Man I learned from listening to Ghostface Killah albums, hardly a lengthy study. Tony Stark is yet another creation of Stan Lee, the man responsible for seemingly half of the big budget movies of the last decade, and Stark has a good backstory.Tony Stark was born into money, but it helps that he is a creative genius also. Hardly a shrinking violet or a reclusive inventor, he does what everyone (at least thinks) they would do if in a position to do so. He bangs supermodels, often two or more at a time, drives fast cars and spreads his money around.He is witty, smart, sophisticated, vain and a little flawed, a description that also exactly suits RD Jr, casting him was probably the smartest move that was made, and allowed Iron Man to be strong enough to be mentioned in the same breath as the new Batman movies, although it is in my opinion just a minor notch below both.What Iron Man isn't, is derivative or indulgent, when the credits roll and everyone walks away happy it is a feeling well earned.Tony Stark is the head of Stark Industries, a massive company responsible for creating and manufacturing the best weapons on the planet. You know, "When it comes to spreading fear, 9 out of 10 terrorists prefer Stark Industries weapons." The movie gets right into the action, Stark is traveling with a military escort after a weapons demonstration when the convoy comes under fire. Most if not all soldiers are killed, and Stark is sent flying by one of his own weapons.Oh the irony! When he comes to, he has been taken hostage and thanks to a fellow prisoner who happens to be a doctor has a magnet strapped to his chest to prevent shards of shrapnel burrowing into his heart and killing him. The terrorists, realizing who they have in their hands, demand Stark build a superweapon for them using all the tools at their disposal. Instead of doing this Stark builds a metallic suit, the bulky and unwieldy "Mark 1".Using the Mark 1 Stark escapes, amazingly the suit takes a huge amount of direct fire, some near misses by rocket launchers, but literally explodes when it crashes into a sand dune on its maiden flight.Regardless, once Stark gets back to captivity he decides to "go straight" and tells the press that Stark Industries is out of the weapons game, which shocks the hell out of Obadiah Steyn, the public face of the company when Stark is under the weather or out whoring it up.Stark's right hand man is Pepper Pots, his secretary who handles all the everyday running of his life and tries to make sure that he stays on the straight and narrow where possible. Gwenyth Paltrow plays Pepper Pots, and really doesn't have a great deal to do. He also has a good buddy in the military Col. Roads, a virtual butler named Jarvis and a couple of robotic assistants who are largely along for comic relief.The Mark 1 inspires Stark to hone his design, and he does so successfully after some amusing failed attempts. Once he completes and test drives the suit (which looks and performs in a cool manner), it obviously becomes sought after by various parties, most of them thinking naughty thoughts, and the rest of the film has Tony Stark fighting for truth justice and the American way, (or something similar).Downey Jr is quick witted and rarely shuts up, though he is never boring or annoying, Terrence Howard sorta sleeps through his role as Col. Roads, but as a hardened military man he is supposed to be calm and stoic I guess. Paltrow plays the role that only several thousand random interchangeable Hollywood women could play, and she seems bemused to even be there after a decade of so called "serious" stuff.The strangest thing is how old Jeff bridges looks with a bald head and a full beard, I had to remind myself that I was watching "the Lebowski Dude" but I must say he has an immaculately shaped head that look great bald, and played the almost Father figure to Tony Start quite well. There are some great setpieces, some snappy dialogue and quite a few more laughs than the Batman flicks, or a season of Two and a Half Men for that matter.The acid test: my wife watched Iron Man with me, all the way through, without once walking off in disgust or needing to "Oh sure!" her way through long scenes, which happens in quite a few action or guy movies that she has witnessed. I might take the ultimate challenge later this year and see if my Dad will sit through more than 15 minutes of this without leaving the house.The best part? I actually really look forward to Iron Man 2 &amp; 3, as opposed to say X-Men or Spiderman when you know you'll watch the inevitable sequels but don't expect much.Final Rating ? 8.5 / 10. This is a very entertaining movie that also works as a serious film. That doesn't happen too often. So as long as Downey Jr is Stark and Favreau is directing, I'm aboard for the ride.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given that this Is the first chapter in the acclaimed Marvel cinematic universe, It actually does a really good job of setting both the tone and the potential for future films. First let me start off by saying that Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, no debate that man was born for the role. Also It has to be said each and every action sequence in this film is borderline perfectly done as well as the heavy metal soundtrack and effects ... but. The two things wrong with this film can come down to the names of Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard. I guess I've just never took to them (bar Seven and Prisoners) as actors, It's nothing personal or to do with the characters but I've just never took to them. Mind you one member of casting I did like in this movie was Jeff Bridges as Obidiah Stane, for a man that hadn't played anyone villainous since The Fisher King (I think) he really shined in the light of evil as Tony's mentor/enemy. All in all Iron Man is a great opener to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but some of the casting could've been done better. Also the end credits sequence is pretty tight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST MCU movie so far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just recently I re-watched it, and WOW just WOW! This was the BEST effort to come from the MCU, better than any other MCU movie I've watched. What's really surprising though is how the movie made me become a fan of the character "Iron Man". I barely knew Iron Man and I always doubted the character and found him uninteresting. After watching this movie, I had to say "Without a doubt Iron Man is one of the best superhero movies and I'm a big fan of the character".Almost everything about the movie is GREAT. The writing, the directing, the acting, and the CGI. All of it was GREAT. The action scenes are placed when they need to be and they never feel over the top or boring or too much. They are balanced with good story- telling and humor. What I don't like about MCU movies these days is that they never know when to start acting seriously. It's just a terrible joke after a terrible joke, and what's worse is that when it tries to be serious it just quickly changes the tone from serious back to jokes again like they never even tried to make the movie look mature. In "Iron Man" Everything is balanced. The jokes are never forced and they never feel too much or trying too hard. It's funny when it needs to be, and serious when it's dealing with a serious problem. This is why I LOVED "Iron Man".In conclusion, My advice to you, is SEE "Iron Man". It's a comic book movie that gets the job done right and there's no way you could make it better. Then I suggest to compare it with every single MCU movie. Then you'll see why it's the BEST out of all of them. Oh, and if you like listening to movie soundtracks (I LOVE doing that) I really think you should see it because it has an AWESOME soundtrack that makes the movie fun and exciting. The only thing I found bad about the movie was how the villain was defeated. I really wished it hadn't ended like that. But nevertheless, it was an epic climax fight scene.Side note: When I rate comic book movies I have two sides. Casual movie-goer &amp; Fan. By rating it as a casual movie-goer I give you my honest score. Which is the score I would give if I weren't familiar with the source material. By rating it as a fan I give bonus scores to the movie if there is some fan service, or because generally I love superhero movies and they are fun to watch.Casual movie-goer's experience: 8/10 (Great).Fan's experience: 9.5/10 (Amazing).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is the film that launched the MCU and it definitely started with a bang! Before this movie, I had no idea the story behind this character. I loved this film so much that I went out and bought some comics! Probably the biggest thing that makes this movie good is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. He absolutely nails it and he IS this character now. Just how there's no Iron Man without Tony Stark, there's no Tony Stark without RDJ. I was intrigued and interested throughout the whole film to see what was gonna happen next. The action sequences in this film are all such a fun ride, from Tony Stark using his first suit when he's captured to the climax fight at the end.

		<fullReview>Hollywood crowd-pleaser or vapid ego-fest for all those concerned? My money's on the latter, but a lot of people seem to rave over this comic book adaptation that sees a Howard Hughes-style inventor making himself a metal suit and using it to fight various nefarious characters. In recent years I've seen the superhero genre on the wane, with boring and predictable outings lacking the spark that earlier hits enjoyed (such as SPIDER-MAN and DAREDEVIL, although I know I'm in the minority in liking the latter). IRON MAN to me was routine, overlong and frequently dull, telling the 'samey' kind of origin story we've been seeing since whenever, and definitely lacking in entertainment value.It didn't help that Tony Stark's character grated on me from the beginning. We're supposed to believe this arrogant weapons manufacturer has a change of heart and wants to do good for the world, all the while retaining his quirky charm. Puh-lease! In actual fact, I was on the side of the (unrecogniseable) Jeff Bridges, cast here as the mentor-turned-villain. Bridges was the only one in the film who seemed to have the right idea what to do with Stark, i.e. beat seven shades of hell out of him.The plot plods along, taking trips to the Middle East along the way for some bloodless hijinks that see Stark building himself a suit of iron out of a few left-overs. BLUE PETER for guys, if you will. It also returns to the area later on for a rather entertaining fight sequence, but action and pretty special effects alone can't win the day for Stark. After the umpteenth confrontation, we're left with the sight of two metal men beating the tar out of each other in a climax lifted from ROBOCOP 2, and the ending drags on forever. Sadly, Stark ends up saving the day, which means that a sequel was greenlit.Other things working against the film: Gwyneth Paltrow's robot-like performance as "Pepper Potts", with whom Stark's character shares mucho dull flirtation. What did Hollywood ever see in this actress? Terrence Howard's military man is as dull as dishwater, and the only minor moments of fun come from watching our hero make implausible use of his engineering skills. But then, if I wanted to see that, I'd rather plump for SCRAPHEAP CHALLENGE, I think.</fullReview>

The plot undergoes makeover for contemporary times thus making it easy to relate. As with any Marvel comic it has complex protagonist narrating a tale of transformation into a super-hero. Robert Downey Jr is impeccable, but was he warranted in the super-hero race? Your guess is good as mine. Jeff Bridges leaves an impact as the second in command. I could not recognise Gwyneth Paltrow who played the love interest. Shaun Toub &amp; Terrence Howard lend adequate support.Background score is engaging, editing is slick and direction first rate. Of course CGI, aplenty.</fullReview>

Sure, he's a decent enough superhero but, to my mind, he's missing something in comparison to the likes of Spider-Man, Batman &amp; the Hulk. Nevertheless, I think that Jon Favreau &amp; company managed to make a pretty entertaining film, mainly through their astute casting.Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark, a billionaire industrialist who engineers a powerful iron suit and takes on the persona of Iron Man. Jeff Bridges plays his business partner, a man who wants to secure Stark's technology for use in high-tech weaponry. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Stark's personal assistant while Terrence Howard plays Stark's friend and military liaison.The story unfolds smoothly and Jon Favreau's direction is capable. The Oscar-nominated special effects are solid, though not particularly awe-inspiring. The film's soundtrack &amp; score are pretty standard. Overall, I feel that the technical aspect is ably handled but unexceptional.Ultimately, the film is an enjoyable piece of entertainment though it doesn't contain anything particularly remarkable. The acting is fine, the story is compelling but not particularly ambitious &amp; the production values are adequate. I wouldn't count it among my favourite superhero flicks but it's a worthy addition to the genre.Addendum (June 16, 2012) - Having seen Don Cheadle in Terrence Howard's place in the sequel I'd have to say that he makes a much more suitable Rhodey. In fact, in general, I think that the sequel makes more satisfying use of all of the returning characters. Also, having recently rewatched the first film, I was reminded that I wasn't entirely comfortable with the use of a real-world conflict to drive a significant portion of the plot. It's obviously meant to contemporize the character but to me it seems to trivialize a situation that should be dealt with seriously or not at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Iron! How Ironic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got a kick out of this film. I have never seen one of the comic books nor do I know about the exploits of this figure. It is a nicely done superhero film which traces the origins of the character. Robert Downey is quite good, balancing his innate arrogance against his good intentions. Jeff Bridges is also an excellent adversary. One of the most impressive scenes in the move is the opening in the deserts of Afghanistan as a roadside bomb explodes and Downey and a group of soldiers come under fire. It really gives one a sense of what those people face each day. It may even be a bit real for a fantasy romp like this is. It is down and dirty. There are great events, including the building of the first suit and his effort to exact revenge against the forces that have used his weapons systems to persecute and destroy the civilian population. There is a lot of action and it's not superfluous. Downey's relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow and the robots in his lab are a lot of fun. For pure escapism, it's really fun. I assume the sequel is on its way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action sequences; comedy; gross-out scenes; sexual tension complete with feint romance and a battle of good vs. evil sees Iron Man waver but just about hit the mark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last time I saw a fictional superhero in a red and gold get-up flying through the air and generally trying its best to 'wow' and entertain a crowd, must've been in that 1996 Schwarzenegger Christmas comedy entitled Jingle All the Way. Thankfully, Iron Man is a little better but it additionally made me daydream about what it might've been like had Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.), the ever present lead in the film, ever stumbled across the two camp hit men from 1971's Diamond Are Forever, you know: the one's that flit around, killing people here and there while philosophising about certain ponderous subjects that come compete with quotes like: "If God had intended man to fly, then he'd have given him wings." Rather immediately, we can assume Tony Stark be the sort of man to think outside the proverbial box; he doesn't just want to fly, he wants to do it without the wings ? bizarre, all-over-the-place-colour-scheme and all.For what it's worth, Iron Man isn't particularly that bad. It covers a tale, indeed a plight, of one small; relatively thin; harmless looking; eccentric even, and soft bodied man of whom represents something far larger, overpowering and powerful in Stark Enterprises, which is Tony's company that he's inherited from his father. Iron Man begins with one of those annoyingly quaint VT sequences, the sort that exists solely to inform us of what's going on; the sort that crams in years, sometimes decades, worth of predicament and event purely so that it can fast-track all the necessary back-log and get to this point in these person's lives. From just about here, it dives headfirst into Afghanistan and presents us with this rich, life loving and seemingly psychologically spotless hero as he merrily romps his way through the desert with the United States Army. Only, the convoy is attacked and Tony is taken captive.First and foremost, Stark is an arms dealer of sorts. He creates weapons so that others may use them for destructive and ill-advised purposes. When it transpires Stark is attacked by his own weapons, there is a moment of clarity that tells our lead that things must change; and that means risking loosing all the close-to-unwatchably-bad content/lifestyle just prior to him flying out to The Middle East. The cheery and sugary scenes of the pompous Stark milling about with reporters, women and extravagant events as he indulges in nights out at the casino and one night stands comes across as woefully inept but tactfully so; simultaneously providing us with a point of attack that gets across what Stark is like but also providing us with a certain wrong belief that is instilled within the lead, something that resembles a gung-ho, "nuke 'em now" policy that will change.Iron Man is competent enough, but I wonder if director Jon Favreau is fit for this sort of material. Stark's realisation of what it is he actually does and what it is he actually contributes to in the world feels underplayed, while his shooting of an Afghan cave system in which Stark is held hostage, and forced into building a weapon of mass destruction, looks less grotty; grimy; undesirable and unpleasant then it does a themed entrance to 'the underground zone' at a theme park complete with cheap, plastic cave walls and fake sand. There is a distinct, but uneven, feel to this segment of the film; an acceptance that this is what's being done, and this is the study being made; but a biting feeling that had the budget been halved and the picture looked less colourful and less polished, we might be feeling the pain with the lead a little more.It's in and around that prison cave system that Stark realises he won't be building any more weapons, so rather than do that, he stumbles across the idea of building a seemingly indestructible suit made of iron that, essentially and perhaps ironically, he will use in combat later on and thus render a weapon of sorts. I think a lot of Iron Man would like to be about the deployment of weapons to other nations by more powerful nations. Stark, being an American and being the head of an all powerful American organisation that ISN'T the government, and his actions recall the giving of Stinger Missile launchers to the Afghans to use against the invading Soviets during The Cold War, and how, in 2003; that news footage of a ground Afghan using a Stinger Missile launcher against an American plane rather eerily comes back to tarnish that decision. By the end of the film, Stark hasn't perfected a weapon as much as he has modernised a suit of some sort that aids in the attempting of ridding the world of those that mis-use these weapons.But slightly interesting study aside, the film is not without reservations. The audaciously named Pepper Potts is played in agonising; not unwatchable, but close, fashion by Gwyneth Paltrow; while a lot, and I mean a lot, of time is reserved for the development of the iron suit which itself involves testing, tests failing and a lot of dumb slapstick humour. The typically British, and-thus-intelligent, computer in Jarvis (Bettany) is a nonsense inclusion as is the manner in which one such Afghan sacrifices himself in order to aid Stark in his getting out of a predicament, which is a little off key. The film may be a large, loud and somewhat dumb at times production, but it's aiming for that in the first place. The fact it has a degree of substance running just below it, calling into question one's morals amongst a few other things, helps elevate the film slightly but it's underwhelming and quite daft in the long run.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, Stunning Action, Great Characters...Quite Simply Extraordinary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 2007's rather disappointing hero flicks, mediocre "Spider-Man 3" and the flat-out crappyness of "Fantastic Four 2", I was hoping 2008 would be a year of improvement. With this film, one won't be disappointed. Jon Favreau was a surprising choice, the man behind "Elf" whether you liked it or not, but he definitely proves he can handle a comic book movie with better directing than Brett Ratner or Tim Story. Compared to this movie alone, the hero films them two have directed seem like nothing more than piles of, what else, crap. One of the things I enjoy about this film is the characters, which are so easy to embrace through light-hearted and hard times. Robert Downey Jr. couldn't have done better in his role, and the cast is fantastic. The comedy entertains yet at the same time manages to strengthen the relationships between the characters throughout. Terrance Howard and Gwyneth Howard definitely act superbly, as well as Jeff Bridges. Bridges is just excellent as Obadiah Stane.The action, driven by a very good story, is kick-ass.The Iron Man suit looks remarkably real despite being CGI and is quite the accomplishment. If the scene with the terrorist doesn't thrill you, then the climactic battle with Iron Monger will leave you stunned. The score by Ramin Djawadi is something new and I love it. It fits the film perfectly."Iron Man" is quite simply extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new here but done oh so well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the past decade or so, the superhero movie genre has been a mixed bag of sorts. Ranging from the awful 'Spiderman 3' culminating in Christopher Nolan's gloriously brilliant Batman films. 'Iron Man' was released in the same summer as 'The Dark Knight' and while nobody (especially myself) expected it to succeed I am please to reveal that Jon Favreau has produced a fine film that achieves everything it should. For anyone not familiar with the plot of Iron Man (such as myself, having never seen the comic books), it revolves around Tony Stark, a military arms dealer building a robotic suit to combat the problems his previously designed weapons have caused. The narrative is quickly established and the suits origination is revealed from an early stage, however the film does take a while to get going and the action sequences don't kick in until much into the film. This is not to say that 'Iron man' is dull, in fact it is far from it. The script is quick and snappy, Robert Downey Jnr delivering his witty lines well and setting up a tensional relationship with his assistant Gwyneth Paltrow which becomes a vital subplot throughout. Comedy is also used to great effect here, always noticeable in a light-hearted superhero film but perhaps more evident here; the laughs churned out frequently keep the film moving at a fast tempo. When the action does begin though it does not disappoint, the special effects and explosions are magnificent and are in keeping with the grand scale of the film. The latter fight sequences are also a joy to behold, bearing quite a resemblance to 'Transformers'. More impressively, the performances of the actors are excellent. The aforementioned Robert Downey Jnr gets most of the gags, but nevertheless Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard all put in good performances.Iron man is a definite hit, but not quite perfect. As with most superhero movies the narrative is predictable and the villain of the movie is not a well kept secret. There is also a lack of substance beneath all the gloss and a few of the characters are 2-D and given little time to develop. The finale is also a little weak and feels rushed and finally you will need to suspend disbelief an awful lot if you want to take certain events seriously. Overall though,'Iron Man' is the surprise of 2008, a well made, well produced film that pushes all the right buttons. With a great soundtrack and terrific effects, 'Iron Man' is nothing new but everything we've seen before done really very well. 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive, Ironman,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm usually pretty skeptical about comic book to film translations thanks to such esteemed disappointments as "Captain America", "Daredevil", and "Punisher" (the early 90's version with Dolph Lundgren). But this movie, which could've been bad.....real bad, found a way to be amusing and greatly entertaining, while at the same time staying faithful to the comics original characters, story lines, and influences.Now this film's not might win film awards and isn't going to turn non-comic fans into hardcore comic maniacs but it is a great pre-summer action/adventure film with some comedy and a bit of the eccentric tossed in for good measure.Also worth noting is the cinematography/lighting/production and set design, which is consistently beautiful. The sets are all engaging, from exterior to interiors, urban to expansive countryside ones.As for effects, which are a large part of the film, I can't for the life of me imagine someone claiming that cgi looks "fake" compared to mechanicals, practicals, stop motion (ala Harryhausen), and so on after they see this film. For my money, these are some of the most impressive cgi creations yet.I won't go into the usual routine and start giving away plot points and story snippet. All I will say is "Go see the movie". But before you do you must take all logic, all sarcasm and cynicism and toss those all out of the car window on the way to your local cinemas. This movie has a lot of things that may contradict a lot of things that most people believe in, but remember, ITS JUST A MOVIE. Thats what movies are for, they are meant to take the impossible and make it possible and so on. Like I said, this movie might not be an award winner, and won't be on any critics ten best lists, but it will be a film that you'll laugh at, and generally have fun watching. Its a great escape from the surrealistic existence that many of us live every single day. So, take my advice, go see this movie, sit back, relax, and have some fun. Ironman is captivating, suspenseful and humorous. It is well worth watching for anyone with a taste for fantasy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With "Iron Man" and "The Incredible Hulk", Marvel has finally arrived at a top form of the superhero movie. Granted, as Roger Ebert noted, that its themes are not as multi-layered as the Ang Lee version, nor its characters as complex and ambivalent (Bruce Banner: "When it happens, when it comes over me, when I totally lose control ? I like it."), I still prefer this Hulk incarnation precisely because it does not take itself too seriously, and simply delivers a popcorn movie with a tight plot, wit and humor, and, dare I say, ample CGI whizz-bang.Critics who complain about the lack of investment in meaning and psychology have obviously not read comic books. Not that such works are deficient in meaning, rather, they generate it differently, than say the realism of 19th century novels. Comic books do not aspire to realism, but rather to formula and stereotyping (cartoon), much like soap operas. They are most effective when their audience recognize the class of forms they are citing: "this is the part where the bad guy gets his just desserts", and exactly how he gets it?how the premise was set up and the story cleverly told?is what makes or brakes the deal.This is precisely my frustration with the first two X-men movies?they were too solemn, too much trying to make a point, too busy filling their cup with meaning extraneous to propelling the narrative. They felt too held-back, saddled, as if reluctant in being superhero movies. "Iron Man" and "The Incredible Hulk", on the other hand, joyfully embraced the genre, dropped all pretensions of meaning, and delivered the comic book goods.(This review also appeared in stickslip.wordpress.com as "'The Incredible Hulk': Marvelous Marvel")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fast-paced comic book movie and a lot of fun. Robert Downey Jr is excellent as the maverick billionaire Tony Stark, who develops a robotic suit in response to current events in Afghanistan. The first hour moves really fast as Downey develops his Iron Man suit. The second hour is not as good with some tedious sermonizing about the suffering caused by American war weaponry. The climax is bit of a letdown (MINOR SPOILERS) with two CGI robots trying to smash each other to bits. Gwyneth Paltrow has a small but interesting role as Tony Stark's warm and caring secretary. Recommended as a fun entertainer with no pretensions to greatness.Overall 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man (2008) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is forced to build an armored suit in order to escape from a group of terrorists but after reaching safety he decides to use technology to help people. I never was a comic book movie guy but my opinion on them has changed over the past couple years since directors and screenwriters decided to throw some brains into the film. Here's another fine example of a film that has something to say and doesn't just resort to non-stop action and slapstick violence. The movie is extremely well made, wonderfully acted and contains some great special effects and that makes it one of the better films of its type. I think the key to this film working is the performance by Downey, Jr. who makes you feel as if everything you're watching could really happen. I think a lot of times you really have to suspend your disbelief but that's not the case here because Downey is so great that you feel he really knows how to create this suit and make it work. I loved the early scenes before the terrorist attack when Downey uses his comic skills because this shows what a changed man he is after he is able to escape. The supporting cast is also very good with Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges doing fine work, although I felt both of their characters could have been written better. Gwyneth Paltrow is the one who really shocked me because I had seen many of her artsy films and was shocked at how well she could handle this material. The chemistry between her and Downey is great and adds a lot of suspense to the film especially in the final minutes. Favreau does a wonderful job with his directing duties and manages to keep the story movie and to keep the viewer entertained even though the final Iron Man doesn't show up until a hour into the film. I'm not a fan of CGI because I feel most directors don't know how to use it but that's not the case here because the effects fit in well with the story and they never try to be the main focus of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above Its Mediocrities Is a Great Showcase of Robert Downey, Jr. and Jeff Bridges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like its hero, this $135 million total 12-year-old male's chronic nocturnal emission collapses but swiftly regains its balance. What's unlikely about this film is its chosen director, Swingers writer and comic actor Jon Favreau and his convoy of inherently underused actors accept the action-fantasy aim and behave toward it with the slackness and sharpness of improv pleasantry. When they're regurgitating dull expository info dumps, they handle it the way an improv actor would, slickly laying information out into the scene, forging groundwork on which everybody can work, or play, depending on how a professional actor would regard a movie like this.Tony Stark, billionaire industrialist, virtuoso inventor and extravagant playboy, is the successor to Stark Industries, the conglomerate chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military, built by his father. He's the personification of the military-industrial development against which Eisenhower forewarned, a monetary Hercules for whom war is just industry, who ensures there will always be a war somewhere. Tony is supposed to be unsavory before he's Iron Man, but he's portrayed as the ultimate leonine prototype for young guys, not only a master dealer and showman but a mastermind who can single-handedly assemble shockingly complex devices and contraptions from scratch.This golden boy is so extraordinarily, exceedingly loaded that the mere idea of money escapes all import. So what if he lives in a literal Jetsons house seemingly suspended on a seaside rock face in Malibu? He still has to fly for lengthy, unexciting spells to get around the world. In his exclusive jet, yes, but isn't it bothersome to be that rich and still embarrassed by the bylaws of reality? He can meet the expense of anything he wants, but it doesn't make things go faster or last longer.Although he has flown his way through more bimbos than he even remembers, Tony's real intimates are the best that money can't buy, but he doesn't seem to appreciate them: We're supposed to think his best buddy is Jim Rhodes, played by Terrence Howard, who is underused in this superfluous role, the military half of a kindergarten-simple military- industrial liaison, but Tony only cuckolds him and Rhodes takes it lying down. His secretary Pepper Potts (for god's sake) cast as Gwyneth Paltrow as if she's somehow more than a token love interest. And his business partner Obadiah Stane (what the hell?) sticks Jeff Bridges with the next most generic caricature, but at least a necessary one.Tony and Obadiah are preventive-war profiteers who have confidence in broadening and asserting one-sided American supremacy through military and economic measures, and give false piety to the sentimental pseudo-patriotism that whatever is good for Stark Industries is good for 'Murica. Tony's turning point he is suddenly held hostage, which is seen as a flash- forward opening sequence, when he starts to realize that there's more to strength and leadership than artillery can ever communicate. So?he?becomes Iron Man? OK, I mean, what could I expect?I think the reason audiences have liked this particular comic book flick is because of Downey. The effects highlight the mass and immensity of his clanging ensemble, and it trust mainstream audiences to be interested by the trouble of aerial steering with formidable thrusters on the bottoms of his feet. But the movie isn't so much a showcase of Iron Man as of Downey. He is a very physical actor who, like Bette Davis, Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino, runs almost purely on presence. Favreau grasps this. When Tony puts on his Iron Man, we spend as much time inside it with him, listening to his impetuous, cocky voice, as we do watching him rocket through the the heavens or clank about on the ground.Downey has crossed the threshold into a well-merited phase of blessing in his career, where he can't seem to go astray. He's always been incomparable on screen, but presently we're even more delighted to see him. What's more, he constantly brings more to his material than his role necessitates, not that that's a big challenge with this film. Whether a given film itself doesn't match him or is very good indeed, he adds something that makes it something to see: Him.Another appreciated appearance is Bridges, who has spent his career being underused. Thunderbolt &amp; Lightfoot, Cutter's Way, The Fisher King, The Vanishing, The Big Lebowski and even The Morning After substantiate his significance. Obadiah Stane could have been less, a lot less. But Bridges finds bits of behavior, like the way he holds his whiskey glass, in an admirable attempt to transcend a generic character. Really, we find ourselves surprised by his development through the story.</fullReview>

So, I will not be talking about how this movie lives to the comic books, rather this I will look at the movie itself, as if it was not based on the comic book.I liked it! I know, a lot of stupid and hyped up stuff is coming out right now (I'm looking at games too), but it doesn't mean all action films are bad because we have a lot of them already! And Iron Man is an example for a good action movie.Yes, probably lots of stuff they put in there are unrealistic. But hey! This is a movie based on the comic book! And at least, there is some good and smart humour and some thinking! Not just shooting, shooting and explosions.This is a good action movie, and that's it! It's or great, it's not fantastic, it's not lame, it's not horrible...it's Good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect comic-book movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr. as a superhero? In a film directed by the guy that did Elf? It shouldn't work, but in Iron Man, it works to make the perfect comic-book movie. Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is a billionaire weapons designer who is abducted by terrorists who order him to make a missile for them. But instead of a missile, Stark builds a metal suit with advanced weapons technology, which he uses to escape. Later, he redesigns the suit and decides to fight crime with it.Robert Downey Jr. is absolutely brilliant in the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. His sarcastic personality makes for a great, not-your-typical superhero and is what I will always associate with Iron Man from now on. Unlike a lot of superhero films, Downey Jr. isn't overshadowed by the special effects and we're always aware of his presence in the suit. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Stark's personal assistant and possible love interest, Pepper Potts, and is impressive in the role. Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard also provide terrific support.The special effects in Iron Man are simply jaw-dropping. Seeing Iron Man fly beside two jet fighters is a mesmerising experience. Also, the part where he first flies out of his mansion in his redesigned suit is beautifully shot to make it genuinely feel like you're flying with him. In the last half hour, the showdown between Iron Man and villain The Iron Monger is an extraordinary scene which shows off the movie's special effects.The thing that I really love about the film is the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously. Without the large amount of humour, it probably would have flopped and not have been as successful. A lot of the humour comes from Downey Jr's character and his sarcastic personality, which brings the movie to perfection. Iron Man has many laugh-out-loud moments such as when Stark is testing out the flight of the suit, spins out of control and accidentally smacks himself into the ceiling.Iron Man came out in the summer of 2008, alongside The Dark Knight and The Incredible Hulk. TDK and TIH are both great movies, but they just don't compare to the perfection of Iron Man. Iron Man's action scenes are far superior to those of both TDK and TIH and the brilliant humour tops it off brilliantly.Iron Man is what I would call the perfect comic-book movie and is my favourite film. I give it 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel &amp; Favreau Do It Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel's first self-financed film is the best comic adaptation to come from their stable of characters (so far). It manages to stay true to the feel of the comics, the characters, and the style. It was easily one of my top favorite movies of 2008 and Jon Favreau was a fantastic choice to direct this film. You can tell the man is a fan of the comics with as much detail and love of the subject matter as apparent in the film. For the uninitiated, the film revolves around billionaire industrialist Tony Stark and his decision to turn from weapons manufacturer to "superhero" after an encounter in Afghanistan leaves him injured but inspired. He dons a high-tech battle-suit to become Iron Man and undo the damage his weapons have caused.Every aspect of this film was near perfect. Before the film had even been released, I knew the cast was ideal. Robert Downey Jr. was awesome as Stark and embodied the character perfectly. His performance helps keep the film entertaining, even when Stark isn't suited up and ready for battle. The supporting cast was just as strong, with Gywneth Paltrow as Stark's personal assistant Pepper Potts and Terrence Howard as Stark's best friend/confidant (and soon-to-be War Machine) James Rhodes. I also loved the casting of Jeff Bridges as Stark's business partner Obadiah Stane; it was interesting to see the man who will forever be The Dude playing such an ominous role.One thing I loved most about this film was that it didn't play out like the typical comic book adaptation. The hero didn't spend the majority of the film battling the antagonist. In fact, Stark doesn't even his completed Mark III armor until about halfway through the film. The fun is in watching him develop and test the suit as the film progresses until he reaches his final product; though once it's ready, that's when the REAL fun begins. The CGI is seamless and blends well enough with all of the practical effects; it all feels real and is done beautifully.Marvel proves that it has what it takes to create it's own movies and, as a result, can do them properly. If Favreau's film is any indication of the level of quality we can expect from Marvel films in the future, this will be awesome; Louis Letterier's Hulk film, while not as strong as Favreau's film, was still a fantastic movie. I can easily recommend this movie to just about anyone, comic fans or not, because the subject matter and the performances are universally enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard they were making a movie of Iron Man, I was excited. When I heard Robert Downey Jr. was cast as Tony Stark, I wasn't so sure. When I saw this movie, I was very impressed. Downey Jr. came out on top and revived his career. His performance of Stark was comical and understandable. With Bridges, Paltrow and Howard, this movie came together very well. I recommend everyone to see this! It has some awkward moments (see parental guide) but other than that, it's a great movie with kids. You'll enjoy it and will be anticipating the second! The plot is easy enough to follow and the characters are easy to understand, it has a good plot and good actors so overall, it's a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, i'll be quick. Iron Man is the one of the best superhero films of all time, right behind the batman remakes.It has a great cast, great script and will keep you entertained from start to finish. Robert Downey Jr. puts in a brilliant performance as the enigmatic Tony Stark, and he is a character you will certainly like. Gweneth Paltrow perfectly captures Tony's right hand woman. Jeff Bridges is great as Obadiah Stane.It's not perfect, but it's solid and enjoyable. Iron Man is not too complex, but is just right. There's not a second that goes by without being entertaining, and i'm sure everyone can get something out of this great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well for all the hype I was severely disappointed. The dialogue was not that great. It felt like the same people that did the atrocious dialogue in Transformers did this movie too. it had wonderful special effects. but special effects do not a good story make.The actors were top notch. I liked that they cast Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow as they're excellent actors, but an actor can only do so much if they are given IMHO a lousy script. Anyway our two male and female leads did their jobs well and I did like them.As a propaganda piece for the US of A it's wonderful. Lots of flag waving moments, and big things going bang in enemy territory. hoo-rah.Did like the dogfight between Iron Man and the F22's. That was cool.I hope if they make Iron Man 2 it gets a much better script and story, as this was less then a Saturday morning cartoon series. Not impressed 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Multi-billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.) is the owner of a successful weapons industry and is the next Howard Hughes. During one visit in Afghanistan, he demonstrates a powerful weapon that works perfectly for the U.S. Army and gets kidnapped by terrorists. He is forced to make his special weapon for them, but instead he uses his mind and skill to create an armored suit that helps him escape from that awful place. As he's sent back to the U.S., his lifetime friend and mentor Obadia (Jeff Bridges) wants to take over the corporation as he sets up a conspiracy. Stark recreates his suit in a better and more technologically advanced prototype that would make him into "Iron Man" in which he serves to protect the public and fight against evil.Intelligent, action-packed and exciting Sci-fi adventure is based on a Marvel Comic character is one of the best comic book movies in recent memory. Gwyneth Paltrow is sexy as Pepper Potts, Stark's babe-o-licious assistant with Terrence Howard as Colonel Rhodes. It's the greatest Marvel movie since "Spider-Man 2", "X2" or even "Blade 2", Downy Jr. was just fit for the part as much as Christopher Reeve was to Superman, Tobey Mcguire was to Spider-Man, and Christian Bale/Michael Keaton was to Batman. Jeff Bridges made an outstanding villain in this motion picture, The late Stan Winston did the Iron Man suit with ILM doing the CGI effects. This movie stays true to the comic book roots and the acting is just terrific including the smart script with good sequences of action, this is a satisfying and brilliant comic book movie that knows how to be a crowd pleaser even among critics.P.S. Catch the incredible surprise at the end of the credits that leads up to something promising.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An happy, careless, alcoholic, arms dealer/billionaire Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) lives the life of a man. Who makes smart weapons for the military. But after he nearly died from a terrorist attack. A kind man named Yinsen (Shaun Toub), he's innocent prisoner... who's saved the life of Stark by creating an unusual nuclear powered fueled heart to keep Stark alive. The terrorists wants Stark to build an weapon, which Stark finds out that many of his designed weapons have fallen into the wrong hands. Now Stark and Yinsen are building together an superior roughly designed human iron shield to saved their own lives. When the shield turned out to be a success to escape but Stark lost his new friend for freedom. Once Stark is back in the United States, he decides to stop selling weapons for good but he decides to fight back the terrorists that nearly killed him by building an flying iron shield suit to beat them.Directed by Jon Favreau (Elf, Made, Zathura:A Space Adventure) made an enjoyable action/adventure/fantasy that is truly helped by Downey Jr's terrific performance. The lead actor certainly hits an home run with this one, especially his comedic supporting performance of a Ben Stiller film "Tropic Thunder". Downey Jr after years of solid work, he finally become an movie star. Director Favreau never slow down the film by adding plenty of action, fantasy and comedy. The director also manages to have an strong supporting performances by Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard and Oscar-Winner:Gwyneth Paltrow. "Iron Man" is based on a popular Marvel comic book.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD's only special feature is Deleted/Extended Scenes, which some are interesting. "Iron Man" turned out to be one of the biggest hits of 2008. It was well received by the film critics and moviegoers. "Iron Man" is certainly a lot of fun but the only complain that the story turns are always predictable. But that doesn't stop you from enjoying it. If you haven't seen it, don't mess it. Director Favreau appears in a bit part as Stark's bodyguard, watch quickly for Stan Lee and there's an genuine surprise after the end credits. Also available in a Collector's Two-Disc Edition for DVD and Blu-ray. Super 35. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man... Indeed iron character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I would like to say that I'm not a "grand connaisseur" of Iron Man. I mostly have a general interest in comic books.To say that this movie has solid content would be rather pushing it. It follows a pretty basic storyline, the content follows a good exploitation of a comic book/comedy/action adventure. I hate to say it but the whole "terrorist" intro was a bit off for me (Like in the 80' and/or in the early 90' the communists we're the bad guys... Cheap political statement) Also it just felt a little forced (the drama and the bad guys, still in the intro here). Then I said to myself, is there another way to start off without losing respect from the original beginning of the comic book. Thank god it wasn't all about them.In fact, contrary to superhero movies like the first Batman (Tim Burton), where the bad guy (Joker played by Jack Nicholson) is actually more polished than the actual hero, I think Iron Man suffers from not having enough significant challenges from its enemies... Either I feel Iron Man didn't struggle enough or the bad guys weren't enough "bad ass" if I must say (Jeff Bridges as a bad guy... not great). This is probably the only downer I can find.Instead of going deep into the psychological aspect of the main character, we are presented a straight up fearless, happy-go-lucky, cynical, genius with a dysfunctional "rich kid" behavior "personnage". And the best thing about it is that we get it and it works from the first glance at Stark played by the very versatile Robert Downey Jr..Overall, great special effects, great characters, good action and easy to follow storyline. It's fun and it's cool, the parents will love it and the kids will want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are three types of attitudes going to watch a comic/game to Movie conversion. First, the veterans who read the comics and played the games before the movie and go in comparing every second and detail to their beloved history and hate it for butchering their story. The second are the veterans who read the comics and played the games who watch the movie and appreciate that it's being "brought back" from obscurity or even death. Then there's everyone else.Being born in '89, comics and the "good" television shows came and went before I was able to even register what the hell I was looking at on the screen. (around '95?) ...Therefore, I knew nothing about Iron man and was able to watch this film with a complete unbias.Right off the bat I am introduced to Tony Stark. And after all the complains given against him for being an asshole, jerk, playboy, etc... I actually liked him. He was witty, likable, and friendly to almost everyone. On the list of complaints, yes, he was a playboy but he wasn't a complete dick to others. I don't know where the hell other reviewers see the "jerk" in Tony.Soon after, he's shoved into an Arab's cave. Now, I thought this entire intro sequence was kind of stupid. First, shoving modern-day problems into an older concept, I did not appreciate. Later in this sequence, they try to establish Tony's genius by being able to build a hand-held reactor deal in a cave. With Scraps. Come the f@#! on, guys. This was entirely unbelievable because the technology only existed in his Headquarters and it was even noted as a "test, a science project" and didn't even go into production. Yes, he had a lot of his own Supplies available to him, but how the hell did he get a hold of that blue reactor stuff to shove in his chest? That all being said about the intro, I gave a suspension of belief and loved the cave-emergence where he wrecked shop with the suit. I /did/ like that. As a gamer, I was pretty much going "boss fight!" when he encountered the boss-Arab-guy.It did go up from that unbelievable nonsense. I liked the emphasis of character development that this movie gave, instead of action. (A mistake many game/comic-&gt;Move conversions fail miserably at, confusing storytelling types) which was also a common complain-against. Not with me. I enjoyed it.That all being said, I did not appreciate how women were depicted in the plane-scene. They all suddenly became belly-dancers. Ridiculous.I also liked the twist of actually revealing to the public that he was Iron Man. That's a different direction most super-hero stories take and I would like to see how that's depicted in Iron Man 2.Overall, relatively decent and definitely worth the sequel.</fullReview>

Anyway, lemme get on with my review.The movie opens with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, a wealthy industrialist in Afghanistan on a business trip to demonstrate the new Jericho missile. While on the way, his military convoy is attacked, leaving his own company bombs to blow up and make him unconscious, leaving a shrapnel near his heart. Then he's captured by a terrorist group, in order to get out, he has to make a Jericho missile, instead of doing this, what happens, ah yes, Iron Man is born! Filled with awesome action, plot twists, and witty dialogue, this movie has everything. Jon Faverau does an awesome job directing, as does everyone else with the acting, mainly Robert Downey Jr. I recommend this movie to anyone who is the mood for a great flick. After watching this, I am PUMPED! for a sequel. =D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As effective and good as a modern superhero movie can get.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically this movie features all of the right ingredients needed to create a good superhero movie with. It has plenty of big and loud action, comedy, an evil villain, a love interest and of course a superhero in shiny armor. But "Iron Man" is actually somewhat more than just another big budget Hollywood action superhero movie. "Iron Man" tries it with a more down to Earth approach and tries to place things in perspective, instead of rather just letting things blow up. It's basically perfect entertainment to watch but also with some more layers to it, without ever getting dull or overdone.Perhaps one of the most surprising things about the movie is its cast. Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow all play roles you normally wouldn't expect to see them in. Robert Downey Jr. is definitely back again after his years of drug abuse and life in jail. His life so far perhaps even itself is already good enough to fill one feature length movie with. He isn't the type of actor for the main title role you think about when casting a superhero movie but he perfectly suits his role, with his dry sense of humor and acting skills. He's a tough, cold hearted, womanizer but yet due to Downey Jr.'s performance you care about his character. It's also great that Jeff Bridges plays the bald main villain of the movie. I'll bet he himself never expected ever to play a role such as this in a superhero movie.But no of course "Iron Man" isn't a very 'deep' movie and luckily foremost the movie still is an highly entertaining one, that is made very entertaining by Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as well as the movie its action.Iron Man perhaps isn't the best known comic book superhero but he's a real awesome one. He doesn't necessarily has 'superpowers' but simply is a man who happens to own billions of dollars and lots of industrial and weaponry knowhow. With this he knows to create a super-suite, that helps him to fly and has a kinds of other gadget build into it. It practically makes him indestructible to most dangers and enemies but luckily for us not all, or else it of course would had been a very boring superhero movie to watch.The movie features lots of action in it, that perhaps is not the most spectacular you've ever seen but it nevertheless is great looking, which mainly is thanks to its special effects. I seriously can't tell halve of the what's real and what is CGI in this movie. What also really adds to the movie its action is its sound. The movie has some real excellent sound and I sense an Oscar nomination coming up for it, as well as for it's special effects I would expect, perhaps also for the reason that this was special effects legend Stan Winston's last fully completed movie before his death earlier this year. It's not a movie that offers a lot of surprises but it features all of the right required ingredients and has something extra added to it as well. It makes "Iron Man" a real effective and entertaining, good looking, well made, modern superhero movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Career Saving Performance From Downey Jr</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, come in from out of the cold Mr. Downey Jr, hands up who would have thought that RDJ would have been given the lead roll in an action hero film at the age of 44. Not me that is for sure! What a great choice, I have watched this film 3 times now and each time I like it more. Downey Jr is better placed than most to portray the playboy millionaire Tony Stark.Downey Jr's life is probably had more up's and down's that a Ferris Wheel, he was kicked off the Ally McBeal show for falling unceremoniously off the waggon and looked to be dead in the water career wise. How wrong can you be? The movie is jam packed with special effects that really give this film a wow factor in a summer with other block busters from Marvel like 'The Incredible Hulk' and the 'The Dark Knight'. The Iron Man was definitely viewed as the underdog but has come out fighting, IMO it easily edges the Hulk into third place.Jeff Bridges plays sinister well, come on, any guy with a bald head is going to be a bad guy.. Gwyenth Paltrow looks like she has be schooled by the Mark Wahlberg actors guild, she appears so wooden that she may have dutch elm disease.The story is not without faults for a movie based on a comic, there may be one or two out there who will be unhappy with the direction. These minor technicalities shouldn't be held against this movie as the overall production is fantastic. Iron Man has been made at a time where special effects can truly bring a comic book adaptation to life without any corners being cut.I just wanted to touch on the the special effects in conjunction with the Incredible Hulk! the Iron man special effects are IMO top drawer without looking too obvious, you might say that all special effects are obvious and you would be right.. but when it looks natural and almost plausible you know the boffins have really worked hard to make it seamless, whereas 'The Incredible Hulk' although better than the first re-imagining, still lacks the finesse of Iron Man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My son arrives home with the freshly released "Iron Man" DVD in hand. "Mom, you've gotta watch this" and I roll my eyes expecting the typical garbage. Not having seen the DVD cover, I have no idea whose in the film.It took me 10 minutes to recognize Jeff Bridges. The trademark gorgeous head of hair was shaved but that was to his utmost advantage. Bridges got inside the skin of this character and he really scared me.I've always loved Robert Downey, Jr. He chews up the screen. Up until now, my favorite Downey movie was "Home for the Holidays" where he completely stole every scene. Downey is just so... likable and believable in everything he does. This film is no exception. And it is not devoid of humor. The scenes where he is testing out his product will bring a grin to your face. I wasn't a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow until "Sliding Doors." In Iron Man, she not only plays the role smartly, she looks good for a change. Paltrow's added a few pounds (but in the right places). No longer the gangly teenager, Paltrow is now a beautiful woman. The directors wisely chose not to interject too much romance in the film either so as not to interfere with the quickening pace of the story.The traffic/city scene literally brought a comic book to life. I was completely blown away. Great job!If you want a few hours of sheer entertainment, including a plot that builds and builds and builds, this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron ManStarring: Robert Downey Jr, Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Paul Bettany, Leslie Bibb and a brief appearance by Samuel L. JacksonGenre: Action/Adventure/Drama/Sci-Fi/ThrillerRated: PG-13Iron Man has definitely matched up to the same amount of success as the "X-Men" and "Spider-Man" franchises. So basically this movie about billionaire playboy Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) who is known for designing weapons under Stark Industries. Tony Stark gets captured in Afghanistan while demonstrating a weapon and builds an iron suit to escape and later builds a new suit to fight crime becoming Iron Man and to stop Obadiah Stone/Iron Monger (Jeff Bridges). Robert Downey Jr does an excellent job as Tony Stark, I can't think of anyone else that would have done a better job for this role. Well at one point Tom Cruise was going to play Tony Stark until he turned it down, what a relief because if he went ahead did the movie it would've sucked which is why I think Robert Downey Jr was a better choice. At the end of the movie, if you may close attention you'll see Samuel L Jackson appear as Nick Fury. I definitely can't wait for Iron Man 2!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Millionaire playboy Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) travels to Afghanistan to showcase his new weapons inventions to the army. While there, he's taken captive (thanks to his own weaponry) and imprisoned for three months. During that time he invents a suit of armor that's also heavy on the artillery, and manages to escape his captors.Back home, he and his secretary Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) work on changing the Stark name - by eliminating all weapons from the program. This infuriates Stark's right hand man Obadiah (Jeff Bridges) as well as Stark's good friend Rhodey (Terrence Howard). Obadiah is soon revealed to be the bad guy in the film, and gets his hands on Stark's original suit design. This leads to a major battle between Iron Man and the Iron Monger.Once again, Marvel delivers a spectacular superhero movie (we'll just ignore "Elektra" and "Hulk" ever existed). Downey Jr. returns in a major way, delivering Tony Stark with dry humor, wit, intelligence, and even some heart. From beginning to end, "Iron Man" is a marvel of a film, and shouldn't be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, it went to another very popular Marvel Comic flick but the message was loud and clear, especially throughout the second half of the film.An excellent role for the roller-coaster known as Downey Jr., who really seemed to enjoy and excel playing the troubled genius ill-fated billionaire.Did it follow exactly as the 60's story did, no, but damn it was still a good story. It is still a great effort for a 'B' list superhero in the Marvel line-up, getting a treatment on screen better than the returning 'Superman'.Combining elements of yesterday and today.. just as the Batman series (part duex) has been able to do.Let's hope the sequels will follow suit where the X-Men films and Spidey's have faltered.Comic book epic for sure... bring the popcorn and no bathroom breaks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had my doubts about writing another comment to this movie because there is more than 700 already so probably no one will read mine... Anyway... mine should also be here.I found this movie so entertaining that I feel I must persuade everyone to watch it. Especially if you liked Transformers then you definitely should watch this one, and if you didn't then you should still give this movie a shot.It was like watching Batman Begins, the birth of a superhero but with a lot greater visual effects. The movie is 2 hours long, that is a lot, but there are lots of action scenes so you won't get bored but there are also lots of quiet moments (sometimes even a bit romantic) so you won't get tired. I think the movie is perfect the way it is. I read some "Hated it" comments 'cause I couldn't imagine why people don't like this movie. Well they don't really make strong points, most of them are simply saying that they hate it for no reason others say that the situation in Afghanistan is no joke. So what's new, everybody knows that war is no joke. The movie is not about discussing current political events, it's about the problem of double dealing of the weapon manufacturers with both parties of a war which result in one thing: the bankers and weapon manufacturers get richer and the ordinary people die.Anyway, go watch the movie NOW.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starts out a little slow, but gets onto the good stuff immediately. Robert Downey Jr. does a great job as Tony Stark, as does Gwyneth Paltrow whose very easy on the eyes, one of the best female leads in a superhero movie I've ever seen. Iron Man has some of the best special effects and cinematography and this is what saves it from being mediocre. The scene with the F-22 Raptors is one of the very best and most memorable, it was simply INTENSE. The final battle was okay, a duel between two robot suits, looked very much like Transformers if I'm being honest.The storyline was cack though. I'm not a follower of the comic books, but I really hated the whole Afghanistan back story. I watch superhero flicks to escape from the real world a little bit, not watch a guy in a robot suit bash the hell out of Middle Eastern terrorists. Although, the scenes where Iron Man flew in to save the day were quite moving and brilliant. There is much potential here and I very much look forward to sequels, I just hope his adversaries are more technologically advanced, and not real world villains or drug dealers. Although they could make pretty good cannon fodder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have four Marvel favourites and Iron Man is in there. Ironically he is amongst Marvel's first conceptions too. The back story of how Stark became injured is almost identical to the original story and the story rolled out similar too. Stark's construction of the suit and it's testing etc is spot on and decidedly hilarious! The entire cast in this is class. Jeff Bridges is as Downey is, scarily similar to his comic book counterpart! Gwyneth Paltrow brings class and panache to the role of Pepper Potts. An example of brilliant casting a horrible oversight when casting the girl for the Spider-Man films... The chemistry between Downey and Paltrow is electric and importantly believable!! The fight sequences and action are superb and humour is side splitting at times. Any marvelite will get a great kick out of this over and over as it's a perfect Marvel movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man the action punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched the iron man yesterday on my home theater and apart form the fact that I already watched the movie in cinema and I was not so impressed the first time I really enjoyed watching it again on home theater. The reason behind this should be the quality of cinemas we found in Pakistan, the crowd which comes to these cinemas, the sound systems these cinema offer and much more and I am all free to say that movie watching is a much more pleasurable experience in home rather than in cinemas in Pakistan. Synopsis of the movie:The synopsis of Iron Man looks something like this: "Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the CEO of Stark Industries which produces advance weapon systems for the U.S. military. Tony's father started the company after WWII, and after his death Tony inherited the company, worth billions. Tony lives the life as a hard drinking, rich playboy ladies man, but he is also a genius who has invented many high-tech items for the company. Tony flies to Afghanistan to demonstrate a new weapons test to the army. On his way back to his plane, his convoy is attacked by terrorists, and Tony is wounded by a Stark Industries missile. Tony is captured and held hostage in a cave with Raza (Faran Tahir), a doctor who saves his life. The terrorists force Tony and Raza to reproduce the new destructive Jericho missile Tony was demonstrating from parts of other weapons. Instead, Tony decides to build a suit of armor with Razas help. The suit gives Tony the strength and protection to be able to escape the terrorists. Back in America, Tony builds a better suit of armor which gives him superhuman strength with the ability to fly. With the help of his personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), Tony vows to protect the world as Iron Man."THE GOOD The most amazing thing about this movie is to have Rober Downy Jr playing the Iron Man. He fitted this character so well that I almost forgot about his past performance while watching the movie. Credit goes to the casting team but for the most part Robert's acting and the grip on the character goods and bads is what shines through all over. On the other hand the performances from the other actors were also good. The visual effects are excellent. Everything looked so convincing and so real. We shouldn't be surprised by that? after all it's the same visual effects company who did the stuff on Transformers The Incredible Hulk. The wizards at ILM did such a good job you can never quite tell when you're looking at a costume and when you're looking at CGI. The story, plot and the dialogues are so well formed that the lack of action in the movie doesn't put you off. It's a good STORY! it had such a good pace to it and the characters and backstory so well set up that you actually enjoy it. THE BAD As mentioned before, the film could have more action in it. Yes the story made up for that, and it's not like the movie was suffering with a SERIOUS lack of action?but I still feel like the action sequences in the movie could get a little longer and more engaging. Its the feel that when it starts to action and actually begin to enjoy the action it end up. The second bad thing I could find about this movie was the back ground music, so unconvincing and so straight. OVERALL Iron man is a fun, exciting, interesting, entertaining comic book movie that even non-comic book movie fans will enjoy. It's funny, looks great and has some great performances. Yes it could have stood a couple of more action sequences and yes it seemed to lose its sense of pace for a little while, but these are minor complaints that didn't effect the overall enjoyment of the film for me. I will give Iron Man a 7.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And no, I'm not one of those people who hated The Dark Knight. I'm just one of those people who liked Iron Man better.It all plays into that age-old debate about whether or not art should transcend politics. Some say yea, some say nay. Personally, I feel that politics have become such an inextricable part of our daily lives that any movie that feigns indifference ultimately deludes itself. The Joker's ruminations on good and evil and the ethical dilemmas of heroes are fascinating, but they're still predominantly abstract and apolitical. By contrast, Iron Man, in its brooding take on weapons control, terrorism, and the corruptive influence of the First World, is more specific, more relevant, and, in my opinion, significantly gutsier. The Dark Knight spins one hell of a good yarn, one of the best of the year, but in the final analysis, there's nothing especially original in its underlying message ? that heroism is relative, and that all souls are crooked. As far as messages go, there's nothing especially original in Iron Man either, but at least it has the fortitude to keep its feet on the ground, to not be another one of those Hollywood blockbusters that distracts its viewers from what's actually happening in the world.Lucky thing, that's not all the film has going for it. Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Robert Downey Jr. are all perfectly cast in their respective roles, and the dynamic between them - the bookends in particular - is perfect. The Dark Knight and Batman Begins take themselves way too seriously, seeming to forget to the fact that, when all is said in done, their lead character is still a man in a bat suit who drives a campy car. The Iron Man, to its credit, recognizes the inescapable cheesiness that will always exist at the heart of a superhero film, and pokes fun at its own genre, even while keeping its sights on the seriousness of its subject matter.If I gave the movie an 8 instead of a 9, it's only because I was a little underwhelmed by the final battle sequence, but then again, this movie isn't really about battles, and neither was The Dark Knight. Neither felt the need to capitulate to cheap thrills, which is why both movies, regardless of which film you ultimately endorse, deserve to be remembered among the finest in the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is a very good movie and that i think everyone can or will enjoy even for non comic book fans it is definitely one of the best movies of the year 2008.The CGI was great and i'd say that it was the best CGI that i have seen in a while. I mean half the i could nt even tell when it is a guy in a suit or CGI.The acting too was great, solid script and great performances by Robert Downey jr make iron man a hit. My only complain was that there wasn't enough action scene and there was too much talking, i mean this movie would have a lot better with more action scenes.Well anyway this still a great movie and it is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a long wait and hearing everyone acclaim this movie, I finally had the chance to check it out by myself.This movie is pretty good. It is not Oscar material,its pure entertainment but done very nicely and stylish. In my opinion this is the first successful marvel super hero adaptation to date.The Story has been adapted for the modern times which was a good move in my opinion(In the original story tony stark became iron man during the Vietnam war although later they pushed this moment forward to the golf war.) The plot is good,the GCI is acceptable( the suit is amazing),it has several well made action scenes and as the movie goes on you become even more interested.But the greatest thing about Iron Man is no doubt the choice of Robert Downey Jr to play tony stark and the way producers approached this character. He is a player,he drinks,he smokes, he is a political incorrect smart-ass who wants to live life to the fullest.Just my kind of Hero. And taking into consideration Robert Downey Jr past, you realize that that no one could have done it better. He truly was a bit of tony stark in the past and he excels in this role. If they had shown a little more of this side of tony stark I think the movie would be even better.Iron Man has some tiny flaws but its pure entertainment.</fullReview>

This is apparent through the screen/his acting. He is very comfortable (not only because of the "support" cast, that ... supports him, Terence Howard, Gwyneth P. and Jeff B.) and this helps elevate the movie!

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Comic Book Movie Hurt by Slow Second Act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man was the first movie to open this summer and was one of the most anticipated it's been a huge hit with audiences so i'm sorry i've been late in writing this review.Iron Man stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark a weapons manufacturer who gets kidnapped in the middle east and held hostage by crazed terrorist Raza who wants Tony to build him a missle that would due great damage to wherever it hits. Stark instead builds a metal suit equipped with flame throwers and an arm that shoots out and sends men flying thru the caves of afghanistan. After blowing up the base where he was held captive Tony comes to the stunning realization that the weapons he makes are being used by the terrorists to do harm around the world and to kill American soldiers fighting in afghanistan. Because of this Stark shuts down all weapons production in Stark Industries which angers mentor Obidian Stane (goatee wearing Jeff Bridges)and confuses love interest and assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Realizing he must do good for now on Tony builds a much more advanced version of the suit he built in Afghanistan do defeat the forces of evil foreign and domestic. (Spoiler) We find out later in the movie Stane ordered Tony's kidnapping and planned to kill him so he could take over the company. He's also in cahoots with the terrorists and has been giving them the Stark Industry weapons Tony wants destroyed. A showdown occurs between him and Tony at the end on top of Stark Industries. Overall i liked this movie it was breezy summer fun with enough laughs to lighten the other darker elements of the picture while having enough action to satisfy action fans (even though it could have had a little more action and little less talk). My only gripe is it's slow second act that drags at times and especially the lengthy scene in which Stane goes on and on about how he orchestrated the kidnapping in Afghanistan while pulling Tony's heart respirator out of his chest. (You'll know what i mean when you see the movie) So overall definitely see it it's worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comic book movie for fun's sake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The two superheroes of the summer seem to be rich, intelligent inventors with high tech whimsy, consummate attractiveness, and a bug up their ass for truth, justice, and the American Way. Iron Man and The Dark Knight are like the same story told with completely different motivations and through completely different means. And after the rash of "serious" comic book movies out there, it's very nice to see one that manages to be bad-ass without just being dumb. Iron Man is that movie.No "I'm an alienated superhero with feelings" here, folks, Tony Stark is a contrary jerk and he knows it. He also doesn't care, doesn't have to care, and relishes not caring, which is why once he finds something to actually care about, that is, making sure that the technology he developed changes it's nature from weapon to tool, it's without a second guess or any real desire to be quiet and indiscreet about it. This is a nice refreshment after the last couple of years, where even cheery and almost always dependably sappy Superman has to become an emo kid in order to make serious comic book fans wet. Taking some of the riffs of Ozzy's "Iron Man" and turning them into a decent metal score, "Iron Man" the movie is mostly concerned with showcasing the awesomeness of a man who has the ability, the means, and especially, the cash to kick butt on his own motivation. No long discussions about the nature of vigilantism, no fear of keeping a secret identity, no real basic questions except, "How do I get those thrusters to work without killing myself? I want to fly." I'm not intending to use this review to give The Dark Knight a short shrift, but where Dark Knight finally succeeded at making a realistic, emotionally felt comic book movie that people have been aspiring to ever since X-men showed it was possible, Iron Man significantly shows that you can have superheroes just be superheroes, which has gotten a little lost in the grind (and the few cases where people have tried making a mindless superhero movie in the past few years have succeeded at making them quite mindless). Stark has weaknesses, he has doubts, but damn it, he also never slows down to think about them. It's about time something like this came back.That said, in the case of Iron Man 2? Eh, probably not gonna be all that great.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This summer has been loaded with great superhero movies, and has been a comic book reader's dream come true. Here's how I rate them: 1. The Dark Knight 2. Iron Man 3. Hancock 4. The Incredible HulkAlthough I liked TDK more, Iron man was a very close 2nd. This is saying a lot because I think the TDK is the best movie of the year. Iron Man is much more lighthearted, charming, and funny where TDK is rather Stark (what a pun!) in contrast. My favorite part about both of these movies, however, is one simple thing. Iron Man and Batman are the only 2 superheroes I can think of who don't actually have special powers. Tony Stark, through his intellectual brilliance, and Batman, through his family inheritance, made themselves out of nothing to combat the evil in this world. They are ordinary guys doing the extraordinary, and that is what makes them true heroes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is a movie of CGI and action. It is entertaining, interesting and to a certain degree, like Batman (except better taken). It's about a rich man , Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) who owns a company that sells weapons used by the USA military. Now, one day, after realizing that Asian terrorists are using his weapons to kill and harass other innocents, he decides to stop making weapons and builds himself a suit, designed to be bullet-proof, emit fire, and send bullets flying through the air. Oh, and it can enable its' user to fly, blasting off like a rocket from the ground. In other words, he decides to become "Iron Man." Now he's going to use this to "make sure the bad guys don't step out of their cave." Tony Stark designs his own stuff, like Bruce Wayne, and has that air of maturity and sophistication. He's just a bit more funny, chill and less arrogant. Anyways, this movie is a cross between James Bond and Batman, with some iron fun. So watch it if you liked those movies, then you will definitely enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is one of the most fun films you will ever see in your life. This is the origin of the character. There is only four action sequences in the film but you will not care because of Robert Downey J.R.'s fantastic performance as Tony Stark, the man behind the Iron Man suit. Although this is a big budget superhero film, it feels more like a character-driven dramedy. That is not a bad thing. The film never lets the action and spectacle take over. It has a heart and soul. The music is heavy metal themed and works with the character. The film is also set on the west coast, giving us a great change of pace from the New York superheroes. After the credits, there is a cool scene that sets up the Avengers film. The only problem I have is that the real villain only has one scene at the end. Other than that, this is a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is yet another comic book adaptation starring Robert Downey Jr with Gwenyth Paltrow. Downey is the son who follows in the footsteps of his father as a weapons designer. When he travels overseas to demonstrate one of his weapons his convoy is attacked. He awakes in a cave, held prisoner by terrorists. They demand that he makes them a Jericho missile, which is one of his super weapons. He agrees but instead of making the missile, he makes an iron suit which he can wear thus becoming Iron Man.Everyone likes Robert Downey and I'm no exception. I liked him in this film because he brings a sense of humor to it. My question though is what is he doing in a super hero film? He really doesn't belong in it because it's hard to believe his character.As an action/comic book adaptation, Iron Man is okay but nowhere near the far superior Batman series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is, in my opinion, the greatest superhero movie bar 'Batman Begins', but will it stand the test of time? The movie's story goes that weapons developer Tony Stark (brilliantly played by Robert Downey Jr.) was on a tip to the middle east to sell a new weapon to U.S. soldiers, when he is captured by a group of terrorists. He then develops the Iron Man suit to fight them and the story goes on from there.As you can see the story is very current, with its anti-terrorist ideas, so when we are past this time where we live in fear of terrorist attacks, will this movie fail to stand the test of time, and so an excellent picture will be forgotten?</fullReview>

The participation of Patrow and Howard in this movie is very interesting because give the movie more intensity and emotions!!!! Jon Favreau no only did his best movie, did one of the best and entertaining movies of 2008, i think this movie could be nominated for one Oscar, i think.If you want to see entertaining superhero movie with great acting an a good, Good special effects and exciting story, i recommend you see Iron Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Downey, Jr. shines.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel's 'Iron Man' has swooped down to deliver a much-needed shot of adrenaline to a barren box office. Both in cash revenue and good old fashioned fun. It catapults us into the lucrative summer blockbuster season, not with a whimper, but with a bang heard around the world. It's not perfect, and it may not change the way superhero flicks are made, but this is one endlessly entertaining and explosively fun adventure that gets it right.'Iron Man' doesn't have claim to the wild popularity of 'Spider-Man' or 'Superman' or 'Batman', which has provided director Jon Favreau and his team of writers a great opportunity to shape a modern franchise for a 21st century riddled with Mideast turmoil. It gives 'Iron Man' a chance to be relevant, to direct a hint of social commentary directly at the war on terror. But instead of pandering to its audience, 'Iron Man' is actually some of the most fun you're likely to have at the movies this year. A solid script, inventive direction, superb special effects, and an all-star cast makes this a rousing good time to be had.While everything blends together exceptionally well, there's one man who shines above the rest, and that person is Robert Downey Jr. Continuing his streak of impressive performances, he really is the shining star that carries this film through and through. His presence is magnetic, and his sense of humor is spot-on sharp. For a man who at one point seemed down and out for good, it's indescribably wonderful to see him get the attention he deserves. A better man couldn't have been cast for this role. And when Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow can all come together and deliver fine performances, you've got something special on your hands.'Iron Man' mixes all the right ingredients together to create a true summer blockbuster that sets an exciting tone for the rest of this season. Drama. Romance. Action. Suspense. Undeniably smart and incredibly witty, it is a decidedly mainstream comic book adaptation that is sure to convert even those who have never picked up a comic book in their lives and know nothing about Tony Stark (like myself). It's a refreshing non-sequel in a franchise-saturated marketplace, and yet it does have the potential to become one of the better series out there. For 'Iron Man' is a more complicated superhero, and it teases us with plenty of stories yet to be told. So don't leave the theater before the credits end.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&amp;view=public</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very fun movie,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Downey Junior does an amazing job in this film. Jeff Bridges' character, Obadiah, does all the work while Tony Stark runs around and plays. It's no wonder Obadiah wants Tony out of the way.The screenwriter obviously watched "The Greatest American Hero" in the eighties. In that short-lived TV series, a well-meaning but very ordinary man has to learn to use a suit with super powers. The humor of watching a would-be superhero crash repeatedly is a lot of fun, and is used to great effect here.There is one serious plot hole I found very disappointing. Obadiah paralyzes Tony, steals his power source, and goes and plugs it in to his iron suit. Tony has spent many hours learning to fly and fight, and gets some very good experience flying against two joint strike fighters. Obadiah gets into his suit for the first time, and has no trouble fighting, flying, and using all the gadgets. When did he learn these skills? The following press conference assumes that everyone knows Iron Man has fought a great battle against evil and is excited to find out it's him. How did the media get in on the audience's secret? I look forward to seeing where this concept goes in sequels, and I hope more is done to develop a villain with believable skills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man more interested in the Man than the Iron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing that makes Iron Man a cut above many comic book movies, and on par with such entries as Batman Begins and Superman Returns, it is it's reliance on character and the actions that occur because of decisions that emanate from them, and not the machinations of plot. Iron Man is a story about it's central character, Tony Stark, and he is carried well by performer Robert Downey, Jr.Iron Man opens in Afghanistan, where Stark, millionaire weapons developer, is showing off his latest product for the military. The convoy he is riding in is attacked, and Stark is captured by rebels, who demand he build them a version of his new weapon. Stark instead uses the parts and tools to fashion a suit of armor to help him escape, and keep him alive by preventing some shrapnel lodged in his chest from entering his heart.After Stark manages to escape from his captors, he returns to home, and announces to the world that his company will stop weapons production, which doesn't go over well with his board or directors, or his longtime partner and friend Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). While the political machinations are going down, Stark is busy tinkering with his armor design to get it perfected, and when he sees the atrocities going on around the world, often using weapons from his company, he decides to use the armor to act.At the plot level, Iron Man is nothing tremendously special. It follows a typical superhero origin story, letting us see how the superhero came into being, the early testing of powers, etc. In that respect, Iron Man is nothing to write home about. However, given that framework, director John Favreau and screenwriters Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway use it to build the story around the cataclysmic change that sends Tony Stark from being a millionarie playboy who spouts platitudes about how weapons protect the US to a man awakened to the bitter realities that surround him that he had previously shut out.What helps sell Tony Stark is the strong performance of Robert Downey, Jr. Downey, in concert with the script, makes Tony Stark less of your typical superhero and more of an average, if someone eccentric, guy. Yes, Stark is a genius, and has a quirky personality, but he still manages to seem a bit like someone you know and like spending time with. Downey's exceptional dialogue delivery, paired with his devil may care attitude, makes Tony Stark a memorable comic book hero.Iron Man imbues it's secondary characters, even the minor ones, with enough development for us to care about what happens to them, so that when the action sequences occur, we have an rooting interest in the outcome, making them more than just random pyrotechnics. Favreau and company don't accomplish the best action sequences in modern comic book action film-making, but they work well enough to be entertaining.Most of the other performances are up to par, with Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's right hand woman, Pepper Potts, who has a somewhat unrequited interest in Stark. Jeff Bridges portrays Obadiah Stane with both a seemingly well-intentioned interest in Stark's success, but also a just under the surface sense of menace. Terrence Howard fills the role of reliable associate with good aplomb as Rhodey, Stark's longtime military friend.What Iron Man proves, and other filmmakers toiling in the comic book world would do well to take notice of, is that when you bring the focus of your story in on the people at the heart of it, and match them with good actors, the results can be exceptional. We can only hope Iron Man is the continuation of a trend that keeps growing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its Robert Downey Jr.'s day in the sun as he absolutely nails the character of Tony Stark! The playboy billionaire who develops a conscience seems to be the part that Downey was born to play. Often, a problem with first super hero outings is that the backstory establishing the origins of the hero gets cumbersome. As a result, action is compromised and one waits for the sequel which one hopes will hit the ground running. While an elaborate backstory is depicted in Iron Man as well, it never gets tedious. The action, when it arrives, is all metal &amp; testosterone and while the climactic battle could have done with a bit more flair, there really isn't much to complain about. The always reliable Jeff Bridges as Iron Man's nemesis is excellent &amp; so are Gwyneth Paltrow and Terence Howard as the allies. Despite the predictability that inevitably plagues the comic-book-superhero genre, director Jon Favreau injects a freshness into proceedings &amp; never loses his grip on the pacing. A couple of hours well spent!</fullReview>

The movie was stylish and actioned packed, but it did run alittle too long. RDJ was the highlight of the film and is definitely the image of Tony Stark. I din't perticularly like Rhodes, his voice was extremely annoying and he felt a little crowbarred in. The scene after the credits definitely leaves room for a sequel.

His chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow will soon become legendary among superhero movies. The first time seeing it, I was impressed but not convinced. The second time around was much more enjoyable as I knew the story and concentrated on how well Jon Favreau paced the action, how good the acting was by all involved, and how well the music fit with each scene and added to it rather than being a distraction. This movies just works so well together, it makes for a great time in the dark. Certainly it is one of the best movies of the year so far, but it also introduces us to another world and another story that we all should get excited about: The Avengers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having been let down after watching Spiderman 3 about a year prior to the release of Iron Man, I had really no interest in watching another superhero film. But, as easily as I am influenced, my mother persuaded me to go pay a few dollars to see this. I wasn't expecting an excellent show, but I got one. I have never in my life seen a Robert Downey Jr. film, nor have I ever read an Iron Man comic or watched the cartoons. I was told that Robert Downey Jr. played a small role in a film I watched a few years back called Natural Born Killers. That wasn't assuring because I hated that movie. The movie kicks off suspenseful and is loaded with action from start to end. Robert Downey Jr. probably plays the best role as a superhero, Even HE'd play a better Spiderman. He gives the movie a large comical influence. The rest of the cast also played a crucial role in the movie's excellence. The plot isn't like something you've never seen, and it is something you would expect in a superhero film... it's above average. But when incorporating everything that makes a film: acting, plot, setting, etc. This movie gets a rating far above average. Best action film of 2008</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Middle Third, but Stale clichéd Story/Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ironman does well overall despite a formulaic, stale, and implausible storyline. It's sleek effects are competent, and (spoiler) it's middle third where Stark develops his suit cozy and entertaining, like someone inviting you to their abode to show you their new pride of ownership. I know nothing of the comic book origins or how faithful this movie is to it, nor do I really care - fact is making interesting villains helps to separate good and great movies, and the writing isn't there for these villains. (spoiler) Jeff Bridges is a fun actor to watch, but doesn't quite have substance here, and when are writers and people going to stop with the continual poor cliché of Middle Eastern Terrorists....stick to corrupt drug lords at least as a better cliché instead of following the mindless propaganda. Also the romance is pretty much an afterthought. Gweyneth Paltrow is completely uninvolving and maybe miscast. But the effects and lavishness are wonderful to behold - as if capturing the spirit of a teenager who gets to work on his own sports-car. There is some good, light humor along the way. So, I'd recommend Ironman although maybe not glowingly which is a lot better than a lot of movies these days...it make it above the mixed category into solid and worthy despite some of it's lackings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't surprised by how good this film was because I went into the theater without any expectations. But I was tickled up and down by how successfully this basically violent comic book story co-existed with a pretty profound anti-war message. Robert Downey Jr. was pitch perfect in adapting to his various sub-roles, so much so that the transitions between extraordinary man and super hero were practically seamless. Jeff Bridges was an exceptionally good bad guy. But Gwyneth Paltrow was unfortunately lackluster in her effort to lend some genuine romance to the picture. In short, if you liked Spider Man and The Big Lebowski, this movie is for you, in no small part because the film constantly pokes fun at the comic book genre without ever being explicitly disrespectful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing...no....really!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ironman is an amazing movie. Why? it's enjoyable. plain and simple. It will appease the hordes of comic nerds and never-touched-a-comic-book-in-my-life people. With me being part of the latter group, I had no idea what to expect. I went in expecting a popcorn movie (which it was, lets not lie) and got a great movie experience. I was sad when it ended cause well it ended. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing. You can feel his anger, fear, intelligence and frat-boy mentality that is Tony Stark (the guy in the suit) radiate from the screen. He might, MIGHT, be able to get some serious nominations for his acting. It's a huge sharer turnaround. Downey owns the whole movie in it's enierty. every scene he's in he controls it. he doesn't act, he becomes Tony Stark, it's creepy. All you can do is believe him. I personally don't think that anyone could make this nut case of a charciter feel real. Yet he is the most realistic superhero brought to the screen. No mutant bug bite, no gamma radiation, no mutant gene. Just Himself, hard work, and a weird magnet in his chest. (only thing in the movie that is a real stretch. I bought it cause the movie explains it the best they could and it's the basis of the comic. For example: How can anyone explain the reason spider-man didn't die from such a rapid change in DNA: from human to spider? Just go with it.) Ironman is Marvel's Batman. they don't have superpowers, they have to create the powers themselves. (though Stark goes no where near Batman's emo outlook) The special effects have mentioning too. They used special effects when absolutely needed. THey built a real ironman suit. CGI was placed around it. Other roles, such as Pepper Potts, are nicely played. Paltrow nicely acts the sexual tension between Stark and Potts. Pay attention during scenes between them. lovely acting + good script + some chemistry = great movie moments. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. NOTES (big Spoilers!! you were warned): the scene after the credits is not important. just a cliff hanger that serves a trailer for another ironman movie (i was going to see the second movie anyway). listen to the ironman song during the credits and leave. look for Capitan America's shield when Stark is in his basement. Stark is to cool for pet dogs. he has pet robots that build stuff. Tony Stark can fly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent adaptation of the Iron Man comic, and one of the best movies of 2008!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was an avid reader and collector of the Iron Man comics as a kid, and this movie is one of the best comic book adaptations I have seen (comparing others such as Spider Man, etc).I was a bit worried to learn that Robert Downey Jr had been selected to play Tony Stark/Iron Man because I had felt that RD Jr. had wasted his talent and career on drugs, he was too arrogant, and he really had yet to "prove himself" again. In short, he did prove himself here. He toned down his own ego enough to fit the character of Stark (a sort of Howard Huges knock-off) quite well. I have a new admiration for Downey Jr's ability to shake off the ghosts of his personal past and put forth a first-class acting job as Iron Man.The story is well-told, without excessive use of CGI, and a few nice sprinkles of humor.I rarely would rate a movie this high, but Iron Man is the complete package. It is very enjoyable, and easily calls for repeat-viewing (as soon as it's available on Blu-Ray).I've heard Downey Jr. comment on his desire to make MANY sequels, and if they're as good as the first (and only if they are), please make as many as you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>iron-man, the movie about a weapons industrialist turned super hero dressed in an iron suit, leads off this summer blockbuster season with a certain suave flair, a certain eased, sophisticated, flair that modestly runs contrary to it's dazzling, fiery, hype and bucks the gaudy, overly-wrought, overly-indulged trend of past comic book movies; where substance and value is judged by quantity rather than quality. in iron-man, there is a posh, dark, stylishly-refined, matured elegance that manages to have this complete urbane feel with a minimal amount of effort, a minimal amount of expense. the movie doesn't try too hard to please. the movie doesn't try too hard to excite. it just simply builds from it's bare bone essentials never freely indulging itself with an ornate abundance of extraneous elements that are intended to entertain under this greedy, corpulent, Hollywood philosophy that more, more, more is good. the movie just, simply, is, that's it; nothing more, nothing less, nothing less, nothing more. pure, refined, beautiful simplicity. and the movie contains a certain unassuming, self assured, quiet quality that produces this prudently-streamlined, austere, confidence. an austere confidence that, ironically enough, runs contrary to the brash, flashy, persona of it's protagonist: tony stark. witty, cool, suave and elegantly streamed; good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a fantastic flick. It was fun, witty, endearing, multi-layered, and had some wicked little surprises. I've always thought Downey was one of our better actors of this generation and this casting and his performance just proves that again and again.Downey is cocky, sexy, sarcastic, funny, brilliant, and even self-reflective. These are all things that make for a superb protagonist. He's someone that is a likable bad boy and relevant to current times, even though he's playing an older comic book character.Downey is Stark. You really can't separate the fact that this is a script because his delivery of lines and persona are so true and dead on to the role. Best line of the movie is when he is "caught" taking off his suit by Pepper Pots. Short, sweet, perfect.The ending was great for a squeal, and offers another reminder that Stark isn't perfect even after all the inner and outer transformation he's gone through.Loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I scoffed at the idea of this film being made initially. Having not-so-fond memories of 1990's Captain America and 2004 and 1989's The Punisher will make you wary of any Marvel movie but surprise, surprise. Iron Man is actually a decent film, and Marvel's lofty goals of a possible Avengers film look plausible if this good effort is a sign of things to come.Robert Downey Jr. was a natural pick for the role, and surprisingly Jeff Bridges had a pull-out-the-stops performance for his role as Obadiah Stane. The movie is full-of-wit, humor and character. Comic book characters such as Tony Stark and Pepper Potts seem to be more real on the silver screen than real life persons being portrayed and I think that's where the real cinch is here. Somehow, past the science fiction and action, we can still identify with these characters, albeit in a humorous way if any, that we can enjoy the film. Because once we return to the action the film doesn't hold up well anymore on its own, particularly during the final fight between Stane and Stark. Nevertheless the film ended on the best note yet, for all movies that lead into sequels, and a valuable lesson is learned for myself that you shouldn't judge a movie by its poster or genre all the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the best marvel movie to date in my opinion, with the possible exception of the first Spiderman film.When reviewing or talking about films with friends I must admit I enjoy picking any flaws apart and making fun of them. With Iron Man I was greatly disappointed as I have nothing to moan about! I cannot think of a single valid criticism for this film from my personal standpoint. If I really had to look for something bad, I'd say that the final battle is a little stereotypical of superhero films with the whole "I'm like you just a little better" scenario as with the Hulk vs The Abomination and Spiderman vs Venom, but personally I enjoy those type of battles as it proves to make for entertaining cinema, however I know of people who are beginning to find it dull.As one of my personal favourite superheroes, I was glad to see a good, critically acclaimed actor such as Robert Downy Jr. cast as Tony Stark and am glad the role was not taken by anyone else. Not only was his performance (along with the rest of the cast) good, but it was right on the money for the character of Stark. This combined with the witty scripting made for a facetious and charming screen persona.The story was taken at a nice pace with just the right amount of impressive pulse pounding action and intense CGI sequences to keep even those with criminally short attention spans enthralled, but with enough story and character building in the right places in-between, to give the film some substance and a good plot.The numerous references to sequels also peaked my interest. With the imminent introduction of War Machine, Nick Fury and the remainder of The Avengers undoubtedly looming not far off, it is something I personally shall be looking forward to greatly.In summation I would highly recommend this film to anyone reading this and believe it to be a definite contender for best film of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie the second time, I must admit I am still impressed. This movie is not as easy to convert from comic book to film, due to the complex story line. Thing is, the way they rewrote it, with todays common issues and interests, they did a good job. Robert D. Jr. did a great job playing Tony Stark, and the other actors were also well picked. The effects were amazing, and the action kept me watching. Yes at times it was slow, but that is because they had a great mixture of origin story and build up, which made up in the end. I don't know why it took me this long to rate the movie... but after seeing the new Hulk film, I felt like watching Ironman again, also to pick out the clues that I missed the first time. All I can say now, is that I can't wait for the Sequels! Great job cast and crew, another great addition to Marvel movies.PS: Watch Ironman before The Incredible Hulk, trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comic book movies are a strange bunch. You just can never be sure which are going to be good are which are not. Then too add to that it is not always the good one's which strike it rich at the box office. But hey good news here is a film that scores on both fronts. As per standard with a super hero movie the first film in the expected franchise we start with the origin movie, and for me not being an Iron Man fan boy this is where it begins to help. The story is now updated with billionaire playboy and mechanics genius Tony Stark (played fantastically here by Robert Downey Jnr) gets kidnapped in Afghanistan where his captors want him to build them a weapon. Stark builds his prototype Iron Man suit to esacpe. The film is fast paced and brings Iron man into the modern world fantastically. There are relevant questions asked about the morality of weapons trading and the role of corporations with Jeff Bridges particularly menacing in the role of the main villain, and man does he also have a big head. There are good nods to the comic for the fan boys out there and the support cast does well with limited roles. Mix in a nice dose of humor which does not feel out of place and we have the beginnings of a very successful franchise which will please almost everyone. Oh and stay for the end of the credits fans. Definitely one I will be viewing again and probably purchasing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Downey, Jr. makes a great Iron(y) Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Java Man Reviews "Iron Man" (Rated PG-13). Directed by Jon Favreau. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Leslie Bibb, Shaun Toub, Faran Tahir &amp; Clark Gregg. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com June, 2008.OVERVIEW: Brilliant, arrogant Tony Stark (Downey) heads a corporation that makes sophisticated weapons systems for the U.S. military. A latter-day Howard Hughes, he inherited Stark Industries from his father and runs it with his dad's partner Obadiah Stane (Bridges). Like Hughes, Stark is rarely seen without a drink in his hand or a woman on his arm. Also like Hughes, he is a technological genius who can build a first-rate robot with parts lying around your garage.On a sales trip to Afghanistan, Stark is ambushed and captured by Taliban types who confine him to a cave and force him to formulate an ultimate weapon. Instead, he creates a makeshift suit of armor which enables him to escape into the desert. When he arrives back home, Tony is a changed man and decides to renounce his arms business. This sends the firm's stock into a tailspin and arouses the ire of Obadiah who wants to keep selling weapons to war zones, preferably to both sides. Always unpredictable, Tony begins fashioning a more sophisticated version of his jerry-rigged armor suit and begins to attract the attention of his pal at the Pentagon, Jim Rhodes (Howard). Keeping Tony organized during all of this is Pepper Potts (Paltrow), his highly competent assistant who may also be secretly smitten by her boss.REVIEW: 3 1/2 out of 4 Java Mugs: Early in the film, Tony shows up late for the take-off of his private plane with this excuse... "I got stuck doing a piece for Vanity Fair." This line, which has more than one meaning (you'll see), is a good example of how well the script is written, and how well Downey inhabits the complex character created for him. Tony's irresponsible lifestyle as well as an intensity and drive that characterizes an action hero are both alive and well in Downey's inspired performance.While Downey decants large drafts of his public persona into his flawed hero, the other actors remain expertly in character. Bridges, Howard and Paltrow, all with previous Oscar nods, have memorable scenes brilliantly performed. Paltrow is especially appealing, doing her best work since Shakespeare in Love.But what is all this talk about a character and performance? This is, after all, a super-hero action movie. The title is Iron Man, not Irony Man. Some of these serious method actors will be flying around in metal suits by the second act. The answer is... we're attracted to movies with interesting characters, especially ones who can remain interesting even while wearing a junkyard's worth of metalBut if you're a fan of flying steel and fiery explosions, don't worry... You won't find this film wanting. The action sequences, and there are plenty of them, are like the movie itself: witty, ironic and well-executed.This is one of the best movies of the year, so far. Though not known for their long memories, Oscar voters should make a note to take a look at this DVD toward the end of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man starts with the playful Tony Stark; wealthy, cocky and one of immense reputation and power. After being kidnapped and forced to make weapons for terrorists, he sneakily builds his first prototype suit and blasts his way out of there.Then he has a change of heart and feels that only he has the responsibility to harness weapons and decides to be a superhero. So far so good.It all goes downhill once his colleague gets a hold of the secretive prototype suit and makes his own adjustments.As you might imagine, this should make for some juicy fight scenes. But unfortunately, it does not. The fighting scenes lacked excitement and was not creative at all. There was no sense of urgency and seemed like a spar instead of an actual fight.Humor is peppered throughout the movie and they weren't too bad. For the first 3/4 of the film, it seemed like it would be a really good movie. But the ending seemed rushed and incomplete. Robert Downey however, captured the essence of Tony Stark very well. The antagonist was simply too cheesy and cliché. It was like just another issue of Ironman, instead of one to remember.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining, but not nearly as good as advertised. Robert Downey Jr. is more fun to watch as Tony Stark than Peter Paker in SpiderMan, or Batman for that matter, if only because he's not the tormented hero struggling with his conscious, he's a billionaire playboy who even when escaping with his life is enjoying building himself a high tech cyborg armor. Pathos is replaced with on screen charisma and witty snappy dialog, and all actors play there parts well here. My only problem was that while Stark get's plenty of screen time, I feel like Iron Man only showed up for the last half hour of the film, which I guess is common enough in this origin stories, but still made the whole thing feel kind of uneven to me. I get the impression if the director, actors, writers stay together for the next film they might have ironed out the bugs. (SPOILER)The next film could be the super-hero jamboree "The Avengers", as indicated by Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, at the end of the credits. And this character might do better in a cross over. Like Spider Man and Batman this film is pretty close to how I always envisioned the character, there's just not enough action and hero screen time here. Still it's a super-hero movie for people who don't necessarily care for them, and that's saying a lot. So enjoyable, not great, but good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Stark is a weapons manufacturer with a jet-set Hugh Heffner style life (or lifestyle!) He lives to make new and innovative machines enjoys fast cars and even faster women. Kind of like Batman but with Tony Stark there is no playboy persona, there is simply a playboy personality. All of this changes when after a routine sales pitch in the middle east for his new weapon "The Jericho", when terrorists using his own weapons capture him and decide to use his skills in order to make a new weapon for them. Using the limited time that he has he instead makes an armoured suit to get him and his captive translator out of there in one piece.After getting back to the US he has an epiphany and realises that his weapons are causing more harm than good and potentially all massed produced weapons can wind up in the wrong hands. The only logical thing to do is make one weapon that can be used by the right person to make a difference, and so is born Iron Man.Whilst I really enjoyed this film and thought it was supremely handled by the director of "Zathura" and "Elf" which came before, and the script was also fairly decent, though nothing spectacular, it is Robert Downey Jr's mesmerising performance that really allows the film to go from being a mere "Hulk" to a "Spiderman" standard. His personality is ideal and his change from stand alone, immune from criticism playboy to a man of integrity is handled with real skill.In my personal opinion this does not deserve to be as high as it is in the IMDb rankings. It certainly is enjoyable and unlike many films that start the blockbuster season it doesn't feel like the filler film to get things rolling, it is a decent film in its own right and maybe that's why it is in the top 250 as people are swept along in surprised delight by a superhero that they've never heard of before.Nuff said Em</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally a comic book super hero not mucked up by Hollywood through miscasting and/or unfaithful adaption. I only saw the first Spiderman and didn't bother with the others (No way can I see that guy as Peter Parker). The first guy to play Batman was, I believe, also miscast in the role. Still, with all the cool gadgetry, atmosphere, and big screen treatment we had never seen before at the time, --he got away with it; and was probably the best of the bunch until "Batman Begins" which was a very good effort. Hands down the "Return of Superman" was the best. Anyway you want to know about Iron Man. Damn good! And I give it 8 stars. I had no complaints about the guy who played the role of Tony Stark and Iron Man and the screen adaption was faithful enough.Synopsis: Tony Stark is a brilliant self-indulgent playboy with a ready wit and totally clueless of the real world as far as war, politics, and business are concerned. A world he blindly contributes to through the sale of revolutionary weaponry ideas to our military and government. During a fateful trip he is ambushed and kidnapped by eastern radicals who want him to build a weapon system for them. It is then that his eyes begin to open and he starts to question his own values and role in the conflicts around the world through his creation and contribution of weapons. It is at this time that Iron Man is conceived. Crude at first, but later very polished, very cool. Great costume and effects! In short, folks, Iron Man's a winner. And if you haven't already, grab the little ones and run out and see it. Love, Boloxxxi.</fullReview>

Upon seeing the movie, I realized how badly I had misjudged it. The visuals were spectacular and really suck you into the story, rather than detract from it. The acting was very well done as well. Robert Downey Jr. puts on a show alone with his portrayal of the billionaire bad ass. Gwyneth Paltrow along with Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges serve as strong support to Downey's character. The humor that is incorporated into the film hits its mark rather than other movies in which it feels unnecessary. This may not be the absolute best superhero movie, but it will indeed go down with the other good superhero movies of recent (Spiderman, new Batman movies). You will not be disappointed. It is not "Hulk" or "Fantastic Four". Props to Jon Favreau for proving that he can direct an action-superhero movie just as well as any other!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it Superman? Is it Spider-Man? No, it's Iron Man! Welcome the newest superhero in town, born out of iron scraps in a cave in Afghanistan. Welcome a comic-book saviour more fun than fantastic. Welcome a franchise which is all set for a long, long flight. Welcome back Robert Downey Jr.Iron Man is a deceptive, a la kiev-style recipe that comes wrapped in a crumb-fried superhero coating but hides a lot more inside. It has all the trappings of an action summer blockbuster but at heart, it's a smartly-written coming-of-age story. It has the steam to blow you off with its hi-tech gadgetry but it also has the soul to make you smile.In spirit, Jon Favreau's Iron Man is very much a prequel, coming closest to the best superhero film made in recent years, Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins. It tells the story of how weapons manufacturing tycoon, playboy billionaire and mechanical magician Tony Stark (Downey Jr) becomes Iron Man. In very un-superhero style, the film closes with a close-up of Tony telling a packed media conference: "I'm Iron Man".This is a superhero born out of necessity rather than a miracle at the lab or a childhood trauma or an extraterrestrial aberration. Captured and held in a lost mountain in Afghanistan by a Taliban-like outfit, Tony builds himself a monstrous bullets-and-bombs-popping iron suit and manages to escape. His heart may now be pumped by an electrical device but his brain realises the futility of manufacturing weapons of war.As Tony wants to close down shop, his business partner Obadiah Stane (Bridges) takes rearguard action, prompting the resurrection of Iron Man. Only now, it's slicker, the suit's got a maroon-and-gold coating (now you know where Shaktiman got his colours) and it doesn't disintegrate on crashing to the ground. Tony's electrically-charged heart has more work to do as his girl Pepper Potts (Paltrow) is tugging at its receptors.If the Iron Man script is meaty, it is the acting which takes proceedings to level next. Robert Downey Jr hasn't been in this impressive form for a long time. He was very good in Good Night, and Good Luck and Zodiac, but here he takes off. He even manages to make a superhero sound cool, though this was never going to be very difficult for an actor who can inject cool into just about anything. The scenes in which he is fine-tuning his suit, talking to his robots in his gadget studio, are testimony to the talent of the man who has unfortunately lost out in the star stakes due to a rocky personal life.Jeff Bridges as the bad guy is a lovely bit of oddball casting. His Stane is played with an old-school wickedness evil enough to demand his elimination. Terrence Howard has played the good friend many a time and he does his bit here too. Paltrow shows what can be done in just three scenes. Her moments with Downey Jr are the most endearing few minutes in the film, demonstrating that a superhero flick can be so much more.The suit's not made of iron. It's made of a gold-titanium alloy. But that shouldn't stop you from catching Iron Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summer Blockbuster -- Definitely Worth Seeing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw that the movie was receiving good ratings on IMDb, so I decided to check it out. I had wanted to see it anyway, but IMDb's rating helped me make my decision. I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. Robert Downey, Jr. did an excellent job playing a stuck up rich guy, but he also had his humorous moments as well, especially during one of his private jet rides. The graphics were superb and good twists and turns along the way. Gwyneth Paltrow was great as Tony Stark's (Downey) personal assistant. Not to mention she (Pepper Potts) was looking pretty hot in this flick. There were a couple of problems with this movie, especially at the end. I think the plot could have been a little stronger at that point, but it still is definitely worth your time and money at the theater! Bring your friends!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly fabulous movie, slightly spoilt in minute areas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the Marvel and DC genre movies, Iron Man must top the lot in all areas. A truly fabulous blockbuster of a movie all round. (Definately worth seeing at any time and most definitely worth buying for any home cribs, movie collection). Unfortunately what ruined the celluloid cliffhanger for me, in not making it a stellar 10 out of 10, was the erratic casting, absolutely great in 50% of it, but the other half was dire and un thought of,(Some of the supporting cast,left a lot be desired). Areas of the production was a bit patchy and incoherent, only masked by the noise and fast pace of the story line. The swansong ending of the movie, appeared to be a rehash of "Transformers". The feel,action, sound and music was all reminiscent of last years kiddie blockbuster. For all die hard super hero fans, Iron Man was true to its storyline and comic history. There is no need to allay any attempt, to be smart and try to be clever about the facts and figures, of the life and storyline of Tony Stark.. The movie spelt it out in droves. It could have been perfect, but as with anything metal, it all has its imperfections, the sequel could become in danger, of getting very rusty!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but needs about 5 more minutes of action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story line was good. Comedy was better then expected. CG was excellent. Only problem was this is suppose to be an ACTION movie and it didn't live up to my expectations. This movie doesn't hold a candle to Transformers as far as action is concern. There was a small boom here, a small blow there, but there was really just one "major" action scene at the end and that was mediocre at best in my books. If there was about 5-10 more minutes of pure action, blow-em-up sequences, I would have given it a 10. But this IS an action movie and the action was just starting to warm us up. I don't think I'm asking for too much since it IS suppose to be an ACTION movie. Heck, Transformers alone had a 23 minute action sequence at the end. And that's at the end, not even including the other parts of the film. Othewise it's a enjoyable movie overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is much better then Spider-Man and X-men but not as good as Batman Begins. It had action and hilarious scenes topped off with good music.I expected another superhero movie where the normal person turns into a superhero and kills a bad guy. Iron Man had incredible story development with some of the best casting i have seen in a long time. It has scenes that had me laughing out loud in the cinema. Luckily the funny bits don't ruin the dramatic and intense scenes.Robert Downey JR was born to play Iron Man. In fact he is Iron Man. His attitude matches this completely. It was the best casting i have seen in years.The CGI was awesome. It actually looked like a real man flying through the air. Unlike the unrealistic super flexible Spider-man swinging through the air. Loved the detail on the suit and surrounding environments.The Iron Man suit was great. Felt like a separate character with it malfunctioning on our main character. We get hilarious results. I can already tell that this is the new popular superhero. Like Spider-Man was but only better. It already has a sequel on the way and i hope that is as solid as this was.It is one of the best superhero movies out there so it is definitely worth seeing. Good job Jon Favreau and all involved.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost perfect genesis superhero movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this is how superhero blockbuster movies should be. Brilliant from start to finish.First off the casting is superb. Palthrow as Pepper Potts is perfect, Terrence Howard has great screen presence. But its the leads that are so perfectly cast, Jeff "El Duderino" Bridges sports a bald pate and oozes power here. But the revelation is Robert Downey Jr, the guy is just so magnetic on screen, he has the ability to play any character and this is ideal for the character of Stark, a preening morally ambiguous playboy at the beginning who eyes are opened to the real world he inhabits.The script is well paced and the dialogue is both relevant, realistic and humorous when needed. The direction (by Jon Favreau) is crisp and balanced.Every other director and writer who plans to make a comic book to movie crossover needs to sit down and watch this movie. Its by far the best in its genre. The genesis movie in the superhero franchise is probably the hardest one to make. You gotta both think about your fan based audience and move at a pace that he wants with all the little details he wants, but you also gotta think of the mass movie goer who wants to eat his popcorn and not be too bogged down with the early life of the superhero they have come to see break things up and bash bad guys.A perfectly balanced action/drama that will be loved by the hardcore fan and Johnny Cinemagoer who's never heard of Ironman before today.Almost perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man:needs tinkering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Stark, aka Ironman, is the hero of 2008. Or better stated, Robert Downey Jr. is Carrot Top, doing stand-up, in the comedy film classic of this summer. Mr. Downey takes off with an array of one liners, and simply does not quit. Along with his stand-up comedy, the sight gags add more support, to this burlesque, portrayed on screen. Without giving away too much of the plot of the film, a head strong Industrialist, goes into the thick of the current battle zone, to show off his most current weapon of defense, and blunders into the hands of the enemy. Ironman is born, and the film goes on, full tilt from there. Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is one of the key board members of Stark Industries, and best friend of Tony Stark's late father. What is most interesting about the choice of Mr. Bridges in this film, is his past film credit, Tron (1982). A lot of the visual electronics, in Ironman, appear to pay tribute, to the early, light show effects, that were created for the film, Tron. Mr. Bridges may play his part a bit over the top, but that goes very well, with his outrageous ego and persona. Pepper Everhart (Gwyneth Paltrow) plays Tony Stark's quick witted, and almost sarcastic, first secretary. In fact, she is his only secretary, and true confidant. Their relationship aids the only true love element in the entire film, which brings a human quality, necessary to bring the script down to earth. Tony' s and Pepper's rapport leads straight into the basis of the material, which supports the real issues of the Ironman myth. The real story of Ironman is taken from the true-love lives of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley. Ironman is Frankenstein, reborn to suit the failed self-image of a man. Whenever man tries to create something greater than his own self-image, a monster is created. No one but the creator, sees the creation for what it is intended, all others see, is a monster! Remember, this is a comedy, so laugh with Ironman, and tighten a few bolts, along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank you :-)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is coming from a guy who doesn't like comic book blockbuster movies (except anything Frank Miller does), but this one is done well and is my favorite comic book film underneath all of Miller's.There are gaping plot holes that really annoyed me- and that is the reason I gave this film a 7 and not a 9. But I won't get into it here. "no spoilers this time around." I like it when movies (comic book fantasy or not) can make me believe in their world. Ironman didn't even come close to doing that, but the acting was superb and the dialogue was great. The comedy was surprisingly sharp and fresh. Jeff Bridges and Downey Jr. are incredible as always, and the special effects are top notch. So for those reasons, I was pretty forgiving with this one. If the plot holes were any deeper, the dam would have broke and this rating of 7 would have been a 2 or 3, but it was so entertaining that it engaged me all the way through. That's tough to do with a weak plot line. Make no mistake: Ironman has a weak plot line. I can only imagine how cool it would have been with a super strong story and well polished script. A rare thing now days, especially with giant money pig movies like this one.So here's to the Iron Man franchise- thank you for not wasting my time, and actually making a decent movie out of a multi- hundred million dollar budget. Which is more than I can say for 90% of all films costing over 150 mil to make. It could have been a lot better, but I still was very entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rise Of The New Superhero...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all of the troubles that Robert Downey Jr. went through in the late Nineties and through the better part of this advancing decade, it would take a larger-than-life character to get him and his career back on track. Thankfully, Tony Stark came along just in the nick of time, the way he does quite often to save the day in IRON MAN.Much has been made of Mack-truck-sized plot holes, deviations from original character motivations and the like. What people seem to be missing is that for the first time in a LONG time, we have a summer movie that puts the "WOW!" Factor back into summer movie-going again.Remember when the bar for special visual effects was raised by films such as CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, STAR TREK 2, and some little swashbuckler in space made by a bearded fanboy geek-turned-filmmaker named George Lucas? Well, all of the best things about the technology that we've always hoped for are here, in the form of CGI, animation and practical effects that blend so seamlessly and with astounding precision, that even the mind-bending effects of THE MATRIX series now seem passé. But best of all, where movies of this caliber that excel in the special effects areas always come up lacking in terms of story-telling and acting, IRON MAN delivers the goods in every conceivable way. Downey Jr. makes Stark a likable, roguish charmer - the kind of cool, laid-back, hedonistic party animal that makes his contemporaries like Bruce Wayne look like they're standing still. This is the kind of role he has always excelled at, and when the time comes for Stark to eat a great big helping of humble pie and experience the epiphany that transforms him into more than just an opportunistic death dealer, his real-life experiences seem to inform his performance with the kind of pathos and heart that will be hard to find in other leading hero roles this summer, (with the possible exception of that guy with the hat and the whip.)Though a little more time could've been spent developing their roles, Downey has great support with the always excellent Terrance Howard, Clark Gregg, Jon Favreau (the director in one of his Hitchcockian cameos) and Leslie Bibb as the inescapable gorgeous-and-nosy gal reporter. Special mention should be made of Faran Tahir as the "McGuffin" baddie of the piece, and Shaun Toub as an unlikely but formidable and admirable ally named Yinsen. The two most impressive co-stars, however, are Gwyneth Paltrow, who has to be the most unlikely superhero love interest since Margot Kidder, and Jeff Bridges, aging nicely into 'hot daddy' mode as Stark's partner and eventual nemesis, Obediah "Obie" Stane. The chemistry crackles between Downey Jr. and Paltrow almost immediately, which is really important to make unrequited romance work and hold the audience's attention, when the rest of the time is comprised of myriad "stuff that blows up real good." Their banter and attraction could fuel a couple dozen limp-and-lifeless summer rom-coms, so it's a nice surprise to find it here.As for Bridges, his dad would be bursting with pride. Jeff is specializing more and more in guest shots and character roles rather than those of his former "leading stud" niche, and each one has fit him nicely. Though a little more background on Obie would've been nice, this one is no exception. His rage at having to play second fiddle to his young protégé definitely comes through in their eventual confrontations, and that needs no further explanation or exposition to justify it.As an independent studio, Marvel has redefined the paradigm for how to make a comic book adaptation work with IRON MAN. Let's see if any of their rivals are up to meeting the challenge...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Happened To The Mandarin?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every super hero needs an arch nemesis. Spiderman has the Green Goblin, Batman has the Joker, Superman has Lex Luthor. As any longtime time reader of the comics knows, Iron Man's arch nemesis is the Mandarin. So why is Obadiah Stane, a relatively minor villain, the bad guy in the movie adaptation? I suspect political correctness. The Mandarin is an old school "yellow peril" inscrutable oriental super villain modeled on Fu Manchu. You could still get away with stereotypes like this in the early sixties when Stan Lee and co. dreamed up the Mandarin, but now the character comes off as distinctly racist.Which is too bad. The Mandarin could be easily revamped for the current generation. After all, Tony Stark, Iron Man's alter ego, started as a shameless member of the military-industrial complex, doing his part to win the Cold War for Uncle Sammy. It wasn't until the seventies that he experienced self-doubt, redirected Stark Industries into humanitarian activities, and became a born-again peacenik. There's no reason the Mandarin couldn't be similarly redesigned to embody, say, the challenge of modern, industrialized China to the United States' global hegemony. Maybe in IRON MAN 2.</fullReview>

There is chemistry between them...you know it and hope the story develops around it...so that's why there needs to be a sequel.The action and story line have a lot of unexpected twists and turns.

		<shortDescription>Nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, when I first saw the previews for this movie I thought that it wouldn't be anything special, but would probably be a fun movie to watch. After reading reviews however I thought that maybe we would get something more, but unfortunately I cannot see what everyone is raving about. What you get is exactly what I expected an entertaining popcorn flick with a lot of special affects that is nothing special.Robert Downey Jr. does a good job in his role and provides some very humorous moments, but this doesn't make for a great movie. The movie starts as if it is going to add some sort of realism, but then immediately decides to go the other direction. Now I don't have a problem with a good old fashion hero flick with lots of fun and a couple of laughs along the way. It may be a bit harsh of me to say that I was disappointed by the movie, in reality it was exactly what I expected, but the build up that I heard made me think that maybe it could be a lot more.So much of the movie just makes no sense what so ever. To start, OK I will accept that this one man makes the greatest weapon that the world has ever seen in a cave in a month or couple of months or how ever long he was in there, fine I'll take that. He then goes on to perfect his creation which takes at least a couple weeks, I remember him saying day 11 at one point but can't really remember anything else about how long he was doing this for. But what I don't understand or accept is how Obadiah goes on to make a better suit in what seems to be a couple of days with scientists that could not even make the basic part to the suit in the first place (the part that Tony made very quickly and with relative ease it seems). How am I supposed to believe that these very same scientists go on to build a much better and more complicated suit in a shorter time frame.Another part in the movie which didn't really make much sense to me was when Pepper goes to Tony's office to get the info and for some reason Obadiah lets her go with no fuss at all after walking in and immediately saying "I know what your doing Pepper" or something like that? How does that make any sense? Then two scenes later he suddenly decides that she needs to die? This whole sequence was pretty stupid to me. Continuing with this whole sequence, Oba goes to talk to his scientists and then manages to beat Pepper back to Tony's house? Why on Earth does Pepper not immediately go with the agents to get Tony to make sure that he is OK? This is just plain stupid to me. Now I can live with characters in movies not being very smart, but this whole sequence of events just makes no sense what so ever to me.In the end Iron Man is alright, it doesn't provide anything new really and to me there are some holes in the plot. It is an alright movie that is pretty fun, but is definitely not worthy of all of this hype that it is getting.</fullReview>

The special effects was where this really stood out in my mind. Most of the time I can tell when something is CG, but here they blended everything perfectly. The action scenes were amazing fun. They really got me pumped up (not to sound stupid). The one liners were good and not over the top because Tony Stark is supposed to be like that. They built up sequels perfectly but not too much (except of course the Nick Fury appearance). As far as I am concerned it was a perfect summer movie with all of the right parts; lots of action and lots of fun. I won't even begin talking about the scenes that I loved, because there are so many. The reason that it is not rated higher because it was nothing more than entertaining. I did not think the writing was better than average and the CG was the only thing that was better than average. It just appealed to the loser in me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conflict within and an anti-climax, yet a good movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "Iron Man" certainly got the audience laughing, but not just at the funny bits.Anyone who goes to see a Marvel movie and wants to enjoy it has to make the switch to non-intelligent. "Ignorance is bliss" could have been Marvel's catchphrase; when somebody seriously tries to dismiss a Marvel movie because it was "cliché", that somebody is an idiot.What caught my eye when compared to other Marvel movies, was that the acting of Robert Downey Jr. was outstanding. I don't want to imply that other Marvel movies had bad acting, but nothing topped this performance.However, this leads me to the conflict I mention in the title. We're facing a cliché storyline, as we all know it of Marvel, and try to blend this with natural and solid acting.This works in most aspects. The comedy for example is plain brilliant, because it feels like a natural product of Tony Stark's personality, which is perfectly portrayed.But when we look at the romantic scenes (mainly referring to, mind spoilers, the "battery replacement"-scene), this instantly leads to a conflict. Tony's personality and realism just didn't seem to fit the cliché background music and the sudden, passionate silence.The other point questionable about the ending, was the ending. Now to be sure, I'll give you the *spoiler alert*, but I'll try to talk around it.We don't and shouldn't expect an extremely original climax from a Marvel. This one wasn't, but it was so cliché it kinda hurt my head.The romantic plot line was such a detail in the movie, that the references at the end didn't do me anything. Too my taste, there were too many, some of which left some in the audience unable to repress a chuckle.Viewing back the movie was a great watch, but I would have enjoyed it a lot more if Marvel had gone bold and had scraped the whole romance from the movie. It was an unnecessary detail which only led to an amplification of the cliché image.Still, Marvel did a good job and it was a good watch. If there's a sequel, I'll be there.I give the movie a 7. Would have been a 6, but in its genre it deserves a 7. (No, the Marvel stamp isn't always +1, because for movies as the 2002 "Incredible Hulk", a Marvel stamp would give the movie a -1. It does not meet Marvel expectations).Thanks for the (lengthy) read, and I hope I was of use.Peter Saarloos</fullReview>

You will be rewarded for your patience. Robert Downey Jr. could be the next Johnny Depp in terms of making a this character a brand name. It already seems like this is destined for a trilogy. It was like a cross between x-men and James Bond with the f/x and the cars and the lovely women walking about. Downey brought Stark to life as I wish they did with Spiderman. Instead we got a sappy soft spoken Tobey McGwire. well with Downey we got an in-your-face sarcastic alcoholic superhero with a conscience. From what I remember of the comic it stuck to the storyline with some modern twists. It is an almost certainty that there will be 2-3 more Iron man films in the next few years. I expect to see this film again in the theaters and can't wait for the 2nd installment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stronger than most marvel films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When sitting down to watch this movie there was only these thoughts on my mind - how disappointed i would be once again from a Marvel film and the feeling of how they could have done so much more.But once the film had ended there was no feeling of relief that it does the Marvel icon satisfaction but actually a lot lot more.Iron Man, maybe not as popular as the Incredible Hulk and Fantastic Four, but this film delivered so much more than the latest instalments of both Fantastic four movies and the dreadful last Incredible Hulk ( will have to see how the new Incredible Hulk turns out before can compare) Iron Man has never had the popularity of Spiderman or X-men but this first Iron Man is better than X-men 3 The Last Stand by a long shot and with it concentrating on Iron Man and his development is for me better than the huge budgeted Spiderman 3 where too much is going on and there is not enough for each character development within the film.I would go as far and say that so far it is one of the best Marvel films released - ever, i rank it alongside the original feeling i had from X-Men and Spiderman, when they we're released i was blown away, maybe because i had no expectation for this film it was even better for me, with something like Spiderman and X-men we all have high expectations. Iron Man has strong competition from Batman this year for the best superhero movie of 2008 and if bettered by the Dark Knight then we are in for one hell of a year for superheroes, Iron Man has set a new height for marvel films, lets hope they do a sequel without ruining it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I loved this movie! I haven't read enough of the Iron Man original comics, but still this movie was amazing. I would have to say, Iron Man has been the best Marvel origin movie so far, followed by X-Men and Spiderman.EXCELLENT graphics, amazing acting performance, and awesome script. The dialogue especially impressed me, with its witty sense of humor that was not over done at any point. The movie is absolutely enjoyable. A MUST SEE in theaters. The one downside I have noticed is its "rushed" end. I loved how the movie was developed, as I really got to know the character of Tony Stark and the development of Iron Man, but I have to say the final battle scene was very rushed compared to the rest of the movie. The final scene was great, but the movie did leave me hanging in an odd sort of way, thinking "wait, that's it for the enemy???" The rest of the plot isn't too special either, but it's enjoyable. The character development of non-main characters was also left relatively low, compared to the main protagonist. In a sense, the movie was honest in that it was (almost strictly) about Iron Man (and Tony Stark), and I can see people wishing that the creators put a little bit more into other character development. Personally though, I liked it how it was.I've heard that there will be a sequel, and I am looking forward for it. I have a feeling that it would not meet up to the quality of this one, but if they continue the script quality of this one, I'm sure to enjoy it greatly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been dangerous turf to tread on but they smacked it out of the park</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I definitely had my doubts about Iron Man. First of all I am not a big Marvel fan, always been a DC kid, and Marvel has been churning out stinkers including the less than stellar Spiderman 3, Daredevil, Hulk, Fantastic 4 and so forth. I had very, very low expectations for the film and then the reviews started coming in from professional critics and...they loved it? They raved about it and then people started talking about how great it was and I knew I had to see it and find out for myself. First of all I can say that Iron Man is absolutely captivating. Nothing I feared for the film pans out...I thought special effects would be over blown and cheesy and they weren't even close!! I thought the story would be too fantastical to translate to screen and they did it perfectly. I had no background on Iron Man, never read a comic but it seemed to me to be the last hero you'd want to try to make into a serious live action film but it seems to me that the film makers took very careful steps in bringing the character to life and hired a cast that was quite simply brilliant in every way. A really great ensemble, a well thought out story, good but not overblown special effects, and really kept true to their fans already existing.Robert Downey Jr. is being heralded for his performance as Billionaire arms dealer Tony Stark. He is excellent. He has a flare certainly for the sarcastic biting comedic wit. However that alone would have made him nothing more than a George Clooney as Batman fiasco but to my surprise he also made a terrific hero and leading man and really lights up the screen with his personality and performance. Terrence Howard who is a really terrific actor gets a supporting role without a lot of depth but given Howard's ability he makes a great pseudo sidekick to Downey Jr. performance. I think his character could have been given more but he does excellent. Jeff Bridges is just an amazing super villain. His story starts out on the low end and really turns him into the ultimate villain by the end with a very cool robotic fight at the end. He is just an excellent adversary and also extremely talented. Gwyneth Paltrow returns to the big budget screen as a sidekick to Tony Stark and somewhat of a love interest as Pepper Potts. Her role is toned down as well so as to not overshadow the main character but she is good opposite Downey Jr. and their chemistry is excellent. Throw in the obligatory appearance by co-creator and Marvel god Stan Lee (who I immediately recognized the first time) and a very small cameo role by director Jon Favreau and you've got an incredible cast together with a great story.As with all Superhero films we have to get the creation of the character and the unique thing about Iron Man is that the entire film nearly is Stark creating and perfecting this persona and then exacting revenge and saving the world from his own weapons. The story definitely leaves everything wide open to serialize (they've already announced a sequel) but can they possibly re-create the same great team and story that they did for this one. To me, who had very low expectations, I have to feel like this was a big successful fluke that all these pieces fell into place but maybe I'm being pessimistic. Regardless Iron Man starts off the summer blockbusters with a huge bang and you won't be disappointed in the story, the action, the characters, the actors or anything else about it. I just found myself completely enthralled by the story as fantastical as it seems, somehow they found a way to make it real and bring it to life without it looking stupid and I thought that would be their real challenge but I was wrong. Iron Man is absolutely astounding!!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel is doing a damn fine job with putting their infamous comic book heroes on screen. Iron Man is definitely one of them!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is the most recent Marvel comic book superhero movie. It stars Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark, a genius weapons engineer who lives a life of fame and fortune. While in Afghanistan demonstrating his latest destructive bio-weapon, he is violently captured by terrorists. He wakes up in a cave within the mountains, and immediately the terrorists demand that he build them his new weapon. It is then that he realizes that his weapons are being used by not only the military, but terrorists as well. As weeks go by, instead of building a missile, Tony Stark builds an armor suit equipped with weapons. He escapes using the suit, destroys the camp, and is soon rescued by his friend Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), and brought back home. As soon as he's home, Tony decides that his industry will no longer make weapons. And he begins to work on a new, flashier red/gold version of his suit, and a more flyable one at that. Tony Stark realizes that he should protect the people he's put in harm's way, and does just that with his new suit under the name Iron Man. However a new foe faces Tony in his own business partner Obadiah Stone (Jeff Bridges). After Obadiah receives the blueprints for Tony's original suit, he builds his own, one that is not on the "good guy" side.Let me start off saying this is an excellent superhero movie. Robert Downey Jr really brings the main character to life, and even adds lots of wit and humor. That's pretty important because if the wrong actor is hired for the part of an infamous superhero, you can bet that will cause some problems (Fantastic Four for instance). Although Jeff Bridges gets a nice amount of screen time, his iron-suited villain unfortunately does not. But for the time he was shown, he was a very menacing and dangerous villain, and makes me wonder what the next villain is going to be. Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow, and the rest of the cast also bring a lot of heart to the film. That's another ingredient that's important in a superhero movie. If it's all just special effects and none of the heart the original character had, then comic book fans may be pretty disappointed. But Marvel Comics, now its own movie company, has done a pretty good job of maintaining excellence in their movies. That list includes Spider Man 1 and 2, X Men, The Punisher, Hulk. Now Iron Man can be added to that list as well.Iron Man is the jump start to the summer blockbuster season. The movie is filled with brilliant special effects, visuals, and lots of things that blow up! Just the right dosage of what everyone wants in a summer blockbuster. The action scenes were masterfully crafted and edited, and really bring a lot of justice to the original Iron Man comics. Anyone whose seen the commercials for this movie has seen a tank fire a shot at Iron Man, he stops, looks back, and fires an arm missile right back at the enemy tank. As Iron Man slowly walks away the tank explodes, and the thought pops up in our heads: This Movie is Awesome! Everything works to great effect in Iron Man whether it be the action, script, characters, actors, or the special effects. It may not be the best superhero movie ever, but who said it had to be. I give Iron Man a good 4.5/5. P.S. Stay after the credits?Samuel L. Jackson shows up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must mention that I had the idea that all good super heroes'films had gone. Also, it was my idea that they couldn't put together great effects and a great plot.Although, after watching Iron Man, I can just say that that idea of mine is gone. The plot is one of the best for a hero's movie, it clearly states a message that every people in this country who support war and destruction should take in consideration. Also, the effects are just superb! I might be wrong, but these effects can be compared with "Transformers" , because of the machinery used...Finally, I recommend Iron Man, because of the message of peace that gives us Tony Stark, also, since you cannot avoid the thought that, one day, ordinary people, like us, will fly just like Iron Man... I can't wait for it!</fullReview>

But i have to say even saying that i really enjoyed this movie to a certain degree. The biggest thing that i enjoyed the most about iron man was that it answered all your questions.questions like why he becomes iron man, how and what.but if you go walking into this movie hoping to see amazing action look somewhere else.but i must say Robert Downy Jr was awesome for this part.i really looking forward to see where they take this franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, kudos where kudos are due. First of all, the casting was really astute. Robert Downey, Jr. was an inspired choice for Tony Stark, and Jeff Bridges was a great Obadiah Stane.This movie was a ton of fun. Playful and intense by turns, highlighted by an exuberant performance from Downey. I enjoyed how the film allowed the visual effects to serve the plot, rather than becoming the point of the film. This choice of focus allowed you to really buy into the high-technology world of the film.The plot moved well, and spent just enough time between development of Stark's conscience, and the conflict that drives this origin story. In terms of developing a franchise, this was a terrific first step. Not to give too much away, but stay until the end of the credits for a peek into where things might be headed in future films.Definitely worth the price of admission!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good but a little unfilling climax *spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i did think Iron Man was good BUT, i thought the climax was a little unfilling the greater half of the movie was basically Tony Stark creating Iron Man and testing it out after he used a cheaper version to escape from terrorists. Of course in all of this you find out the bad guy is who we all thought was the "good guy" from the get go, which i wasn't expecting but did like the little plot twist, even though I'm not sure why Obadiah hated stark so much... but it's cool, no harm no foul.anywaysi thought the movie was good, the effects were well done the story was good blah blah blah my main concern was that the main battle between Iron Man and the protagonist was far too short the whole movie seemed like a build up to that fight but the fight was only about 7 minutes long so I was a little distraught by the thing and was really just left me wanting more, but knowing there's gonna be a sequel (of course) i guess that can make up for the fact that i still want more. Let's hope the sequel gives me what i want and doesn't leave me slumped back in my chair asking "is that it?" I mean the fight was good while it lasted, just way too short for that much of a build up (about an hour and a half).8/10 pretty good, go see it if not def rent it when it comes out its worth the watch indeedp.s. excuse all the spelling and grammar errors that are riddled throughout this review! English isn't my strong spot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't find anything wrong with this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It lives up to the comic book story and meshes well with modern events in the Middle East. The transformation of Tony Stark from philandering billionaire genius who seems to L-O-V-E his weapon creations a little too much, to a superhero trying to make things right- fills an emotional need for hope in these needlessly war-torn times. The mechanism of his epiphany, however enforced by captivity in a cave, is well developed in the movie. While at first I found Robert Downey Jr to be an unusual choice for the hero of the piece, he assumes the role well, although initially his mustache and hairstyle resembles a 1970s swinger or couch-casting producer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man is shiny, polished and moves at supersonic speeds, despite its heavy metal mentality...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- This Review was originally written for South Yorkshire Newspapers and featured on BBC Radio Sheffield Leeds and York - The May Day Bank Holiday always brings with it the first of the summer's blockbusters. Iron Man is not only first off the starting blocks, but also happens to be the first in 2008's onslaught of superhero movies, and notably, the first to be financed and produced by Marvel themselves. With one of their big name, heavyweight characters and a budget rumoured to be around $150m the comic house have a lot riding on the success of Iron Man. It is clear that they are aiming to establish a new franchise with this film, and with their forthcoming Incredible Hulk, there is plenty of potential for the kind of crossovers and exploration of the 'Marvel universe' that has so far been confined to comics format, presumably due to cost implications and licensing restrictions. At least fans of the source material know that their hero is in safe hands ? nobody is likely to treat Iron Man more faithfully than Marvel themselves.This new development has produced other benefits too; rather than cast the latest big name celebrity to gain exposure and column inches, Marvel have opted for actors that are renowned for their distinctive and award winning performances. Perhaps the most controversial casting so far has been Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark, Billionaire Genius Weapons Developer and the titular man of Iron. Stark is cocky, arrogant and every bit the swaggering billionaire playboy, but Downey Jr brings an enigmatic natural charisma that make him an absolute joy to behold. Downey Jr. is joined by 4 times Oscar nominee Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, (a politically astute director of Stark Industries and an old family friend who clearly has his own agenda) and Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's personal assistant and potential love interest; the unfortunately named Pepper Potts.The film kicks off with Stark being attacked and captured during a weapons demo in Afghanistan. Confined to a cave, his Taliban-esquire captors force him to go to work on building an advanced missile launching system, but, being a bit handy, he proceeds to go one better than the A-team and construct an armoured suit complete with all manner of makeshift weaponry in order to make his escape. This contraption forms the prototype for the legendary Iron Man suit, paving the way for some superb action sequences, with plenty to keep adrenaline junkies palpitating. The visual effects are never anything less than superb, as bright and stylised as the comics yet seamlessly convincing.Like the best examples of the superhero sub-genre; Batman Begins, the X-men and Spiderman franchises, the film is littered with in-jokes and references to keep the fan-boys happy, yet the movie remains accessible to all. There's plenty of humour, with a few truly laugh-out-loud moments that are most likely the hallmark of the director, Jon Favreau. He's better known for his comedy acting in episodes of Family Guy, My Name is Earl, and movies the Break-up (2006), and Open Season (2006) than his directorial efforts, but even when he's behind the camera his comedy talents tend to take precedent; most notably in the Will Ferrell break-out vehicle, Elf (2003). Iron Man earns Favreau serious kudos. Let's hope that he keeps a hold of the reigns for any sequels, as he strikes a perfect balance between tongue in cheek humour and being serious enough to add weight whilst avoiding the camp trappings Joel Schumacher's hammy Batman films.Whilst Stark's arsenal is undoubtedly impressive, it's difficult to shake the impression that Iron Man's not yet firing on all cylinders. This is most likely due to it being a tale of origins, building foundations and setting the scene for the films to follow, much like the first X-Men movie. The film has a very familiar story arc, a predictable, even clichéd structure, but it's executed with such flare that you can forgive it its comic conventions. It's rather apt that, like Stark's Alter ego, Iron Man is shiny, polished and moves at supersonic speeds, despite its heavy metal mentality. If this is a sign of the quality we can expect from the superhero films of 2008, then it's going to be one hell of a summer?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man is King of Comics on the Big Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know anything about Iron Man as a kid, nor did not have any intentions of seeing this movie. I had seen the trailers and just kind of ignored them. My friends persuaded me to go see it opening weekend and I said I would because it would be better than studying for exams. I was very surprised!!! It was way better than I expected. Iron Man takes you in during the first ten minuets and doesn't let up to the lights come on in the theater. Although I liked Transformers better, Iron Man's dialogue is more for an adult audience. The action isn't as much as I thought would be, but when there was, it was very solid. Robert Downey Jr. is hilarious as Tony Stark, so the comedic side was a bonus. The others in the cast were good, but not great. No holes in the plot of this movie. Relax and take the entertainment in and go see Iron Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironing out the issue of Downey as Hero, the stark reality is? He rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After nearly a year of self-imposed exile (still think I'm right about Norbit's casting), the Bajan cine-phile is back!The translation from Vietnam of the 60's to Afghanistan in the 21st century is an almost flawless juxtaposition with Stark's character remaining initially a devil-may-care genius and played with sardonic perfection by Robert Downey Jr!Robert actually has a deliberate shift from playboy to hero when he asks Pepper a dangerous favour, he makes a passionate explanation why he needs the favour and you realise the character of Stark is not as Devil-May-Care as before...Casting the guy who put soul into "Heart &amp; Souls," or making Ally McBeal far more interesting than the anorexic twerp of Callista Flockhart is top notch move - his real life trials and tribulations make him easy to accommodate Stark's tortured addictions only hinted in for the first chapter... I hope in reality Robert stays clean (For me his only flop was "The Singing Detective"), us '65-ers have to stick together!Terence Howard's interpretation of James Rhodes -aka- "Rhodey" is more of a shuck &amp; jive sidekick than was played in the comics, but by the end of the picture, his character was more what we came to know over the years.Aspects of the original Iron Man and the Bob Layton version came through loud &amp; clear as well as the Ultimates Marvel incarnation, it was easy to forgive the lack of "Happy" Hogan...Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger was actually plotted better than the comics, his presence in the dead-tree version simply as a foil for Tony was sudden as I recall - but here as the virtual 2nd father of Tony made huge sense. Rather than a villain, I think he feels rejected for saving a company from dropping out of the top 5 in the Fortune 500!Yet Tony is guilty from seeing in Kandahar and elsewhere what his weapons artwork has done to disrupt others' lives, rather than perpetuate it and having been at the end of his own medicine - he decides to make amends and thus Iron Man's purpose!The technology displayed such as the mini-guns in his shoulders or the telemetry on glass is magnificent, it can be hilarious when he tried repulsor boots at ten per cent power, instead of using one per cent in the 1st place, LOL!If Stark no longer does weapons, then he will have to be cutting edge in medicine or other similar applications like mobile or laptop technologies, which was hinted by placing a child version of himself near a young Bill Gates. This, despite the use of Apple desktops and laptops throughout the whole film!I hope that Pepper and Tony do NOT get involved, the Moneypenny/Bond frisson is much better for the flow of the project, especially if it goes beyond 2010!The movie has many fantastic one-liners like "Good Dog," addressed to Butterfingers, the semi-dopey robot trying to help save Tony's life; or?(Trying to create a miniature Arc Reactor like Tony's pacemaker, Stane hires a battery of scientists and is clearly frustrated when no results are forthcoming...) STANE: What do you mean it's impossible? (Angrily points to huge machine) Stark built a tiny version of this out of scrap metal in a cave, for crying out loud! SCIENTIST: Sir, I am not Tony Stark!The flight sequences in the movie make "Top Gun" look like "Top Dud" and have you on the edge of your seat! The movie also does a good job in laying the groundwork for Avengers, Captain America, S*H*I*E*L*D and even interaction with other Marvel Universe people. As always, Stan Lee's cameo was a guffaw-maker - this time compared with Hugh Hefner!This film is not only worth its weight in GOLD but IRON too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright! a good superhero movie. Robert Downey Jr. made this film for me with his fantastic delivery of his lines to his portrayal as a regretful billion dollar weapons manufacturer this movie is just all around good if not great. However it must be said that without Downey Jr. this film just wouldn't be very good. All the other performances are somewhat bland, their not awful just not memorable. The movie is thoroughly entertaining and is refreshing to have a superhero that is not just one big action scene after another as a matter of fact the action doesn't even pick up until the last 30 minutes and before that they are few and far between, which may turn some off, not me. anyway this movie is great, definitely check it out</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We meet Tony Stark after he is on his way back from showing a newly designed weapon to the military bras in Afganistan. His armored vehicle is attacked, he is seriously wounded and taken captive by terrorists. He survives although he does now need a device to keep shrapnel out of his heart! With the help of another prisoner he eventually manages to escape and he vows that from now on he's going to protect the people he put in harm's way first! This does not sit well with his company after all they've made a fortune designing and selling weapons!So how do you make a fairly standard super-hero something special? Simple! Hire Robert Downey Jr. The man never looked better and with all his real-life antics (now in the past) it's easy to forget that he is this very, very gifted actor! He simply steals the show as playboy go do-gooder! He makes Tony human, he gives the movie lots of dry humor and some really funny slapstick moments! Oh there are other good actors too. Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and a completely wasted Terrence Howard! Now try and find a really great story for the sequel and it can only get better!

The plot was a little crazy but any kid who wants to see an action packed movie should see this.But this movie isn't just for kids/teens. Any Adult that likes action movies or really any kind of movie would like Iron Man.The only reason I didn't give it a perfect score is that the sexual scene was unnecessary.It also gets a little slow during the middle, however makes up for it with humor through-out and action at the beginning and end.This is probably Marvels best movie yet so any Marvel fan would enjoy it.Overall it is a good movie.</fullReview>

I well say I was very shocked how this film turned out. Robert Downey Jr. is certainly the best thing about this movie and definite going to be the comeback for this actor. All the other actors do a good job but nothing compared to Robert. The special effects are really good and so is the editing. When the Iron Man song kicks in at the end of the movie is awesome. Really the big Bad thing abut this movie is the first 15 minutes is just awful and not funny, but after that the film makes you laugh, excites you and entertains you just what a summer blockbuster should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is a live action version of the comic book series featuring characters created by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby. The film focuses on a rich weapons manufacturer named Tony Stark, who while on a business trip to Afghanistan, is kidnapped and forced to work on illegal weapons. With the help of a doctor who was also held captive, Tony eventually creatures a robotic body filled with different defence techniques and weapons, which he uses to escape and get back to America. Now back in America, and surviving a near fatal experience Tony, puts away his wild lifestyle and focuses on getting rid of weapons and making the world a safer place. Eventually, Tony has to put on the robotic suit once again to fight an evil co-worker and protect the city and world from weapons and evil. Lots of action and a build up to a probable sequel follow. Normally superhero action films aren't usually the kind of film that I pay much attention to, but within the last little while there have been some above average superhero films made and Iron Man, joins the team of successful ones. The film works on a large part because of Robert Downey Jr's top notch performance where at once he plays an arrogant and spoiled playboy to becoming a good hearted protector of things gone bad, so either way his snappy performance pulls it off quite well like it does in most of the films he stars in. The script the filmmakers have to work with is fairly intelligent and combines a look at the different characters in the film and much to my liking focuses more on them and has quite a good build up before it gets into action and special effects. More time is spent with the characters and how Tony, becomes Iron Man, and I much preferred this to a non stop special effects extravaganza. Even when there is action scenes they do the job of entertaining and don't go overboard by being too long, or too overblown by special effects, so that worked for me as well. While, I didn't think the supporting performances were quite as good as Downey's performance, they still held their own and for a film like this Oscar calibre performances aren't totally necessary even though what Downey pulls off is gold. I liked the pace of the film and thought it moved along quite well and for a film of this type I think the writers and filmmakers did a pretty good job of making something that could be loud, tedious and non stop with special effects into a more compelling and human story that combines the typical superhero movie elements, but does it well due to good timing, writing and direction. A good entry into this summer's movie schedule and an overall pleasant surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man: Perfect everything, perfect cast, top notch visual effects, outstanding directing and solid script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***I just saw Iron Man in theaters with a friend. After a long wait I was able to see one of the few superhero movies that made it to the top 250 IMDb films of all time list. And that was what made me see the movie. It had an 8.3 user ratings and compared to other superhero movies, that's very high. The film was absolutely great. Let me start with the cast. Robert Downey Jr., who played Iron man/Tony Stark, is an Oscar nominated actor for the movie Chaplin back in 1992. Terrence Howard is a great actor who also was nominated for an academy award, so was Jeff Bridges, for 4 Oscars in fact. And who could forget the shining star of Shakespeare in Love, Gwyneth Paltrow, who walked home with an academy award for her lead role in the movie, Shakespeare in Love. The point I am trying to make is that the major stars of this movie have either won or been nominated for an academy award, which is what Terrence Howard stated when he was being interviewed for the movie premiere. The fact that Iron Man is filled with this talented cast made the movie huge before it even hit the theaters. And when it did hit the theaters the audience flew like a river to see what this cast has to deliver. My personal favorite character in the movie, though I don't want it to sound obvious, is Tony Stark. I liked him because he was witty and most of the time relaxed, even though he runs a huge company, and even though he is in a serious or tense situation he still manages to brighten his and his colleagues' day with humor. Especially there is this one scene where he shows up at a press conference with a cheese burger. The other cast members were also cool. Gwyneth Paltrow plays a convincing and attractive assistant of Tony Stark and Terrence Howard delivers a solid performance by playing Jim Rhodes, a guy in charge of the weaponry in the U.S. army. I also enjoyed Jeff Bridges' performance playing this seemingly nice guy who later turns out to be evil, though I did have a problem with that character, which I will discuss later. As far as the directing, Kudos Jon Favraeu. Perfect and consistent shots throughout the movie, unlike "The Kingdom"(2007), where the camera was too close to the actors' faces that sometimes part of their faces was cut out. Not that I am saying The Kingdom was bad, I am just saying that there was something wrong with the cameraman. Alright back to Iron Man, Iron Man has stunning visuals. The visual effects supervisors should be really proud of themselves. All the scenes seemed so real that at some point I stopped believing that I was watching a movie and started thinking that this is some sort of documentary with real people in it doing real stuff. That's how much convincing the visuals were.Now I can tell you a movie that had fake and easily noticeable visuals, "The Matrix Reloaded"(2003). Remember the scene were Neo was fighting the agents, and it was him by himself and the agents were exponentially increasing in number? Anybody who's not blind can tell That scene was totally made up of CGI shots, I noticed that the very first time I saw the movie, though I am not complaining about those CGI shots, I am just saying that They should have at least attempted to make it seem believable.I was watching the behind the scenes footage of Iron Man on TV Guide network the other day and Jon Favraeu was mentioning how they had to fight against nature to film the desert scenes, which proved to me the authenticity of the movie. All the scenes, as I mentioned in the previous paragraph, seemed so real, and I could not tell which scene was CGI and which wasn't. I loved every scene in the movie from beginning to the very end.Let me back away from all the positives of the movie and tell you the one negative thing that made me give the movie a 9/10 rating. The one thing I did not like about the movie is that Iron Monger/Obadiah Stone (played by Jeff Bridges) did not get enough time to display his evilness. There are only a few scenes were Mr. Stone is shown as the evil Iron Monger. Other than that for the most part, we only saw a friendly and nice Obadiah Stone that was Tony Stark's ally. Nevertheless, The fact that Jeff Bridges' evil character did not get enough screen time did not stop the movie from having a lot of action. Most of the action in the movie occurs in the second half of the movie, like most movies. And believe me, it has some good butt-kicking. Advanced weaponry that aren't seen anywhere else, voice activated robots, tactable holograms so on and so forth. Now, I've been hearing these rumors and have also seen on IMDb that there is going to be an Iron Man 2. You know what they say, sequels aren't as good as the first ones. Prove me wrong, Paramount, Marvel, Jon Favraeu and whoever else is going to be involved in the second movie. As to the first one, it was two hours of my life and the money paid to go see it well spent. I recommend this film to whoever wants to see an action-packed, comic book based, superhero movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank god for Robert Downey Jr.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, thanks god for Robert Downey Jr., the actor was brilliant in the movie, after watching the movie i couldn't imagine any other actor portraying the role of tony stark, the guys was simply brilliant.I had gone for this movie with a couple of my friends and we were sitting in our recliner chair with leather seats and a bag of popcorn and were ready for the ride. TO be honest i was a little disappointed with climax of the film. Come on guys, another movie based on a marvel comic hero i guess i was expecting a little too much after Spider Man.The Movie starts off brilliantly with Tony Stark having a ride with the military in the deserts of Afghanistan and suddenly gets attacked and captured and how he builds his first iron man suit in a cave and escapes was just brilliant. Another scene that i loved was the one with Gwyneth Paltrow when she says its her birthday. A couple of lovely action scenes well choreographed i have to say but when u start comparing it with likes of transformers which had a huge ending and the likes of the spider man series (especially the second installment) one gets a little disappointed with the climax of this movie.In all, i would give this movie a good 7/10 and nice action flick with some amazing moments and a pretty good supporting star cast of Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard doing justice to their respective roles but the film totally belongs to Robert Downey Jr. who plays the role of tony stark to perfection from being a workaholic/womanizer/party animal and transforming himself into this superhero ..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is a great night out.Robert Downey JNR delivers a fun packed cocksure performance that will have you laughing out loud on a few occasions.Fans of the comic book must be delighted with his interpretation of Tony Stark. He truly brings the character to life and provides us with of the best comic book to film translations in memory.The visual effects are also outstanding and the film is very cleverly directed.The film goes a little 'Transformers' towards the end but on the whole it is a thrilling ride and has set the bar at a high level for the rest of the summer blockbusters to try and beat. Great stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He's Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron man is an interesting film in the fact that it deals more with the character and less with the action. DOn't get me wrong, the movie has action, but with Robert Downey Jr. in the title role of TOny Stark/Iron Man, he steals the show and makes Iron Man a pleasant surprise for fans of the character and the comic book. I enjoyed this movie.THe movie starts with Stark (Downey Jr.) talking with American troops in a Hummer in the Middle East. THese first scenes set the character perfectly and lead to the goods that follow. He is at once humorous and likable, and this continues throughout the film's running length. THey are of course attacked. All the troops are killed and Stark, who is a weapon's expert, is taken prisoner by a terrorist group who has used his own weapons against him and America. THe group forces him to build a weapon they can use against their enemies, but he instead creates a suit of armor which he then uses to attack his captures and escape.Once back in America, Stark realizes that the weapons he thought he was developing to help America are being sold to America's enemies. He decides that he must create a suit of armor, like the one he created in the Middle East, to help America and stop the enemy from harming more people. THat is how Iron Man is created, and it goes through two more upgrades before he finally gets the armor to where he wants it.THis movie hits on a lot of issues that are effecting the world today. One of them, and probably the biggest one in the movie, is the corruption that factors into everything. A strong jab is made at the US weapon's industry, and it had a profound effect on me. THe movie makes some strong points about why America is probably struggling, and it all factors into the corruption of the corporate elite and how they will sell their souls to make a buck. It sickening but oh so true.THe director, Jon Favereau, never preaches this, but just lets the viewer know, with subtle hints, that not everything is the rest of the world's fault. It's good, great even, but it's too bad he can't do action as well, which brings me to my next point.The action in Iron Man is there, but it is never in your face like many other blockbuster action films. It is more of a drama than anything. If Downey Jr. didn't pull off the part so well, as well as the rest of the supporting cast which includes Terence Howard as Jim Rhodes, Gwneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, and Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, this movie might not have made the money it has so far. THey hold the movie together and keep you focused on the characters, and you never really notice how very little action there is. Of course this is an origin story, so maybe the director will do better with the sequel, that is if he comes back to do the sequel.I liked the movie, I liked the performances by all, but Iron Man could've used a little bit more of a kick-ass sense that would of made it an instant classic. Still, it's hard to argue with what we get with Iron Man. It is definitely one of the best Super Hero movies since Spider Man 2, and Batman Begins. And on a final note, make sure you stay until the end credits to see something special and very interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly great super hero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man was one of the first super heroes that Stan Lee came up in the early sixties. He also was one of the original Avengers, Marvel's answer to DC's Justice League which of itself updated version of the Justice Society that began in the forties. He never was a particular favorite of mine. He seemed too much like a robot. In that, his suit contained all the super powers he could have. His alter ego, Tony Stark, stripped of his suit, had no super powers of his own except for his genius for making such a suit. With a weakened heart, he couldn't even be match for his counterpart in DC, Bruce Wayne. a.k.a. Batman. There's actually a precursor of Iron Man in cinema though in comics, he came first. That precursor was RoboCap, a supercop who became for robot than man. In fact, there's a least two scenes that directly the earlier superhero but done differently enough. John Favreau has made successes in making comedies. He does show a great comedic touch is directing the script written by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, the later who's from India, assuring the Aghanistan are treated as people and their plight of villagers shown. But it's the casting that really works here. Robert Downey, Jr., plays Tony Stark as a spoiled playboy millionaire who's able to deadpan the most chauvinistic lines with a straight face. Gyneth Paltrow is also very good as Pepper Potts (what a name!) who plays his assistant, which includes taking out the trash, meaning some beautiful woman that Stark beds then instantly forgets. Actually, why she would any interest in him at all is a problem with the script, not her performance as she does come across as very smart even when she's playing the damsel in distress. The main antagonist is played by Jeff Bridges, who's obviously enjoying himself and even looking a bit like Bruce Willis with his shaved head and goatee. The BBF (Black Best Friend) falls on Terrance Howard's shoulders who at one point sees an outfit and says to himself "Not this time." Well, there's no secret as of this writing that there is going to be an Iron Man 2. What was really unexpected was if one said a few years ago that Downey would helm one of the best super heros made, that would have seemed impossible. He has the rare quality to be likable when he's doing the most rude things. How he ends the movie almost makes one stand up and cheer. The movie also gives an interesting question. Can peace be achieved by using the military correctly? As this is 2008, creating war weapons is big business and that is actually the business Tony Stark is in to make his billions. Will he find the heart to do what's right? To even have such a question come up is not bad for a comic book movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody is talking about Robert Downey Jr. now. Finally!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr. is one of those actors who can offer a lot more then he's given chances to prove himself (like Matt Damon). It's mostly because of his drug and alcohol problems but no one cannot deny that he's an outstanding actor who never acted in big budget movies. Not until now. Now he's Iron Man and his career suddenly blossom. Sadly you have to act in well accepted blockbusters to became widely known and appreciated actor. People didn't think of Johnny Depp as big star until 'Pirates' (of course there are few of us who are his loyal fans since "A Nightmare on Elm Street" or "Cry-Baby"). So, I really can say that Robert Downey Jr. is type of actor I like since I saw him in "Chaplin". But lets concentrate on this movie and not on right or wrong sides of Hollywood A-list actors.Based on Marvel comic "Iron Man" is a story about Tony Stark, a wealthy industrialist and master engineer who builds a powered exoskeleton so he can escape from people who are holding him in captive. They want from Tony to build them a Jericho missile, like the one his company is being creating. Soon, Tony escapes and he decides to modify his design so he can help the world.Jon Favreau was obviously given a lot of money and he invested it wisely. Although I'm not a fan of blockbusters this one as a movie is a good one. Comic is successfully brought to life. "Iron Man" has its holes, like not so convincing start but everything since the time Stark returned from his captivity is good and entertaining story. As I said before Downey Jr. is a thing this movie needs, just like always excellent Jeff Bridges in role of Obadiah Stane. In this cast I didn't like Gwyneth Paltrow. She acted terrible. She's obviously not into acting and as I read, the only reason she accepted this role is that filming was close to her house and her children. Oh and Clark Gregg has that plastic face and everybody was laughing at him in the cinema (how did he stayed alive in the movie when Iron Monger strikes at his fellow agents???) So "Iron Man" is good for fun and as blockbuster that would fill cinemas, but for a place in 250 best movies, I think not. I don't want to talk about some views of American politics in this movie (like the one that Stark shows when he's destroying his weapon that they sold to other countries). I will just say that that could happen only on movie. So at the end, I hope you'll enjoy in this movie and too all the critics - this movie is made for people who wants to have fun, and you mostly cannot talk about Hollywood blockbusters as movie masterpieces (there are very few exceptions of course). So my advice is to take "Iron Man" for what it is. Just a good movie and solid fun for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy Superhero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ironman's alter ego (Tony Stark) is a millionaire, playboy, genius/inventor with an off color sense of humor. Underneath his egotistical, cynical, comedic exterior is a noble heart for the larger things in life such as world peace. He even has Gwyneth Paltrow as an assistant who does ALL to service and please him. As Ironman he is the invincible beast who crushes the "evil doers" like flies, soars through the air at supersonic speed to wherever he wants and has a sleek hotrod suit with all the gadgets you would want. Not only is he the superhero inside the suit but he is the inventor as well. This is the ideal fantasy superhero, the type of superhero you would want to be and that is the fun of it. Smartly made in a not to be taken too seriously fashion since the overall mood is tongue and cheek, contains moments of Three Stooges type slapstick (when he first attempts to upgrade his suit), and the unlikely superhero Robert Downey Jr. plays Ironman. All this means fun which prevails over the predictability and redundancy of this superhero movies. This is another scientist who instead of mutating to something supersonic builds his mechanical organism. Then the typical superhero movie formula ensues and it is just somewhat interesting. Despite being only somewhat interesting particularly since it doesn't have a very interesting character study with a history (like Batman and Spiderman do) and it lacks a cast of idiosyncratic villains (unlike Batman or Spiderman) it is still fun, well done and well directed. You'll have fun watching this fantasy play-out</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected nothing from this movie but when i watched it in the cinema i was gratefully surprised. Even more having watched other of the latest hero-movies that really suck.The starring character's personality is very defined and he has an intelligent humor that i like very much. The rest of the characters are not so important, but the only presence of Gwyneth Paltrow is always grateful, as well as the acting is more than correct.About the story... well i haven't read the comics but i find it acceptable for being a superhero movie. The only part that i didn't like at all was the ending... i think we have enough fights between "the good and the bad" (Transformers, Fantastic For sagas, The incredible Hulk soon...) and they always finish in the same way.Special effects are awesome, i enjoyed the use of technology to explain certain things. It makes it a little more real.Totally recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man propels himself to the big screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not the biggest Iron Man fan of the comics, however, I usually only see comic book movies these days so I of course had to see this one. In the end I was happy with the result. The story, is the origins of Iron Man so you basically get to witness the events that made Tony Stark the leader of his own company who is a bit fly by night kind of guy is also quite immature into someone willing to risk his life to save people across the world as Iron Man. You get to see the suite take life and all that good stuff. As usual with Marvel adaptations you get some good humor as well as I really enjoyed the scenes of him testing out his suit and trying to perfect flight. Robert Downey Jr. is quite frankly very good here. He portrays someone that is good at just building devices seemingly at will very good as I would expect someone like that to be kind of high energy. You also get to see in this movie a rather good fight at the end too. However, I do have a complaint...and although it did not make me hate the movie or anything it did make me not give this movie a ten. I would have liked to have seen a bit more Iron Man functioning at 100% a bit more. I just rather him be at full force in that last battle as he seemed like he would be the underdog even if he was fully charged. A minor complaint to say the least, but I just thought I would bring it up. However, the ending was rather good and different, nice to see a super hero movie not end with the hero flying off or sitting on a rooftop for a change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very well acted super-hero movie - with a mixed bag of bad and amazing visuals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot : Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) - multi-millionaire weapon designer : is captured by terrorist during a new weapon demonstration. He invents a robotic iron suit to escape the terrorist and once he gets back to America , he is a changed man.Story : Although I do know of Iron Man - what he looks like , his back story. I've never read an Iron Man comic , nor can I tell you a single one of his enemies - so I couldn't go through this movie saying "hey it's that guy". That aside , the movie is played out very well and owes a lot to it's cast. Tony Stark arrives back in the U.S and announces that his weapons manufacturing company will no longer make weapons - this does not go over well with his business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who tries his best to take Stark out of the picture. Though I did "like" the majority of the movie - the amazing stuff starts happening once his new Iron Man suit is complete.Visuals : This is a very mixed bag visual movie. On one hand you got some very good camera work that captures the environment and characters , but sometimes you get bombarded with close ups or very sub-par camera angles. Once you are viewing the CGI parts though - all these problems disappear and the movie looks amazing (including the great action scenes). I only wish that director Jon Favreau could make the whole film look like that.Synopsis : A very well acted super-hero movie makes up for the sometimes very poor visuals - but once you add the amazing CGI action scenes on top of this : you get a very entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong early summer entrant(not to mention a lot of fun)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My bias in Superhero Comic characters made into movies sides mostly with DC,so my familiarity with a fair amount of the Marvel world is somewhat light. Particularly with Iron Man,so my learning curve on this show was in one part helped by a friend of mine who IS a MArvel fanatic and in another--a much bigger one--in this movie.I'd say I did okay in that regard. Better than OK.The transformation of debauchery-loving rich kid/gifted inventor and demi-genius Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.,fantastic!) from cynical war profiteer to wounded crusader on a mission(via his creation and film's namesake,of course)is somewhat of a slow one,as he survives a kidnap attempt in Afghanistan and has to use his smarts and the equipment he's given to escape,not to mention the help of a equally gifted translator(Shaun Taub,underrated),but that's okay. Downey's arch,oh-so-real acting and perfectly glib persona makes his reform interesting and even fun to watch so that by the time the finished version of Stark's creation comes to fruition,it doesn't seem like much of a wait at all IMHO. With the help of his loyal and attractive(also attracted)assistant Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow,someone I'd sorta forgotten how luminescent and lovely she really can be before seeing this movie),he strives to use his nascent technology for good rather than evil,which naturally will incur resistance from within.Great supporting turns by Terence Howard as Tony's associate and erstwhile friend,Jeff Bridges as Tony's mentor and potentially shadowy menace and Clark Gregg as a tight-lipped fed make director Jon FAvreau's job helming this adaptation a HUGELY better result than the wan,flavorless "DareDevil" from 2003. THis is a satisfying film from at least three levels: for those who love superhero movies,it's great;for those who enjoy a good message movie,it's only BARELY preachy and always able to keep it frenetic and true;and as a summer film,it's large and captivating,never letting the viewer go till the credits(and perhaps even STILL during that)! While I cannot quite go all the way with a ten for this film,it's a very strong nine. A strong movie-going experience for most anyone who likes "Summer" films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Entertaining Superhero Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came into the theater looking for Harold and Kumar tickets, expecting a light and silly comedy, but unfortunately, it was sold out. However, I was in for a surprise as I half-heartedly bought "Iron Man" tickets...The plot and pacing is quite different from other Superhero flicks. Granted, all Superhero movies have some similarities, but this was often a far-cry from many of the unrealistic, somewhat laughable superhero movies we see today. The villains are not as defined as some of the others, but that may actually a positive in this film. Instead of seeing Spiderman fight the Green Goblin for 150 minutes, you get to enjoy a great plot and very solid character development for the protagonist. But don't worry, you get some great action sequences as well.The acting overall was solid. Robert Downey Jr. owned his role as Tony Stark, the weapons genius/mogul. He played his part close to flawlessly, and often carried this film. Jeff Bridges also had a noteworthy performance as Obadiah Stone. I must say Gwyneth Paltrow has some rough moments, and this definitely wasn't her best performance, but she didn't bring down the film by any means.The special effects were very slick, and the visuals were stunning as expected. I must admit, the film does drag on a little at times, and as I mentioned before, the movie does not progress at a break-neck pace like some Superhero flicks. Still, it was very entertaining and I highly recommend seeing it.</fullReview>

There is plenty of character arc, with hints at more for characters outside of Tony Stark.Across the board, excellent performances. Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark to the maximum. He is everything you would think Tony Stark would be if he were really alive. Jeff Bridges literally hides behind a bald head. Paltrow does a very good job of playing the in the wings smart girl who loves our hero.The special effects are better than I expected. From the shots seen in trailers, I wasn't sure about them. But they are seamless throughout the film.The ending is great, it leaves you satisfied yet wanting more. This is how a smart movie is made. Let's not just call it a comic book movie.

		<fullReview>I'm not a comic book aficionado, so I judge movies like this on whether they deliver a good story. I was especially struck by the good reviews given the performances. The reviews were right on.Even before his captivity, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) comes across as interesting despite his gazillion bucks. He jokes and schmoozes with the troops in his convoy. He bonds with his fellow captive. So it's believable that he comes out of the experience changed.Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect as his Girl Friday, exuding a perfect mix of loyalty, competence, bemused contempt at her boss's hedonism and sardonic humor. The red hair is a nice touch. And that name! Pepper Potts! I have to go back to Goldfinger and Pussy Galore to find a name that perfect.There are some marvelous comic scenes as Stark tries to work the bugs out of his super-suit and trades barbs with his AI robots.I do concur with the folks who thought a battle with a malevolent robot was a bit of an anti-climax after single handedly liberating a village. Thus the 9 instead of a 10.Rarely have I seen a film with so many things protruding from the ending plainly labeled "attach sequel here." Stark and Potts have a thing for each other but they still hesitate. Rhodie will get a suit of his own. SHIELD will have missions for Stark. And reporter Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb) is plainly interested in Stark. Some commentators felt Bibb was underutilized in the role. Fear not. We have not seen the last of the yummy Ms. Bibb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more then a summer film, it's pure genius!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyonce and a while, a film that is very smart and unique arrives under the title of "box office film". This is that film. Iron Man is truly the best Super-Hero film since Batman Begins. Robert Downey Jr. not only makes this very unlikeable character likable, he makes him all his own without taking away the comic counterpart's traits that made us love him in the first place. Everyone has perfect comic timing, with Terrence Howard being a riot. Also, Paltrow is perfect as Pepper Pots, she nails that likable character who just wants to be normal and I truly enjoyed how she didn't become the usual love-interest.Iron Man has what Batman Begins had, the patience to show how things work instead of just getting the suit on. The training scenes added a sense of realism and made for some great humor. Faverau knows how to pace this film, because it has a amazing pace for a summer film. It mixes the action, humor and plot well so it doesn't seem like a film that changes genres every few minutes. Bridges is a good villain but at points lacked that menacing quality.The main problem with it is a plot problem. Why would Stane make a bigger suit without testing it out first? Why did he even get the suit and put it on? It just seemed a little flawed at that point but it's forgivable.The effects Iron Man has are very creative. I liked how they didn't CGI ever single shot of the film. It was great to see some practical effects for once and the action was top notch and fit the characters so it never seemed out of place.I think Iron Man is much more then a summer film, it's truly a work of genius with perfect acting, great timing and pace along with some stellar action scenes. Move over Spidey, this is a real hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In much the same way that Ron Perlman's inspired performance made "Hellboy" better than it would otherwise have been, Robert Downey, Jr. helps "Iron Man" be something beyond the standard superhero junk fests that become popular every year around this time. Downey is perfectly cast, though I never would have thought of him for the character he plays here, tycoon of a weapons manufacturing company who suffers pangs of conscience after seeing what his terrible weapons can do, and turns himself into the ultimate weapon so that he can stop others from using them.Gwyneth Paltrow is Downey's assistant and love interest, and it's a bit of a shame to see such a smart actress stuck with such a dud role as this. She stands around in heels and looks worried while Downey tries to save her.Jeff Bridges, shaved bald and sporting a bushy beard, is the movie's villain, and if the movie has a major failing, it's him. Bridges is fine in the role, but the villain himself isn't particularly menacing, and the final showdown is anticlimactic.Be sure to sit through the end credits for a brief scene that promises a sequel.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a decent superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man avoids many of the embarrassing clichés of the previous superhero movies. You know what I mean; the hour of boring explanation why the hero really needs to become more interesting, the pause half-way to ponder Responsibility or Redemption or whatever, the troubled love relations that doesn't make sense. Go away, says this movie, and what's left is entertainment, pure and simple.Although much of Iron Man contains the usual first-movie-in-series introducing and presenting, it is really funny and makes for solid entertainment. Unusual for a superhero movie. This is much thanks to the actors, all of them great but none as amazing as Robert Downey Jr. Still nervously babbling, but now with a touch of insufferable wealth and technical genius, we couldn't ask for a more pleasant performance. How this basically loathsome character can be so likable is all thanks to the writers and Downey Jr.There isn't an overdose of CGI either. Animatronic models where built and sets where constructed, which looks amazing in many scenes. The Iron Man suit itself looks superb and for once, I found myself thinking "man, that looks real" instead of "man, that looks cool"(or more often "man, that looks fake"). Is Iron Man special or have we finally breached some sort of barrier here? The up-coming Hulk spectacle answers that question nicely: No, CGI still sticks out like a clown penguin. I guess Iron Man got lucky.All in all, Iron Man is better than most A-level superhero movies such as the Batman reboot or Spiderman. It is fun, engaging and clever, sometimes relatively original, and very, very likable. Go see it in the cinema while you have time.</fullReview>

Ohhhhh Maaan, Robert Downey Jr. was just perfect in the role of Tony Stark, and of course Iron Man. Of course the other actors weren't bad at all, but I must say that R. Downey Jr. nailed it as a smart-ass rich-boy, with no concern what so ever of the consequences of his extremely successful weapon company.Another plus to this movie is of course the special effects, anyone who has seen this, regardless of their opinion about the story and the acting must agree with me on this one, they were very good.So if you like action from the beginning, acting in the highest class, and great special effects... I recommend You to watch this one :-) 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better superheros</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this movie today afternoon, and this movie ranks right next to batman begins in the list of superhero movies. The pace is perfect, at no point does one feel that the movie has been overdone- perfect for people who want to watch action and those who want to have an interesting story and not to much of gun shooting.Downie does a great job of being the iron man. The rest of the cast was did a fair job too. The story is about the rich man Tony (Downie), an owner of a company selling weapons who is captured by the very people to whom he sells the weapon and realizes that instead of creating weapons for destruction, he should use them in order to help people. All in all, a must see, and the ticket's worth. It was good to see Gwenth Paltrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't know what to expect, I wasn't a fan of Iron Man comics...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel, creator of the best superheroes. Surely that can be debated but it's my blog and so my opinion is correct. Anyway, so Marvel have created my favourite superheroes (and villains) - Spiderman, X-Men, The Incredible Hulk, Ghost Rider, Silver Surfer, Nick Fury and many more. But I've never really been one for Iron Man, he just never appealed to me so I went into the cinema knowing next to nothing about the character or the comic.So I sat down eating my tub of Malteasers and the first thing I heard is AC/DC blasting through the speakers - that is when I knew this had to be a good film, but would that first impression last on me? So the scene takes place in Afghanistan where our main character Tony Stark, famous for building technology (mostly weapons) he's a pretty realistic character I would say, he's hard working but always has his eye out for the ladies and is quite the comedian. So as he's being driven, the characters have a few jokes and laughs which leads you into a false sense of security as something attacks. The next thing we know, Tony is being held captive but we don't know by who or why, but we can safely assume that in this period of time he is close to becoming Iron Man.Then we have a flashback, I thought this was very clever. The writer had taken into account that the first in superhero films lose attention from the audience when taking too long to unleash the superhero in our characters so this flashback held the attention of the audience. A smart move indeed.We now see an insight into the rather carefree world of Tony Stark and meet a few of the charatcers (Tony's friends and assistants) and learn how they act and what they are like. I'd like to point out that it is here that we start to see the realism in the character of Tony Stark.Eventually we get back (or forward) to the time when Tony Stark is kidnapped. It appears his kidnappers wanted him to re-make the most powerful weapon - The Jericho. Tony has no choice but to agree, but what a man says and what a man does are two different things...Throughout this film there are actually three Iron Man's. Mark I, Mark II and Mark III, the latter which is the most famous and the one Tony Stark dons permanently. Now, this being an origin superhero movie this would naturally mean there isn't as much time to develop a villain and they're objective for doing what evil they are doing so unfortunately this leaves the rest of the film from after he makes Mark III a little rushed.Now I'm not gonna reveal anymore of the story in detail but I will now focus on the aspects of the film. I've never really seen Robert Downey Jr as a valued actor before but this film really shined a new light on him, he actually kind of reminded me of Johnny Depp both looks wise and expression wise. Gwenyth Paltrow didn't give such a satisfying performance unfortunately, but after reading why she took the job I can perhaps she why (she only accepted the role because the studio was 15 minutes away from her house).This is a film I think you should definitely go and see, it's fun and entertaining. And for those big Marvel fanboy geeks, such as myself, then stay after the credits as they'll be a clip that should either erect you out of excitement or just make it hard to wait for a film coming out in 2011...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm probably getting old, but Speed Racer tired me and somewhere in the middle of Iron Man I found it a bit slow. Either that or I experience burnout from wallowing in the pre-release internet publicity of both movies. Some people are saying that this Iron Man is better than Batman Begins. Yes, in one aspect, I think Robert Downey is a better actor than Bale. They are both quite good, but I give more points to Downey for being self-deprecating and funnier, plus, his personal history outside the movie adds to the baggage (actual positive baggage!) he brings to this role. Very inspired acting, aside from the fact he's quite qualified to do the role anyway. I do prefer the basic story of Batman over Iron Man. A Batman story relies on atmospherics (hence the use of a bat, and the generally dark tone of most of movies and comics). He also uses a bit of deductive reasoning in combating crime. Tony Stark is an inventor, and his suit is a wonderful toy, but Iron Man's antagonists aren't that inspired (except maybe the Mandarin). The comic's best story arc are Stark battling his personal demons. I like the way Favreau makes his fanboy homages so integrated to the movie. Not being aware of them won't detract a whit from a newcomer's experience, but knowing about them will send a fanboy to nirvana. In any case, exemplary work. My rating of an 8 may seem too low for a positive review, but I'm a bit of a contrarian. To me, the best comic book movie was The Incredibles, and I'm in the minority holding that opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a bit difficult to tell sometimes, isn't it? We all turn up for these summer movies hoping for the best, often leaving the theatre with a crashing sense of disappointment (Superman Returns) or downright anger (The Mummy Returns, Planet of The Apes remake). However on the odd occasion somebody somewhere gets it right, and Iron Man is one of those moments.Firstly, The story actually has some weight. Tony Stark, armaments manufacturer and inventor of weapons of mass destruction, re-evaluates his shallow life when he's almost fatally injured while demonstrating a new missile system in Afghanistan; and we all know what he's doing there, don't we? He ain't writing Shakespearean love sonnets...Designing a Titanium Alloy - only a little bit of the title metal is used - exo-skeleton to preserve his life after his military convoy comes under attack. Stark doesn't need this to kick backside - he needs it to keep his shrapnel-injured heart beating. The bad guys - presumably the Taliban though they're given a different moniker here, The Ten Rings - Me thinks they may have a sponsor by the name of Mandarin, but that's for the sequel - are keeping our hero prisoner in the hope he'll build them a version of his new missile. And, to quote Tales of Suspense 39, "Iron Man is born!" That's the set-up, a superbly executed 30 minutes of tight suspense and gritty action. There's some subtle criticism of US foreign policy here - Stark sees his own weapons in the hands of the bad guys - but it's a film that never preaches. The movie slows somewhat in the middle but still delivers its fair share of one-liners, suspenseful moments and interesting scenes. Robert Downey Jr nails the part of Stark almost effortlessly. He's as good in this as he was in Zodiac and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. It's brave casting, and it works.The supporting cast are rather underwritten but as it's hey, about Iron Man and not Pepper or Happy we can forgive this. Director John Favreau pops up as the latter and Gwyneth Paltrow is the love interest, though to be honest Stark seems less interested in her than his armour. Terence Howard is Stark's put-upon buddy James Rhodes, a future Iron Man/War Machine in the making. Jeff Bridges wears a mighty scary beard as Obidiah Stane. He's a pretty good, believable villain. And the addition of Ozzy Osbourne/Black Sabbath to the soundtrack should bring a giggle or two. The only real minuses are the somewhat sluggish pace at times and the lack of a central hook to hang the story on other than Iron Man's origin. But the film, as I said in my intro, gets most things right.The effects are fabulous, never get in the way of the story, being used sparingly but well and there's a marvellous fan boy moment after the end credits, with Nick Fury appearing with a highly interesting offer for our new hero. I've heard a little rumour that Iron Dude is cameoing in The Incredible Hulk. The Avengers are about to assemble...***Postscript May 2010. Just watched this again and I've added a star to my original rating - Iron Man is a grower. The blue-ray looks amazing and the middle section plays better than it did to me on my first viewing. I think this is a much better film than it's sequel, which seemed rather rushed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, one gets it right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr. was a perfect match for Tony Stark. Well cast and well played. Performances by Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard are also a marked step up from the pale fare of supporting actors. There is good delivery of dry humour and the acting doesn't feel in any way forced. Well done cast and director Jon Favreau! The film moves along well, the story is interesting without being inexplicable and ends with my interest piqued to see where this next goes. Hopefully Robert will be back.Iron Man received very good reviews from people whose opinions I respected. Prior Super Hero/Comic Book crossovers to film had left me crossing them all off my theatre-going wish-list. Trailers before the film mean I will most likely be passing on the latest installments of Hulk and Batman and I was a bit worried I was in for a let down. I'll wait a week after opening on those titles. Hopefully we will never see another Spider-man 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel superhero movie that packs a punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the cinema to see Iron Man not expecting much; I liked the cast already, but it's been a while since I saw a really good summer blockbuster. Anyway, I was blown away by how good it is. Robert Downey Jnr (Robert Stark) was a revelation - I can't imagine anyone else in the role. The usually reliable Gwyneth Paltrow worked wonders with a slim role as Stark's PA, and the package was completed by a shaven-headed and bearded (and almost unrecognisable) Jeff Bridges as the fatherly company VP. This film is a perfect blockbuster - it delivers fast-paced, exciting action, nuanced but light performances, and a story that is never boring or incomprehensible. If you're looking for something profound or life-changing, you won't find it here, but you shouldn't expect to. The hero is a genesis of the journey he makes during the film, and the bad guys do get their comeuppance, but expect (and look forward to) at least one sequel in the next 2 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not have any expectation from this movie, especially after seeing the trailers a couple of times. I had thought ? the same usual stuff, and had reminded me of Transformers, gadgets etc. which I do not like.But when I settled down in the movie hall, within first 20 minutes, I started enjoying what was going on.A genius arms industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is kidnapped by terrorist in Afghanistan and asked to make the deadliest weapon for them; Tony instead makes the Iron shield that would help him to escape from the clutches of terrorists. He succeeds. Back in US, he realizes the big dis-service he is doing to the world by designing and selling arms. Against the wishes of his industrialist partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) he decides to stop the company and he designs the Iron Man suit. Once ready, he fights the terrorist, but faces a new enemy in Obadiah who designs a similar giant Iron suit. The last fight is between our real life hero Iron Man and this giant Iron Man.Robert Downey Jr. is the most unlikely hero material for such a role. He is middle aged, does not look suitable for such a heroic role. But surprise, surprise?it is only because of Robert Downey Jr. that the movie becomes watchable. He is a great actor, and brings the extra punch to the persona of Tony Stark, that it is hard to imagine anyone else in his shoes.The movie is a fantasy movie and so everything is tolerated ? no question asked. But it is entertaining. The movie thrills and has right amout of humor and action to keep you entertained. The Iron man suit is really cool and convincing enough to believe what all things it can do.It was interesting to hear the terrorist in Afghanistan talk several languages, one of them was Urdu ? Hindustani. Interesting! A good entertainment..I enjoyed it a lot, and I am happy that a new series of Iron Man would start with this movie. I am also happy to learn that this movie is doing very well at the box office ? not to the happiness of the detractors who did not bet on this Iron Man. But this Iron Man has arrived and is here to stay.(Stars 6.75 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superhero Epic with Wit, Heart, True Political Relevance and Downey's Knowing Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casting Robert Downey Jr. ("Chaplin", "Zodiac") in the title role turns out to be a masterstroke as the beleaguered actor slips easily into all the complexities of a brilliant scientist who also happens to be a billionaire industrialist and a hedonistic playboy whose every pleasure-seeking habit has turned into a death-defying addiction. The textured part of Tony Stark so mirrors Downey's former tabloid-headline-grabbing life that the actor can't help but inform the role with layers of resonance and irony that elevate what could have been a more cookie-cutter superhero epic. At the same time, director Jon Favreau ("Elf", "Zathura") has more on his mind than creating another heavily stylized comic book myth, as he spends the first part of the film on establishing the realistic context for his hero's circumstances in rugged, war-torn terrain of Afghanistan. No less than four writers were recruited for the screenplay - Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway - on top of the original work by Stan Lee and his creative team at Marvel Comics. Usually having too many hands is a warning sign of a bad, neutralized movie but not this time - this is smart, provocative entertainment that doesn't forget it's also a popcorn flick with plenty of special effects, nonstop action and an unsubtle sense of good versus evil.The story has Stark, the head of his own multinational corporation specializing in the manufacture of state-of-the-art, mass destruction weaponry, in Afghanistan demonstrating a new guided missile that can launch a multitude of smaller missiles aimed at individual targets. His military convoy is ambushed by insurgents who kill the soldiers escorting him. Stark survives due to the quick-thinking ingenuity of a local Afghan physician who implants a device in Stark's chest to ensure the remaining shrapnel left in his body doesn't travel to his heart. Stark's captors demand that he build a missile like the one he just demonstrated, but instead, he makes an elaborate armored suit and blasts his way out of the cave where he was held hostage. Lots of carnage inevitably ensues, but Stark's miraculous escape sets the stage for the rest of the story. Transformed by his traumatic, three-month experience overseas, Stark has a change of heart which has detrimental ramifications on his company but also allows him to follow his monomaniacal pursuit of building a sleeker, more powerful version of the suit he built in captivity. Three people, in particular, are impacted by Stark's unpredictable actions - his military liaison and best friend Lt. Colonel Jim ("Rhodey") Rhodes; Stark's cagey second-in-command at Stark Industries, Obadiah Stone; and Stark's devoted personal assistant Pepper Potts.With impressive agility, the often under-appreciated Downey makes Stark's transformation palpable and brings surprising conviction to a role that must have seemed absurd on paper. Favreau's other casting decisions also pay dividends though some more than others. Shorn of his thick hair and sporting a salt-and-pepper beard, Jeff Bridges, another actor who never seems to get his due, is still recognizable from his trademark grin and plays the avuncular, villainous Stone with great relish. Credit Bridges for not overdoing what could have been an excessive Willem Dafoe-like turn in the first "Spiderman". One suspects that Terrence Howard will have more to do in the sequel as Rhodey since he is not called on to do much in this first installment except provide support and official alibis. Playing the distressed female again after a similar role as Polly Perkins in Kerry Conran's "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow", Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have much more to play here as Pepper Potts, but she makes the most of a mostly observational role and effortlessly delivers some of the film's more amusing lines. All the production values are top-notch - as they have to be for this type of franchise - and special mention should be made of J. Michael Riva's elaborate production design (Stark's Malibu estate is quite an eye-catcher), Matthew Libatique's crisp cinematography, and the dozens involved with the seamless CGI effects. Make sure to stay after the credits in order to see a surprise final scene which gives a hint of what the sequel may be about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>everything the incredible hulk wanted to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i'm going to rate this movie relative to all of the other comic book movies iron man: 8.5/10 okay, i never read the comic series for this...really, i haven't read the comic series for any of the comic book movies...i'm just not into comics. but iron man is a great movie. of course there were spots of bad acting/dialouge, the bad guy was very cliché, but i'm not going to fault the movie too much for that because comic books themselves are pretty over the top, so this is just more of the comic book element being maintained. the movie did a great job of conveying the man v. self conflict that is evident in all superheroes, but it did it differently which i'll get to later. the movie also dealt with other humanistic qualities such as relationships, compassion, anger, hypocrisy, etc and did a decent job of covering those. but this comic book movie did something great that not many comic book movies do; it was made relatable by alluding to the current state of the world. "i've become comfortable in an industry that has zero accountability"...and that line set up the rest of the movie and iron man's ultimate battle. the writers did a good job of expanding the inner conflict and pressures of a super hero beyond just 'how am i going to maintain a normal life and still save the world beginning at dusk?' to 'how am i going to undo my wrong, save the world and maintain a normal life'...great story.this movie is most similar to the incredible hulk...but believe me, its so much better. just...everything...the story, writing, acting, effects...it was everything the incredible hulk wanted to be.the acting was very good i thought for a superhero movie. robert downey jr=best actor yet in a comic book series and tony stark=coolest albeit cliché...but not to the point of the biker guy in fantastic 4...not at all really, which allowed me to let out a sigh of relief. and as far as presentation goes...you're going to be wowed...the special effects and sound in this movie are insane, and bonus points for always being able to clearly understand the dialouge. all in all, iron man is going to be right along spiderman 1 and 2 for best comic book movie ever...(sidenote, saw the trailer for the new batman and it looks so badass in a movie theater...i can't wait for it)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best marvel comic book film since Spider-Man 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I start with a film like this ... like Iron Man, now all one person would have to do is take a glance at the title and likely scoff at the idea of a film called 'Iron Man' being anything but good, but one would probably think that of all superhero movie titles but by the time Iron Man comes around people not familiar with the comic book or character may think that it's just going to be another run-of-the-mill superhero flick. Thankfully here this isn't the case and that Iron Man is indeed a good film but not just a good film a excellent film! and director Jon Favreau breaths new life into the marvel comic book film saga which had previously began to fall into a slump with such disappointments as Elektra, Fantastic Four and its 2007 sequel, X-Men: The Last Stand, Ghost Rider and Spider-Man 3.At first glance Jon Favreau wouldn't look to be the ideal director for Iron Man if you look at his track record of such films like: Zathura and Elf. But upon seeing the film you couldn't imagine anyone else at the helm of the film, he not only handles the action sequences to perfection but the drama, comedy and exposition as well and he mixes all these ingredients in a superbly formulated sync. Hardcore fans might be disappointed by the lack of action, but as an origin picture I felt it was necessary that it was not overloaded with action and focused more on the development of characters and this may be the film's only sore point. It doesn't develop it's character as well as it should have, particularly the supporting characters like Terrence Howard as 'Lt. Colonel James 'Rhodey' Rhodes' who seems to run on auto-pilot throughout the whole movie does little to advance the plot or add anything to it and I hope to see him more developed in the sequel, the circumstances are understandable however regarding his character as this is the origin picture for Tony Stark and he does get to deliver some of the film's best one-liners which is a plus.Gwyneth Paltrow as 'Virginia 'Pepper' Potts' however also suffers the same fate but not as heavily as she does play a good part in the exhilarating climax, but unfortunately it's Paltrow's blandness which drags her down and she seems unsuited for the role but now having been established in the role I do not want to see her replaced but rather just hope she improves. Jeff Bridges plays the villain 'Obadiah Stane' and whilst not incredibly villainous, he brings some fun to the role and it certainly seems to show in his performance and he's a great first nemesis for Iron Man and is more of a test of strength for Iron Man, the only downfall is that Bridges is a little wasted and could have been used for so much more. Others like Shaun Toub as 'Dr. Yinsen' and Faran Tahir as 'Raza' are also underused but otherwise fine and rather enjoyable to watch in their respective roles.When I heard Robert Downey Jr. was going to play Iron Man I had my doubts like everyone else, but he fitted the character perfectly and brought a suaveness, coolness and excellent charisma which translated well to the screen. What more can I say that hasn't already been said? He's perfect as both Tony Stark and Iron Man and I have trouble finding which alter ego I like better.The action in the film like I said earlier is minimal and not outrageously overblown but plentiful for a film like this. There's a memorable scene where Iron Man blows up a tank and just carelessly walks away which was really well done and the audience I was with responded well to. The airplane battle was fun and truthfully I was hoping would last a little longer just for the sake of seeing Iron Man in action he he. And the final battle between Iron Man and the Iron Monger (yes, yes I know he wasn't referred to that in the film just Obadiah Stane but who cares that's his name in the suit) is fantastic if perhaps not a little too short and I would have like to have seen the Monger maybe defeated a little less easily, but otherwise it was fine and a great climax.Iron Man is off to a strong start and let's hope as the inevitable sequels approach that they are as good as if not better and don't fall into the typical slump that most sequels do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had mixed feelings when I saw the direction this movie was heading. While I was excited that Marvel was taking a step out of the box by casting RDJr., it was still a superhero movie, being released early (possibly hinting at lack of faith) and seemed to be an orgy of CGI and summer hoopla...I was quite wrong. My faith in RDJr. was well placed. The megalomaniacal turned benevolent was played brilliantly, and while he hit the requisite super hero swagger, RDJr. played without getting campy or superfluous. The effects were spot on without becoming a crutch or an excuse for lack of talent. The script was passable, and the gags were just right.However, what made this film a 9/10? A solid leading actor and director , script and SFX all make a decent movie, but it was the cast as a whole that give the movie staying power. Terrance Howard, Gweneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges played their roles as well as RDJr. and set up a solid ensemble cast that balanced the movie well. You can tell that neither the producers, writers nor the director put their proverbial eggs in one basket.In the end, you will be able to pick out various flaws and short comings, as did I. But, it is more enjoyable than your standard pre summer fare, and as a soft opening for Cinema-palooza Summer 2008, Iron Man is enjoyable and fun without getting bigger than it's britches.Summary: Exactly what you would expect, which is not bad, and bests the recent entries into the Superhero Genre.9/10</fullReview>

Tony Stark's character could really set the foundation for Super Hero movies to come. The humour and the way Robert Downey Jr. plays his role makes the whole thing worth it for me.Aside from some extremely minor cheesy comments in the movie, the overall entertainment value is worth every penny.I bought four theatre tickets for this movie, and I do not regret it. ;) Almost anyone can enjoy this film.

		<fullReview>I'm not a Marvel comics reader and so, not that qualified to assess this "superhero" portrayal from comics onto the big screen which real Iron Man fans can do much better. However, I found this movie very entertaining and if you're into gadget-loving, sci-fi stuff, there's a lot of innovative stuff to learn. Some particular scenes like the deployment of Jericho missiles were a real visual delight. You don't want to miss the "assembly line" for its gadget-gizmo's delights where Tony Stark (a.k.a. the Iron Man, a billionaire arms manufacturer and Master Designer) designs the robot-prototype armor (which is the central theme of this movie). Basically, the armor is a one-man army like never seen before; impenetrable to bullets, missiles and bombs - the armor is a heavy suit made of gold-titanium alloy (there was another one designed in an Afghanistan cave which falls into the hands of Obadiah Stane, Stark's business partner and main villain in the plot). The climax scene where Stark needs to deactivate a gadget called the arc reactor from Stane's chest is not clear in its outcome(it's supposed to be an inexhaustible source of free energy, Palladium-315 being identified as the fuel). Some scenes had loose ends e.g.the journalist called Christine Everhart from Vanity fair, with whom Tony has a one-night stand, her character wasn't developed but is important. Pepper Potts (played by the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow) is shown as a loyal and dependable secretary who turns out to love her Boss (even though he's womanizing). Robert Downey Jr. was adequate in his performance as the bundle of energy called Tony Stark.In my opinion, the script did a lot of to-and-fro between Afghanistan and Los Angeles. The focus should have remained on the main villain Obediah Stane but they had to put another bad guy called Raza, a power-hungry terrorist commander operating from Afghanistan. He's given a lot of unnecessary footage as the unsuspecting ally of Stane who ditches him in the end for his own personal power ambitions - all these seemed like loose ends of the plot to me. Moreover, Afghanistan is a war-ravaged country and the Taliban certainly don't have the technology to "reverse engineer" those robot prototype armors and Jericho missiles - it's unnecessary for Hollywood to project Afghans anymore as terrorists and Taliban -let's leave them alone, the poor Afghans have suffered long and hard enough. What they least require is another "labeling" of a terrorist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Between the winter and summer a little switch goes off in my head, and I move between two schools of film-making and film appreciation. Six months ago, I couldn't be less interested in big-budget glory fests. I judged the movies I saw in theatres ? movies like No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, and Atonement ? with the sharpest of critical eyes; the slightest detail out of place would have thrown me off completely. But now, in the upcoming summer months and eagerly awaiting releases such as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian and The Dark Knight, my eye is different. I see a movie like Iron Man and don't care that it is almost entirely disconnected from anything remotely realistic. I don't care that it portrays Afghani terrorists as caricatures operating in backwater, undeveloped, ridiculously improbable cave networks. I don't care that there is a character named Pepper Potts. In the upcoming months, all I want is to sit back and enjoy the ride. And if these films have a little something more to offer, then all the better.As I previously mentioned, Iron Man does slightly dab into moments of elated poignancy. Some aspects of it do serve as a very contemporary reminder of the current status of world politics, especially in terms of weapons distribution and military support in foreign countries, coming back at us like a boomerang. In this sense, Iron Man is almost like a comic book version of Charlie Wilson's War. In addition, the filmmakers and the extraordinary Robert Downey, Jr. do a fantastic job in creating an interesting, well-rounded and satisfyingly flawed protagonist. But for the most part, it's just, plain and simple, a really good show. Visual effects are top-notch and seamless; the action scenes are thrilling; the theatre's surround sound system was working overtime, and in all I have to admit that the two-hour runtime felt like a lot less.Jon Favreau, famed actor, has had slight experience in directing but nothing nearly as large-scale as this so as to indicate that he was even capable of pulling it off. Well, he does indeed manage to pull it off, and quite will at that. The film looks stunning, the scenes are directed and choreographed exquisitely well, and in all Favreau manages to create a very strong balance between big-budget action comic book movie sentiments along with more smaller-scale techniques more in vain with Favreau's breakthrough role in Swingers. And most of this is thanks to the one, the only Robert Downey, Jr.Downey, Jr. is the kind of actor who can almost sleepwalk through a role. Like the greats such as Daniel Day-Lewis or Al Pacino, acting and charisma seems to be an utterly and totally natural thing for him. With roles as varied as a book editor, a crazed drug addict, Charlie Chaplin and now a multi-billionaire playboy turned super hero, Downey Jr. still manages to apply his unique and personal fast-talking, rapid-fire, neurotic, cynical acting style in everything he does. I guess he's just lucky to always get to work with directors who let him cut loose and do his thing. This film is no exception ? many scenes involving Downey, Jr. with rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue seem like straight out of a Robert Altman movie and totally improvised. What is so great about the performance is that Downey, Jr. combines this trademark acting style with a really impressive sensibility and connection to the more comic book action-movie-oriented aspects of the role. Every single frame he is in becomes all the more worthwhile and entertaining; it's just a fun, great, funny, well-rounded performance that proves once and for all ? if roles in other smaller recent films such as Good Night and Good Luck, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly and Zodiac didn't quite break it to the mainstream sentiment ? that Robert Downey, Jr. is back.The cream of the crop of super hero movies are the ones not only featuring strong, rounded, interesting characters from the original comics but are also films in which the filmmakers take special care to place action in a familiar, as-realistic-as-possible setting, providing not only interesting characters but also believable settings for us to identify with them in. The single best comic book adaptation movie of all time is for me a three-way tie between Spider-Man 2, X2: X-Men United and Batman Begins. Other impressive efforts include the first Spider-Man and X-Men films as well as Tim Burton's non-realistic but uniquely stylized versions of Batman, and also Richard Donner's old Superman movie. And the more lousy, effort-less super hero movies come out ? such as Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Ghost Rider and many others ? the more the quality of the good ones is emphasized. Iron Man contains bits and pieces of what makes a movie like Batman Begins so good, but also many bits of guilty pleasure over-the-top fantasy that are entertaining but quite silly and unbelievable. That said, Favreau and crew are definitely on the right track, and while Iron Man was a good introduction, I'm hoping that the sequel will take everything that was good about this first film and amplify and further develop these points. A darker, more flawed exploration of Tony Stark's character is always welcome, and with Robert Downey Jr. on board, it's almost a guarantee to up the ante, similar to the X-Men and Spider-Man sequels. Here's hoping for the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best live action super hero movie yet (only 1 minor spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is definitely a must see! Although the character development is not fully complete, there is definitely room for a sequel, and I am sure that the characters will be developed more at that time. Everything is very nearly believable as it is (Stark's secret power source is pretty fantastical now, but maybe not in the future). The only thing that both my date and I sat up over in the movie because it was so unbelievable, was when Stark (Robert Downy, Jr) walks out of the cave with the full size car battery tucked under one arm (ever try that??). It would have been on step better, and that much the worse for the villain, if he had had to half lug, half drag, the battery out like any real person would. But other then that, the power suit that made Iron Man, sans power source, is almost here today (see PopSci May -08). In the movie, you want intrigue, action, and humanistic issues? You got it in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets face it, when you go to watch a comic book adaption the last thing you expect is a cinematic masterpiece, at best you will get a FORMULA FLICK THAT ENTERTAINS and at worse FORMULA FLICK THAT Doesn't ENTERTAIN.But even more recently you had a different kind of comic book adaption, the fun is out, THE DRAMA IS IN, ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY INCLUDING THE FANS BUT MOST EFFORT WAS PAID TO THE CRITIC WHO ITS WELL KNOWN CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH OF DRAMA AND EMOTION...Offlate most of the comic book movies fall into this category,AND TAKE THEMSELVES TO SERIOUSLY....They pump their movies full with good actors..Put in lots of emotional scenes.....bloody everyone cries (think spidey3)....Themes of love are rampant throughout the film...superman had more problems than charlie brown...On face value this movie looks like it will fall in this category, I mean who wouldn't, one look at the starcast and you will remember HULK and be scared.But somehow this movie was different, this movie didn't have the special effects that will leave you flabbergasted or the unnecessary comic relief YET IT WAS FUN.AND SHOCKINGLY IT WAS DUE TO THE SUPERB ACTING, Robert Downey played the middle aged teen who became a superhero brilliantly, he was funny suave and a delight to watch.Jeff Bridges looked and played the part of an evil corporate honcho to the hilt.Even Gwyneth Paltrow did great job of playing the not so serious pepperpot.Thanks to the acting even the subtle romance scenes were enjoyable to a romance allergic person like me.The action scenes AND SPCIAL EFFECTS etc were in fact weak compared to TRANSFORMERS WHICH HAS OBVIOUSLY SET THE BENCHMARK FOR SCI-FI ACTION.However the fact remains that this movie remains weak in primary selling points, THE HERO IS WEAK BECAUSE FOR THE MOST PART THERE IS NO Villain AND ANY GOOD HERO NEEDS At least AN AS EVIL Villain.Special effects were only at par.The comic book excitement was lacking.SINCE IRON MAN HAS ALMOST NO GLOBAL FAN FOLLOWING ESPECIALLY HERE IN India, we definitely needed some aura building which was lacking (especially in film).Yet this movie delivers the goods and can be watched even in after paying premium rates, although watching a nice matinée show would definitely push the experience up.-s no recognition, at par special effect,so so action, no comic book feel.+\-s none quite a simple film actually.+s GREAT ACTING, ALL DRAMA AND ROMANTIC SCENES HANDLED BRILLIANTLY, even things like humour are withing the main characters.total 7/10 (not factoring in the fact that this movie was above my actually quite low expectations, expect good and you will get it, if you are one of those drama loving maniacs, BE AWARE THE ACTING IS SUPERB BY COMIC BOOK MOVIE STANDARDS BUT NOT BY THE 3 HR LONG EPIC DRAMA STANDARDS.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solid as iron, with a potential of something more. I vaguely remember reading some of the Iron Man comics. I was too young to really appreciate it, and at the same time, I don't think they gave him the same depth and humanity this movie does. Robert Downey is like a fish in the water playing Iron Man, suave and cynical. He's not too cynical though to provide a certain depth. Not that it is all about depth. It's mainly about just enjoying a good ride with awesome special effects and a crafty screen play with great dialogues and a rockin' soundtrack. And then you might look a bit further. Maybe the big antagonist of Iron man isn't just one man, Obadiah Stane / Iron Monger. Maybe he represents the good old Military Industrial Complex, the good old War Monger, the one that brought you Vietnam and Iraq. The one Eisenhower, JFK and others warned about. And maybe The Matrix is just a good action flick with nifty special effect. And maybe this is just a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say this movie has set a new standard for comic-movie adaptations. It is rare that summer superhero action flicks are GREAT because of the acting, script, and realism; Iron Man has accomplished this! If you're going in looking for a lot of action, go to Blockbuster and rent Transformers (which I luv also). This movie has 3 major action sequences, but you don't miss the acting because Robert Downey Jr. does such a good job to make you more interested in Tony Stark than Iron Man. Can you imagine a movie where someone is more interested in Peter Parker, Clark Kent, or Bruce Wayne than their super alter egos? Iron Man has done that and more. Don't get me wrong the action is good and the graphics are so amazing you forget you're watching CGI. Go to this film with an open mind, and like many others chatting below on the boards, you will be in your basement attempting to make your own suit of armor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Comic Book Adapation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just been to seen Iron Man and I liked it. Iron Man is based on the the Marvel comic and is there first film they have done by themselves.Iron Man starts with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) was in Afghanistan to show his company's latest weapon, the Jericho, which was a missile that could fire miniature missiles. However, Stark gets captured by a terrorist group the Ten Rings. In the attack he is badly injured and a capture surgeon using a car battery an electrical-magnet to prevent metal from getting to his heart. However, instead of building a missile Stark makes his own Iron Man suit and uses the electrical-magnet to power it. After escaping from the terrorist camp he is saved by American troops and is returned to America. It was then that he declared that Stark Industries would stop selling weapons and many people within the company and the media worry thinking that Stark had lost his mind. After this Stark refines his design for the Iron Man suit and learns that his friend and business partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), was secretly selling terrorist Stark industry weapons. One the Iron Man suit was refined he goes off to Afghanistan to do battle with the terrorist and test it out. The terrorists also discover the original iron man suit and end up giving Stane it and he uses it to develop his own suit to become Iron Monger. At the end of the film Iron Man and Iron Monger do battle at Stark Industries and Iron Man becomes known to the world.Iron Man is harder to make into a realist film to other superhero films but it works. What the writers and director do is set Iron Man in the near future with technology being very important to the world. Jon Favreau also updates the film from Stark getting captured in Vietnam going to China to being captured in Afghanistan. Iron is also more humorous then other comic book adaptations, but it works for Iron Man. Favreau also has a good cast to work with, Downey was good as Tony Stark and he will possibly develop the character from a billionaire playboy to someone more darker. Gwyneth Paltrow was good as Pepper Potts and had good chemistry with Downey. Terrence Howard was casted with the sequel in mind and become War Machine. Finally there was Jeff Bridges, an actor I like played the villain. Finally their were cameos from a number of people, including Jon Favreau as Stark's bodyguard, John Crammer as himself, Stan Lee and last but not less Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury at the end of the film. The special effects were impressive and needed because there was no other way of it being done. The action was great, especially the fight between as Iron Man and Iron Monger.However, this film does have problems. It was made with sequels in mind and at time was predictable. However, it still a fun film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the exception of Elektra, the first Fantastic Four and Blade: Trinity, there hasn't been one Marvel movie that wasn't at least superficially enjoyable (in the case of Spider-Man 3 and The Punisher, that was almost all they had). Given the high credentials of both director (Jon "Swingers" Favreau, who also acts in the film) and stars (Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges), Iron Man was expected to be one of the superior Marvel flicks, and indeed it is: it doesn't really reach the heights of X2 or Spider-Man 2, but ranks solidly alongside the first installment of either franchise as a great start of what is set to be another crowd-pleasing series.As expected, the first half of the picture is entirely devoted to the origin of the character. No angsty teenagers or alienated aliens (sorry about that), though: unlike Peter Parker or Clark Kent, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is not concerned about anything, except having as good a time as possible. And could you blame him? He is one of the richest men in America, charming enough to bed whichever woman he wants and just so smug that when asked to comment on his nickname "Merchant of death" (he owns a weapons factory) he retorts: "That's not bad". However, things are about to change, as Tony is kidnapped during a business trip in the Middle East and forced to create a missile for a local warlord. Disgusted by the sight of his weapons being used to slaughter innocent people, he decides to find a way to escape, and comes up with a hi-tech armor as a result. Once back in the US, he announces he will no longer produce death machines, and with the help of his secretary (Paltrow) he modifies his suit to make it more effective for his new cause: ensuring peace.All in all, protagonist aside, there is nothing very original in Iron Man: good vs. evil? Yep. Gorgeous female sidekick? Yep. Tons of action juxtaposed with great humor? Yep. Deeper issues? Let's save them for the sequels, shall we? And yet the film works very well, every single minute. Why? Because Favreau never slows down the pace with futile digressions (the few tender moments are essential in establishing character), nor does he make the fun bits overblown (one of the problems in Spider-Man 3): having obviously learned something from the criticisms aimed at Daredevil, in which he had a supporting role, he delivers a blockbuster that is clever yet accessible, as well as tremendously fun and exciting. Considering his comedy CV (he even appeared in Friends), it was practically granted he would nail the lighter scenes, and he does: just check out the ubiquitous Stan Lee, who gets mistaken for Hugh Hefner (yes, you read that right). Even better, Favreau does miracles when it comes to combining laughs and special effects, deserving comparisons with Sam Raimi's work on the Spidey flicks. And the real action? Well, there's the entire third act, a marvelously executed piece of entertainment.The film scores another bunch of points casting-wise: after a series of pretty much unseen roles, Paltrow finally hits it big again with the sweet, helpful Pepper Potts (terrific name), Terrence Howard is a suitable mix of authority and hilarity, and Jeff Bridges is excellent playing the bald, goateed villain. But what really makes a difference in this movie is Iron Man himself, easily listable as one of Downey Jr.'s Top 10 performances. Sure, he is equally great in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Zodiac, but there is a distinct feeling he was born to play Tony Stark, and not just because of his similarly excessive past lifestyle: a lifelong fan of the comic-book, Downey squeezes every drop of humanity he can find out of what could otherwise have been reduced to a playboy caricature and portrays a real person, albeit a (super)heroic one, in pure Marvel fashion.And yet, for all these combined treats, the film falls a bit short of perfect for being, ironically for the genre, too short, even at 126 minutes: the ending comes off as abrupt and somewhat sequel-baiting, though less irritating than the conclusion of The Matrix Reloaded. But hey, if Iron Man 2 means another two hours of Downey Jr. in the red-and-gold suit, bring it on: the first film is one of the most fun cinematic experiences of 2008, and more of the same can only be a good thing, right?</fullReview>

My wife did not want to see this movie, but someone else told us how good it was, commenting his wife even agreed; my wife is also in agreement here... she said this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.

		<fullReview>Iron Man. 3 *'s out of 4 Cast: Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow.Director: Jon Favreau.Tony Stark is a different type of alter ego for a super hero. Of course there are similarities to Peter Parker and Bruce Wayne, but while those characters are always mourning for the loss of their relatives. Mr. Stark enjoys living the life of a playboy bachelor. He has a great house, the best cars , and has sex with hot women, and enjoys being Iron Man. Most characters in comics become a super hero due to either a scientific accident, being born with powers or something tragic happens and you build a costume .However, that is not the case with Iron Man.Tony became Iron Man due to a basic need to survive. At the beginning he is captured by terrorists after the testing of his company's latest weapon. They want him to build a weapon for them, but instead of their weapon he makes an invincible suit and escapes. He wants to do away with the destruction his weapons have caused and start helping out those who need it.What I enjoyed about Iron man was not really Iron Man himself, but the character of Tony Stark. Robert Downey Jr is that character through and through and I can't imagine any one else who can portray him. If there is one reason to see this movie, It's because of his performance. Most super hero movies you can't wait to see the hero kick ass. Don't get me wrong the action sequences are very good, and worth the money alone, but the scenes between Tony Stark and his assistant Pepper(Gweneth Paltrow, who looks really hot as a red head) were very captivating even if you knew the outcome before they did. The rest of the cast where very good. Hell they were all academy award winners or nominees. I hope That we will continue to see people who can act take these types of roles.Another thing that impressed me about "Iron Man" was that it was directed by Jon Favreau. He was the writer of Swingers, but his directing work with "Made" and "Elf" made me question if he could pull off a super hero movie, and the answer is yes. He loves these characters and does a great job of letting you know the heart of them instead of just running around and kick ass. I think what makes a super hero movie works is that you like who is inside the costume a little bit more than you like the hero. Tony Stark himself says he is not a hero, but whatever he does. He rules at it</fullReview>

Especially, for this super hero comic story watch what Lorenzo Semple Jr. (who wrote the Batman TV series and Flash Gordon) has to say about hero stories and Iron Man. His counterpoint, Marcia Nasatir, is a Hollywood producer who doesn't always agree. They discuss the script, the acting, special effects and the genre.

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Comic Book Adaptations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Iron Man on Friday, and I thought it was an excellent movie. When I first heard Robert Downey Jr. was going to be cast in the lead role, I had my doubts, but I don't think they could have picked a better leading man. Gwenneth Paltrow plays his assistant/love interest in the film and she is very good. It isn't often when you get an academy award winning actor for a flick like these. Jeff Bridges, a very underrated actor in my opinion, is also excellent in his role as a shadowy business partner. In a lot of comic book movies, you can tell the actors are phoning it in for a paycheck, but that isn't the case here.The effects are amazing. Probably the best of any comic book adaptation so far. Rarely does computer generated imagery (CGI) look so real. I couldn't tell when something was CGI or not. The action scenes were also good. There could have been more, but a lot of action was sacrificed for plot and character development, which is a good thing, though I think the momentum of the story suffered a litte slowdown in the middle.So, it comes down to this: if a movie about a billionaire that makes a high tech suit of armor that allows him to fly and shoot lazer beams out of his hands sounds stupid to you, don't see it. If you are like me, that is freaking awesome! I love comic books and comic book adaptation movies, and I have always been an Iron Man fan, so that they pulled off this movie so well was a real treat. There is an excellent mix of seriousness and comedy that is just perfect, and the scenes where he is building the suit, which happens the whole movie, make this story as believable as possible. Luckily, this comic book movie is filed in with the good ones (Batman Begins, X-Men 1 &amp;2, Spieder-man 1 &amp; 2) and not the bad ones (Fantastic Four 1 &amp;2, Ghost Rider, Spider-man 3).I give Iron Man a 4.5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few mild spoilers ensue.Downey does a great job. The plot is good. The technological display is excellent. The ironman suit is awesome.Some aspects of the plot strain credulity - like the chairman of the board being able to throw together an iron monger suit, one even more advanced than ironman's. Stark will quickly start dying without his arc generator, but at the end of the movie somehow he's fine after both existent ones are destroyed in the final fight.Sorry, Palthrow left me unmoved, as did the Stark-Potts romance angle. I think they could have saved a lot of money with a relative unknown. But I guess the industry banks on big names to bring in box office, eh?The final fight was spectacular, but I found the details of its action very unclear.Overall though, a very good job. Very entertaining, and in the end goodness and personal virtue triumph. I'm glad the Stark character finds himself. But how is he ever going to cope with divulging his identity? Secret identities protect loved ones and enable the hero to operate with discretion. Stark has the somewhat lovable trait of blurting out what he's thinking, but this time it seems he's bitten off more than he'll be able to chew. I don't get where this is supposed to go.Finally, I sat through the credits for the famed bonus scene. Whoop de do. Frankly, it was a waste of time. And they didn't even give us secret decoder rings!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi it's the 14 year old film fanatic and this is my review on Iron Man.I love comic books first of all.May is a good month, mainly because it's what i call the transition period into the summer blockbuster season, myfavourite time of the year.But the transition this month had serveral bigger titles than ever before with the return of indy and so forth a newcomer and next big franchise starter comes along, Iron Man.The story and narrative was well executed and it wasn't slow or difficult to get into. It opens up well then gradually leads us through with out rushing it.Paticualr praise goes out to Jon Favreaus excellent drection. He's made a superhero film, which usually is aimed at younger child audiences, which is very serious and very adult. The first ever grown up superhero movie.Comic book movies have the excellent luck of being perfectly cast ut if they ever slip up it's normally a big one (Yes i'm talking about you tommy lee jones as two face!) But this movie was excellently cast. Robert Downey Jnr. played the role of Tony Stark brilliantly and truly captured the character, wise cracks and all. But another thing that makes his performance excellent was his character development from charismatic smart arse to warrior of the righteous.And a quick short mention to Jeff Bridges playing an excellent villain.The effects were top notch and they did know where to draw the line between real time and CG.So yes, all in all the best superhero movie ever made....so far (Jsut wait till chris nolan rocks the boat with my most anticipated film this year The Dark Knight). Just don't take your kids to see it. if i had more than 2 hands i could count how many kids and parents left the theatre half trough or how many kids moaned how bad it was while leaving. This film is NOT for kids it's very grown up and should be seriously so don't be expecting an exciting popcorn movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The easiest way to sum up this movie is Robert Downey Jr. He is this movie. Robert is Tony Starks. Without Robert this movie would have been empty gadget porn. Don't get me wrong, I like Jon Favreau (the director, who also makes a nice cameo as one of Stark's bodyguards). I really, really like him. I feel a certain kinship as we are both Librans (with birthdays very close together) and both grew up in Queens. I think his role as Mike in Swingers will be forever burned into my consciousness, however, without Robert this movie would have been a flat, ordinary, predictable and gadget ladened comic book based movie. The movie is a very straight forward narrative (and very predictable) of a talented person caught up in the money, fame and drugs of living the "good life". To say that Tony Starks has an ego is an understatement. You can hate him at the same time you really like him. He is the charismatic rogue and frankly what most men want to be (lets be honest). At the beginning of the movie, Tony lacks a purpose. That purpose is given to him inadvertently when he is kidnapped by some Islamic terrorists (do we really need to get his clichéd?) and forced to build his company's top of the line missile in a cave out of spare parts. Instead he creates an iron suit and decides to escape. The experience infuses Tony with a purpose to make a positive difference in this world, of which the result is Iron Man. There are several subplots, twists and turns, but all are quite predictable (and wrap up quite nicely by the end of the movie).The supporting cast is good, though I think they're not suppose to overpower or even make much of an impact. They are props for Downey to envelope us in his magic. Does it matter that his personal assistant is played by an Academy Award winning actress (Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts) or that his "friends" have 5 Academy Award nominations between then (Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard)? It doesn't. They are they simply there to fill in any of the rough patches and makes this movie look smooth. For the most part, they succeed, but in a behind the scenes and supportive way. They hardly stand out.While this is a showcase for Downey, Favreau adds some nice easter eggs for the fans. There are several important easter eggs that Favreau throws out during the course of the film.* He also delves into Stark's relationship and alcohol problems of which Downey has adequate life experiences to base his method acting on. There are adequate crumbs here to lead one to at least one more film. The rest is Downey interacting with technology. What can one say about the special effects of Hollywood that hasn't already been said? This is a prime example of the technical proficiencies of a good Hollywood production, while Favreau keeps it from becoming ridiculous. Tony Starks lives &amp; breaths technology, so it is quite appropriate. Are you taking notes Michael Bay? This is what Transformers should have been like.To read this review you might think that I didn't enjoy this movie or perhaps have an unhealthy fixation on Robert Downey Jr. Both are not true. I liked this movie and I have never had any doubts about Robert's talent. Iron Man has joined the ranks of Spiderman 2 as my two favorite (and best) comic based movies. Both are very enjoyable, yet flawed (and definitely not horrible. Yes, I'm looking at you Fantastic Four). Other have dismissed my qualms with the movie by reminding me that this is a comic book based movie. To this I respond with why does a comic book or comic book based movie have to be simple, predictable and clichéd? There are numerous instances of the medium's seriousness and complexity. Why does a summer blockbuster have to be flashy, trite and predictable? It doesn't have to be that way.This movie is much like most staged performances.

		<shortDescription>delivers what's expected but goes on longer than it needs to</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Downey brings the perfect blend of strength, smarts, and humor to the role of Tony Stark, a flip and wealthy industrialist who's made a name for himself by following in the footsteps of his late father and producing high-tech weaponry without assuming any responsibility. A near-fatal accident in the Afghan desert leaves him with an artificial heart, and for the first time allows him to see the repercussions of his business endeavors. A changed man, he decides to pull the plug on weapons marketing and covertly constructs a state-of-the-art iron suit that gives him the capability to combat rebel militia groups who've acquired his technology under the table...unfortunately that's easier said than done. Marvel Comics adaptation is less fanciful than most of its predecessors but certainly true to the genre, with intriguing?and believable?characters, spectacular action/effects sequences, and an engaging hero, the only thing it lacks is a human story compelling enough to sustain its length. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man gears up for a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a good film and certainly worth the admission, but not awe-inspiring like Spiderman 1 &amp; 2. There were definitely some very cool scenes, like the fighter flight, design and building of the v.2 armor and everything having to do with Stark's fancy computer interfaces, and in the end, the scene building up to "I am Iron Man." Iron Man seems to be made to reach its eventual payoff not before a sequel or possibly several. It's very much an introductory movie where they're holding out on the Iron Man goodness to establish characters and develop them.This is not to say that the film would necessarily benefit from more action. The break from the constant fighting of superhero movies is refreshing, and the character interactions are handled really well and in an interesting way - with the exception of the baddie, who was just an excuse to kick any and all dogs available, and to provide an underwhelming "big fight" at the end of the movie. Whatever motivations the antagonist might have had, they were completely undermined by the baffling and unfounded actions forced upon the character to bring some sense of conclusion to the movie.Iron Man is a good film, but held back by too much prepping for sequels instead of focusing on the movie at hand, and a main baddie whose development and motivations are criminally poor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judged by the trailer, it's silly. Judged by the first viewing, it's good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, about 10 months ago I first saw the trailer of Iron Man, in which Robert Donney Jr. plays a very clichéd and silly "iron man", which reminds me of the 1960's Japanese cartoon series "Atom Boy", especially when Iron Man flies by jetting from the feet. In a moment, I was telling myself, "This is gonna be another piece of CGI rubbish." But, I was totally wrong. on May 2nd I walked into the theater in Chinese Mainland, waiting for a 2-hour letdown(Which I spent to gather some former classmates). The movie begins with Robert Donney being blown away by his own bomb, and then kidnapped by some terrorist. Then we saw a long flashback about Tony Stark(Donney)'s life style. Donney has been famous for giving noisy and "rap" performances in many charming characters. This time he definitely did it again. While the audiences are being convinced by the conversion from a play boy to a super hero, which is tuned down by the makers, the movie just kept teasing everyone's eyeballs with exciting actions and a sense of "Donney" humor. The "escaping from terrorists base" scene was considered to be a really big stereotype in my mind, but it worked out very intense and interesting.Jeff Bridges and Patrow share the same amount of supporting roles. However, it is definitely Bridges to win the applause. Even though Patrow didn't blow me away, still she does no harm to the movie. Very smart screenplay and editing,worth a node of Academy's technical Awards.8.4/10 better than Spiderman 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to work in a movie theater for years, and became very critical of movies from all genres. I can't give Iron Man a 10 because there's no such thing as a perfect movie, but for all practical purposes, it comes deliciously close. The characters have an appropriate amount of depth, the action is well paced and exciting thanks to Jon Fav, and the acting on part of Downey, Bridges and Paltrow is simply excellent. This film had the whole theater cheering, booing, and generally having a killer time. If you have any interest in hero movies, action movies, comedies, or good movies at all, there is simply no good excuse not to pay to see this movie immediately. You don't need your girlfriend to come with you. She might not enjoy you seeing Tony Stark leading the life every guy wants. That's actually one of the more appealing aspects of the movie; for people without an idea of who Tony Stark is, he's basically Bruce Wayne (Batman) actually having fun with what he's doing! It's spectacular, it's a riot, it's a great time! Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IRON MAN (no spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Ok. I have to admit, I am not a HUGE Iron Man reader, or The Avengers, really, either. So if you are a purist, then I have no applicable idea as to how the movie compared to the series. HOWEVER, I have read a few Iron Man/Avengers story-arcs, so I am not completely out of touch with the character itself.*I have some serious questions that need to be answered here:Q: Why Robert Downey Jr.? A: Because he's AWESOME. Downey Jr. is what you might call...A REAL ACTOR. Unlike so many less-than-exceptional actors that have been playing superheroes since, well, the dawn of time (a few exceptions can be made, yes, feel free to list them in rebuttal comments), Downey Jr. captured the highs and lows of Tony Stark as perfectly as he was allowed to. It was clear that he was held back a bit by director Jon Favreau, who has a tendency to do such things to actors. Sometimes it works (i.e. "Elf") and sometimes it hinders a bit, as is the case for Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. That said, Downey Jr. still conquered Tonk Stark with a mighty and powerful...OK, now I am just thinking of him naked.Q: Why Gweneth Paltrow? A: Only God knows why she is in any movie. Ever. Wes Anderson did with her what he could. John Favreau gave up, I imagine, halfway through filming. Chemistry of a doorknob, that woman.Q: Why couldn't they make the action sequences in Transformers more like the phenomenal and easy-to-follow, non-distracting action sequences in Iron Man? A: Because Michael Bay is a budget-waster and should be put on trial and convicted of murder for the crap-fest that was Transformer's action sequences. The vomit in my tummy threatens to erupt at the very thought of the upcoming Michael Bay remake of Hitchcock's "The Birds". John Favreau did an excellent job of maintaining my increased heart-rate and keeping me ever-so-slightly panicked, without over-doing the action to the point of disbelief.Q: Where can I get a robotic suit like Iron Man's? A: In my wildest fantasies. Seriously, if it wasn't weird enough that I had all kinds of crazy superhero fetishes before, now I have to be into robots? Whoever did the character design for the Iron Man itself did a superb job. Say it with me, Joe, superb. From the first moment you lay eyes on it, it oozes with personality. If you can suspend your disbelief like I can, then you will get the maximum effect. I encourage this.A few otherwise notable things:The character and plot development was well thought out and although the plot was fairly predictable at times, it was no more predictable than your average graphic novel, which is what I like in a movie based on graphic novels.This movie is entirely appropriate for most kids, as long as you don't mind your kids getting more anti-brown-people ideas placed in their minds by the media. The writers did a fair job at not making it an "us against them" situation, but it's still something to put on the discussion table with your kids after the viewing.There is much, much more to this movie, but in the interest of keeping my "no spoilers" word, I'll just say that Iron Man isn't perfect, but it isn't crappy, either. I was expecting crappy. I ended up getting new images to, um, ponder in my "me" time...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical Marvel-based product</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that one should not expect anything deep or serious from a comic book-based movie, but with all this talk about the Iron Man movies being psychological, dramatic and stuff, I took my time to watch this one. Well, it started out on a lower grown up level of complexity, but then it turned into a typical Marvel comic stuff. If this kind of a movie is intended for the adult audience, then the audience members should have their IQs rated at no higher than zero. Otherwise one could not watch all this ridiculous stuff seriously. On the technical side, I did understand why all the Al-Qaeda guys carried those expensive modern German-made H&amp;K rifles. 99 times out of a 100 members of those organizations use Chinese, Romanian, Check, Polish or sometimes Russian-made AK-family of rifles and machine guns (mostly the outdated models). The remaining 1 our 100 may carry an old FN or a SIG rifle, if not a WWI-era Lee Enfield. If someone does not know these obvious facts, then he really needs to start watching news reports at the very least. It does not require one to be an expert on terrorist organizations or firearms to know this. It was also funny to witness that shameless Burger King promotion, if you know what I mean. I guess that a true American patriot and a visionary will not eat any Subway food, right? In short, this movie is a childish pseudo-Sci Fi and it does not even cut it as a piece of mindless entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the movie a couple of times to find moments if any of the actors 'acted'(other than being the character they should be) in the movie and i couldn't find a mini second of failure. Especially Downey... outstanding performance for this kind of movie.When you look at other super hero movies the starring actor or actress generally cannot reflect the character they should be which is -i think- a huge failure of the director.Downey here portraits who Tony Stark is. I have to admit that the story is not even close to the original story but it is a fine adjustment in todays political and military issues. and also Tony Stark character is almost recreated in the movie.The supporting characters were also well chosen starting with Stane(Bridges) and Rhodey(Howard) and continues with Pepper Potts (Paltrow).The visual effects of the movie...It was also another thing that stunned me. I was almost gonna believe that they've really built the suit!I highly recommend to everyone who is considering watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action-adventure film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best action-adventure movies I have seen. It delivers the goods - entertainment and fun, clean language (very important since I like to watch movies with my kids). There is all a film like this needs: dramatic, anxious, and passionate protagonist; subtle, implied romance (without the grossing out sex so common in other films), conversion of the hero from his former line of work, since he's seen things from a different angle (the moral growth); punishing the bad guys; well developed pace and sequence of scenes - good story-telling.Generally I don't like movies to tell me their directors' and/or writers' political or troubled philosophical views. Movies are generally for good fun-they have to be enjoyed by the viewer. The writing and the lines of the movie are crisp and intelligent. There is enough good humor, yet there is what to think about as well. The acting is also at the appropriate level: Robert Downy Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges deliver - they make us understand their characters and motivations. Good film for the whole family, with the exception of some of the violence and more intense scenes even for the younger. Hopefully the sequel will not take the usual turn to the darker side of movie-making.UPDATE ON IRON MAN II: Regarding the last sentence above -- unfortunately my hopes were in vain. Iron Man II is NOT a GOOD sequel. It did take the usual wrong turn to the darker side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He is Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to reward one of the best superhero movies with a higher rating than just 8/10 stars, but each time I've seen this (now on the 5th time,) I can't get past the two major flaws and one scene, though incredibly original, I didn't personally 100% care for.Let's get the negatives out of the way, because the positives thoroughly outweigh the minor downfalls of Iron Man. #1: The story is just too damned old, familiar and makes it not only predictable, but very A-B-C. #2: The so-called "villain" is so foreseen, even for the first viewing, that it's funny they should even put in the "surprise" scene. The scene that was original, but I'm on the fence with, was the last few seconds of the film. It's hard not to give away the spoiler, but since the trailer for Iron Man 2 specifically lays it out, it's Stark (Downey Jr.) revealing his secret identity.I grew up on superheroes, namely, Superman, and one of my favorite aspects, if not the #1, is the secret identity part. Of course it can be considered unrealistic ? uh, glasses and the farm-boy stance hardly makes Superman invisible, especially to his "incredibly brilliant and reporter" partner. So, I'll give it to Iron Man as it would be hard not to put two-and-two together and they were doing just that in the finale's press conference. But, now the fun's gone and I strongly worry, though still curious, about the direction part two's going to take.Okay, glad that's over. The #1 best thing about Iron Man: Downey Jr. He made this movie. Literally without him, this would be just another run of the mill Superhero film. His wit, depth and incredibly funny one-liners shoot this film up to the top 10 (if not 5) best superhero movies. In addition, Paltrow did a great job (up to her nervous fumbling in the closing) of bouncing very nicely off him, as he did with the robots, as well. Bridges, as much as I like him, wasn't a great part of the film. I wouldn't go as far as to say he was miscast ? on the contrary, for the character he played, he did fit the part. But, he was just, well, there. Nothing special. Howard's the same and I'm not sad to see him go for the second movie.Back to Downey Jr. If the opening hilarious "taxi" ride doesn't grab you with his humor, stance and instant charisma, you might as well turn the movie off. Sure, the action's good, in fact, most of its great, but I strongly believe he made the movie.Stark is an alcoholic, rich, spoiled, womanizing, sarcastic and incredibly smart engineer who heads up his deceased father's weapon company until he gets a change of "heart" while captured, tortured and forced to break free with the Iron Man 1.0 model. After the initial transformation of Stark (inside and out) the movie plays out like almost every other superhero/comic book origin story ? again, with the exception of the phenomenal performance of Downey Jr.Not my favorite superhero ? like I said, I like the change the superhero has to QUICKLY go through to save the day and here, like Batman, it's a long drawn out process. (I will say this though, they must've known people might have a problem with that because they made it sincerely interesting, despite time-consuming.) But, they definitively got a new fan here to the decades old hero.I do look forward to #2 as well as any kind of Avengers movie with Iron Man ? as long as Downey Jr. plays Stark. I can't imagine anyone else stepping into those "not-really" Iron Shoes. (I could see them cutting costs on that Avengers movie with Iron Man now played by Freddie Prinze Jr. Save your role-stealing to Jack Bauer. Another character you'll never replace.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Writing the Origin Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an easy bet to say that Iron Man will be the best action picture of the '08 summer. Some of the credit has to go to the casting and performances of Robert Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow. They're so good it makes us realize these two actors should be in a lot more movies than they are. But most of the credit has to go to the script.There's a natural tendency to think of the action genre as the most director-dependent of all the forms, what with all their spectacle, staging, and special effects. But this is just another example of where conventional wisdom is wrong. Invariably when an action film goes wrong, it's because of the script. And when it stands above the crowd, it's definitely the script.Comic book action films like Iron Man look deceptively easy to write. Just a fun, heroic character flying around and fighting evil villains. It's actually a tricky form, because you are combining three genres: action, fantasy and comedy. In this script, writers Mark Fergus &amp; Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum &amp; Matt Holloway avoided every pitfall of the form and made all the right structural choices.One choice was already made for them. As the film that introduces the character to the audience, Iron Man is an origin story, and that is always the best story in a series. Think of Batman Begins vs. all the others, even the Nicholson one.But the key choice the writers made that set this action film apart had to do with the characters. In the Action Class, I talk a lot about how to create characters that have the capability to change, a structural element that becomes even more important when you combine action with fantasy. Here in Iron Man, instead of a superhero who is super heroic, main character Tony Stark has a number of weaknesses and is in many ways an unlikable person. Instead of being a one-note fighter for good, he is a real man with a deep need that is both believable and relevant in today's world.The writers take this same approach to the opposition. Instead of battling a silly, over-the-top villain, Stark must go up against a deadly Afghan warlord and a corporate boss who will let nothing get in the way of profit. These opponents are not detailed or deep in any way. We've certainly seen them many times before. But they are believable and relevant to the audience in the real world, and that gives the contest power beyond the boundaries of the comic book world.This grounded and real character work makes it even more surprising that this is also the funniest script of the season. The action-comedy combination has been popular for a long time (it's one of the seven comedy sub-forms I detail in the Comedy Class). In the past this has been used most often in action-crime films, like Beverly Hills Cop, as a way to show that the action hero is so good he can make jokes in the face of death. But here the comedy is used to undercut the natural pretentiousness of the superhero character. The writers extend this technique by having the main character make fun of the comic superhero form itself. This again makes him seem more real as he performs his heroic deeds, because the comic book heroes are all those other guys.The combination of action and fantasy is now virtually the sole genre of summer blockbuster films. It's obviously one of the main products that Hollywood wants to buy in their never-ending quest for worldwide popularity. If you want to write an action fantasy, do not underestimate it. Going back to the deep structure techniques necessary for any great story is your only guarantee of success.FOR MORE REVIEWS, go to www.truby.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid and cool with some flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man's summary with two words would be solid and cool. It is a highly entertaining, amusing film also with very well written dialogs. However, the film is not brilliant or that great because of some flaws. Before this movie, I had liked Downey Jr. but became a fan of him by this movie. Iron Man could be seen just for him and the character h created in this movie! Jeff Bridges's acting is great and despite he is not an interesting or bad-ass villain (he is a businessman) he is the second star of the movie and he is memorable. He is a cliché character a little bit (a black-hearted and hard-nosed capitalist), but Bridges makes him pretty deep and realistic. There are a few logical goofs and it seriously disturbed me. For example, while trying his new Iron Man equipment, he hits to the ceiling very badly. No one can stand against such a strike or the scene which he falls to the ground from miles, it causes person to die or at least heavily injured. As said, The movie is highly entertaining from the first minute till the last, as for action, there are not tons of action unfortunately, it can't change the fact that this is an action film. Especially, the scene that he tries to save a group of people and the jet scene were so well done. The climax fight of the movie was a bit short and far from being unforgettable, but a solid one. Final fights are generally waited with high expectations and mostly only a few of those meet the expectations. In terms of political background, the origins of some bad guys or the very American tone annoyed me, but I didn't mind much. By the way, there is a brilliant thing about this movie; the relationship between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts is different from all the same kind of movies here. It was twisty. However, in the end, the movie could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can he see, or is he blind?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, I'm sick and tired of big budget movies. They are all empty, shallow, vacuous excuses for entertainment, that are not worthy of our attention or money. That's what I was starting to think then, as if by inverse force of will, along comes a movie like Iron Man. Downey Jr. plays Howard Stark, a man blessed since childhood with the ability to 'engineer', to fashion the extraordinary from the seemingly ordinary. As the spiel near the start of the movie goes, at the age of 4 he built his first circuit board, at the age of 12 he built his first, erm, jet engine? Can't quite remember, but you get the idea: He was the sort of precocious young upstart who deserves nothing short of a damn good cuffing. Whilst showcasing his companies latest invention, the Jericho project, a weapons system designed, literally, to shock and awe an enemy into submission, he is kidnapped by a bunch of shady Arab sorts ? apparently it is now OK to assume that all people of Middle Eastern extraction are somehow involved in terrorism. Asked to build his Jericho system for them, he suddenly sees the light, and determines that his company will no more be involved in the manufacture of weapons ? a claim that does not sit well with his 2nd in command, Jeff Bridges hamming it up marvellously. Inevitably, as hostilities mount, a showdown looms and, ultimately, a huge CGI battle with robots hitting each other very hard kicks in. But here's the thing: Unlike that other movie of recent times that involved robots pounding the living Jesus out of one another, this is a fine film, as opposed to one of the worst movies in existence. Downey Jr. is all simmering good looks and oddball mannerisms, whilst the story ticks along at a fair old clip. The movie is plot-driven, not effects driven and whilst there is the aforementioned CGI-fest towards the end, it doesn't feel forced, more a natural progression of the plot line. With an Iron Man 2 already in post-production and an Iron Man 3 rumoured already (has the world gone completely mad?), what could have seemed an odd choice for comic book to movie conversion now simply seems inspired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron out the rough spots...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, I feel quite well qualified to rate this movie as, being a big comic-book fan (although more DC than Marvel!), I'd digested Marvel's "Essential Iron Man" re-print of all the early Stan Lee penned Iron Man comics just before this film appeared. Given my belief that, with few exceptions, movie-goers (at least mature ones like me, I suspect) prefer less crash-bang action in their super-hero flicks and more characterisation and plot, (which you invariably tend to get in origin-type stories), this film is all the better for being of that ilk.It has plenty of faults too though, which I'll get off my chest post-haste. Firstly, whilst respecting that the original Iron Man comic creation was born at the time of the Cold War and doesn't shy away from painting Iron Man's enemies as often originating from Red China or Soviet Russia, while this is okay in comicdom, I was uneasy at setting what is basically a super-hero confection in war-torn Afghanistan, especially at this particular time with the conflict far from over and US &amp; UK casualties rising.Secondly, Iron Man isn't the most original of heroes, borrowing the playboy image of Batman's Bruce Wayne and the humanitarian angst of Spider Man's Peter Parker. Also, the movie gets off to a fairly unpleasant start, with an unnecessary rock soundtrack in tow, with a gratuitous celebration of mega-rich Stark's opulent lifestyle, where women are just "what's your name again" objects of desire or easy conquest, as even a hard-nosed but attractive journalist falls too easily for Stark's dubious charms.Thirdly, there's Gwynneth Paltrow who non-acts her way throughout as Stark's "Miss Moneypenny", Pepper Potts, who in the comics blossoms from prim &amp; proper secretary to a dazzling beauty, which certainly doesn't happen here. And yes I could have done without the sub-Transformers action climax between Iron Man Marks 1 &amp; 2, but I guess you have to give the teens something to watch at the finish. Strange also to see Stark's chauffeur Happy Hogan restricted to almost "extra" status - in the comics he's every bit as important to Stark as Pepper and indeed is jealous of her feelings for Stark. Ironically this part is, I see, played by director Favreau himself! And yes, while it's de rigeur for blockbusters like this, the in your face product placement does grate (Audi &amp; McDonald's prominent amongst them).On the plus side though, there's Robert Downey, cool as anything in the lead role. Thankfully he rarely dons the Iron Man armour so he gets to act a lot, definitely a plus. Ditto an almost unrecognisable, let's be generous, somewhat filled out Jeff Bridges as Stark's double-dealing mentor Obadiah Stane. The dialogue is invariably snappy and quick-fire, with occasional stabs of humour permeating through. I do feel though the director missed out on a possibly humorous King King moment as Stane, by now having his Doctor Octopus moment in donning the recreated prototype Iron Man armour, menaces Paltrow's Potts. The closing revelation by Stark as to his alter ego is also up there with Indiana Jones shooting of the "whipmaster" in the surprise stakes, certainly I don't recall Stark revealing his identity in the comics.Best of all though is the armour, which films great in burnished red and gold. Downey's extended scenes where he attempts to master his equipment are probably the best in the film and the special effects in general are at the top-end of the scale.So there you have it, another successful addition to Hollywood's roster of comicdom and no doubt a relief to Mavel after the comparative failure of big name dramatisations like Daredevil, The Hulk (twice) and the Fantastic Four.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man An Entertaining Comic Book Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to see Iron Man I wasn't expecting much but this film surpassed my expectations thanks to a knock out the park performance by Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. In tradition of "Batman Begins" this movie tells the story of how billionaire industrialist and genius inventor Tony Stark becomes the high tech armored superhero Iron Man. Downey Jr. delivers a great performance and he owns the role from his very first scene just as Christian Bale did as Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman Begins and the late Heath Ledger did as Batman's arch nemesis the Joker in the sequel The Dark Knight. He's perfect for the role of Stark making you believe a man like him could really exist. The rest of the cast also turn in terrific performances including Terrence Howard as Tony's best friend Colonel James "Rhodey" Rhodes, Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane and later Iron's Man nemesis known as Iron Monger, and Gwenyth Paltrow as Tony's loyal assistant Pepper Potts. The film may be a bit light on action but what it does have is character development plus lots of humor, drama, some suspense, and thrills. The action sequences are well choreographed and most of them happen toward the second half of the film. The special effects are fantastic especially when Tony puts on the suit and becomes Iron Man. Jon Favreau the director and actor did a great job of bringing the character of Tony Stark and Iron Man to the big screen. The battle between Iron Man and Iron Monger at the end did feel a bit anti-climatic and a bit rushed but fortunately the good more than outweighs the films tiny flaws. Because other then that Iron Man was definitely much better than I thought it would be and now I'm looking forward to see what they have in stored for the sequel. If you haven't seen Iron Man yet then go see it. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not someone who followed comics as a child. Yeah, I enjoyed the Superman and Batman universe for what they were.I could watch the old Superman reruns when they were on TV. I watched the 60's Batman series on reruns and could enjoy them for what they were, but never got into a cult loving sense of them.I watched the Superman and Batman movies when they were released. Of the two, I personally got into the Batman movies more as they seemed to have a much greater depth to them. IMHO, except for the first, the Superman movies were really bad. I thought that the Batman movies were presented with a better story that appealed to me. For a short time, I even considered it would be cool getting a Batman tattoo. This was around the early 90's when it was in vogue.Fast forward to Iron Man. I had already seen all of the other super heroes movies released as I am a movie nut. I was not expecting too much as I had been let down from releases in the past.Boy was I wrong. The story, visuals, music, editing, plot, characters and a mix of humor were a true joy.I can't wait the the sequel that is surely to follow. They set a very high bar with Iron Man. I only hope that they can continue with a story arc that is as good as the first installment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Downey, as usual, rocks this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Downey, Jr. absolutely rocks in this film. Say what you will about his repeat trips to rehab and his "Hollywood Bad Boy" persona, but this is an actor who was truly born to play the title role. You can see just how much he enjoys himself as the playboy rich kid Tony Stark riding in a tank in the middle of a war zone, enjoying a drink and joking with the soldiers. You can't help but wonder how many of the lines were ad-libbed by Downey because the ease with which he delivers his lines is just too perfect. Gwyneth Paltrow is refreshing as Stark's assistant. While Paltrow has presented herself as a serious (dare I say pretentious?) actress in the past, she seems to relax and allow herself to enjoy the film. Her red hair helps to downplay her natural beauty allowing her to carry herself as a slightly mousy woman in comparison to the supermodels her boss usually brings home. Jeff Bridges, as always dominates the screen. He is a powerful actor and a diabolical baddie. I am impatiently awaiting the sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Take: Robert Downey Jr. is the real treat here. Comic-book movies are growing up! After the success of a revamped BATMAN franchise and the SPIDER-MAN pictures which successfully venture beyond its basic premise, it's about time Marvel's metal-suited action hero to get his share of the spotlight. I'm talking about IRON MAN, of course. And it's quite a surprise. Thankfully, IRON MAN doesn't fall on the tragic path of cheesiness and artificiality like the FANTASTIC FOUR pictures. Instead, IRON MAN is nearly as potent and mature as the SPIDER-MAN pictures, although not as dark or sinister as the new BATMAN pictures.That's fine however, since IRON MAN aims for a different approach. It's a comic book adventure for adults. It's mature and geared more to adults than on the little tykes, yet it still has the feel of a comic book movie. It's got flashy action sequences that are lighter than those in Chris Nolan's new BATMAN movies, including a rock 'em sock 'em battle between Iron Man and a larger metal-suited behemoth. It tackles deeper issues than most superhero/comic-book movies (maybe even deeper than the SPIDER-MAN movies), but it never forgets to be fun, even in the forgettable sense. Robert Downey Jr. makes an eccentric Tony Stark, a weapons industrialist and a genius, not to mention a playboy. Think Bruce Wayne meets Nicolas Cage in LORD OF WAR. Ironically, he's a superhero's own worst enemy. He sells nuclear weapons of the best quality. But after being captured by a underground terrorists asking him to re-build a weapon of his to be used against the Americans, he suits himself up with an artificial "heart" and a metal suit armed to the teeth to blow you apart.From eccentric weapons engineer, Stark finishes his advance armored suit and turns himself into a real man-of-steel of the title, much to the dismay of his superior Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges, who looks exactly like William Hurt in another Marvel-based movie of the year THE INCREDIBLE HULK), who wants Stark Industries to continue producing the latest in weapons technology. Gwyneth Paltrow also stars as Pepper Potts, Stark's assistant. But the real star is Downey Jr., a superb actor who gives deeper dimension to the typical superhero alter-ego. If the explosions and eye-popping special effects will be gone the moment you step out of the theater, the character of Tony Stark will stay with you like a person you just met. The character is funny, eccentric but most of all, memorable. Director Jon Favreau may not stage the action as good as Christopher Nolan's BATMAN pictures or like Sam Raimi of the SPIDER-MAN films, but he handles the characters real well. IRON MAN is a good start for the summer movie season, but it isn't just a while-you-wait blockbuster for THE DARK KNIGHT (arguably the summer's best picture).Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film to be entertaining as Hell. Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark, the playboy who reaches the point where he doesn't like where things go (after a traumatic experience) is fantastic. Even at the beginning of the film, when Tony is still a complete jerk, for reasons I can't explain, you can't help but like the guy.Also, it's a good idea to watch after the credits (and just before the credits of the Incredible Hulk movie).The script was funny, it had enough action in it, and Downey Jr gave one impeccable performance, with good performances from his three co-stars. Basically, I thought it was brilliant. I can't wait for the sequels and the Avengers movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can not say enough good things about this film. The story, the writing, acting, direction, casting, production design,...etc, were ALL top-notch. This is the film many Summer films aspire to be.Robert Downey Jr. struck just the right note with this character making him a bit of a playboy cad, but still immensely likable. The audience was rooting for him from the word 'go'. (Note to Mr. Spielberg: Remember when you used to create likable characters instead of annoying overly-flawed morons? War of the Worlds ring a bell?)The sexy Gwyneth Paltrow was spot-on and Jeff Bridges showed how years of acting experience can bring such weight to a role that in hands of a lesser actor most certainly would have come out as over-the-top. There were no superfluous subplots or wasted shots and the character development was adequate and came in the course of the storytelling rather than being heavy-handedly shoved down our throats. The pacing was just right and all of the action sequences were directed with a competent hand; none of those 'what the hell is happening now?' moments that are seen too frequently in other films where action scenes mean too many blurred shots and quick cuts that leave you confused. Mr. Favreau has made an intelligent film that actually has a heart and one can only hope that he keeps the sequels up to the standard of the original.Watch 'the Dark Knight' for Heath Ledger's performance, skip the Hulk and don't damage your brain with 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'. Just watch this flick and actually ENJOY A FILM for once in a while. I wish that Hollywood would get it right like this more often!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharp and exciting adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a life threatening run in with a group of terrorists, weapons maker Tony Stark (Downey) sets to work on a new weapon.After Marvel comics Spider-Man and Incredible Hulk were made into blockbuster smash hits, the trend grew with another infamous comic book being adapted and based on Stan Lee's series; this is a very effective exciting Sci-Fi thriller.Robert Downey Jr (Chaplin) stars as weapons genius Tony Stark, an intelligent man with a professional life. At times films can have a central hero with a bizarre under-explained background but Favreau dives into Stark's life before Iron Man by projecting a simplistic idea into the opening scenes. Stark is receiving an award and we take a look at photos of his past and how he came to where he is. This simplicity is brilliant, building a character in a matter of minutes whereas other films can fall in an overdose of information that plagues them throughout, but not here. Downey fits the part of the superhero. He looks it (losing weight for the part to and adlibbing his speech) and is funny, smart and unemotional, everything that the award projected to audiences. Apart from Heath Ledger's Joker, Stark is the most accurate portrayal of a comic book character to date.The supporting cast of Howard, Bridges and Paltrow give good support to the outstanding Downey but this film is all about the plot.Spider-man, X-Men and Batman films have thrown in clichés into the franchises over the years and thankfully Iron Man is a cliché and predictable free film, filled with spontaneity, life and excitement, made so by Favreau' s direction and the writing.We start in the middle of the desert and Stark is travelling to an unknown destination in the company of soldiers who immediately protect him when the explosions begin.What follows is a string of interesting and jaw dropping events such as kidnap, politics, business and the creation of the superhero. All fast and flowing, the plot is simple but exciting. There are a few lapses in the kidnap scene, not to mention a brief explanation of the hole in the chest and a typical last gasp ending fight.Iron Man is a consistent action thriller filled with fast flowing action sequences. The comedy and drama Stark has is added bonus, plus the scientific language and look at the weapons industry will please die hard fans.This is a thoroughly entertaining film which will please all ages</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An above-average superhero movie with an above-average leading performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite a few superhero movies came out in the summer of 2008 ? the first, and one of the best, was Iron Man.With the film telling the story of Tony Stark's kidnapping by terrorists, escape from said terrorists, and the subsequent building/refining/testing of his armour, the familiar red-and-gold version of Iron Man doesn't appear until more than halfway through the film. He isn't even referred to as Iron Man until right at the end. Despite knowing that there are sequels being planned, I was a little disappointed by this, but not that much: most of the origin story that comes beforehand is well worth watching, with interesting character (and armour) development, and some good humour thrown in. The action scenes and special effects are excellent. I was left dissatisfied by the ending (as in "They can't stop it there!!"), but again, maybe I'll feel better about it once the sequel rolls around.One thing I really enjoyed about this film is the realism, which is handled just as well (if not better) as in the latest Batman films. Most of the film, including the construction of the Iron Man armour, is as believable as it can be, which I feel makes it that much more fun to watch.The acting in the film is generally of a higher standard than most comic book adaptations. As Tony Stark, Robert Downey Jr provides one of the best performances of a superhero alter-ego ever, giving us a character with a great casual attitude and effective moments of seriousness, and making Stark likable despite some disreputable character traits. Gwyneth Paltrow gives a natural and impressive performance as Pepper Potts. Jeff Bridges's acting as Obadiah Stane is good at the beginning, but drops a little in quality once his character's dark side is revealed (not that there's anything wrong with watching him enthusiastically wreak havoc in his Iron Monger suit).When compared to 2008's other comic book adaptations, Iron Man is better than The Incredible Hulk, but not as good as The Dark Knight (although there's not that much difference either way). I'll be looking forward to seeing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't think so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched the Iron Man trailer, I figured okay this movie will be entertaining and something fun to see. Granted I love most of the comic book movies of recent times (except Electra, Daredevil), especially the revised Batman series, and the X-men series and Fantastic Four is getting better with each movie. Well I guess I was somewhat right. You could say I was somewhat entertained but I don't know maybe that would be an exaggeration.First the Bad: Characters we're not developed at all, so you really didn't care about anybody except for Tony Starks.Terrible plot. SPOILER: Terribly developed fight scene between Iron Monger and Iron Man, which just made me sick. All that build up for such a lame fight scene in the end. There was nothing special about it, it was short, and there was nothing to fight for by that point. Iron Man could of walked away to fight another day and we (the audience) would've lost nothing. And I know this is taboo in the comic book world, but I couldn't really believe that Tony Starks build the suit in a cave out of spare parts, something should've been done in the writing process to make it more believable.Also and this part bugs me but maybe I'm overreacting. I thought the movie was way too Pro-American Military, too Anti-Islamic, and the scenes with Afgani terrorists, well they just looked too Hollywood for me. If they were really going to use today crisis in Afganistan as a plot device I would've appreciated if they could've made it more realistic then just getting some darker skinned actors (clean shaven) and called them Afganistan terrorists. This movie re-enforced so many negative stereotypes.Okay that was a lot of bad and I did give it 7 outta 10 stars, so here's the good: Robert Downey Jr.If it wasn't for his quick witty responses and overall comic relief this movie would've bombed, because every movie nowadays has great FX (and it was great) you can't really say "the movie was good cause of the special effects". Also the comedy by other actors was very funny. I did laugh out loud a few times.So If you think, like I do, that The new Batman Series is perfect, and X-men series was pretty damn good, and believe that comic book movies need depth and realism as well as fantasy, well I would rent this movie once not expect too much and hope the sequel will be better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little reluctant to watch Ironman because I wasn't very impressed by a storyline in which a billionaire war profiteer turns into a superhero. I was even a bit more skeptical when I learned that Downey Jr. would be playing the lead role. Downey Jr. first caught my attention in U.S. Marshals and since then I have always looked forward to watching him on the big screen. Again his witty personality and charm wins me over in Ironman although I must admit I was more captivated by Bridges and Paltrows performances. I was never a fan of Paltrow until I saw her in Ironman as Starks (Downey Jr.) kind hearted and clever assistant. I only wish that she had been given a bit more screen time. This high energy action packed film will appeal to most audiences though I wouldn't waste your money buying it...I would just rent it or borrow it instead like I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic portrayal of the comic book version of Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen basically all of the "modern" superhero genre movies (I'm counting Superman with Christopher Reeve the first in that line) - and obviously Marvel and Stan Lee have raised the bar on matching scripts to original comic series. Since Marvel made Tony Stark comparable with his human foibles to the series, I felt it fit (and enhanced) the movie experience.Robert Downey Jr., one of my favorite actors, was brilliant in this film - as were Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. Gwyneth Paltrow was very good but not great as Pepper; she was a little flat, not quite as feisty as the comics portrayed her. Jon Favreau was shockingly great as Happy, and fit the part perfectly - and he's now on my top 10 director list. I also thought that Shaun Toub as Yinsen was dead-on - the fact they altered his nationality to fit the story for present day was a non-issue.The technical upgrades (robotics, holography, new alloys) compared to the original series were realistic and added to the whole experience.I cannot wait for S.H.I.E.L.D to be a reality, which it appears Marvel is going for! Most of all - finally, Stan Lee gets the kudos he has always deserved and was blocked from (particularly the money) in the earlier superhero genres movies. Stan Lee is an American icon and deserves everything, including the wealth and respect, he is starting to finally get for building such a rich tapestry for comic aficionados.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this film despite being very dubious going into it after seeing a ridiculous trailer. John Favreau has done a really good job of handling the material and bringing it all together in an entertaining way. The story flows nicely and there is a superb balance between story, character background and action scenes. The film has its weaknesses however and is flattered by its current rating at the time of writing (around 8) The characters lack any real depth and their personalities are not really developed. I hate to compare this to the new batman films but that was an example of how a superhero film could allow for real character development allowing the audience to build a complete picture of the protagonists. I agree most people want to see films like this simply for the action and explosions but I think many others now expect a bit more from action films. I think most people could enjoy the film but I think given a year or two it won't be any where near the top 250 and will have been largely forgotten about (unless they bring out a sequel of course)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man, a Great Summer Blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw Iron Man, I expected to see something that I would like just as much as other comic-to-movie adaptions (Spiderman, for instance). However, I was not expecting what I got. About half-way into the movie you can tell the Director did not do what most summer blockbuster directors do; he did not focus only on action. The story that this movie maintains is very entertaining and well-developed. I have heard people complain that this movie was doing nothing but disrespecting Arabs, but I did not see this. If this movie featured all Caucasian people, all African American people, all Hispanic people, etc. as bad guys nobody would be saying anything racist was going on. The fact is that the people who made this movie just wanted a villain familiar with people today and that villain is terrorism. Even with that point aside, it should not detract people from seeing that this is a great way to spend 2 hours.Pros: Well told storyline Great Acting Seeing Tony Stark transform from egotistic to a caring individualSuperb CGICons:Horribe climax The last line (I won't say what it is), in my opinion, ruined the ability for a sequel to reach the heights this movie did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say is, give this one a chance. The movie moves along at a fine rate, there is action aplenty and it doesn't insult your intelligence particularly badly.Robert Downey Jr is excellent in the role of the socially mal-adapted Tony Stark whose world is turned upside down when he gets captured by "evil terrorists (tm)". He realises the error of his ways and sets out to change the world.In short, the movie develops Stark's character and lets you see how he becomes who he is. The technology on display is quite far-fetched, but it serves to further the story, not dominate it, or be used as a "get out of trouble" card by the hero.Comparing this to the year's other big superhero movie, The Dark Knight, there is really no viable comparison. Iron Man is leagues better in terms of coherent story, pacing and acting. Additionally, the movie leaves you wanting more, unlike TDK which drags on endlessly.In short, if you want a decent action hero movie, you could do far worse than see Iron Man. It's also nice to see the little cameo at the end that hints at future cooperation between the different superhero franchises.Well worth watching.</fullReview>

The director delivers just enough action to make it entertaining and keep you on the edge of your seat, without overdoing it for as much a second. And the best thing? There wasn't a single "gotcha" moment that makes no sense, unlike some other comic-based movies that will remain nameless...My favorite goof in the movie, though, are the monitors in Tony's basement with the Dell logo in the front and an Apple logo on the back, rofl. I especially enjoyed that little detail (though product placement rich) because I use an Apple computer with a Dell monitor and it gets me strange looks when everybody sees it ;)The only thing this movie is missing is a bondage scene, Secretary style, between Tony and Pepper.

		<fullReview>Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the head of a large firm that makes devastating weapons of warfare. His father, who founded the company, was responsible for the A-bomb, among other achievements, and he schooled his genius son in the "fine" art of making killing devices. Now, Stark has rock-star status in the world, for he is also very handsome and rich. On a trip to Afghanistan, with Colonel James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) as a guide, Stark shows the Allied Forces his newest creation. All of a sudden, the company is ambushed and Stark is taken prisoner. Once in captivity, a fellow scientist saves his life by implanting a mechanical device in his heart, for the shrapnel that remains in his body could kill him. Now, the Afghan meanies want Stark to re-create his latest weapons for them and give him any materials he requests, within reason. But, in his new laboratory-cave, Stark instead develops a unique bit of armor that can withstand almost any attack. Naturally, with this metallic suit, he breaks out of his prison and gets rescued, nevertheless leaving bits and pieces of the armor behind. Once back in Malibu, he informs the press that his company won't be making any more weapons. This angers his longtime co-worker, Obadiah (Jeff Bridges) and puzzles his ultra-efficient personal assistant, Pepper Potts (Gywneth Paltrow). In secret, Stark begins to work on a new suit of armor that will far surpass his original work. Thus, he becomes "Iron Man", a human with the ability to fly and take out the bad guys. Will he save the world? This is an excellent, excellent film, one of the best, if not the BEST, of 2008. First, the cast is terrific. Downey's great manic abilities are slightly in check but he delivers his lines with energy, humor, and compassion. As such, he is one of the most likable comic book heroes ever put up on the screen. Bridges, too, is a marvel, as he totally "hides" in his role as the supposed friend who crosses over into the dark side. He should most definitely receive an Oscar nomination for his work. As for Paltrow, she is beautiful, intelligent, wry, and touching, nicely balancing the mostly male cast with her strong showing. Howard is one great sidekick and the rest of the cast, although mostly unknowns, are very fine. One must mention that the costumes and sets are wonderful, too. As for the special effects, the script/story, and the direction, they are absolutely mind-blowing and will transfix almost any audience out there. In short, my advice is to go, and go now, to arrange a showing, for this is one of the best "big-money" movies ever made.</fullReview>

This long awaited for movie that have been expected to do good.. well.. How can I put this? It exceeded expectations. This movie has comedy, action, and follows the story of a superhero that is basically just a cyborg, but can kick butt.The reason I dropped down the rating from 10/10 to 9/10 was the fighting scenes. When Iron Man fights a bigger Iron Man, sure it gets exciting later, but they spend about five minutes just fighting infront of the bus, and the only new camera movements that I get to see is zooming. It wasn't that fun.But, ignoring that for now, let's explain the story. Tony Stark is a millionaire or billionaire who makes weapons for the government. He is kidnapped somewhere in the middle east or another desert area, and spends six months making what was supposed to be a missile for the terrorists because they told him to make one and he will free. Well, he was making a prototype Iron Man suit and kicks the snot out of everyone and escapes. The suit fails and people find him. Well, after returning to America and eating his Burger King, he makes another suit and uses it to save people in the middle east. Well, when another forgotten name friend finds out about this, he wants to make a bigger suit and wants to take over the world.Very interesting movie, and very hilarious, too. This is another great superhero movie that you should see this summer along with The Incredible Hulk and Hancock. Great movie.</fullReview>

I was captured.The track Ironman by Black Sabbath is perfect, especially the 'I am Ironnnn-Mann!'; at first I thought that this would be like Batman Begins the characters are roughly the same, not the exact same....but both millionaires and create their own suits. The plot is based on the comics, Tony is a weapons manufacturer who is captured in Afganistan (Contemporised); by terrorist who want him to build a weapon and instead he uses this time to create the Mark 1. After escaping Tony has a epiphany and has a change of heart, stopping his company from making weapons; this causes tensions with partner Stane, who plots to bring Tony down by creating a suit known as the Iron Monger, although his name is never mentioned.I never expected Iron-Man to be a comedy and thats what caught me off guard. Comedy suits Iron Man...and so does Robert Downey Jr, Downey is Tony Stark, he gives off a brilliant performance as a fun loving bachelor and brings the hidden depths of the character to light when he realises his wrongs. Gwyneth Paltrow is sweet as Pepper Potts, while Jeff Bridges plays the conniving Stane; Rhodey is played by Terrence Howard who plays the concerning friend and ally of Stark with prominence and I have high hopes of seeing him as War Machine. Its great to see well established actors taking on these roles and making it more interesting and full of depth...The Iron Man suit is spectacular to look at and the second fight scene is satisfactory while the end fight scene with Iron Monger could have been a little better, but this is a origin story and succeeds in telling the origin of Iron Man, the S.H.E.I.L.D touch was perfect at the end.A childhood hero has been given justice...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Marvel film I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was breath-taking. Just extraordinary. I enjoy analyzing how the plot is laid out to the audience and how the character arcs are displayed.I give both a 10! The layout was extraordinary! You are introduced to Tony Stark/Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr. who's acting for such a cocky character was done perfectly, and you are instantly told of his position (how important he is to society), and you are told of his personality nice and steadily. Once Tony makes it back to America were told how he acts in society and what he thinks of life.All the supporting characters do a fantastic job. It doesn't take a long time to realize what the other character's persona's are like, so they're kind of rushed, but still easy enough to understand what they're like.The basic plot is that when Tony realizes that terrorists are using his military products, he drops out of Stark Industres and creates a suit to destroy his other inventions. That's basically it. It's a better film then how i present it. I swear.The fight scene at the ending is entertaining and fun, better than the usual 2-minute trash you'd see in a Marvel Superhero movie.I highly advise people to see this film and to own it on DVD when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome back, Robert Downey Jr.!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks Marvel, for having the guts to cast Robert Downey Jr. He brings the soul into a mainstream-plot. Also thanks for the writer for putting some nice dialogues into the movie. The scene, when iron man first tries to flight even compensates the ripped-off fighting scene (does anybody remember Robocop, ehm...Aliens?, ehm..Matrix?, ehm..transformers?:). But if you want to make things better, there must be something that's not good enough. So I'm curious to see what happens next. Even if it's a cameo of Iron Man in the new "Incredible Hulk". By the way, what a funny surprise to see Samuel L.Jackson at the end of the credits!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the Iron Man movie was announced, I was unusually ambivalent (unusual as I'm a massive comics nerd with a ton of IM comics amongst my megaton collection). Casting news and rumours still failed to spark in my imagination (possibly as the scars of the execrable Spider-Man 3 had me fearing the comic movie bubble had burst). Then the news that Robert Downey Jnr came through and I thought "Mmmmm?interesting". Then, well, then came the first trailer ? a riot of action, tongue in cheek humour, spectacle, rock n' roll and, in Tony Stark, possibly the best realised alter ego since Christopher Reeve first arrived in Metropolis. Against my usual efforts to not get my hopes up, I began to look forward to Iron Man, and by the time that I saw it, my expectations were huge. And, most shockingly of all, it totally delivered on all counts. This is, for my money, the best superhero film since Superman II. That's all I've got to say. If you haven't seen it, rectify that right now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the brazilianth superhero movie to come out the US in the last picosecond. And it's not too bad, but, like with most of them, I doubt I will be as willing to see any subsequent sequels.In its favour is the performance of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man. The movie is basically boot-camp for people unfamiliar with the titular hero. In other words, you get the genesis of the character "Iron Man". Stark, as played by Bob Downey is smug, but fortunately comes with a dry sense of humour. Stark is a brazilianaire who inherited his fortune from his military industrialist father. Utilising his own scientific brilliance, Tony Stark has carried on in his father's footsteps and is now the supplier of choice for the US military.His Personal Assistant is Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Quirky name, but not in the same league as Pussy Galore, or Alotta Fagina. Paltrow provides her character with a degree of warmth...and coolth. She is reminiscent of some of Woody Allen's leading ladies at times, too, like Mia Farrow or Diane Keaton.Anyway, the story is basically about how Tony has a crisis of conscience after he gets a taste of his own medicine, arms wise, in the Middle East. Generic Middle Eastern terrorists are one of the main bad guys in this film.In a way this is an American fantasy about itself. In Hollywood movies like this, America plays the hero in the Middle East and Americans care a lot about not inflicting civilian casualties. This is ably demonstrated by Iron Man in one scene where the phrase "surgical strike" is not pure spin.A theme of this movie is the struggle between the individual conscience and that of society or bodies like the military/Pentagon. Stark has a foot in both camps and thus sometimes mud will stick where you least expect it to.As I was just about to leave the theatre, after the end credits, an extra scene appeared, hinting at the nature of the sequel. Dunno if I'll see it.7/10</fullReview>

I expected a good film. You know what? I got it.From a great lead character (thank god Robert Downey Jr. has cleaned himself up. He is great in this film), dazzling yet not overdone special effects, and direction that allows this film to go at a tight pace...Iron Man soars.What an enjoyable cinematic experience.

		<shortDescription>A comic book movie that doesn't stink (Nick Fury spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who is unfamiliar with Iron Man in particular and Marvel Comics in general, I was intrigued by the good reviews of this film that I read. A movie based on a comic book character that doesn't stink? How is this possible? I was happily surprised that the movie doesn't stink because Robert Downey, Jr. plays an actual character instead of a caricature of a superhero. The other actors do a great job as well, but he really carries the show. His character growth, from the initial naiveté and arrogance stemming from thinking his weapons were purely used for good, to the realization that what his company was doing was more complicated than what he thought, to his development and actual use of the Iron Man suit, shows a two-dimensional playboy tycoon's transformation to a full-fleshed human being with a heart.While "Iron Man" is a movie purely for entertainment and not a contender for any acting performance Oscars, the character development was enough to make this English major proud. It also left me wondering why other superhero movies aren't this good. If "Iron Man" can do it, why can't other movies? Perhaps other characters have not been as fleshed out as Tony Stark was in the comic books. I don't know for sure, because I don't read Marvel comics. Maybe this movie also should be taken as a call for more developed characters in movies purely meant for entertainment, instead of just the cool fighting scenes and flashy special effects movies Hollywood seems to be always cranking out to make money. Surely this is more difficult to do, but as this movie's performance at the box office shows, such effort would be heavily financially rewarded.Well, enough of the review, here is the spoiler: As for the scene with Samuel L. Jackson playing Nick Fury that you all missed, it played after the ending credits, discussed the "Avenger Initiative," and left no doubt in anyone's mind that there will be a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man vs. Batman Begins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I do indeed highly recommend Iron Man. The movie was well done, and Robert Downey was brilliant for the role. The CGI was incredible although I would have loved to have seen some more intense action scenes that dealt with Iron Man facing a more challenging opponent. The lines were great, the cast was awesome, and some of the scenes with Stark alone with his robots were priceless.However, many people have come to say this movie is the "best comic book based movie to date". I would have to disagree. Although it was highly entertaining, Batman Begins takes the spot at the top. Iron Man was bit too unrealistic for me. I am not talking about how his suit was made but some of the scenes in the movie were a little too fake. I won't go into any details but perhaps a little more clarification on how this happened and so forth would have made the picture better. There were also some scenes that one would look at and say that would never happen (again not talking about his suit or anything in that manner). Batman Begins goes through step by step how he became who he is and what got him there. There weren't any scenes that made yourself say, "psh yeah right".Again, highly entertaining movie and I do recommend it to kick off the summer. My advice is to stay seated through the credits...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very excellent depiction of the comic book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid I've never read comic books, and is still true to this day, but I have seen a lot of cartoons that are based on comic books. When I first viewed the character of the Iron Man, I gotta say that he was probably the least favorite hero of all the many others, such as Spiderman, Superman, X-Men, etc... It didn't fit that fantasy of superheroes that have some kind of unnatural super power. So I certainly didn't get excited when I first heard that Iron Man was going to become a film.For the film itself there really wasn't much to the story that I haven't seen before. There are heroes and there are villains--as simple as that. Although while viewing the film I actually felt like a little kid again. Everything was just new and cool. The CGI, and the comedy ensued throughout the film really made it extremely entertaining. I thought Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent job as the lead, as well as Jon Favreaus' directing. Throughout their careers, usually Downey and Favreau would play supporting roles and hardly ever starring in films, and this film really got'em out of that threshold. They have certainly made an impression on me, with it seeming as if their careers would never take off, or even dwindling, they have gone 'against the grain' and have leaped on to the top of Hollywood.I certainly can't wait for the sequels. It will only get better and better, especially with CGI getting better. With CGI any film is possible, and this film is proof of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went into theaters, I didn't think Iron Man would be all that good. I thought it would be another comic book-turned-movie mess up like The Hulk, Ghost Rider, or X-Men (excluding X-Men 2 of course). Yet this film is one of the greater super hero movies I've seen. With its superb visuals to its magnificent main character played by Robert Downey Jr. who seems like he was born for the role of Tony Stark a.k.a Iron Man. It begins when Tony Stark is in Afghanistan on an army convoy when it's attacked by terrorists. He is captured and is forced to build a missile of his own for the terrorists to use in dominating Asia and possibly even the world in time. Instead, he secretly builds a suit of armor that helps him escape ultimately leading to his rescue. When he gets back to the U.S. he decides to no longer build weapons and put people in harms way. He builds two suits, the Mark II and the Mark III that he uses to fight against the same terrorists that captured him. Eventually Obadiah Stane, who is sort of second in command at Stark Industries, uses his own suit and becomes Iron Monger, trying to kill Iron Man so he can rule over Stark Industries himself. The movies' combined action, visual effects, characters, and humor make this movie one of the top three super hero movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was commenting about Spider-man 3 earlier, and this film is almost the antithesis of that. It's lean, slick, smart, and it only has one villain, and a really well-fleshed out one at that! This is what every Marvel film should be like.Robert Downey Jr. puts so much heart and soul into this role that I believe it's one of his best roles since 'Chaplin'. He really nails the character well, and his comic timing is absolutely perfect in this one. He realizes that it's his time to shine, and he uses the opportunity immensely.Gwyneth Paltrow takes one of the more shallow characters in the comic and makes it her own. The chemistry between Stark and Potts is undeniable. She's so much more than a damsel in distress in this one. She plays a pivotal role in the film and is just as important as every other character in it.Jeff Bridges raised my eyebrows when I heard the casting, but he works perfectly within the context of the film. His change in look is drastic enough to easily make him the defacto villain in this film. Having said that, I didn't quite buy into his turn later in the film, but that's just a minor quibble.Terrence Howard knows full well that he will get his opportunity to shine in the sequel, but that's not to say that he phoned in his performance as Jim Rhodes. His concern about Tony will start to become more and more a center point in the story as time goes on, and it seems that Terrence knows he has a role with meat on it to keep him interested for the long haul.The special effects of this film are absolutely amazing, and I didn't feel this way about a man flying since the first Superman way back in 1978. We are taken on a ride with Iron Man, and I must say it's quite exhilarating.I believe that this will be one of the huge Marvel hits of the summer, with the Incredible Hulk showing great promise as well. Marvel Studios is very deserving of each and every dollar spent to see this film, and I believe that the future looks bright for future cross-overs/appearances of other Marvel superheroes in other films. Make Mine Marvel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some weird reason a lot of movies involving incredible CG effects seem to forget that it should also be accompanied by an equally well written script. With this in mind, I went into the movie house just expecting to be entertained with visual eye-candy more than anything else. But with Iron Man, I was glad to have been proved wrong. Iron Man is simply the best Marvel movie that ever came out. Faithful to the material, stunning special effects, amazingly well written, though the plot *might* be predictable (well...to fans of the comic book anyway), the execution was exceptional.I'm giving this a 9/10 just because I think they went a bit over the top with the ending. Other than that, you can't afford to miss this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relentless firepower for boys and girls of all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago, after the debacle that was the "Batman And Robin" movie, there was a lot of discussion about who should be the next actor to portray Batman. It was considered by many that George Clooney came up short in many ways and fatally contributed to the negative feeling about that movie. (Not an opinion shared by me, by the way, but my feelings on "Batman And Robin" has changed a lot in the years since it's release. A discussion for another time.)Who should it be? Clint Eastwood in an adaptation of "The Dark Knight Returns"? Keanu Reeves in a movie directed by the Wachowski Brothers? Kurt Russell? Brad Pitt? All of those names were mentioned.I remember commenting to my Brother that they should go with somebody like Robert Downey Jnr. Laugh? I thought he would never stop.Robert Downey Jnr??? A man who had been arrested several times for drug related offences. A man who had snorted his talent up his nose. A man dropped from a prime slot in a Woody Allen movie, because the insurance company refused to insure him. A man whose career was effectively over, barring cameos in television series' and the odd movie gig.Yes, I said. Robert Downey Jnr. A really good actor, when his mojo is on. A man who had lived duality. A man who could portray the irresponsible playboy Bruce Wayne, but also the darkness required for a serious Batman?Of course history shows that it did not happen, but I was not too unhappy. "Batman Begins" was a killer movie, Christian Bale was great and I don't think that Robert Downey Jnr. playing Batman would have made it any better or any worse.This brings me to "Iron Man". Robert Downey Jnr. playing an irresponsible playboy and a vengeful, costumed superhero. (I still have my crystal ball, and am available for readings, if anybody is interested.)Robert Downey Jnr. makes "Iron Man". He really does. "Iron Man" would not have been half good without him. He is funny, sarcastic, sexy and charismatic, and just about dominates every scene that he is in, whether in costume or not. I read one comment that said "Iron Man" would have been just as good if it had been called "Tony Stark" and Iron Man had never made an appearance at all. I don't think that I would disagree with a word of that. If I had to make a small criticism I would say that Robert Downey Jnr. is so good, he diminishes everybody else on screen at the same time as him, and these people are certainly not chopped liver. (Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Terence Howard.)I thought that "Iron Man" was a great film. Action packed and fast moving. A big, bright powerhouse of a movie. Everything a hardware obsessed superhero movie should be. Relentless firepower for boys and girls of all ages. I liked the pointed subtext about science being corrupted by the military. Technology can be used for good or bad, a theme faced by Albert Einstein in real life and Tony Stark in "Iron Man".Bring on "Iron Man 2". I can hardly wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mechanical encrusted on the living, with a a vodka martini</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this story supposed to have political significance? In it Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), the brilliant playboy scion of a megabucks American weapons manufacturer (are there cut-rate ones?), discovers that his company's products, which he ostensibly thought used to protect the US and preserve "peace," are being supplied to some multinational bad guys in Afghanistan. To keep us guessing about who's being demonized this time, these blokes speak Egyptian Arabic, Dari, Pushtu, Hungarian, and after that I lost track. You wonder how they carry out their operations since they change languages every five minutes. Naturally their leader turns out to speak perfect English so he can spar verbally with Tony as the need arises.While Mr. Stark is held prisoner with a friendly foreign scientist, he's supposed to develop a super-rocket so the bad guys can take over the whole region if not the world, but miraculously he manages to conceal the fact that he's in fact not doing that at all but engineering a spectacular escape by cobbling together a giant robotic weapons-fitted iron suit out of scraps. That'll show them.Oh and by the way, Stark's chest got filled with shrapnel when the baddies captured him, so he's fitted first with a giant magnet to keep the lethal metal from going to his heart, and then some sort of artificial heart gadget. It's supposed to be a wonder but we're not to know how it works. All we know is that it gives out a luminous glow. It's the symbol that Tony himself, hitherto into life only for the pleasure it could give him, has acquired an ability to care. He rushes home, flying through the air being one of his suit's abilities, and after declaring his Stark Weapons Technologies out of the weapons business, begins devising a much more high tech and sleek version of the robotic suit thing, in red, and no longer made of iron but some sorts of miraculous alloys.There is a little of James Bond in Tony Stark. He likes to drink, he likes women, and frankly, up to now, he doesn't give a damn. On top of that he has wavy hair, a sharp mustache, a nice tan, and a fearsome intellect. His repartee is rapid fire and offhand and only occasionally mimics the delivery of Kevin Spacey. Remember Bond's blazing Astin Martin? This robotic suit thingy is some sort of grossly hypertrophied offshoot.There are two kinds of real fun in Iron Man for those who are patient enough to sit through all the wizard explosions and pointless political confusion. One is the dazzling special effects of Tony's private robot suit factory (he shares his process only with tool-manipulating robots that he handles with witty condescension). This stuff becomes most entertaining when Tony learns how to fly, with some nasty bumps along the way; but for gadget geeks the elegant complexity of the artificial limbs and head and the way they click miraculously onto Tony are equally pleasurable. The other fun thing is to see Bridges and Downey Jr. and Paltrow play off each other. Yes, real people can be fun in a movie too.It ought to be inexorably comic, since the concept of the robot suit donned by a man is such a literal expression of Bergson's definition of comedy--"the mechanical encrusted upon the living." Only it isn't. Nor are obvious, perhaps much too obvious, implications about technology shielding man from his humanity, ever brought to light in this movie.Well, yet another comic book has been brought to multi-million-dollar screen life in Hollywood. Favreau has assembled an excellent cast and one stops wondering why they bother (for the money, yes?) when one sees how typically mercurial and witty Robert Downey Jr. is in the lead, how disconcertingly unpleasant Jeff Bridges becomes as Obadiah Stone, his would-be nemesis, and how appealing and present Gywneth Paltrow is in the neutral role of Tony Dare's (Downey's) girl Friday, Pepper Potts (cute name). Terrence Howard is wasted and too mild as some kind of air force commander who basically just works for the weapons company.You might wonder why Iron Man has done so well with adult film critics. Isn't this just adolescent fare given a mild gloss of adulthood and a heavy extra coat of S/X? But then you think of how much better this is than the competition, and you understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really well done characters liven this film with wit and fun interaction. Robert Downey Jr. makes a good superhero surprisingly and the other characters portrayed by Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Gwynethh Paltrow and Faran Tahir were equally effective. I was really surprised that in a movie of this type we would display a scene showing importance to Fathers and making a statement of innocent men. We always hear the cliché phrase of "Innocent women and children" as if there are no innocent men in the world and our feminist focused society usually does absolutely nothing but demonize men at all costs. In the film we see the father saved and reunited with a loving son, instead of having the father killed(Oh, no big deal.) but spare the mother because she is the only parent we should be concerned about. I guess the argument about the rich guy who is the superhero has been done, but this is a comic book adaptation and hey he has to get the money to make this stuff somehow. . . Also one prop gets walked off and obviously will become important later in the movie(That is only a minor complaint.) On a whole this is a great action movie with great characters and yes, another franchise on the way!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well executed; Downey Jr. and Favreau shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into the 4:30 showing of "Iron Man," I tried to keep my expectations reasonable. I had heard from countless critics that it was worth watching, as well as reading similar positive comment from IMDb users. Thanksully, I was not let down watching this movie. This film is well directed with great performances from all of the actors, most especially Robert Downey Jr. as the lead. The material backing up this movie is strong and well presented. John Favreau's direction reminded me of Christopher Nolan's for "Batman Begins." It is of a very high level.I won't give away too much of the plot; if you've seen the trailers that should be enough. Needless to say, the trailers are a bit misleading; this film is a bit darker and more complex than it seems. This is more than just a story of a changed man looking to protect the world from evil. He must also have to make tough decisions involving the weapons company he owns, his personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his unstable partner Obadiah Stone (Jeff Bridges), his military friend Jim Rhodes (Terrance Howard), and his own personal image. The complexity of the story is the movie's greatest strength. Tony Stark cannot simply go around saving the world without annoying (or downright insulting) some people in the process. The journey ahead is not easy, and Stark knows it.As far as the acting goes, Downey Jr. is excellent as the anti-hero Stark. He pulls of the role of Stark with a weird sense of humor, an occasional sarcastic wit, yet with enough intelligence to make us side with him. Downey Jr. does not simply wink at the camera here; he embodies the role and makes Tony Stark/Iron Man a reality. The script also helps here; by the end of the film, Tony Stark/Iron Man is a fully fledged and developed character. My fullest compliments to Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow also does very well as the female lead Pepper Potts, with a strong sense of loyalty to Tony. Jeff Bridges and Terrance Howard have had bigger roles and more fleshed performances, but they are more than capable with the material they have here as Obadiah Stone and Jim Rhodes. Leslie Bibb also has a minor role as a reporter with an interest in Tony Stark.The visuals work well, and the film has a very good look to it. I absolutely loved the assembling of Iron Man, and the first time he kicks ass in the Afghan desert is worth a second watch. But the visuals and production design of Iron Man aren't what's important here, it's the characters and story and direction. Indeed, Favreau executes this movie near perfectly. He delves into the life of Tony Stark, developing him to the point of where he is neither good nor evil, but simply a well-rounded 3-dimensional guy. He also makes us get highly invested into the story as well, which is a good thing, as it is rich with complexity and occasional twists. Finally, he develops suspense well, and makes the film have a great sense of humor throughout (actually, on that latter statement, most of the credit should be given to Downey Jr. there).Minor quibbles occur in the climax, which had some very far fetched parts within, and with the motives Obadiah Stone. The ending is also very sudden. But that's okay, because the material as a whole is more than strong enough to make you think highly of the film. This is a great film and one of the more mature comic book blockbusters out there. It is a film for the intelligent film viewer, and the best start we've gotten to a summer season since 2000's "Gladiator." Thank you Robert Downey Jr. and John Favreau for this fine work.P.S. Stay tuned for the credits. There's a little scene afterwards that you don't want to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this movie with the problems of Transformers and Spiderman 3 fresh in my mind, I was dubious as to how well this film was going to entertain me, based largely on the fact this'll be the zillionth comic book adaptation made in the new millennium. However, the mere fact that Robert Downey Jr. was attracted to the screenplay made me considerably more open minded, but still with that minor bit of scepticism.I liked this film for two major things: it doesn't seem to hype up US might, and instead rather sets the argument out about its corporate weapon manufacture; and also because it is designed to entertain you, therefore it doesn't take itself too seriously - this shows in the screenplay. The jokes are good, and the playful relationship between Stark/Potts comes through. The opening of the film is also a wonderful entry to the movie (even if there are a lot of inaccuracies: you don't use heavy metals to construct a nuclear missile, and would take more than just a couple weeks to build), and the ending leaves you wanting more, rather than other comic book movies that just made more movies for the hell of it. Also, the characters and their interaction with one another are well developed - at least, for a Hollywood blockbuster.Mistakes then. The action seems too recycled from other action movies, and some jokes that they use (the family in the car) are old and past their sell-by date. Whilst I'm not complaining about the casting of a beach babe as the "reporter with morals", I'm sure a lot of feminists would have walked out of the cinema within 20 minutes of the start of the film. But this fits in line with the film's self-awareness of its over-the-top-ness.Overall, a decent film, and the first "big" film of its kind that I've afforded a score above a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Iron Man" raises the bar for superhero movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Iron Man" is every bit as good as "Spider-Man (1)". The character is lesser known to the public, but he is a central figure in the Marvel universe. No prior knowledge is necessary to thoroughly enjoy this movie, but it is packed full of references to the source material, a real joy for a lifelong Marvel Comics reader and fan like me. One can just feel Marvel Studios flooring the accelerator on future adaptations ("Thor", Captain America", and "The Avengers" are all listed in IMDb as being in pre-production). Do NOT miss this movie: it is loads of fun, crisply paced, and well-acted. It is not just a great superhero movie, but a great movie, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good superhero movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When billionaire weapons maker Tony Stark is captured by terrorists in Afghanistan, he builds a suit of iron to allow him to escape. When he discovers that the weapons his company make are being used against innocent civilians and American troops, he re-designs his suit to fight back.....I don't know that much about Iron Man and Tony Stark. I never read the comics on which the character is based. So going into this I had no expectations what I was about to see. And I'm glad as this is one of the best superhero movies so far.Robert Downey Jr, as Stark is clearly having a blast in the role. Stark comes over as a fun guy, more interested in designing the weapons than ever really thinking about them being used, but when his eyes are opened up after his capture, you do see the change in the character.The rest of the cast are also pretty good, with special mention to Jeff Bridges, Terence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow. In a way the casting here is similar to the approach taken by Batman Begins, in that they have gone for good actors as opposed to big name stars.In fact, the plot of this movie is structured in a similar way to Batman Begins. Both movies don't show the hero in his 'proper' costume until nearly an hour into the movies, and both start with a smaller threat before engaging the main villain in the movie.The visuals and CGI by Industrial Light and Magic are superb. The only criticism I have about them, and it's a minor flaw only, is that the final confrontation between Iron Man and his opponent is very similar to Transformers. This is understandable giving it is two men fighting in metal suits, and as I said, only a minor flaw.Jon Favreau is a curious choice of director. Not known for making big budget action movies, he acquits himself well. As I said, it the casting helps, and he draws excellent performances from them, and the action is also impressive.While this movie is not quite up to the brilliance of Batman Begins (in my opinion the superhero movie against all others are judged), it is an impressive origin story of a hero, and you do hope that any sequels are just as good.Oh, and if you do go see this, stay until after the credits.... there's a nice little scene for fans!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah! This movie was flamboyantly ROCKIN'!! Robert Downey Jr's quickly-delivered one-liners were barbed with bite by marvelous Marvel scriptwriters, and Downey's delivery was as impeccable as his Malibu house.**SPOILER ALERT** The story begins crisply as Tony Stark's military escort in the Mideast sands is ambushed by terrorists. This scene is swift, and very realistic for this type of flick.Then, we get a major flashback which uploads tons of information on Tony Stark's character, career, and friendships. Here, we get big bang for the buck invested in this background.A mini-story then transpires, giving us a glorious new beginning for the man of iron, including a terrific technical segment long enough to linger, and short enough to keep our attention. Here, Tony also receives his motivations for the remainder of the movie.After a battle royale, and rescue (I don't want to give away too many details), Tony Stark continues constructing an updated version of the suit.Engaging enemies in foreign lands, and taking to the skies like a rousing rocket, Iron Man is born! Of course, Iron Man meets a formidable enemy, but it won't be who you think it is.Other great aspects to this movie are a generous portion of good-natured and true humour, a very believable Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, an unobtrusive Cuba Gooding Jr, great Lucasfilm robotics, and a cool music score.Now, some bad points: (1) Iron Man's major foe has two question marks which are not explained - namely, how can the foe exist if the technology is not backwards-compatible with Tony Stark's creation? and how can the foe be formidable without any experience with the technology? (2) Major explosions generally cause great damage, injury, and loss of life, yet the finale will have you scratching your head as to realism in these things.However, these negatives aside, "Iron Man" was worth the price of admission.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story ... Nice effects!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie combines a good story with some nice special effects. The result is an action-packed movie that is fun to watch. Now, it's not without its flaws - but it's not easy doing "yet-another" superhero movie either. Fortunately for audiences, the overall result is strong.Basically, Iron Man is about a billionaire businessman and weapon scientist who has a change of heart after he is injured in a war zone. He develops a new energy source and body armor that give him the ability to fight terrorists - especially those who are using weapons he helped develop. But things turn out to be a little more complicated than they seem ...If you like special effects - this movie has scenes that won't disappoint. The body armor / suit looks pretty cool and the flying sequences are outstanding. (There's an older movie called the "Rocketeer" which had similar scenes, but didn't capitalize enough on them enough like this movie).Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges and Gweneth Paltrow all do great acting jobs - especially Jeff Bridges, whose performance is superb. While the editing and some aspects of the plot seem a bit too rushed at times, the overall movie succeeds anyway.It's hard to think about who would 'not' enjoy at least something in this movie - so it's pretty easy to state that this one's worth seeing for just about everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lives up to the hype, and just might trigger even more hype for the sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To kick-start the 2008 blockbuster season is an enjoyable entertaining first look at Marvel's answer to DC's Batman. After years of begging, one of Marvel's more popular comic books appears on the big screen equipped with a stellar cast, massive budget, and drastic marketing campaign displaying how much more fun it is to follow the man in the metallic suit rather than the man in leather. Iron Man is a film that contains enough attitude and energy to intimidate other films of the same genre. Much like Batman Begins, Iron Man slowly but surely explains the origins of our hero and displays how and why he becomes the superhero that we all know. The only difference is Iron Man is simply a lot more fun and enjoyable to watch.The hero in this tale starts off a womanizing, sarcastic, selfish and carefree leader in a weapons manufacturing business. Tony Stark was trying to sell his latest greatest inventions overseas when suddenly he is kidnapped and is forced to manufacture weapons for the enemy. Right then and there he realizes that he's accidentally producing for the enemies as well as for the allies. Upon this revelation and being caught up in the middle of it, he crafts his greatest invention: which is a killing, nearly invincible machine full of ammunition and tricks. With a few major adjustments, this ultimate weapon becomes his new alter-ego, which is the heroic yet fearful Iron Man.Iron Man's biggest strength lies in the realism. Guess what, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is not a flawless hero, he has his moments of questionable decisions, lack of morals, and inability to see some of the dangers he creates. His secretary (Gwyneth Paltrow) is not a mere toy for our hero, nor does she settle for Stark and all his flaws. The lack of attempt to make the superhero seem perfect is definitely a breath of fresh air when compared to recent comic book movies. To add to that, Iron Man is not a mindless action movie full of explosions and carnage; most of the movie focuses on Tony Stark and his transformation from carefree millionaire to protector of the general public. Using a great script from Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, the movie is sprinkled with great one-liners, good dialogue, and very little slow-down and unimportant moments.Robert Downey Jr. does an absolutely stellar job as Tony Stark, and fits the role perfectly. Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and Terence Howard do pretty well with the material they were presented, with the exception of one scene that wasn't supposed to be funny (Bridges can't yell). Complimenting the acting is the special effects, which never overpowers the actors nor does it overpower the scene. When Iron Man is fighting, the only thing you can do is sit back and enjoy the wild ride. The special effects weren't the greatest, but they certainly got the job done. Unfortulately, the final fight wasn't that great because we witnessed robotic carnage to the nth degree last year in Transformers. Topping Spielberg and Michael Bay is never easy in terms of action pieces.What keeps Iron Man from becoming a comic book movie with the top-notch quality of the best comic book movies (My personal favorite is Spider-Man 2) is the fact that the main character and alter ego need time for presentation and introduction to the audience. The potential in the Iron Man franchise is not only immense, but it basically spills into the screen at all times, especially in the final moment after the credits. Iron Man is the beginning of something potentially very special. Spider-Man 2 had the advantage of us knowing the man behind the suit, and got the pass to deliver two hours of intense, emotional, and excellent film-making. Iron Man 2 can be the next Spider-Man 2, as long as the same amount of dedication and effort is put into the project.Bottom Line: In the meantime, we have one heck of a flick here, as Iron Man dwells beyond the typical comic book flick and delivers a great start to the 2008 summer movie season. Great acting, excellent special effects, and more promise for the future of Iron Man should be enough reason for you to see this. Even if you don't know a lot about the comic book, the movie does a great job in presenting the man behind the iron mask in all his glory (and anti-hero glory). Recommend, as the beginning of a great franchise is offered here.P.S. Except a killer soundtrack here too.</fullReview>

Gwyneth Paltrow was very easy on the eyes. I really liked the Iron Man suit. The plot stuck to the Iron Man story line. There were some hilarious lines by both Downey and Paltrow.Without a doubt, this will be the box office monster hit of the summer. I read some of the negative reviews. I have no idea what they are complaining about. This was an excellent movie if you are an Iron Man fan. I haven't read a comic book in 35+ years but went because this super hero was one of my favorites as a kid. It delivered!! Hollywood actually got something right. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard that Robert Downey Jr. was chosen for the role of Tony Stark, I said "Excellent choice.I still hold that belief to be true.Downey played the role of billionaire playboy to the hilt.The writers updated the story and instead of being in Vietnam, it is now Afghanistan.For those of us who read the Iron Man comics as children we know his heart is damaged and a kidnapped doctor keeps him alive by using a sort of pace maker.Stark is forced to work on weapons of mass destruction for the rebels. But instead makes a suit of armor, similar to the knights of old.He escapes and decides that WMD's are not what he wants to build anymore Jeff Bridges plays the character of Obadiah Stane as one deceptive bad guy.Gwyneth Paltrow is very good in her role of Pepper Pots. She and Stark have a good relationship that has an underlying sexual tension In the end, however the sexual tension is delayed by a battle between Stark and Stane.Just a quick note to those of you who walk out during the credits thinking the movie is over better not as there is a teaser for the sequel.Hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron man-comic vs. film!! (spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the movie last night and was honestly impressed. In comparison to past comic movies I thought it was pretty damn close to perfection.Robert Downey was a great Tony Stark, a little older than the character would normally be but it still worked. All the other characters were equally as well matched with actors.My only bone with this movie was that some of the scenes seemed to drag, and though this may not be a popular opinion I honestly don't like Samuel L. as Nick Furry. When I see him I don't see Nick Furry I see him as Samuel L./Windu/and a crap load of other characters. One of the reasons why I liked the casting for X-men was because most of the actors weren't that famous. I could make the connection between them and the character rather than thinking of all their past characters. This may just be me being anal but it's what I think.As a comic nerd and a practical person I know they don't make movie adaptations for fans. I know they do a little bit but it's mostly to bring non readers in and entertain. If anyone bothers to read this and doesn't read comics I encourage you to pick one up. People put negative connotations with comic reading, but as someone that reads both comics and regular literature I can say some of the best characters and story lines I have ever read came out of comics.They movie was great. One of or the best comic movie yet I think. I look forward to a sequel even though Sam L. is going to be Nick Furry. I am also looking forward to Wolverine Origins. Which will have the first movie appearance of Deadpool!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine Slice of Comic Book Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great start to the summer blockbusters, Iron Man features an endearing performance by Robert Downey Jr as the ludicrously wealthy playboy genius, excellent SFX that manages to pull off the near-future sci-fi aesthetic with a convincing grounding in reality, solid characterisation of the two leads and a story as far from the by-the-numbers superhero origin schlock as one can reasonably expect. That is until the final twenty minutes of course, when the narrative enters predictable 'evil all along' territory and throws in a nemesis of face-palming obviousness. While I realise the logical antagonist for an robot suit is a slightly bigger, more advanced robot suit - and it may seem unrealistically critical to bemoan a Marvel film for being predictable - it simply felt like an insulting kick in the balls after the finely crafted first half.Also the phrase, 'But you'll die!' nearly caused my eyes to roll completely from my head.That aside, Iron Man is a fine return to form for the comic adaptation after the Spiderman franchise swallowed a large slice of jingoistic apple pie and shat itself inside out, and it's refreshing being drawn to a protagonist so utterly unlikable in principal. If anyone in our humdrum real world owns a plane with a private pole dancing lounge and numerous flight attendents hired for their large breasts and aversion to clothes, they can happily sod off back to their Bel Air mansion and die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Start to A Promising Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a rare to see near-perfect casting, the cast ably preforming their parts, the direction great, the cinematography crisp, the script coming from a real direction and the CGI not look campy or cheesy. Well Iron Man did this, and did it without looking in over it's head.Spiderman stressed the "With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility" line and did it great too. Batman Begins made a superhero, human, sure Batman isn't a superhero per-say, but that was his appeal. Iron Man actually pulls off both of these.Tony Stark a genius billionaire Arms Manufacturer has a near death experience after he is kidnapped in Afganistan and forced to build a missile for his captors. While in captivity, Tony sees that his captors have most of Tony's weapons (that he later finds have been funded to them under the table, through STARK INDUSTRIES) and they are killing innocent people. Tony escapes by building the first Iron Man suit, he is brought home and he comes to the realization that he can do something about his weapons killing innocent people. He builds the more perfected Iron Man suit. With this he fights injustice basically.The Action is sparse, but I really enjoyed it, It shows the movie wasn't hiding behind the action but that action stands WITH the character development and plot.I would say this movie is a 8.5, but I'd rather give this a nine before I gave it an 8. This was a great start of a franchise that should go on for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert was a great Tony Stark. He plays the character perfectly. The way he treats the reporter is like the character would and the relationship with pepper is almost like a mirror to the comics. It only needed more intervention from Happy Hogan (aka Jon Favreau). The only reason I don't give this a perfect score is the slight lack of super action and only one real villain. Oh and from keeping Rhodes from being War Machine. OK lets go on to acting; adequate. Not the greatest in the world but FAR from the worst. Like a mile or so. Downey plays almost all the jokes to perfection. The scene with the fire extinguisher robot had me rolling, and for some reason everyone clapped when he finally sprayed Stark after the crash. Weird, but any ways the CGI looked AWESOME. I actually had some trouble seeing what was real and what was CG. (trust me not all the scenes, mostly at the end when stark loses his helmet and actually wears part of the suit on set oh it was fake when he was flying trust me).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better Superhero movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always liked Iron Man growing up but I thought it was ripe for having "Hollywood types" mess it up. I am very happy that this movie was not messed up and it delivered on all counts as far as I am concerned. It did not have a lot of WOW or incredible stuff but it surely met my expectations and with the movies I have been seeing lately, that is a pretty good accomplishment.Some Superhero movies were terrific and were like watching a comic book. Spiderman had to be the best but Batman Begins was also extremely good. On the other end, you have things like Electra, Superman Returns, Ang Lee's Hulk and the other ones that seem to forget they are about a comic book character so we do not need tons of backstory. Say someone is self-centered and maybe one scene with it and it becomes a given. Don't spend valuable screen time showing us over and over or writing lengthy speeches. Film it like a comic book.Here Robert Downey Jr. shows again that he is one of the most talented actors around and I could not imagine anyone else playing Tony Stark better. Tony's selfishness and genius combined with his desire to take nothing seriously but everything for granted just shines through. I understand that much of the dialogue was ad-libbed and if so, they did a really good job of being smart and sassy. One of the toughest things in a superhero movie is the villain because with the first movie, you have to have a villain that is quick and easy to get into action since most of your time is taken with the origin story. Superman movies keep trying to involve Lex Luthor and he is a complex villain that just begs for lots of screen time. Spiderman did great with Green Goblin and Batman Begins was brilliant to use 2 lesser known villains. Here, the Iron Monger is certainly not one of Iron Man's most notable foes but, as in Batman Begins, his motivation and story intertwines so well with the hero that you are not losing any story telling time. He was the perfect villain with the perfect motivation for this movie. A villain like Mandarin would be great but that is for a later movie where there is time to tell more of the villains story and set up more things. Here, we get lots of how Tony Stark becomes Iron Man and changes his outlook and how he developed that marvelous armor.As with most movies I have seen in the theaters lately, there were the annoying people talking to the screen and one another throughout the movie. If there is anything that will kill the cineplex, it not going to be DVDs and home theaters, it will be these inconsiderate fellow patrons who cannot understand that they are not sitting in their living room. Combine that with the skyrocketing cost of tickets and concessions and even I am starting to prefer to watch movies at home. This is one movie though that really benefits from the large screen though because for Iron Man, you need big sound and big pictures. As it should be.Go see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A step-above the normal superhero, in fact, this movie is more spoiled rich man with technology who discovers a conscience. This movie movie delivers a Robocop (1987) except bigger and larger but without the more poignant loss of Robocop's wife and family, delivers the Aliens (1986) scene of hi-tech individual warfare with the alien factor that actually provides a more intimate Civil War (1861-1864) angle, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) without the alien factor again. What Iron Man can't provide is due to its very nature - the everyman, common man perspective, a level that the mass audience can identify with as with the Spiderman franchise as well as the more personal relational boy-girl conflict. While Iron Man is truly intellectual with a conscience, that is what it remains whereas Spiderman focuses on the universal experience of all of us. Additional, unnecessary flashback sequence like with Batman Begins (2005) or even the more contemporary movie such as Made of Honor (2008) allows for the underdevelopment of the familial relationships important to the movie. So while Iron Man is worth its ticket, it allows some of the gloss to overlook the more important flash underneath. Seven out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much to say about this film without spoiling it, so I'll keep my commentary brief. There will be some spoilers, but nothing that will spoil or reduce your movie viewing pleasure.I'll start by saying that this film had so much potential to flop, but thankfully, it didn't!The script writers and director did an overall fantastic job on this film. I really enjoyed the fact that they avoided the typical Hollywood route of brandishing all Middle Eastern people as terrorists. I was shocked to see them show innocent refuges and speak very compassionately about them during the television newscast. That in itself is rare, and when Ironman saved the refuges, nearly everyone in the audience cheered and clapped. Wow.I found it humorous that they mixed Arabic, Farci and Urdu together in the same sentences. Most of the audience was probably clueless about this, but those of us who speak these languages picked up on it. And being able to understand Urdu and Arabic, I knew that something else was up when Stark was being videotaped by the "terrorists" in the beginning of the film. Being able to understand the other languages made it a little more fun to watch. Robert Downey Jr. really redeems himself in this film; his portrayal of Tony Stark/Ironman is top notch and he fits the bill perfectly! The director did an incredible job of filming the entire film, especially the action scenes. All too often in other films, the camera moves too quickly, and we end up missing out on the action taking place. This certainly is not the case in this film. Not only is the action easy to watch, but it's well balanced as well.The CGI is very believable and subtly adds (as opposed to taking away) to the film without being overbearing. In my opinion, some of the coolest scenes were Tony Stark getting into the Ironman suit.The script is entertaining and enjoyable, and the cast and crew (on and off screen) all did an amazing job on this film. The last scene after the end credits lets us know that some kind of sequel will take place. I can only hope it will be something new, yet still as enjoyable as this one.9/10 - go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Iron Man the summer season of blockbuster movies officially began. This is a great movie, smart, funny, with awesome adventure and amazing action. Its pure entertainment since the beginning of the film until the end of this one. Although it has some little changes, the story is strictly based on the original comic book thing that I must appreciate. Jon Favreau delivers an excellent work with a fantastic vision of a comic in real life. The special effects are simply astonishing. The soundtrack is just great. Very good rhythm the situations move very fast a thing that makes the movie enjoyable and never gets boring. It has an all-star cast, everyone with great acting jobs, Robert Downey Jr. seems like he was born to be Tony Stark, this role fits hims to the perfection, a flawless performance from him. Jeff Bridges was excellent in his role of Obadiah Stane, he was the perfect villain. Gwyneth Paltrow was very good and convincing as Mrs. Virginia "Pepper" Potts. In conclusion, the movie was spectacular, it has everything a movie needs to enjoy, entertain and spend a really good time. It really exceed my expectations. Definitely one of the best superhero movies of the year and all-time. A real must see movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Downey Jr. is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For an action hero, I think Downey was the perfect choice. There isn't a woman on earth born between 1970 and 1980 who isn't drawn to his magnetism on screen. I laughed as I read some of the reviews dissing him in this role, for anyone who saw Less than Zero, Chaplin, anything with his name attached knows he can transform before your eyes. That his troubled past contributed to the portrayal of this conflicted super hero is obvious. His face and dark gaze emote more than just some pompous actor putting on a suit. The humor and intelligence behind IronMan was a result of his collaboration with the director. Perfect: Love him, loved the movie - - although I agree it got very "Transformers" near the end. Terence Howard, on the other hand, was a bit wasted in this movie, but I chuckled near the end of the movie when he saw the second suite prototype. Also, he and Gwyneth had fantastic sexual chemistry. I was hard pressed to imagine her in a super hero movie as Pepper Pot, especially as his love interest. But each time they were on screen together you could tell she respected him and adored him as an actor, if not a person Cannot wait for the sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing several commercials and trailers of Iron Man, the movies delivered just as expected. All the actors played a great part, except Gwyneth Paltrow - her performance shocked me. She played such a big part in the movie, but she just couldn't play her character good enough. If she had performed the movie would have been 10/10. Other than that.. Great effects, thrilling action and plenty of funny scenes. I didn't even know what Iron Man was before this movie.. So I can totally recommend this to anyone.One last thing.. The CGI effects really amazed me. I've compared Transformers to this movie, and there is a clear difference between the animation quality. Several scenes in Transformers look animated, however I couldn't spot any CGI 'errors' in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Iron Man Begins" basically in a very enjoyable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to explain who Iron Man is (I hope!), i.e. that guy in the iron suit (surprise surprise) who used to pop up in Spiderman and Marvel cartoons etc when we were all younger. Anyhow away from the comic books, they've now made a film for the character, and takes Robert Downey Junior as Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) to fight the good fight for truth justice and all the rest.Basic story is that its "Iron Man Begins" like as was with "Batman Begins" and takes us through the origins of the character etc. Mix in explosions, mega robot v robot fight and all the rest, and surprisingly a lot of good humour and you have here a surprisingly good film. I never expected to enjoy this much but this is well worth it. Even Gwenyth Paltrow was well-suited, whilst Jeff Bridges was good as always.A big plus word for the visual effects, which were very good and fitted in well into the movie, and didn't overtake the whole film as it could have, getting the balance right.Recommended viewing. Not as great as Batman Begins, but you'll still enjoy it a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man - Billionaire playboy/weapons designer Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) suffers a mortal wound and has a change of heart (literally) after he is abducted by terrorists in Afghanistan. After seeing his own weapons used against him and innocents, Tony Stark creates several armor suits to escape his captors and become...Iron Man.Now this is what I'm talking about! This movie is badass. I would have to see it a few times over, but I think it may have a notch over Spiderman 2. This movie made me feel like a 13 year old, watching the Spiderman movie with glee. Origin stories are boring unless you do them right, but it is terribly fun to watch Tony Stark transform himself technically and mentally into Iron Man. And there are several (very well done) action scenes, but it never feels over the top or too much. They always leave you wanting more, which is a good thing. It's such a great feeling every time he puts on the suit.Robert Downey Jr. has done a commendable job. He is quirky, hilarious and entirely believable without ever stepping into the dangerous camp zone, as Marvel movies are prone to do. He has me believing that a man with more money than God and the coolest suit of armor ever could have problems. Everyone else turns in a good performance, and especially Jeff Bridges. I never got to see him do anything villainous before, but his performance as Obadiah Stane is quite chilling. Even Stan Lee's cameo is actually funny this time (I thought he left Marvel. huh.) Looking forward to Terrence Howard's extended part as War Machine, as he's kinda stinted in this one. It's mostly Robert Downey Jr.'s movie, and he sells it.I've never been much of an Iron Man fan (I do like the Ultimate Universe comics involving him though) and only saw Robert Dwoney Jr. in Zodiac prior to this. I'll have to watch his other film. He's fantastic. See the film whether you're an Iron Man fan or if you're not. If you read comics, if you don't. It's a very GOOD FILM regardless, and easily accessible. I can't wait to see it again. It'll almost make you believe a man can fly. Or that a billionaire would actually put his own life in jeopardy for the rest of mankind.btw, stick around for after the credits when you see it.A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly one of the best comic book adaptations ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a few, I was one of the people that though this movie would totally blow, based on the trailers. So, I went in with very low expectations. I walked out with a smile and exclaimed to my friend "That was pretty good!" It really was. The movie is a bit slow moving but done very well. A very selfish man, Tony Stark (played surprisingly brilliant by Robert Downey Jr.) is hit with reality and turns against what he's worked towards all of his life. But it's a force that won't go down without a fight.The script for the movie is not incredible, but the way the cast delivers it is. Robert Downey Jr. is great; he's very convincing, and even when he changes to a more heroic type, it's not overdone and he hasn't changed as drastically and unrealistically as some might think.Other actors include Terrence Howard, who was good, Tony Stark's friend in Afghanistan (I forgot his name) was good, Jeff Bridges was pretty good (with the exception maybe of his last scene in the film), and Gwyneth Paltrow, who was excellent with the exception of the showdown. She overdid it in that scene, and I was surprised by the sudden cheesiness that overcame her.Like I said, the movie is a bit slow moving, but when it delivers, it delivers. The action sequences were good, though my least favorite was the climatic showdown, which was too clichéd for me. The movie as a whole is clichéd, but its done intelligently, so the clichés don't feel as clichéd.I was happily surprised. I thought this would be another Fantastic Four, but I'd stick it between Spider-Man 2 and Batman Begins, which are my favorite superhero movies. I haven't seen a ton of comic book movies, just mainly the superhero ones, and this is one of the best of those superhero-comics-turned-movies. It's a fun movie the whole family could see and enjoy. But you can honestly enjoy it. 8.0/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Downey Jr. is perfectly cast in a film that is better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is really little to say about the plot of Iron Man that most people do not already know about. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is an obnoxiously wealthy CEO of a US weapons manufacturing company who is taken hostage in the remote mountains of Afghanistan. He manages to create an armoured suit he wears to escape his terrorist captors, and returns to the US a changed man.I was a little apprehensive getting hyped up over Iron Man. I was never a huge fan of the character, and with Jon Favreau at the wheel, it did not exactly sound like it was going to be as great as other comic book films like X2: X-Men United, Batman Begins or the Spider-Man sequels (my personal favourite remains Tim Burton's Batman from '89). But rather impressively, the film is much better than I think anyone could have expected.For one, Stark's characterization is a little more rounded than most. Much like Bruce Wayne, he is not really a superhero by the standard definition, but more someone who becomes one. He has the skeletons in the closet, he is a womanizing prick, and he's a border-line (if not full blown) alcoholic. He is not shown as in-depth as Batman was in Batman Begins, but the work put into his evolvement is much better than a typical comic book film.It also helps that Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as Stark. I do not think anyone could have pulled him off anywhere near as well. He has just the right amount of cynicism, sarcasm and wit to make the character truly memorable. Any fan of the character, or anyone just looking for an actor putting in the work needed for his character to be believable should look no further. Downey Jr.'s own sketchy past only helps make his portrayal even more credible of someone living the high life, and then re-evaluating themselves and changing to be a better person. It almost speaks as a bit of a metaphor for his own journey, and makes his work here that much more personal. His wounded eyes speak volumes for him and the character.Unfortunately, as far as origin stories usually go, there is not a lot of room for the supporting characters to shine. I liked Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's assistant Pepper Potts, but Terrence Howard's Jim Rhodes is very much underused. We know of his importance to the story, but he never truly overcomes the flaw of just being a smarter and more successful tokin' black guy we all know from the years of stereotypes. He sets himself up for future installments, but I think his dialogue could have been fleshed out to be a little more useful than it is here. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane is another underused character, but Bridges manages to chew up a lot of scenery when he is on-screen. I think this may be his most involved and most fun performance since The Big Lebowski.The story itself is another great thing about the film, because it is nowhere near as far-fetched as most origin stories. While the creation of some of the more scientific elements may seem preposterous, its real world basis makes it miraculously relevant to the current war time events going on as we speak. This is a character who could only work after 9/11, and coming out now is probably the best move any studio could have ever made. Stark's story is one for this generation, and I think by not glossing anything over, the filmmakers have done justice to a character who cannot be any timelier. I also like that it focused a lot of attention on the meticulous work he does creating the suit, and showing his little failures along the way. The humour injected into a lot of scenes is also very well done.If anything at all, it could have used a bit of editing here and there however, shaving some time off in Afghanistan and the suit creations (as much as I liked them). Some of the dialogue is a little off as well (especially with Howard's character), and could have been tightened to better effect. I realize that these portrayals are based off comic book characters, but that does mean their dialogue automatically needs to be cheesy, or so silly that it needs to be funny.The special effects are another marvel, making the preposterous science elements seem even more real. Just watching the scene where Stark is trying out his suit's flying capabilities before creating the rest of the suit may be enough to make the film's imaginative structure look authentic. Yes, it does have a few moments where it looks fake and could have used more work, but for the most part, this may be the most fully rendered and realistic looking comic book character to date (in the realm of relying heavily on CGI of course).And as for Favreau, I was very impressed with the way the film handles itself. He truly kept it on the rails, and did not let its ambitiousness become too much for him. Yes, there are flaws, and yes, the film is imperfect. But for someone whose name I doubt could have ever been synonymous with creating action-orientated films before (not counting the family fantasy Zathura), Favreau has truly outdone himself. He has brought a complex character to the big screen, and has created one of the strongest comic book films to date. As I said earlier, I had my apprehensions, but his work here can only lead to bigger and better things.From its startling opening all the way up to its action infused finale, Iron Man is great film in every respect and one hell of a start for the summer movie season. It has its flaws, but the finesse of the story and the lead character make it truly memorable.8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Super Hero movie in 2 decades..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one of those that is impressed by "Spiderman" or recent incarnations of "Batman" (I think they all have poor story's and boring remake style) including a fan favorite "Batman Forever" but for the 1st time I found myself liking a super hero movie when they all make me yawn.. the last one that wasn't so terrible was actually the newest Superman but this movie actually beats it out..So what do I claim the last best super hero movie was.. Tim Burtons "Batman" starter of whole franchises...What I liked about this movie was that it had plot, it had acting and it wasn't over the top or too long (spiderman is a great example of this) and maybe it's possible that it stems also from the fact that I haven't seen any cartoon series of the show.. (though I'd never seen Fantastic Four cartoons and those movies were generally terrible) I like that in this movie Robert Downey Jr. has a ironic or albeit poke fun at self sense of humor.. and the fact that in some ways his character really does embody his Hollywood persona One thing I noted is that this movie wasn't rife with Hollywood cliché's I expected to here it time and time again.. Jeff Bridges (the bad guy) killed his father.. never said it once (as far as I know) and in the end the comment about his father was more of a compliment to Roberts's character.. and what about the fact that Robert didn't exactly get the girl this isn't exactly a Hollywood typical fair..So what can I say about this movie.. Best Super Hero movie in 2 decades!! Original, interesting, good plot, good acting.. worth watching.. it won't shake you with awesomeness but it won't leave you bored either.. thank Allah, (cliché') that Hollywood can still turn out something original.</fullReview>

If for no other reason than you get to see Robert Downing Jr. go see it! To the fellows out there... My husband did read the comics growing up and he really enjoyed the movie. Seriously, the movie was so great that the whole theater of late night movie watchers cheered and laughed out loud though out the film. One fan even jokingly cried out for the theater operators to rewind a particularly stunning scene. Two thumbs way up on the creativity as well as the conservative nature of the film.

		<shortDescription>Everything that makes superhero flicks awesome is back and this time it's iron clad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's time to suit up, because the comic film genre has a new face bringing it back to life and it's a shiny one. "Iron Man" delivers everything you want in a comic book-based film and is probably the best thing to happen to Marvel Studios since Spider-Man 2--that's nearly 4 years of a lot of money with disappointing delivery. A good start for the first film fully produced by the studio with no additional funding.Iron Man is not the most well-loved of Marvel characters, but at this point in the Marvel film universe, he feels like next logical step to give the comic company a boost in the right direction. The man is Tony Stark (Downey Jr.), a millionaire playboy in the arms dealing business. On a routine demonstration trip in Afghanistan (updated to the modern era), Stark is captured and held hostage by a rebel band of Afghanis who demand he build them one of his best missiles. Instead, Stark devises a plan to build a suit of armor so he can escape.A victim of the very weapons he created, Stark's uniqueness in comparison to other Marvel heroes Stan Lee has created is that he learns the error of his ways, his ignorance to the evil his industry produces, and the experience changes his perspective. It's not a vengeance story, it's one of personal redemption. Downey Jr. carries this film. Not entirely, but the film focuses more on his discovery and creation of Iron Man than it does on him being on Iron Man and fighting evil, a wonderful choice by the writers. Downey Jr.'s standard witty comedic acting fits this perfectly as finally there is a superhero with a sense of humor. "Iron Man" could be the funniest of all superhero films, or at least it certainly beats the awkward attempts of "Spider-Man 3." Marvel was way overdue for introducing a new character after the 3rd installments of the "X- Men" and "Spider-Man" franchises. An origin story, the reason why those other franchises took off, was in order. Those films were fantastic in many ways, but failed because they tried to do too much and "Iron Man" doesn't. The plot is straightforward. Now there have been other Marvel origin films "Hulk" and "Daredevil" for example, that fail as well. "Iron Man" is better than those films because it is so focused on Stark's character. This is interesting and fascinating because of the visual effects and the sheer creativity of those behind the concept of what his suit could actually do. A lot of scenes are test scenes and while not much is going on, they're really cool and captivating. There's no law that superheroes have to spend most of their time as the hero and fighting. "Iron Man" doesn't do that--it reserves that for the climax of the film and doesn't dwell there any longer than it must. You want more, but what you do get isn't bad.The supporting cast really helps too. Bridges in his first truly evil role as Stark's adviser turned-bad, Obadiah Stane, is great, Paltrow provides a nice change of pace as Stark's personal assistant Pepper Potts and even Terrence Howard is likable as Stark's friend and military ally, Jim Rhodes.The only thing to complain about "Iron Man" is that there wasn't enough. So much time, though rightly so, was spent on Stark's development of "Iron Man" that there wasn't enough room for more awesome action sequences in the suit and most disappointing of all, further thematic development, which is what made Spider-Man revolutionary. It's all there, but it doesn't get as much attention as it should. A second viewing might bring those themes home more.Jon Favreau should get incredible applause for outdoing the skepticism he unjustly received when it was first revealed he would be at the helm. There are plenty of treats for the comic book fans in this film and there's just a lot of great realism to this film than previous films too focused on great one-liners and the like, which is what someone like Favreau of the "dude romantic comedy" persuasion can bring to a genre in so much need of that normal/ human touch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have never read Iron Man comics, so don't have anything to compare it to, but really enjoyed the movie. Good special effects, good story line, subtle comedy throughout, but not too much. Enjoyed the actors and it held some surprises. Wanted to hear more of Iron Man song. Robert Downey, Jr. kind of reminded me of the old Bill Bixby (original Incredible Hulk, and Courtship of Eddie's Father) as he got older and wore the same style ugly sunglasses. As the movie progressed, his style seemed to enter the 21st century. I didn't know anything about the movie other than Robert Downy, Jr was in it, so was pleasantly surprised to find out Gwyneth Paltrow was playing his secretary, Pepper Potts. I always enjoy seeing her in movies and this time was no exception. Kind of reminded me of the Superman/Lois Lane crush. Jeff Bridges was another surprise. I was trying to figure out who he was through the whole movie. I recognized his voice, but couldn't put it together with the face and lack of hair on his head. The fight scene between Iron Man and the enemy iron man at the end could have been longer and a little more intense, but still left you with the feeling good conquered evil. Very short easter egg after about a billion credits, but worth waiting for ... almost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron-solid Movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is one of Marvel's good FIRST movies. Marvel's first movies are usually bad, like Daredevil or Ghost Rider, etc (except X-men 1, that's one of their best movies) and only their seconds are good like Spider-Man 2, X-Men 2, etc. But not Iron Man, though. Iron Man went straight out, with only minor differences from the original storyline. The people who kidnapped Tony Stark, for example. The filmmaker trade Vietnam for Afghanistan, probably a reference to today's war issues.The GOOD:The acting is believable. The actors can create tension and comedy when needed. And Robert Downey Jr. is a perfect choice to play the used-to-be rich, obnoxious, playboy and selfish type of person who turns into a selfless, well-mannered, patriotic and protective person after escaping from his kidnappers. And Gwyneth Paltrow is better than some might think. The only bad actor is that guy from S.H.I.E.L.D. who kept repeating the long names (but he's not too bad)?The graphic is stunning and the details are just -- WOW! The Armors (yes, there are more than one, not including Iron Monger, the bad guy of the movie) look real. Everyone knows that the Armor is CGI'd when in action, but it looks so believable that one might think that the suit is really there shooting and flying around. The details are amazing. And it's terrific how the filmmaker actually paid attention to these parts. For example, Iron Man's face plate was severely scratched when he fell into the war zone and the mechanism on his back opens and closes up whenever he turns while flying. The graphic itself is worth the money. One could look at it and not care what the movie is about (okay, maybe not). But still, it was no better than Transformers graphic.The BAD:My only complain is the fact that it does not have a long fight scene. Yes, the armors are in action. You see it flying around the sky, firing missiles and repulsor beam (which also weren't enough). But there were so few punches. But Iron Man gets thrown around a lot. There are fight scenes (two, in fact), but they were pretty fast. It makes one want to rewind and see it again. The only good part of the fight scene is when Iron Man loses his face plate (his mask), and his left arm armor with only a spurt of energy left. He uses the so little energy to shoot the ground with his repulsor beam and send himself flying and landing while delivering a punch to Iron Monger.The fight scenes are great but they are the "blink-and-you-miss-it" type of scene.This movie gets a 8/10 from me JUST because of the lack of fighting sequence.OVERALL:It was a great movie. A thrill ride. Funny. Worth watching. The action, although so few, were still great. Oh yeah, the ending is a bit surprising. Tony Stark don't quite follow Spider-Man's or Batman's idea of keeping a secret identity. And stay after the credit for more surprises! Well, actually, there's only one. But worth watching if you're a total comics fan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well well well, the summer blockbuster season of 2008 is officially upon us! Things get started off rather well this year, and if this movie is any indication of whats to come later on, it could be quite enjoyable box office wise. Iron Man starring Robert Downey Jr. in the title role has just enough action, humor, and a little drama to keep you entertained and keep your butt planted firmly in the theater seat. Things start moving from the very beginning, and they don't slow down a whole lot, although there are some breaks for character development and humor intermittently throughout the film. We follow Tony Stark in his journey from carefree playboy billionaire to iron clad justice dispenser and the ups and downs along the way. Downey Jr. and the rest of the cast interact well and give the whole movie a measure of credibility. This is no Daredevil, Electra, or Ghost Rider, this movie delivers! There are several supporting good guys and bad guys but the conflict between the main two is very well done. Downey Jr. and a somewhat unrecognizable Jeff Bridges play well off each other, with Bridges being the serious sinister business man and Downey playing a sort of lighthearted funny genius. The special effects are great, the soundtrack is awesome and the cast superb! I wish I could say everything that I wanted to about this movie but I don't want to give to much away, SIT THROUGH THE WHOLE THING and I don't think you will leave the theater disappointed. Also, due to the somewhat political undertones in the scrip the movie might go over slightly better with adults rather than teenagers and younger but I still think everyone can enjoy. This was altogether a very well done and entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the past 10 years a slew of comic book movies have been made, or re-made, or made into live-action. Among these are titles like X-Men, Spiderman, Batman, Punisher, the Hulk and so on. Some (only some!) of these movies have honestly been a let down, whether it be because the story was lacking, the acting sucked, the characters were not explained or developed and so on. However, Iron Man was a great movie in my opinion. I am not extremely well-versed in the Iron Man comics, however, i know the basics, and i felt that this story was well told. i didn't feel the plot line being rushed, or a fake "guy/girl" relationship being forced on the audience. the point from beginning to end was clearly the creation, development and story of the Iron Man. it is a hilarious movie, it has action, some suspense, and is a definitely a flick to catch on the big screen!</fullReview>

There was no sophisticated storytelling, no extraordinary action, even no acting that was more than schematic. It's so black and white. No one seemed to invest more than an evening in the plot to make it half-way intelligent. Jeff Bridges - hum, he should have stayed at the grand piano, Gwyneth Paltrow - she acts like ever, namely she doesn't act at all, only Robert Downey jr. gives at least a face and he sometimes acts like Tony Stark might feel.

		<shortDescription>Acting, writing and armour makes Iron Man fly at the top of the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first actual movie made by Marvel comics's own studio instead of having their characters "leased" to another movie studio. They hit this one out of the park. The script is smart but what made Iron Man such a critical and financial success beyond the special effects is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. I just cannot imagine someone who could be more suave, funny and perfect as a genius playboy millionaire tech geek (yes, he beats whatsisname as Bruce Wayne handily). It's like having an Oscar-calibre actor in a popcorn superhero movie. We actually have three with Gwynneth Paltrow and the underrated Jeff Bridges. Tony Stark seems excited about creating and trying his Iron Man armour and it transmits to the audience. I remember thinking when I first saw Iron Man that despite Stark's genius, he could also be a jerk and irresponsible hothead but it's to Robert Downey's Jr and the writer's credits that you like Stark anyway.There's a genuine sense of fun permeating the whole film yet it's not without its serious dramatic moments. Everything would crumble if the superhero armour wasn't up to snuff but the different versions look amazing and believable, with lots of little incidental animation making it more dynamic. Sometimes you might think it's computer generated (and honestly it probably is most of the time) but it's easy to suspend your disbelief especially with the constant but cool close-up shots of Tony Stark inside the helmet with those constantly updating computer readings. That clever trick permits us to see the emotions that are not outwardly visible from the outside. Iron Man doesn't reinvent the superhero movie genre like Watchmen does but it does everything right while adding a few bits of originality such as the initially egotistical selfish almost villainous protagonist who changes as well as the guy becoming super-powered not through accident or mutation but by designing the coolest armours ever seen on screen. Let's not forget that clever never seen before ending who put a big smile on my face and probably most people who watched it in theatres the first time.Rating: 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Age Superhero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is a superhero film for the new age. It is a visual ecstasy of a motion picture and may be death of fantasy-based superheroes. It isn't even a superhero movie at all really. It's more a science fiction picture which happened to originate from a comic book. I included it on my best films list of 2008 (which I will release someday), and I prefer it to The Dark Knight. Tony Stark is a more "realistic hero" than Bruce Wayne could ever hope to be. His character, while part of the corporate world, actually appears affected by it. In the Batman films, Wayne Corp. is a mere backdrop for the action sequences. Great villains are used to cover up the problem, but it persisted until Batman Begins. No filmmaker has yet to effectively include real world concerns in Bruce's character like Jon Favreau does for Tony Stark. Stark is a weapons-designing genius who sells his products to the US military. He travels to Afghanistan for a demonstration, and his entourage is attacked on the return. The assailants use his own weapons to subdue his escorting caravan. Tony's heart is pierced by shrapnel which could sink into his arteries any minute if he didn't have a weird battery thing protecting him. What does the shrapnel do while it floats in his chest? His captors say they will release him if he can design the weapon he demonstrated earlier. So he says yes, builds Robocop armor, and gets the heck out of there. Back home he is greeted by his super attractive maid Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and decides to remake the company's image. No more weapons. Shareholders, represented by Stark's mentor Obadiah Stane are upset, and the company's value falls by nearly half. Stark doesn't care about any of this and recreates his armor professionally. There are many sequences of Stark talking to his robotic assistants and chiding them for their perceived ineptitude. It keeps the movie true to its comic book conventions. Iron Man is a playfully serious movie that feels like a comic book. Comics are sure of themselves as legitimate literature but consistently tease it with silly language and crazy bad guy names. Iron Man chooses some of these elements to preserve but Favreau applies his hand to give a modern edge to it. Stane learns of Tony's new project and contacts his private clients in Afghanistan about it. They are the same crooks from before and they want "an army of iron soldiers". Stane says no but begins designing his own prototype only to lose a confrontation with the real Iron Man. Stark finally reveals his status as the mysterious hero who is misnamed. Imagine the film's basic plot for a moment. The head of a powerful weapons development corporation manipulates his figurehead "boss" to sell product to terrorist in the Middle East. Stark learns about this firsthand and decides to do something about it. It's an idealized version of our invasion of Iraq. Favreau made a great decision to cast Robert Downey Jr. as the titular character. Downey brings a subtle assurance to Stark. Downey delivers his lines so assuredly, as if he knew the effect he would have. If this movie was too self-indulgent, then his approach wouldn't work. Tony Stark would be too inhuman, like Mr. Fantastic. Mr. Fantastic of the Fantastic Four movies is victim of his own film's ludicrousness. There is no way to interpret his character as anything other than a comic book convention. Like Favreau's earlier movie Zathura, Iron Man has impressive visual effects. The CGI is smooth enough to appear realistic. Even the ice which forms on Iron Man's helmet during a flight test is incredibly detailed. His mask is quickly covered in a layer of frost which melts as he falls. This idea is even incorporated in Stane's defeat. This movie is indicative of an arising trend in superhero cinema. It's the not-so-super superhero. New heroes are just regular people who save humanity via artificial means. None of that "faster than a speeding bullet" gibberish is acceptable anymore, unless one is referring to Iron Man's top potential. I imagine that new fantasy superhero movies (a la The Flash) will have a built-in prejudice against them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I wouldn't say it comes along the lines of the best superheroes movie like the "The Dark Knight", but, it's worth watching. It's quite entertaining and very good. I would say it's in the league of "Spider-man" movies.Very good CGI effects and 3D graphics. A simple plot. I guess it's because it's just an intro movie to Iron Man. I hope they have a strong plot for the second one. Robert Dowrney gives an amazing performance. My favorite part of the movie is the ending...Just watch it guys. It's full of clichés. But it's fun-filled action movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing that makes Iron Man great is that nobody expected to be great. I mean people were skeptical because Robert Downey Jr. hadn't been a lead role for a decade so it was questioned if he would fare well or not. After seeing this movie , we all can agree that Robert Downey Jr not only was perfect for the role of Tony Starks, he also gave the man personality.Brief spoilers: Tony Starks gets into a near fatal accident in a Middle Eastern country and is forced to build a weapon for some militia group there. He builds his first Iron Man suit(which looks like the Iron Giant) and escapes from the terrorist group's clutches. He is found lying in the desert and returns home to say that he is through making weapons comes as a shock to everybody. Meanwhile there is something fishy going on with his longtime partner Obadiah Stane(Jeff Bridges).Opinion: Robert Downey Jr is great as Tony Starks. Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect as his assistant Pepper Potts and even though I had Michael Jai White in mind as Rhodes, Terrence Howard does just fine as the Colonel. Jeff Bridges is in top form as Obadiah Stane. I like how they took time to show how Tony Starks tested his armor out before he decided to finally use it. I also like the fact that the movie sticks to the comic book without being cartoonish and silly. Iron Man was the first superhero movie to come out in 2008 and it unexpectedly set the bar high for superhero movies in 2008. Two thumbs all the way up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man. You hear the title, watch the trailer, and you might think to yourself, "Oh no, not another ridiculous, overrated comic book movie." After seeing Iron Man you will walk out of the theater thinking, "Man, that was good!" Iron Man begins with a couple of armored cars driving through the Afghanistan desert. In one of cars there's a few soldiers and the rich and famous Tony Stark, CEO of Stark Industries which is a company that builds weapons. One moment Tony is flirting with a female soldier, the next guns are firing and everything is blowing up, and then you see Tony held hostage by Afghan soldiers.The next bit is a tad confusing. Tony is all of a sudden back in the U.S.A. You definitely know he's rich(he owns a huge house in Malibu) and you know he must be good with the ladies(one night stand with a Vanity Fair reporter). He also has his own personal assistant, Pepper Potts. It is in that moment when you first hear that name that you know you are watching a comic book movie. Names like that are only used in comic books.You might be wondering what's going on. Is this a flashback? Did he already escape from the Afghan soldiers? As only the rich and famous can do, Tony arrives three hours late for a trip in his private jet. He arrives in Afghanistan, and it's then you realize that Tony hadn't escaped yet. He hadn't even been held hostage yet. This whole sequence has been showing you what Tony's life is like and how he came to be in Afghanistan. From there, you know what happens. Armored cars. Fire. Hostage.His captors want Tony to build them a missile, the Jericho missile to be exact. If he doesn't...well, let's just say it's bye-bye Tony Stark. Tony was injured. The only thing keeping him alive is this round metal device implanted in his chest which magnetically keeps bits of shrapnel from reaching his heart. The man who implanted that device, Yinsen, is Tony's assistant for building the Jericho missile. But Tony isn't building a missile at all. He's creating a metal suit powered by a miniature arc reactor that he will put inside himself to keep him alive. The suit will make him so powerful that he will knock all his captors away and escape before they can let five bullets out of their machine guns.Of course, Tony escapes and gets back to the U.S.A. Tony decides he doesn't want to make weapons anymore. He wants to reverse the bad his weapons have done. The rest is up for you to see.Robert Downey Jr. does a great job playing Tony Stark. He transforms himself into the character. He is no longer Robert Downey Jr. He is Tony Stark. And the action bits...they're just great. No comic book movie is complete without some amazing action sequences, and the action scenes in Iron Man make the movie.Overall, there may be some cheesy bits of dialogue and some things you might not like, but you forgive Iron Man of its faults because it's just that great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Century 21</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What did I love about Ironman? Was it Robert Downey, Jr.? Not really... he was good, not great. Was it all the CGI hardware and effect shots? They were fun, but that's not it. I think what I loved was the fact that the movie grabs you from frame one and pulls you instantly, effortlessly, into an aggressive, fat-free narrative with drive... the story moves at light speed, and by the time you realized you haven't touched your popcorn you're in the solid center of a great comic book/superhero movie. The film is also a blueprint for the way all modern movies should be made. Welcome to century 21...See, most superhero movies start with a first act that tastes like medicine. They're dour, solemn setups about nuclear accidents, childhood traumas and secret identities... it's redundant. We are now the sons and daughters of the MTV generation, in an omni-media world, and we know movies like the French know wine. Just put on the damn cape and start fighting crime! This is where Ironman makes even newer hits like "Spiderman" and "Batman Begins" look like creaky old dinosaurs; the first act is a self-contained mini-movie, as Tony Stark builds the suit not out of an idle need to do good, but to save his own life by escaping from his captors.By the time Tony Stark is back home the movie has brilliantly weaved in all the exposition and back-story we need to enjoy the fun. Directors Steven Spielberg &amp; George Lucas spoke about collaborating on "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and they maintained it was impossible to make an action movie without a "pointer scene," a flat, boring, talky sequence which serves only to fill in the back-story and set up the rest of the film. They named this after the scene in "Raiders" in which a government official literally puts a pointer to a chalkboard as he lectures Indy about the history of the Ark. Maybe it's a change of the guard, but there is no pointer scene in Ironman. You pick up as you go, and the payoff is a film that rewards you for being smart and paying attention.Director Jon Favreau has to take the credit for the film's greatness. He makes this movie for the audience as he would make a film for himself or his friends; no dumbing-down, no compromised corn or clichéd studio stupidity. He is so committed to this story, so sure that this fantasy is real that he dares you to question it in scenes like the one in which Tony basically asks his secretary to perform open-heart surgery on him. You'll buy it. We're so deep into the brilliant fever dream that it all seems joyfully plausible. Bravo...Ironman should stand as a lesson to ALL filmmakers: stop underestimating your audience. It is the twenty-first century and we've seen everything. Twice. Stop trying to paint by the numbers and just paint. Ironman is a great leap in cinematic storytelling... I hope it's just a beginning.GRADE: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent; overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew this movie had gotten very good reviews, so I was excited to see it. I grew up reading comic books in the '70s and '80s, but I've been mostly disappointed with movie versions. They seem to target the same demographic, 10-16 year old boys. If I was still that age, I think I would have enjoyed Iron Man. Now, as a cynical, doddering 40-year old, they just strike me as the new vehicle for Rambo-style loud dumbness. There are exceptions; the previous Batman was quite good (haven't seen the new one). But Iron Man strikes a lot of the same notes. Believability is tossed out the window almost immediately when a man, even a "genius" like obnoxious playboy Tony Stark, could build anything in a cave in Afghanistan, much less an advanced missile system or completely unheard-of military suit of armor. Given that the events are supposed to take place now-ish, it's also silly that Tony basically has solved the AI problem, with his computer assistant (Kitt?). These are just a few of the bigger things that made me shake my head. They should've canned some of the more outrageous things and established in a prelude some believable steps to the suit technology in an R&amp;D lab.Yes, Downey had a pretty good performance, though the character really grated. I understand it's not your typical hero, but I really have a hard time cheering for a cocky, rich jerk. In real life, I'd shake my head and walk away from such a person, if not slug them. I don't care for Paltrow much, though her character was okay. The rest were pretty dull caricatures.Bottom line: If you can check enough of your brain at the door or still enjoy reading comic books, you'll probably like this film. I think I've grown up too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Done, If Not a Little Overrated...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I didn't have high expectations for Iron Man, but for what I did have, all of them were surprisingly met. As a whole, it is a well done film, if not a little overrated. The acting is sometimes hammy, the special effects aren't all that impressive, and the pacing isn't exactly going to bode well with younger audience members.The acting is moderately good. Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges steal the show with their roles, while Robert Downey, Jr. seemed less than impressive -- and, at times, bored as Tony Stark. Terrance Howard, once again, is dull both in performance and as in character.As far as visual effects go, Iron Man himself is pretty realistic, but as for the explosions and final battle it's not very detailed, nor impressive.Favreau's direction is pretty good, if not a little mediocre. I thought his inclusion as director seemed too big for him, as his only "great" film I can recall is Elf. A few of the flaws can be put on the screenwriter, primarily. The pacing of the film is pretty bad, even for an origin-story, it takes a long time for Stark to gain a conscience and become Iron Man. The villain is predictable, and the showdown at the ending is neither heroic, or enthralling.The music by Ramon Djawadi isn't very good, however, there's moments of real soar and sweep that make it worthy of a buy -- an example would be when Stark is making the prototype iron mask while prisoner.Overall, Iron Man isn't as good as the first two Spider-Man movies, and no where near classic status of the new Batman films, yet it is vastly superior to the majority of other superhero films, and I recommend it to families who have children that can comprehend why it takes so long for Tony Stark to become Iron Man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billionaire arms manufacturer Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is kidnapped by terrorists during a visit to Afghanistan. Stark is held captive and is told by the terrorists to build them a missile. As he begins work, Stark sees first hand his legacy of death and destruction. What's funny is that just the day before Stark was rebuking claims of being a war profiteer by saying, "As soon as weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals." Let me come right out and say it. Iron Man may not be Marvel's most popular superhero, but he's officially my favorite. This film had the usual summer comedy and action but strangely enough, Robert Downey Jr. was able to bring a lot of soul to the role of Tony Stark. He's the hero with a heart, and considerably more dialogue than Peter Parker ever had in any of the Spider-Man movies. You see, back home Tony Stark was just another genius billionaire playboy (Bruce Wayne anyone?). His world consisted of his assistant Virginia "Pepper" Pots (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Colonel James "Rhody" Rhodes (Terrence Howard). After his return to the United States, he immediately shuts down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark Industries. I know you're thinking this is problematic. "Didn't you say he was a weapons manufacturer?" Yes, and that's what makes it problematic for Stark's board of directors headed by Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). Stane ends up having his own agenda with Stark, but I'll save the rest of that for those of you who haven't seen the film yet (and if you haven't, stop reading and go watch it now!).The entire cast turns in terrific performances, and not just by comic book standards. Tony Stark is the wisecracking, womanizing, filthy rich and absolutely brilliant weapons manufacturer who chooses to undo his legacy and destroy his weapons. Any movie that comes out in the summer is usually bound to be one of those mindless action movies with no plot; just a series of excuses for more action. Lately, the summer action film has been somewhat reinvented. They've been getting smarter, wittier, and they even try to capture a more human side of story telling. This is part of why Iron Man wins our hearts. The other part being that the film addresses so many issues of our time while maintaining the summer movie spirit. Stark spent his life following a few basic rules. In his own words, he became comfortable with a system that had zero accountability. His decision to shut down his company and use his vast ingenuity to help people is what makes him a noble hero. It's not Superman, who was born to do the job. It's not like Spider-Man, who had the responsibility thrown on him. Iron Man is a lot like Batman since they both chose to do the job. Both are filthy rich and both use everything at their disposal to save the world, one city at a time. The only downside to the development of the characters is the fact that Rhody was somewhat underplayed. I'm guessing this was so the movie could focus more on Stark. In the comics, Rhody dons the Iron man armor and eventually builds his own suit of armor to become War Machine. The little hint in the movie with Rhodes and the Mark II armor was something of a well placed teaser.The only thing that kept me from giving this movie a perfect four stars was the action. Don't get me wrong, the action was great. I just wish there had been more of it. At just two hours long, I never once felt like Favreau was trying to rush through the movie. It never felt like he cuts scenes and took short cuts with the script to get to the ending. I did feel "jipped" with the action though. I wish there had been just one more big action scene, and that all the other scenes had been extended. In the end the lack of action is somewhat inevitable. With the film debut of any comic book hero, the makers always have to spend a considerable amount of time introducing the character and their microcosm to audiences that might not be familiar with the source material.Early on I read that director John Favreau wanted to make this film somewhat politically ambitious. For the average American it probably was just that. Trying to paint a somewhat respectable image of Muslims, especially in Afghanistan has to be a difficult job. But for someone like me, being the child of a couple of Bengali Muslim immigrants to America, I think the end result was more like being politically ambiguous. While held captive in Afghanistan, Stark's cell mate Yensen (Shaun Toub; a Jewish actor from Iran) tells Stark of all the different languages that the terrorists speak. He goes down a list including Urdu, Arabic, Farsi, Dari, Pashto, Russian, and Hungarian. My interpretation of this was that the terrorists come from all countries and not just Arab speaking ones. How you interpret the implications of such a claim is up to you. But in a later scene, Favreau aptly shows that the majority of the victims of terrorism and radicalism are in fact, Muslims.I think Iron Man has a highly successful and highly lucrative future ahead of him. This is the first official movie of the summer 2008 and I can't wait for the sequel!</fullReview>

It was Bad. Even Robert Downey Jr. was not Great and i don't know what the hype is about! Besides that the story and plot were super-ridiculous at most times!! The manner in which Iron Man wiped out Iron Monger was so dumb! This is nowhere even Close To being a Good Superhero movie, leave alone being one of the best! Batman Begins and Spiderman are in a different league entirely!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Marvel Screen Adaptation To Date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ironman was always one of my favourite Marvel characters. Alongside Spidey and Wolverine, Tony Stark and his snazzy titanium Deathsuit ranked highly in my list of superheroes. Thats why I was initially aprehensive of Marvels latest big screen venture. I was excited to see what Ironman would look like in full CGI and whether Marvel would hit the nail on the head with storyline. At the same time however, I was terrified that they were going to slay a classic character like their previous Hulk incarnation had.After a bit of further research, I decided the Cast looked solid enough and the trailers looked impressive and so my mind was eased slightly. I waited anxiously for the day I would be able to feast my eyes on the shiny new comic book caper and kept my fingers crossed that Marvel wouldn't balls it up.I can safely say they did a stunning job of bringing Ironman to the big screen.Robert Downey Jr. played the role of slick playboy Tony Stark flawlessly. From start to finish his perfect portrayal of the woman eating studmuffin kept me captivated and his sleazy one liners kept me chuckling like a besotted school Girl. His On-screen connection with the lovely Miss Paltrow was electrifying, and made for a believable and quirky relationship. The supporting cast were all superb, and Colonel James "War Machine" Rhodes, was also cast brilliantly.The storyline was as close to the comics as it could have been, and kept me on my toes throughout. It was well constructed, well planned and had an excellent screenplay to boot.The Visuals were none less then breathtaking and the action scenes were high octane and adrenaline injected. A beautifully made concoction that Marvel should utilise more often.This is by far the best recent Comic Book to Movie adaptation since Batman Begins, Lets just hope Marvel keep this winning formula for any further big screen escapades they splash out on.Ironman is one of the few films I cannot pick a fault with. This was 126 minutes of sheer entertainment and I recommend all filmgoers to go and check it out as soon as you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meets the hype - unusual accomplishment for a summer blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spiderman was good. Batman was good until the 'Prince parade' scene. And now Iron Man.I almost went in not wanting to like the film. Robert Downey is not exactly a popular Hollywood star. JF is not a great director (he casts himself as a supporting player in early scenes). And the promos featured Sabbath's song, which I though would be inappropriate at anything but the closing credits. Sure enough, that's where it was, all the way at the LONNNNNGGG closing credits - what were there? 100, 200, 300 stuntmen, stunt drivers, stunt extra, stunt directors, I don't know? I've never seen credits that long. And the teaser was that if you sat through the longest run of movies credits ever, you'd see a 2min clip suggesting a sequel.In short, the clip is that our hero comes into his high ceiling 'living'/oceanview room, and there's a black guy with an eye patch who identifies himself as, Nick Fury. He says he has something to do with National/Homeland security, and that Stark is not the 'only hero'. So the sequel is about government agents in Ironman suits? Still, if JF can produce even 3/4 the film he did here in the sequel, that too will be some accomplishment.The plot of Ironman is that Stark is a technological genius/phenom. He can engineer and build a Learjet from two scraps of paper and a bottle of Sprite. McGiver has nothing on him. His dad was a munitions maker who went into the government-contract game with the heavy, played by Jeff Bridges (I just couldn't help flashing back to Big Z from the surfing penguin movie - his voice was so memorable).Dad dies, off camera, and the young Stark is in it with Bridges, both self-righteously touting their defense of freedom by superior weaponry - which is fine as far as it goes. But our hero is naive, and doesn't realize that the enemy can grab up weapons on the field of battle, too. Sure enough, on a sales tour to Iraq, his motorcade is hit and he is captured. And sure enough, the bad guys have a bunch of equipment from his company. He even asks, where did you get "my" guns.Perhaps it's best to think of Jr. Stark as an idiot savant. He builds an ironman suits from discarded rocket parts, basically. His captors know who he is and want him to construct the weapons he had just sold on his sales tour. But it gets to the point where his suit doesn't look anything like the rockets he's supposed to be building.In fact, the core technology is some sort of reactor. He builds a small version, with parts on hand. And somehow it gives his suit 'super-powers'. He can sustain flight with chemical boosters far longer than there is chemical in the boosters (that he can fly, period, with no control surfaces is bizarre). He is equipped with flame throwers that make the jets from the old island hopping WWII tanks look like toys. And so on. But it's only a prototype. He makes his escape. But he lands a short distance away. He wanders the desert. He gets rescued. But the bad guys find the remnants of the suit.Cut to chase, he returns home a changed man. He wants a bigger and better suit. Turns out partner, Bridges, is really a psycho, who is invited by the bad guys to Iraq to view the suit. His bad guys kill all those bad guys. And he works on his own suit, sort of the bigger, badder 'robocop', that we've seen before.Stark's girl Friday, Miss Potts, discovers the secret of area 16 and the super-suit. She gets government agents to close in. But Bridges dons the suit, kills some of them, and goes after her. Sure enough, Stark/Ironman flies in to save the day, and is almost killed himself.One place where perhaps the film goes off-note is when Bridges team so effortlessly kills the bad Arabs who had been threatening locals with Stark's weapons. It's a little too easy. Should have been a fight. And the other is the big plot hole as to why Stark needs a hole in his chest. At first, it was to prevent shrapnel from sinking into vital tissues. But he could have had that fixed upon his returns. He continues to wear the reactor in his chest, which is how he 'powers' his suits. And it's not explained why the reactor is there, or could itself be damaging soft tissues with radiation. Bridges 'super-robo' suit uses the same reactor. And he doesn't have to wear it in his chest.But apart from that, it's interesting to see the tie in to the terrorist problem in Iraq and frontier regions there. It's interesting to see the sets. The pacing is good. The acting is fine. Marvel and JF did quite a job with this. But, dang, those are some long closing credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Huge Surprise...!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that when I sat down to watch this film, I was a little skeptical. Marvel had come out with some really crappy movies and a few major letdowns, so there was no reason to expect anything else from Iron Man...O how wrong I was. This movie has so many things going for it. Not only is the script solid, but they had a fantastic cast. Robert Downey jr IS Tony Stark. He makes the character to be exactly what he should be and made it beleaveable and the other actors were fantasticaly cast in their roles. Whats cool about the film is that if you read the comics, you will pick up little nod's here and there to the fans of the comic which is a nice touch that the filmmakers not only were faithful to the source, but updated for todays audience. The special FX are very well done and only enhance the film experience. I think the film added humor in just the right way. Unlike the Fantastic 4 films where I felt like they were more gags meant to be funny that to me, felt really out of place and took any seriousness out of the film, Iron Man has Humor placed just right while stll maintaining a fairly serious tone. My only little nag is I wish there were more fights between Iron Man and opponits/villains but seeing as how this is the first film, what we got was perfect. All in all, this is a smart, well written comic book film that will appeal to the fans of the character and movie goers as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure I would agree with the folks who give this an 8 or higher -- but then, my scores for movies are probably graded out on a higher bell curve than most folks seem to think exist. So, a 6 for me, means well above average. The acting in the movie is, for the most part, uniformly good, even the small roles. I would agree with some of the user reviews who said that some roles were very small and the actors were underused. In particular, Terrance Howard doesn't have much to do with his role - although I guess if they go the standard Hollywood sequel route, at some point Howard will get to top line a War Machine sequel. Paltrow, as Pepper Pots, however, strikes me as stunt casting pure and simple. This is a role that could have been handles by any number of other actresses and probably handled equally well, if not with more ease and grace. Some of the secondary roles, such as Leslie Bibbs were also way too minor not to be played by a decent character actor, and others, such as Jeff Bridges, simply were too rushed to reflect the arc that characters took from the start of the movie towards the end.This feature is your basic super hero origin movie - likely because the filmmakers must assume that most people (such as myself) would not be familiar with how Tony Stark became Iron Man. On that level, I think the movie worked really well. The story was plausible (although I feel more could have been done to explain both the Arc reactor technology and the actual medical issue of the shrapnel/heart danger).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not that good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I didn't have great expectations about this movie, I mean I imagined this could be a nice and entertained film, but not as good as some in the same category, for instance Batman begins, x-men or hulk which in my opinion are very good comic adaptations.When I saw the cast Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges, I thought that the film would worth the trouble to see it.I have to say that the film is well performed and that has outstanding visual effects. The art direction is also well conceived.On the other hand the plot is quite predictable, and I wouldn't have complained if it were more interesting or suspenseful, but all in all, is not a bad start, and since due to it success in box office, they announced a part 2, I hope they will improved the script for that one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi, I am really confused that this movie is receiving such a good feedback. The problem is that I cannot think of any single "major" superhero movie that wasn't better than this. I even think Robocop easily beats this.What's wrong with this movie? The whole script needs work. The little story there is isn't one bit credible. The guy is kept captive in Afghanistan and he is asked to build a missile. The terrorists are watching him closely, but you know what? Our genius hero manages to fool them; he is not building a missile, he is building the bloody armor that will allow him to escape! And the terrorists who are so eager for their plan to work just let it happen! What kind of terrorists are they?! I am sorry, I don't buy this.This is what the movie builds itself upon and I assure you it doesn't make any more sense as it moves on.There isn't the drama that makes other superhero movies so interesting and touching to watch.This is an overall empty movie. The guy is no hero. He destroyed his own weapons and killed the thing that was trying to kill him and the woman he loves.It is a very superficial movie.If you are no teenager or fan of the comics, don't be in a hurry to see this.May be people like this because of the setting in Afghanistan, but sorry, this isn't about news or war, it is just a movie that doesn't deserve such praise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is just OK !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? I was so excited to see this movie 'cause it was rated highly along with very good comments, I really couldn't wait.But when I started watching the movie for the first 10 minutes, I knew the story wouldn't go so far but again about a same-old same-old hero.I definitely assure that the script is nothing but a boring, incoherent and unreasonable. The first thing I would like to point out is the change in Tony's mind. A man who has been designing weapon for decades like him wouldn't change his mind just because of being kidnap, and there is nothing which hits to his mind to make the change. In other words, it looks like the story line is not so convincing at all.In addition, what is the meaning of the movie after all this? Personally I didn't feel my heart was touched by both story and the acting. Fairly, the movie really has humor scenes but they're even not deep enough to tickle audiences. A same-old "weird" relationship between a man and a woman needs to be acted professionally and creatively enough to bring not only the story but also all the emotion behind that. Unfortunately, they just failed it! So, from a very serious point of view, Iron man is just OK!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The credit goes to Robert Downey Jr., clearly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I am not the heroic type, clearly", says Tony Stark in a press conference at the end of the movie. Robert Downey Jr., however, is clearly the best man for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man, a comic book character that is at once simple and complex. Genius, multi-billionaire, flamboyant, flippant ? RDJ can do that in his sleep. It's when it comes to the complete recklessness of flying to the outer whatever-sphere on a whim that you really love the man.But the movie is not all whims. They have taken their good time in developing the first sequence of captivity and escape. Sure, being able to manufacture the first version of Iron Man in the cave under constantly CCTV surveillance taxes credibility to the limit but you tend to forgive and forget when your attention is drawn to the effective script, neat direction and excellent acting.The dialogue is one cut above the usual Marvel Comic genre, for example, Stark's retort when confronted by a challenging reporter at the beginning of the movie. There are of course also the expected snappy lines such as Stark to bartender, "Give me a scotch, I'm starving". Best though is devoted personal assistant Pepper Potts' (Gwyneth Paltrow) claws-out exchange with the sexy reporter in the morning after the latter's sojourning in Stark's apartment, the bit about taking out the trash.Paltrow's role brings to mind immediately Amy Adams' in "Charlie Wilson's War" (2007). While both are devoted personal assistants to a womanizing boss, Adams' character is strictly business while with Peltrow, there is a tantalizing romantic touch, played just right.The special effects are just fine, which is quite a complimentary assessment as it is very difficult today to impress an audience in that department, an audience that has seen everything. "Iron man" stands above most others in the genre by offering and telling a good story, playing every card just right and, above all, having Robert Downey Jr.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many superheroes can filmmakers drain to absolute dehydrated shells? Look what happened to the Superman movies (5 so far counting the most recent waste of time) and the Batman movies (Also 5, if you don't count the recently yet un-released swan song of Heath Ledger). Actually, Batman was reinvigorated with a new innovative director, superb story and brilliant actors who saw its potential.The same could be said for this the latest installment of what could have been a massive bore. The director, Jon Favreau, who is also an actor, had the stroke of genius to cast Robert Downey, Jr. in the part of zillionaire tycoon, Tony Stark. Downey, while not playing himself, clearly put some autobiographical stamp on his part which fit the character brilliantly. Tony Stark is a middle aged man who seizes the chance to redeem himself after a frightening wake up call (cue Downey's sordid past). Favreau also cast Gwyneth Paltrow and for once her character didn't make me want to spew vile as other female characters have done in lesser superhero flicks (eg. Uma Thurman in Batman bomb + Robin). One minor quibble, her character must be the loneliest person on earth besides Stark himself. No clear motivation as how she is attracted to him other than that.Jeff Bridges acquits himself nicely, although it is never explained how he is able to be a threat to Iron Man (see the climactic battle if you don't know what I mean). Also his mumbling performance is a bit tiresome after a while.The CGI is of course top-notch and quite unbelievable (really, where can you get such a supercomputer, let me know). There is a clever little sequence while Stark is perfecting his suit that mirrors a scene seen in Disclosure. As for the action sequences they are not that interesting, except for a glorious dogfighting sequence.So I was only mildly interested in seeing it but once it was over I thought: "It could have been better but not the mind blowing bore I thought it was going to be".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All to often, superheros turn into geeky, rather dull characters when they get out from behind their various costumes. 'Iron Man', on the other hand, in a stroke of brilliance, makes it possible to love the man behind the metal mask even more than the hero itself. For the first time, we're not dealing with a dual personality here- Iron Man and Tony Stark (his true identity) are one fully realized character.Mr. Stark is the rich young owner of a huge weapons dealing company. While displaying his newest creation for the army, he is captured by terrorists who order him to build them a bomb of their own. It is in this place that he has a revelation and escapes with one purpose in mind: He must retrieve the weapons that he himself distributed.Robert Downey Jr. is spot-on perfect in the lead role. He somehow blends sarcasm and real caring into nearly every line. The result is someone we can laugh with, yet also genuinely care for. As Pepper Potts, Tony's longtime secretary/caretaker/love interest, Gwyneth Paltrow delivers the goods once again, playing both hard-to-get intelligent and still very girly. The relationship between the two leads plays wonderfully, never going into schmaltz or typical lovey-dovey-ness. Instead, their interest in each other is not hardly addressed up front, yet through great performances is made clear. Jeff Bridges adds his own flavor as Tony's business partner.Director Jon Favreau keeps the pace quick and the editing sharp, bringing the excitement to near boiling point at times. Yet he also shows an intelligent and graceful hand with the more plot-centered scenes, in particular the ones between Tony and Pepper. All in all, a fun and exciting way to start off the summer. Check this one out on the big screen while you can! Jay Addison</fullReview>

However he delivered an excellent performance and anchored the role to perfection. The CGI was splendid and brought our favorite tin man to life.

		<shortDescription>The tastiest superhero du jour so far...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...thanks to a remarkably coherent script from four guys (usually a sign of last-minute rewrites and trouble in River City), some seriously immaculate production and visual design (from outfits like The Orphanage, ILM, and Stan Winston Studio), and most of all a sterling performance from Robert "Weird Science" Downey, Jr. as genius mega-tycoon Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Downey has had quite the roller-coaster career, and "Iron Man" is going to be one of its peaks, no question. He's pitch perfect, occupying the role like nobody's business, and although his transition from smug, self-involved war profiteer to conscience-stricken humanitarian seems little more than a pragmatic result of nearly being done in by his own weaponry, and leaves the audience wondering just how naive this wunderkind is in the first place, Downey plays the absurdity of it all with both good-natured relish and a certain restraint.Director Jon "Elf" Favreau elicits more than competent performances from the rest of his cast as well. Gwyneth "Proof" Paltrow fills Stark's gal Friday "Pepper" Potts' shoes with grace and a smoldering promise of things yet to come in the inevitable sequel (get your free hint at the end of the credits reel), while Jeff "Starman" Bridges genially gobbles scenery as the bad guy. Terrence "Hustle &amp; Flow" Howard is somewhat wasted as Stark's military insider, and Leslie "Popular" Bibbs has little to do beyond look good as a bimbo journalist with a brain (Brown? Color me bemused!), but Shaun "Crash" Toub is excellent as Stark's savior in Afghanistan, and Clark "We Were Soldiers" Gregg will no doubt enjoy more to do as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent under the command of Samuel L. Jackson.Anyway, as the first genuine blockbuster of the summer, "Iron Man" serves perfectly. Plenty of action, but not tiringly so, a script that mostly treats its characters intelligently and with a sense of humor that never condescends, outstanding production values, and even a score that never overwhelms nor tries to elicit emotional response that isn't otherwise deserved; what more can one ask? I haven't had this much fun since "Spider-Man" or "Batman Begins," and I'll be back in the theater to see this one again, soon, if only to prep for "The Incredible Hulk" (in which Stark/Iron Man will apparently make at least a cameo appearance).Cynics may object to the de rigueur "sci-fience" that "Iron Man" relies upon to exist, but that doesn't make the film any less entertaining or worthy of seeing on the big screen. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An untypical hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Untypical. I like this word. Is it in English language? Not sure. Could be that I invented it. Anyway, it is a nice word. Something untypical has to be special, different, unusual...my kind of thing. Here is one, Iron Man.This world is never in shortage of superheros. Spider, bat, someone in his underwear, a giant green guy... but iron man is unlike them. He is more real and human-like, to me. An M.I.T graduate, a high-tech weapon developer and a notorious playboy, Tony Stark had everything. However, after seeing his weapons used by terrorists to kill innocent people, Stark changed his mind. He realized that he was not making peace so he wanted to close the company, which frightened his collaborator whose benefits were much threatened. So, a fight between them was unavoidable. So far, we have the hero and the enemy, but where is the beauty? Gwyneth Paltrow comes as a vase, again, playing Stark's very important assistant, a job that I envy much. Now, we can just sit back and enjoy the chasing, exploding, flying and...no sex, not even kissing!The scenario has no sparks, but the way it's told is consistent and reasonable(the least requirement we ask for superhero blockbuster). With the help of exciting rock music and brilliant action scenes, Iron Man presents us a special experience of watching superhero saving world. What's more, the amazingly charming Robert Downey Jr. has made us believe that he is Tony Spark. Downey's history is colorful as a movie itself, but he's a wonderful actor with strong personalities, no doubt. I've listed him onto my favorite actors. He's made Iron Man a film that actually has some acting in it.I don't really fancy heroes that much because they are so perfect. Thought Hollywood has realized this and tried to add defect to its heroes, they still look unattractive. But Iron Man, or Tony Spark, has got his charm because he is not always so heroic. Actually, he is kind of bad, but we like him!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that Iron Man wasn't on my preferred reading list as a kid when comics made up a large part of my reading material. Superman, Batman, and the more obscure Tomahawk were my staples. So taking in John Favreau's rendition of Marvel's Iron Man allowed me the luxury of not bringing excess baggage to the screening. The result? Iron Man is a treat for the senses.Telling the story of billionaire military industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who during capture by Taliban-esquire guerrillas, develops both his tin man design and a clarity of vision causing him to see the evil of his company's ways, Iron Man unfolds with a style and flow that most movies can only envy.During filming Favreau allowed his principals free reign to improvise their own dialog. The result, along with some smart plot scripting by a quad of writers, is a film that has a natural, unscripted feel that lends it a natural, somewhat realistic feel.Rounded out by an impressive cast that includes Terrence Howard as Stark's military confidant Jim Rhodes, Gwyneth Paltrow as his long-suffering love interest, and Jeff Bridges (The Dude) as the movie's villain, Iron Man plays out very much in line with creator Stan Lee's original vision of Tony Stark patterned after genius billionaire playboy Howard Hughes. His vices of alcohol and women are there, but in muted form.Designed as the first installment of a trilogy, with all actors signed for the duration, the continuation is expected to further delve into Stark's alcoholism as well as the advent of Rhodes' morphing into War Machine, which is hinted at late in the film.Originally optioned by Universal with horror icon Stuart Gordon (Edmond) to direct, Iron Man bounced around studios and production houses ranging from 20th Century Fox through Paramount, with, at varying points, everyone from Quentin Tarantino and Joss Whedon, Smallville's Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, to Nicholas Cage and Tom Cruise having being penciled in for the production, the final culmination under Favreau and Downey is a movie that will enthrall viewers from the first frame to the last. So grab that bucket of popcorn and large drink, and sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Marvel's Best to Date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron man is a great start to this years movie season. It is just a sweet action packed adventure. The great colleague of trailers leading up to the movie was worth the eight bucks for a ticket as well. This is one of the best comic book films to date. I would go as far as saying this is Marvel's best film alongside X-men 2.Robert Downey Jr. portrays the playboy and illustrious Tony Stark perfectly. His mannerisms and attitude are everything I could hope from the character. His casual and laid-back attitude mixed with a serious and devoted approach to his work is an excellent portrayal of the Stark character. Downey is phenomenal in what I would call his best performance and most memorable to date. His character may have a bit too much cockiness for my pleasing though. The rest of the cast including Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, and Jeff Bridges as the villain Obadiah Stone all deliver good performances Jeff Bridges character can seem relatively dull at times but his character definitely improves as the movie goes on. Noteworthy is Downey, Phenomenal acting on his part and he makes it appear as if he was born to play Tony Stark.The conceptual designs of Iron man are outstanding. I love seeing the evolution of the armor going from an original grey giant to a perfectly designed red-blue suit. The effects are terrific and watching the evolution of the costume and Stark's designing of it is a great addition to the film. The Iron Monger is a great robotic villain for Iron man. I was just expecting him to use Tony's original costume but to see a new design made it much better. The special effects are terrific.The story is outstanding. A couple of new concepts are added to the story and help make it interesting. It is easy to follow and easy to dive into. I am so glad that the biggest concept of the Stark character was handled so well in this film. The idea that Stark feels at fault for all the harm he has created with his weapons. This ultimately leads him to designing the suit and become a protector. And even better, we see the struggles and challenges he must overcome. The stress and hardships he feels after his incident overseas.This is it! Indiana Jones, The Hulk, Hellboy, Wanted, and EVEN The Dark Knight have a lot to live up to. This is going to be one of the best films of the summer. I am not just saying that from the perspective of a fan boy, but also as a movie goer. This is one of the best comic adaptations to date that has helped modernize a character and help relate him to a modern day world. Fantastic film. Bravo Jon Favreau.P.S. Watch the movie all the way through. Don't leave until after the credits. You do not want to miss the scene afterwards. I literally jumped over the seats and down into the aisle way once I saw it. I bruised up my arms and legs. NO JOKE! This extra scene is everything you could hope for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that starts off with a bang ends as such, with none of the usual superhero trappings to get in the way of the action. You won't find in this film a conflicted main character, tortured by their duality and hidden selves. You will find a main character that jumps off the screen with attitude and strength of character to amaze in and out of superhero suit. Robert Downey Jr does well to include the pompous attitude of the world's most powerful billionaire industrialist with the subtle humorous breaks that do not lend to camp or sappy under-emotions usually noted with today's sensitive superhero.Does Ironman (the character) boldly go where none other has gone before? In the end, yes he does, and the film is much better for it. To tastefully prevent a recanting of the entire film, my only info to provide at this time is that this is one film that deserves the extra $$ to be seen on the big screen. Think Transformers minus the kiddy-entrapments and commercial influence. Nine to avoid the over-utilized 10-rating it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man provides about as much fun as one could ask. While it lacks the emotional punch of films such as Superman: The Movie or Batman Begins, the film has many virtues going for it and could be enjoyed any number of times.The movie has some of the most visually inventive special effects I have ever seen. Watching all of Tony's inventions come to life consistently put a smile on my face. Plus the humor in the film is considerable. Jon Favreau knows how to brighten a viewer's day, and the film never ceases to be a joyous crowd pleaser.The cast adds to Iron Man tremendously. I'm not usually a Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but she knew how to add spice to the role of the loyal love interest and she shared great chemistry with the hero. Terrence Howard makes a strong right hand man; all of Tony's goofy indulgences were made that much more entertaining by the contrast with his responsible, endearingly square best friend. Plus the caring bond between the two of them gave the film more heart. Jeff Bridges isn't given the kind of memorable villain role the likes of Willem Dafoe and Terence Stamp have gotten in the past. The movie is sometimes too light for its own good and the good vs. evil battle is not that compelling. However, Bridges is one of the best actors in history and he still manages to create a character we love to hate. Of course the most entertaining supporting character may have been the robot...However the unquestionable star of this show is Robert Downey Jr., who elevated the film to another level entirely using his magnificent charisma. I found myself wanting to applaud Tony Stark even when he was at his most hedonistic, because he was just that charming. And when he chose to be a superhero, you'd be hard pressed to find someone you'd want to root for more. Downey of course proved himself to be too human in the past, but after years of his being clean his talent has finally taken over and brought him the role of a lifetime.Here's hoping Iron Man lives on forever and its gifted star is only beginning his reign as a major Hollywood force!</fullReview>

The essence of 50's industrialism that was somewhat captured in the Rocketeer but failed in storyline and at the Box Office seems reversed-engineered and refined in Ironman. This tomato is a must-see...its wonderfully and tastefully etched on silver celluloid. Comic fans need not critique. Stan Winston's studios capture the magic of post war polished steel and chromium while Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway craft a fantastic story that chronicles the genesis of the original man-machine cum cyborg.

Now I was never a Marvel Comics geek, my favorite characters were the mainstays of the DC Comics universe, like Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, et al. But if you were a fan, you couldn't help but know about the alternative universe that contained Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, The X-Men and Iron Man, which brings us to the subject at hand. I thought that the movie did a credible job of spanning the forty year comic book history of Iron Man about as well as could be expected in a distilled down two hour movie. Particularly effective was the way we see how the origin costume in the picture pays tribute to the early Iron Man years, while the modern day red and gold armor conveys the advance of science and technology into the twenty first century. Comic book purists will most likely have serious issues with the picture, but I've been able to get over the whole faithfulness to continuity issue some time ago. What I'm looking for in a flick like "Iron Man" is an opportunity to be entertained for a couple of hours, and there's enough here to have some fun and be just that - entertained.The one thing I AM looking for in the Marvel universe pictures is the ubiquitous cameo appearance of Stan Lee, creator of many of the comic book icons we recognize today. He's incorrectly credited in the cast listing as I write this, as he's listed appearing as himself. What you need to do is pay attention to that party scene in the casino when Tony Stark says hi to 'Hef'. That was just the coolest way to get Stan into the picture, and I give him a lot of credit for not taking himself too seriously as he truly is one of the gods of comic book history.As for the picture, it's easy enough to bash it for it's adherence to current world events and the milieu of extremist terrorism. But is that any worse than reliving the events of the early 1960's and placing the character in the middle of the Bay of Pigs or the Cuban Missile Crisis? The present day Iron Man can be a product of his time and still be effective as a symbol of patriotism and honor, even while the rest of the country is immersed in presidential primaries and partisan politics.You have to give credit to the selection of Robert Downey Jr. for the Iron Man role. Perhaps his own bouts with substance abuse uniquely prepared him for an outstanding performance as the conflicted title character. However the character I was intrigued with the most was Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane, I just couldn't get over his appearance as Tony Stark's operations chief. The role was played with just the right amount of reserve and just below the surface malice; I thought he did an excellent job. Gwyneth Paltrow had pretty much a thankless job as Stark's personal assistant and secret admirer and it didn't seem to me that her performance was all that stand out.As an aside, the one thing I feel I do have to comment on is a personal gripe of mine relative to the IMDb ranking system. As I write this, "Iron Man" sits at number #130 of the all time best films as ranked by current users. It seems to me that the way fans line up behind a picture even before it's released, there ought to be a moratorium of say, two or three years before a new release could be eligible for Top 250 ranking. When you consider the truly great films of all time like "Casablanca" or "Citizen Kane", it's hard for me to reconcile a popcorn flick like this one to be considered in the same breath. I feel the same way (as to a voting moratorium) about stunning pictures like "No Country For Old Men" and "There Will Be Blood". If a picture has the legs to stand up as an all time great, it will be remembered a couple years after it's original release. Remember all the fanboy hype about "Serenity"? Does anyone even care about that picture today? See what I mean?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had more of a negative buzz when the news even broke that Iron Man will be made... boy were the buzzes wrong! This is one of the greatest comic based movie ever! The moment I heard Jon Favreau was directing it, I knew it'll be great. He puts forward human interaction and self discovering in characters before wild visual effects like in this movie or Zathura, or even before Will Ferrell in Elf. Then the name Robert Downey Jr. came, this will be the movie to wait! I can't even imagine who can be Tony Stark now because of Robert Downey Jr. He's really the greatest. Even if his character here isn't that much of a difference than in Zodiac, if he wasn't in this movie, I think the movie won't even work. I even think his dark past helped carve his great talent here today. Waiting for Tropic Thunder here! Not only are the visual effects superb, there's still a chunk of story we can actually care about. Jeff Bridges... Oh, Jeff Bridges! I was surprised! I usually see him as these goody-2-shoes characters... he was so evil here! This movie just has to have a sequel! It just has to! I blame the writers and Jon Favreau for it! Serves you right for making that big cliffhanger and bringing a certain great actor WAAAAYYY.... in the end of the movie! I want sequel... Now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Spider-Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, Spidey fans, but it looks like your hero's time as the most popular comic book movie character is up. Now Iron Man's reign has just begun.When i heard that Iron Man was getting his own movie about 2 years ago, i was expecting just the average action film since that's basically what this character looks like, just a tough guy in a suit of armor. However when i saw the movie, i saw Tony Stark's true nature, and he isn't a tough guy at all, he's a wisecracking billionaire weapons inventor, who at first is oblivious to the damage he helps to cause in the world by making these dangerous weapons. After a while he makes a nearly unstoppable suit he vows to correct the damage he did and make sure it doesn't happen again.What really got me was both the action and the humor, which is rarely something that any action film succeeds at. The script is really funny and smart and the special effects really make the action stand out. The film also has a deeper storyline than any of the comic book movies, because of this you're not really gonna see Tony with the suit on a lot, but that's more than OK, because its one of the reasons why Iron Man is so unique.Robert Downey Jr. gives the performance of his career because he basically IS Tony Stark! He looks exactly like him in the comics and both their personality's are the same, there definitely isn't a better actor out there that could've been a better choice. This movie should solidify his position as a superstar. I highly recommend this instant classic for everyone, even if you've never heard of the comic book or even if you hate comic books.Just watch it and be amazed....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the first great summer blockbuster of 2008 is Ironclad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest superhero based film that comes down the pipeline is Iron Man,telling the origin of how billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) becomes Iron Man while captured by the enemy during wartime (updating the story, substituting the Koreans for the Taliban for obvious reasons) Casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark was a stroke of genius given his highly public past escapades, and after seeing him as the hard-drinking, womanizing, wealthy industrialist turned superhero Iron Man by sheer necessity one would be hard pressed to view an other actor portraying him. Downey IS Stark and this is a primary reason why the movie works so well (there's a scene late in the movie where he has a scene that mirrors "Less Then Zero", in look more than subject matter, that I quite enjoyed, but won't spoil here). Jeff Bridges holds his own very well as Obadiah Stane, Tony's main foil, but there's no stealing the spotlight from Robert in the least. This is fully his film.However even with the immaculate casting, the film only would be as good as it's storyline, fortunately here too it excels, remaining highly compelling and vastly entertaining (for the most part, of course a scene or two could've been trimmed a tad to tighten things up, it still works though). The direction by Jon Favreau is great as well and remarkably solid (even if the same can't of his role as Happy Hogan) All in all, this is the first great blockbuster of 2008 and will likely remain the best until the new Indiana Jones comes out. It already, without a doubt, ranks up with the best Super-hero movies made thus far.PS. Make sure to stay until after the credits for a nifty surpriseMy Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comic Book movies can still be very fun and innovative and Iron Man is all the proof you need...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly didn't know what to expect with this film. Marvel has been very hit and miss as of late and I really think that the last truly great film they made was Spider-Man 2 04. Iron Man is a treat and a reprieve from the Ghost Riders, Electras', Blade Trinitys', and Spider-Man 3s' of recent years. Robert Downey Jr IS Iron Man. He is absolutely outstanding in the title role of Tony Stark. He has a huge on-screen presence and he is really what drives this movie which has an outstanding cast. He captures the persona of the Stark character perfectly. Some say it is because they have similar character traits and I simply don't think that's true. Tony Stark is the anti-superhero and you have to be clever and witty to make him appeal to the audience who expects the Romantic good guy in a quest against evil. Stark builds his new suit out of curiosity to see how far the limits could be pushed rather than doing it out of a conviction to fight off villains. The last exchange between Stark and Pepper is a direct parody of the entire Spider-Man film series. Stark is not your average hero and he makes it known. They remain faithful to Stark's personality and thus the movie can offer the audience a treat in the world of summer superheroes.The story of Iron Man was written as a critique of the Cold War ideas but the story transfers verily well to our modern War on Terror. Stark is a patriot and when he sees his weapons being fired on American soldiers he gains the conviction to become something better than what he once was. There is some critique of weaponry and war but it is mainly about how Tony comes to the realization that war must be used for the right reasons and he comes to this through his capture in the film's beginning. Starks reaction to seeing his weapons in the hands of terrorists is portrayed very well by Downey. We are able to see inside the real Tony Stark past the playboy.The special effects are realistic. ILM shows that they don't need superheros to be in the dark to make them look like living breathing beings.My complaint about the film is the final battle. The dialogue and the fight choreography are bad enough to be in your Saturday morning cartoon. Jeff Bridges is an immensely talented actor and to hear him deliver pitiful cliché lines is somewhat of a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clearly one of THE BEST comic to screen adaptations. You'll love this!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is one of the lesser known Marvel Super Heroes, especially for us, living in India. To most of us, his past is unknown. With a sense of humor one rarely gets to see in a superhero, Iron Man is something of a revelation, deviating from the normal "Saving the World" type of Superheroes. With the coolest outfit one could ever lay eyes on, Iron Man is merely the beginning of a Trilogy that could as well be remembered for a long long time to come as one of the best comic book to celluloid adaptations ever made.Actor/Director Jon Favreau, along with a stellar cast of superstars who have been absent from the big screen of late, have come together and made something top notch after the recent spell of disappointing superhero movies made(think Ghost Rider, Fantastic Four 2, Spiderman 3). With the likes of Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges, Terence Howard, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Iron Man is the first big hit to come out of Hollywood this year.Iron Man stays true to its comic book, telling the story of billionaire industrialist Tony Stark who devises the idea of a man covered in metallic armor after he is captured by Afghan terrorists. Upon his escape, Stark improves upon his design. And in order to stop 'under the table' sale of his weapons to terrorist groups by his business partner, Obadiah Stane, he becomes the man in the gold titanium alloy suit, named Iron Man by the press.Certain sequences in the film are highly detailed, some others not so much. It suffers from a spot of bad editing, and it really wouldn't have been bad if it were extended by 10-15 minutes. It is entertaining enough to hold anyone's attention for 15 more minutes. Guess we'll have to wait for a Director's Cut for that. In the theater, it has a modest running time of 2hours. Broken into two parts, the introduction and the origin. The former being more detailed than the later.One of the first things one will notice about Tony Stark is his amazing sense of humor. Robert Downey Jr., who is at the peak of his career at age 43 has an undeniable flair when it comes to playing a man who is full of himself and cracks jokes at the drop of a hat. He doesn't even have to try. Its a flawless performance. He acts the part, and boy oh boy does he look the part! Even Gwyneth Paltrow plays her part well as Stark's assistant, Pepper Potts. She looks better than ever. There is a magnificent amount of chemistry between the two which will be something to look forward to in the upcoming movies. Terence Howard and Jeff Bridges are just there, portraying the sidekick and villain respectively. Fair enough, though I would have liked Howard to be given a bit more screen time.One, very integral part of the movie was the making of the original suit. Shown till the last detail, it was just a treat to watch the testing and assembly of the suit. And once again, even this contains a fair amount of humor. You really don't expect such a lot of humor in a superhero movie, but by the end of it, one realizes that that exactly is what Tony "Iron Man" Stark is all about. He isn't your average superhero. He is as much the khaki professional as he was before he become Iron Man. He did not get transformed accidentally by being bitten by a spider, neither did he descend from space. A little similar to Batman, he chooses to become someone different. Someone who can change things. Unlike most others, he isn't gifted with super powers. Wait till the last scene of the film for deviation, and an amazing piece of rock music in the closing credits along with concept art from the making of the film.Iron Man ranks right up there with the likes of Batman : Begins, Spiderman 2, and Superman Returns(which, I think is grossly underrated by critics) when it comes to being a comic book adaptation. And it adds a dose of coolness to the genre of superhero movies. Whether it is the miniature arc reactor/pacemaker on his chest or the part French-cut beard he keeps, Robert Downey Jr. will be best remembered as Iron Man. Iron Man, who can take phone calls while flying through the skies with two fighter jets on his tail. Now, thats what I call cool!! Great start to a promising Hollywood Summer!! 8/10 overall. Great background score. Loved the suit. Cannot wait for the sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on opening night, not expecting much. The trailers had looked okay from what they showed, but I wasn't planning to like it nearly as much as the first Spider-Man. However, Iron Man may have surpassed Spider-Man. Robert Downey Jr. is absolutely amazing as Tony Stark and completely owns this role. Gweneth Paltrow was great as Pepper Potts, Jeff Bridges was terrifying as the Iron Monger, and Terrence Howard will rock as War Machine in Iron Man 2. The special effects were stunning, and the storyline was gripping. Being Marvel Studio's first film, I will expect quite a bit out of their movies from now on. I'm looking forward to The Incredible Hulk, in which Robert Downey Jr. cameos as Tony Stark in a scene with William Hurt's General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross. I wish they had the Hulk Buster suit in that movie...but that's unlikely. Overall, I loved Iron Man and recommend it to every comic fan on the planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely fantastic. I was excited to see this movie for months and frequently after having so much buildup I leave the theater feeling let down. This, fortunately, was the opposite experience. The movie was better than I ever could have imagined.I would have to say that this has already become one of my all-time favorite movies and I've only seen it twice. Usually after seeing a movie you can come up with numerous flaws that were disappointing in the movie. Iron Man on the other hand does not have this problem. Personally, I could only think of one particular line that I, personally, didn't like.This movie has excellent ratings on IMDb and other sites because it deserves them.

		<shortDescription>Doesn't iron out every wrinkle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's be very, very, very clear about this. Iron Man is an immensely enjoyable movie. It takes a little while to get going, after an enjoyable opening sequence, but when it does it provides the spectacle, minor laughs and thrills you'd expect from any half-decent comic book movie. BUT this is far from being the best superhero movie ever made and the level of rabid praise and appreciation it garnered on it's release is, frankly, quite baffling.Most of the kudos seems to be thanks to the casting in the central role of one Mr Robert Downey Jr. and it's definitely a plus for the movie to have this sardonic, likable guy in the lead. He makes you like him no matter what, whether he's playing the early Tony Stark who sells lethal weapons or the later Tony Stark who makes an unrealistic change of character (the turnaround here is a bit much to take although some people have since told me that they found it easier to believe).The rest of the cast also do well and nobody hits a flat note, even Gwyneth Paltrow (who can sometimes irritate me) hits just the right balance of strong and demure in the role of Pepper Potts. Terence Howard is a great foil to Downey Jr. and Jeff Bridges is great when given enough to do although, sadly, that's not often enough.Jon Favreau has slipped so comfortably into the director's chair nowadays that it's easy to forget he hasn't made all that many movies and that he gave us Made early on in his directorial career. He gets a lot of things just right, including a great soundtrack, and there aren't really any mistakes that would make you think he was out of his depth.The main problem I had was with the pacing. It's just a shame that we have to sit through a couple of strands that feel like not one but TWO origin stories about the same fella. And when we do get to the main character being established it seems that he's not in the suit for long enough on screen and is just killing time till some big final battle with a worthy opponent that you should recognise coming from almost the very beginning.It's a great, fun movie and I would certainly recommend it to people. I would just try to maintain a sense of perspective while doing so, something that seems to have gone out of the window for many folks who seem to have been waiting for this film for a long, long time.See this if you like: Spider-Man 3, The Rocketeer, Robert Downey Jr.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will of course start out by saying; grownups, go rent Robocop, which eclipses this film in almost every department except star quality. But Iron Man is a good solid film; it has bangs flashes and a nearly hypnotic performance from both male leads. I mean, Jeff Bridges with no hair; what's up with that? And his fantastic brand of avuncular menace; excellent! True to the comics? I'm sure that's right; Marvel have stamped on it, so the back story is great and the visuals perfect. All the suits from scrap to Ironmonger work beautifully on screen. Why only a 7, then? It's a bit of a between-two-stools film. The action sequences are fine but not quite long enough, and Rob Downey's anguish doesn't really work given the time scale it is supposed to have occurred over; the easy availability of all the material to someone of Stark's standing; and of course the fact that he is fantastically rich and famous and supposedly actually has something to do with the company he runs. Assume he's only a figurehead and the film works but his character doesn't; if his hands are dirty then the kidnap should really just have encouraged him to nuke the perps. Plus of course the rescue scene in the village raises the unpleasant thought; how many times a day is this happening all over the world with nobody being able to do anything about it? Bad taste in the mouth, there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people have been raving that this is 2008's best movie, and while it very well may be so far, the year isn't even half over yet so we'll just have to wait and see. Iron Man is an amazing film that blew me away. I thought I was going to be let down because of all the hype but it's become one of my favorite super hero movies. So if you're wondering if it lives up to all the hype, the answer is a very enthusiastic "yes." I was very impressed with the storyline and I loved how well everything was tied together. A lot of super hero, and just action films is general, seem to focus so much on action sequences that they don't really have much time to focus on story and this movie wasn't like that at all. It created a great story. The acting was fantastic also. Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow and everyone else were amazing. I also thought the CGI and special effects were done very well. I usually hate CGI but I really loved the look of it in this movie. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie.I am a big fan of the first Spiderman, the Batman films, the X-Men films, and Superman films and this one definitely deserves to be placed with those. It is the best super hero movie to come along lately and I can't till it's on DVD so I can purchase it. Go see it while it's still in theaters and for once, believe the hype!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong contender for best superhero flick of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man. Who'd have thought?Quite simply one of the best superhero flicks ever made, and a strong contender for the top spot. I honestly don't know if I can pinpoint a single flaw in the film, except that I wish it was even LONGER. Not only does it succeed as a comic book adaptation, it succeeds as just a great MOVIE. Probably the most fun flick I've seen in a good two years or more.So how did this movie get it right when so many others get it all wrong? It certainly isn't just the character. Iron Man is a second-tier Marvel character that never really caught my eye much or gained the general public's love. I believe it was two factors: casting and respect for the material.First and foremost, I can't imagine anyone but Robert Downey Jr. playing this role. He owns it so completely and is such a perfect fit that I have to wonder how much of the script was completely re-written for him or was improvised. His brand of humor and wit, along with his great range as an actor allow him to convey the whole arc of Tony Stark's story, and to make it entertaining every step of the way. I am especially impressed at the studio's decision to *gasp* actually cast an appropriate actor over 40 years old, rather than cast young just to bring in the teen box office.While so many other comic book flicks treat their material (and audiences) condescendingly, or just as a silly story that can be used to show off cool effects or action scenes, Iron Man instead respects that it can be just as good or respectable as any other film. Nothing is over-the-top or forced. The story is much more grounded in reality than most superhero genre films - There are no "superpowers", just technological genius and talent. It's taken to extreme degrees, for sure, but never feels far-fetched or silly. The film also shows you can include comedy without it being blatant comic relief, full of forced silliness and one-liners. No the laughter here is genuine, and lots of it. I laughed more in this film than I have in any actual comedy film in a long time.Recent superhero flicks like Batman Begins and Superman Returns were well-made, exciting, and dramatic, but lacked the fun factor. The overall tone of those films is so dour that repeated viewings are a bit of a chore. Then others like the Fantastic Four came out and went in the too far in the other direction, being cheesy and dumb. Iron Man got back to the tone of the first two Superman films and found the perfect balance of drama and comedy.I could go on about every aspect of the film - the supporting players, score, effects... but I'll just say it all clicked. The rest of the summer's flicks are going to have a lot to live up to. I suspect this is the movie people will go back and see again and again, as other summer fare fades away. Just plain fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About ten times better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many months I had no hopes for, or interest in, this movie whatever, expecting just another explosion-loaded summer gadget-fest for the tech fanboys. When I heard the buzz on Downey's performance I decided to see it, but I still had no expectations in particular. Well, I got a surprise and then some, because this is one heck of a smart, funny, rockin' movie. It has huge kinetic energy, and stays on course throughout, never sinking into the trap of a long, dumb, drawn-out special-effects brawl (I'm looking at you, X-Men III); the Iron Man suit is a ***real suit*** from the wonderworks of Stan Winston, not CGI, thank heaven!; music choices are very cool (Black Sabbath's "Iron Man" and Suicidal Tendencies' "Institutionalized", yeah!); casting and acting are excellent (Gwyneth Paltrow gets high marks); and Downey's performance is simply a marvel--pun only half intended!--perfect from start to finish. From his fast-talking hyperactive demeanor and the edgy, nervous intelligence of his eyes to his expressive face and understated body language, he really IS Tony Stark, completely believable as a high-tech genius used to living on his mind and nerves (and alcohol) alone. (I'm guessing the buff physique is just something he cultivates to make sure he looks good in those expensive suits.) Playing Stark as a wired 21st century media star instead of the outdated stereotype of the suave high-living playboy is a brilliant stroke, and his crisis of conscience is completely convincing without being at all maudlin or overdone. --Downey's just great in this, and I publicly apologize for not having had any confidence in him, cos this could not have been played better.To top it off, it's even got a relevant and topical anti-military message, raises touchy subjects like American foreign policy and war profiteering, and has a surprise cameo after the credits (do not leave early!) that raises all sorts of speculations for the future. =)---Man, I had the best time at this movie. It's a complete kick, and much, MUCH better than I expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Superhero Movies Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is an example of when expectations slowly started to sneak up on me, until my excitement towards the film had reached an incredible point. Let me tell you right from the off. Even with my high expectations, I was blown away by this movie. Excuse the pun, but Iron Man is a marvel of a blockbuster.There are so many accolades that I want to give this movie. It is one of the best kick-offs to the summer movie season ever. It is one of the best, if not the best comic book movies since Spider-Man 2. It is one of the best comic book movies ever made. And finally, it packs one of the best casts for a comic book movie ever.I'll start with Robert Downey Jr., who gives an absolutely phenomenal performance in the lead role of weapons manufacturer Tony Stark AKA Iron Man. Downey Jr. not only develops a deliciously likable, intelligent and hilarious individual with aplomb, but he also does a tremendous job at delving into the character and revealing his guilt over how he has destroyed many people's lives, and his determination to right the wrongs that he has committed. In Downey's hands, this is a shockingly electric portrayal, one of the most compelling and human performances ever in the role of a superhero and easily one of the best, if not the best performances of the year so far.The incredible supporting cast also deliver fantastic performances. As Obadiah Stane, Stark's business partner, Jeff Bridges manages to do the near-impossible; he manages to counter Downey's exceptional performance with one which is almost just as impressive. Taking the character by the horns, Bridges crafts a truly menacing and imposing individual. The power of Bridge's portrayal is all the more notable because he refuses to chew the scenery, which makes Stane all the more deadly. He is truly a terrific adversary. As "Rhodey", Stark's military liaison and friend, Terrence Howard brings charm and charisma to his role, and also makes his character one to watch in future instalments with one killer line. And finally, Gwyneth Paltrow oozes sexiness, intelligence and sophisticated emotions as Stark's assistant and possible love interest, Pepper Potts. In a role which has given otherwise perfect superhero films such as Batman Begins a thorn in their side, Paltrow and the filmmakers have crafted a truly lovable, authentic and memorable love interest for their superhero. Impressive performances are also given by Shaun Toub as a prisoner of terrorists in Afghanistan and Faran Tahir as the terrorist leader.The direction and screenplay are also two other reasons why this movie is so compellingly brilliant. There is no doubt that Jon Favreau is a talented director (see Elf and Zathura for evidence), but I wasn't exactly surprised when many people reacted nervously when it was announced that he was to direct Iron Man. Fortunately, he acquits himself excellently. Favreau delivers a blockbuster that strives to be more than just your normal action feast, and that always hits the mark. Favreau's direction is heartfelt, engaging, fun and smart. He ensures that those who have never heard of Iron Man are sucked into the film's brilliant story right from the beginning, and directs the cheer-inducing action sequences with tremendous energy and panache. But where he really succeeds is in the quieter, more character-based moments, which transform the characters into living, breathing individuals.He is aided by a thoroughly superb script, which mixes intelligence, rip-roaring humour and crackling dialogue into one glorious whole. None of the characters feel like cardboard cut-outs. They are complex and interesting, but their sophistication never affects the action which many people want to see.Visually, Iron Man is flawless. None of the visual effects feel over-the-top or forced, and their perfect implementation into their environment makes them all the more realistic. Also, Iron Man uses its visuals much more subtly than other blockbusters, such as in the hysterically funny moment where Stark first tests his flying boots. This is a movie where the visuals are being beautifully used in order to make the movie's story have a stronger and more profound impact. They are also a terrific tool when it comes to crafting the movie's fantastic action sequences. From Stark's explosive escape from terrorists to the final climactic clash between Iron Man and Stane's alter ego Iron Monger, the action is fast, gripping, expertly crafted and utterly sensational, much like the film as a whole.There is also a unbeatable display of gadgetry on display here. The final Iron Man suit is absolutely flawless in its creation and layout, and is truly iconic, whereas Stark's robotic assistants (robotic arms and a computerised butler) provide some terrific moments of humour when Downey Jr. is around to be brilliantly sarcastic and energetic. Also, the soundtrack is excellent, with several great songs flawlessly mixed in with Ramin Djawadi's pitch-perfect score. All of Iron Man's terrific assets combine to make the best movie of the year thus far, one which is quite close to flawless in terms of entertainment. With a stunner of a leading performance, a top-notch supporting cast, terrific direction, an intelligent and hilarious screenplay and stunning visuals and action sequences, Iron Man is a powerful knock-out punch of a movie. If you haven't been to see any movies at the cinema so far this year, I implore you to go and be astounded by this. Also, be sure to stay all the way through until the end of the credits, for one mouth-watering final scene. Comic book spectacle doesn't come any better than this. The ball is in your court, Mr. Hulk. I look forward to seeing how you are going to top this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, not Great, but a whole lot of fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is an immensely enjoyable film. Major props go out to it in terms of direction, acting and special effects. Where thing begin to fall apart is the plot, but I'll get to that in a second.Iron Man is very well shot. The music is well picked, well placed, and well timed. When it opens with AC/DC the tone is set for the entire film. It is fast, it is fun, and it f-ing rocks. The music cues throughout the film tend to enhance this sense. When Iron Man fights, they break out the guitars and it just feels right.The special effects are beautiful. I am a cgi hater, but in the case of iron man you don't really have a choice. I'm just glad that they decided to use it sparingly and when they do it is breathtaking. I think most uses of cgi in movies look terrible. Not so here. A+. And because they use it sparingly and they took the material seriously (while keeping a light tone), this feels like the real world to an extent. Tim Story and even Sam Raimi should watch this film to show that you can have a light tone and keep things in something of a realistic realm. You can have a comic book film be fun and light without becoming a cartoon. You can be funny without being stupid.And this film is funny as hell. You will laugh. This is rare for a comic book film. Most don't know how to handle comedy. They either go overboard and its just ridiculous and stupid (certain dance scenes come to mind) or it gets wedged in and comes off as awkward one-liners that make you cringe (the one flaw in my beloved batman begins). Most of the humor comes from the absolutely fantastic performance by Robert Downy Jr. He f-ing nailed it. I could go on for pages and not come close to how good he is. This is his film through and through. It's why the film is so much fun. He is instantly likable, funny, awesome, and real. Two thumbs up all the way. The other cast members all do their jobs and pass with flying colors. The performances range from serviceable to excellent. None are bad. Everyone does something to contribute to the film overall. Kudos to the cast.Now to the major glaring flaw to this film. The plot. It's terrible. Fortunately, you don't care that much because it is otherwise so much fun. But really, it couldn't be much more silly, cliché, or predictable. The long, overblown bad-guy speeches handed out by jeff bridges (not his fault, he does the best he can with the material) are especially overwrought and overdone and the closest this movie comes to a cringe moment. If you were to write an outline for your typical comic book movie plot, hell your typical action movie plot, you'd basically have the exact plot that this movie follows. Which is a shame, but fortunately it doesn't drown the movie. It just holds it back from being something greater.Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Iron Man has one of the best endings of any comic book movie i've ever seen. It completely caught me off guard. I love it. Just another parting gift from the wonderful filmmakers. The hackneyed plot could have used such surprises. In the end, it was just really good to see marvel get its groove back after the abortions that are Ghost Rider and the Fantastic Four movies (and Spiderman 3). Stay until after the credits for 30 seconds of Samuel L. awesomeness!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is based on the fictional Marvel Comics character Iron Man. You say that Robert Downey Jr is just not the super hero type...get over it. He plays Tony Stark the billionaire industrialist, who manufactures superior weapons of war. Stark is captured by terrorists in Afghanistan with the promise of freedom if he builds a highly destructive missile for them. Instead he builds a suit of armor to make his escape. Stark realizes that many of his weapons are being used to kill Americans in combat. He holds a press conference expounding his manufacturing empire will quit the production of weapons. He puts a lot of effort in perfecting his armored suit to turn himself into the highly technological hero Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his faithful personal assistant Pepper Potts. Terrence Howard is his jet pilot friend James Rhodes. And his mentor and business partner Obadiah Stane(Jeff Bridges) is the essence of evil covertly ordering a hit to kill Stark and take over his empire. Also in the cast: Faran Tahir, Sayed Badreya, Shaun Toub and the gorgeous Leslie Bibb. FX and CGI are commanding and superb. You really get the bang for your buck. The film's stars have already signed on to do two sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first off stay after the credits to see nick fury, he talks about how tony stark isn't the only superhero in the world, which makes sense cuz tony is in the incredible hulk.anyway just got back from the theaters and all i can say was that it was pretty good.i liked robert downey jr. and jeff bridges a lot. Terrance howard didn't do much and gweneth palrow bugged me a lot! anyway to sum things up ice and neatley, The movie showed very little of iron man, it needed more action, downey jr. stole the show and the director knew that making the focus more on TONY stark than IRON man himself so the movie should be entitled TONY STARK instead of iron man if their was more action this would be a perfect movie, but sadly it isn't i liked it but probably wont be seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not ashamed to admit it: I love Robert Downey Jr. If you read my other reviews, most of them are about him. I cannot get enough of this gifted actor. He was the reason I wanted to see this movie.Director Jon Favreau does a great job with this film. The special effects are out-of-this-world. The music rocks. The dialogue is witty &amp; humorous. The suit rocks. And the actors shine.Gwyneth Paltrow is Pepper Potts, Tony Stark's assistant. Not a Paltrow fan, but she suits this role. I loved her hair color. She is perfect in her conflicting emotions. And absolutely gorgeous in the blue ball gown. Perfect.Terance Howard surprised me. I have not seen him before, but I am a fan. As Rhodes, Stark's best friend, Howard brings a realness to the character. You cheer him on as he hints towards a sequel.The villain is played by Jeff Bridges. Amazing. I absolutely hated him. Knowing that he wanted to kill Tony when Tony trusted him made me cheer for Iron Man even more. I suspected him from the beginning. A great job by a great actor.This movie, however, belongs to Downey. He is perfect as Tony Stark. Talk about hot!! Not only is Downey good-looking in this film, but the shots of his bare, muscular arms sent a tingle through me. And his tight jeans sent more. The best good-looking shot of him is in the tuxedo. I melted into a puddle. Besides his looks, Downey makes Stark human. He can change emotions at the drop of a hat. Watch his eyes: he can tell a story just using them. I've said it before, I'll say it again: he has the best eyes in the business.The sexual tension between Potts &amp; Stark steams up the screen! You can see how much Tony wants her, &amp; how much she wants to tell him she loves him. I really wanted them to get together. Hopefully in the sequel.This is definitely the big blockbuster of 2008. I cannot wait to add it to my collection. Be sure to see it. Also, be sure to stick around through the credits for a surprise at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man = solid gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DC has always had Superman, and Marvel has always had Spiderman. In the modern era, Superman and Batman have made a powerful 1-2 punch for DC/Warner Bros(anyone else see the World's Finest teaser billboard flash by in I Am Legend?), but Marvel has been throwing a weak 1-2 for years now, with the Punisher, Daredevil, and the Hulk all failing to make a decent follow up for Spidey. But now Marvel has Ironman as a powerful left cross.Ironman is an excellent franchise launch. Following my analogy above, it most closely reminds me of Batman Begins with it's well grounded story, excellent cast, and well built(literally and figuratively) franchise foundation. There are no weak links in the front four, with Robert Downey Jr. fitting the gold plated armor as well as Tobey McGuire fit the Spidey suit, Gwyneth Paltrow being the best female lead in a superhero movie since Frances McDormand in Darkman, Jeff Bridges towering over his costars and chewing scenes, and Terrence Howard channeling Benicio Del Toro as Tony Stark's friend (and one day successor in the comic book), Jim Rhodes. Really not an acting related weak spot to be found throughout the reel.As for the script, I thought it was a slick, well plotted, complete movie. Some knock John Favrue as a lightweight action director, but I felt he did a really good job(remember, I am not a Gen X-er, so we'll see what their patience for story is). Favreau and his staff achieve the right mix of action and back story, plotting and fireworks that many other directors miss with superhero movies(either all show, no go like the Clooney Batman movies, or slogging metaphysical BS such as in Eric Bana's Hulk or Val Kilmer's Batman). He playfully flirts with more than a few superhero movie cliché's, but skillfully moves the film against type at just the right times. When the completely unsurprising twist comes near the climax of the movie, it is so well acted and written that the story doesn't miss a beat. And twice in the final frames Favrue puts the football up on the tee for Charlie Brown, only to yank it away to good effect before the kick lands. Deft touch, I thought. Also, Stan Lee's obligatory cameo is more amusing and less gratuitous than most of his others.Overall, a very good superhero, action movie, a more solid beginning to the blockbuster season than we have seen in a few years. Should clear at least $275 million domestic, $70-80 million in the opening weekend would not be unheard of.3.5 stars out of 4.Investors will note the opening splash screen no longer says "Marvel" but "Marvel Entertainment", heralding a new chapter in Marvel's spotty cinematic history. With a reclamation project of their intellectual property rights completed over the past 5 years under Avi Araad, Marvel is now producing many of their own features (Spiderman and X-Men are still optioned as collaborations with other studios). Ironman, and the Incredible Hulk opening in June are both produced solely by Marvel, meaning larger profits for them, and Monday is Marvel's earning's call, so look for their stock to bump up towards $35-$40 real soon.</fullReview>

I cant thank all of the actors and everybody who worked on this movie for allowing me to share in this cinematic gold in my local theatre. Definite theatre movie. Definite DVD buy. I highly recommend it. It is an "adult" super hero movie, in a way that others have not been. And an amazing pick by the casting department and creators on the folks that borough those characters to life. The special effects were nothing short of brilliant. And...Im rambling. Please, if you enjoy comics, or even if you don't and you just want something different, this movie is something different.

		<fullReview>First things first - I have never had an Iron Man comic, I don't think - Iron Man is simply an incidental character in other comics I've read. Kind of like Marvel's Aquaman (although I have at least had some Aquaman comics from time to time). So I'm pretty unfamiliar with Iron Man's mythology, origin, supporting cast etc., and I'm therefore not in a position to say whether the movie is faithful to its origins or not. I'm simply approaching it as a generic super-hero movie.There is much to like in this film, although I came out entertained but not jazzed. Downey is great, the effects are mostly fine, Bridges is a very good duplicitous villain, the chemistry between Downey and Paltrow is good, and there are some nice moments in the script. And I was surprised to find it was 2 hours, it felt more like 90 minutes as it whizzed by.But it left me curiously unmoved, unengaged. I didn't care that much about these characters. On an overall entertainment level I would put it on a par with the FF movies, with the key distinction that the relationship between the FF meant that you did care about them. Not so here.Having said that, the "first night out" in the revamped suit is GREAT - really fun and exhilarating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of, if not the, best comic movie I've seen yet. The writing was extremely solid; no ridiculous lines or trying to make things flow when they don't (like that sentence). Special effects were stellar; they really upped the standard here- very realistic. Casting was very good for each of the roles; although Gwyneth Paltrow wasn't so very integral for her role (to me) she still did a good job. I thought the ending could be slightly improved but everyone else thinks I'm crazy for thinking that. Oh and they could have utilized the song better.Those who are fans of the original comic will be glad to see how close they try to remain to the original storyline (as close as they can for a movie). And those who never followed it will still be extremely entertained and pleased. It's the first big summer movie and a must see if you like good acting, writing, special effects, and action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no doubt Iron Man is an entertainment machine and a stunning one at that but it's a damn shame it takes so long and at so much expense to get there. Sure the pacing's not great and both the beginning and the end flitter with dodgy CGI and a underwhelming feel but there's no denying that the central parts of Iron man is the very best of marvel. It's lead man Robert Downey Jr. Who shines the most. He has just the right amount of dry Witt and charm to carry the film through even its patchiest moments.From Marvel Studios and Paramount Pictures comes Iron Man, an action-packed take on the tale of wealthy philanthropist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who develops an invulnerable robotic suit to fight the throes of evil. In addition to being filthy rich, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is also a genius inventor. When Stark is kidnapped and forced to build a diabolical weapon, he instead uses his intelligence and ingenuity to construct an indestructible suit of armor and escape his captors. Once free, Stark discovers a deadly conspiracy that could destabilize the entire globe, and dons his powerful new suit on a mission to stop the villains and save the world. Gwyneth Paltrow co-stars as his secretary, Virginia "Pepper" Potts, while Terrence Howard fills the role of Jim "Rhodey" Rhodes, one of Stark's colleagues, whose military background leads him to help in Whose military background leads him to help in the formation of the suit. Jon Favreau directs, with Marvel movie veterans Avi Arad and Kevin Feige producing. Paltrow provides some much needed flavour to the otherwise dry script and Terrance Howard adds to the humanity that is often forgotten in super-hero movies. Fortunately while Iron Man does deliver on the humanity level when needed it doesn't allow humanity and realism to bring down the overall fun of the film as it is in Spider-Man 3.Iron Man isn't perfect, it's riddled with ultimately forgivable flaws but flaws none the less. Flaws witch most of the world seems to be able to over look considering its high rating and a place on IMDb's Top #250. For some though the flaws are too huge to simply ignore. Most eyes remain of Downey Jr. Throughout the whole show and quite rightly so. He is charming, sophisticated and best of all very funny. Its clear he was the right choice for this role. The CGI is a tad strange, flitting from computer graphics reminiscent of the original spider-man all the way to last year's transformers, there often bad there mostly good.Not too light, not too dark? a bit grey, then? Not at all: this is buoyant, bright, a constant breeze. But still it hovers somewhere on the superhero-adapt spectrum between the good and the great. Not as flyweight as Fantastic Four or Daredevil or Ghost Rider, but just missing the myth-spinning splendor and heft of a Spidey 2 or X2 or Batman Begins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These morally compromised times all but demand that a morally compromised anti-hero be allowed to stand at their centre, and there are moments when an audience member is left to reflect that the alter-ego Tony Stark could almost have been specifically created for Robert Downey, Jr. He brings the full weight of his experience to bear on a part that seems almost to become like a second skin for him, at times. Not to imply that the task of assuming a dual identity should be viewed as a burden. Far from it. RDJ is clearly having fun with the chance to put his quirky sensibilities to use in more mainstream fare again, now that he is older and wiser. There are many who would have doubtless echoed the sentiment that he is "not the superhero type" when news of his enlistment first broke, but here he proves beyond any doubt that he fits this particular bill perfectly.Alloyed (geddit?!) to a couple of instances of fine casting, there is a story that surprisingly manages to successfully combine an almost fetishistic celebration of badass technology with the altogether simpler drama of human dilemma. We are given a mini robot war at the film's climax for example, that knocks the ENTIRETY of last year's "Transformers" squarely on its backside, and demonstrates deftly to Michael Bay the opportunity for emotional investment that he so obviously missed.This is a serving of pre-summer fun with a fair bit of heart behind the machinery. If you're after a blockbuster that boasts a respectable quota of acting talent to its name, then I think you'll find this is one confection knocked together that actually polishes up rather well! Like Iron Man itself, then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr. has deservedly been hailed as the star feature of Iron Man: he brings wit and warmth to the playboy entrepreneur-turned-superhero formula at the heart of this film, which would likely seem tired and clichéd without such a charismatic presence. Downey Jr. plays weapons manufacturer Tony Stark, owner of a vast fortune and an ego to match. After being captured in Afghanistan by a group of terrorists, Stark gets his first inkling of the misuse of the modern weaponry that he has helped to produce. To escape his captors and avenge the wrongdoing that he was witnessed first hand he draws upon his technical prowess and becomes a force for good: Iron Man.The opening scene, in which the Afghan terrorists suddenly seize Stark, is brutal and gripping. The subsequent flashbacks to Stark's nauseatingly opulent lifestyle in America form a startling contrast to the misery and fear of his imprisonment in an Afghan cave fort. The bold decision to set much of the action in the modern-day battleground of Afghanistan shows that director Jon Favreau is willing to engage directly with serious issues arising from modern warfare. It is disappointing that, from this early promise, Iron Man develops as a hit and miss action film that is unable to offer much in the way of meaningful commentary.Stark first appears as Iron Man when he escapes from his imprisonment in the cave and massacres his captors. This is a rudimentary action scene with few surprises. Other action scenes, including the final showdown with an evil Iron Man, have the same dull inevitability about them. It is only in the sequence involving Iron Man and the two jet fighter planes that the CGI and choreography combine to dazzling effect. The humour in this film is similarly patchy. The scene in which Stark's secretary (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) operates on his machine-aided heart is painfully funny. Like most of the humour, this scene owes much of its success to Downey Jr.'s personal charm. Elsewhere, the use of slapstick is far too predictable.Where Iron Man really falls down, however, is in the decision to dabble with serious issues such as terrorism and the arms trade whilst failing to offer any real insights. The Afghan enemies develop into hackneyed villains along the lines of the Nazis in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Jeff Bridges gives a darkly menacing performance as Obadiah Stane, Stark's crooked business partner, but is forced to chew his way through some clumsy lines, especially during their final confrontation. Iron Man, a film with some very strong elements, falls short in the effort to mix action, comedy and current affairs. This is an entertaining film but could have been so much more.</fullReview>

A man in an Iron suit didn't excite me (I have never read any Iron Man comic). And Robert Downey Jr. as a superhero????? It just doesn't fit. Then after few months came the second trailer. When I watched in you tube, well, this time it looked good. There were some really impressive visual effects.When the movie released, I waited for its reviews. So far the reviews were good. So I decided to see it. I am just back from the theater and I'm hell of impressed.The movie has everything a superhero movie needs. The style, the action, the visual effects and the story. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was just awesome. I really never thought he could do something like this. And definitely the dialogs, they had been awesome. I have never seen any superhero movie with that many excellent dialogs. Terence Howard, Gwyaneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges were good in their part. The direction has been really good. The style of story telling is really remarkable, a fast-paced stylish story with humorous dialogs to fill-in the gaps. Nice to see appearance of S.H.I.E.L.D in it. Hope to see more in the sequels.As a whole, it's a really enjoyable movie with a 40+ star as its lead.The music is good. So you get a 9star movie...........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I like Robert Downey Jr. He's a very versatile actor. Any role he is in is brilliant, (Heart and Souls being a favorite) and Iron Man is no exception. He delivers lines almost as if he were making them up as he went along. His playful banter with other characters and various machines and small bits of comedy make the film very enjoyable to watch, and the events surrounding his capture and the first half of the film hit too close to home, adding to the films realism. We get the small nods to the comic geeks (You know who you are, myself included) with a cameo by Stan "the Man' and even Rhodes making a reference to a War Machine suit that could be in his future. Plus on a personal note, it was good to see the Air Force (of which I am a member) was all over this film, we haven't had this much screen time in a movie since Stargate and the Transformers. Plus we're the good guys again, its nice to see it again, I hate when we're the bad guys; but then again I AM partial. Plus, the Air Force knows when to step in and when to let Iron Man kick a bad guys ass. But I digress?. This film is just what we needed to (1.) get the summer movie season off to a good start and (2.) restore our faith in Marvel comic movies. (Need I mention Ghost Rider, Elektra, Hulk,the Punisher, Blade:Trinity, Spiderman 3?need I go on?) It is good to see we can go beyond the normal heroes like Batman and Superman to someone who has real depth as Stark does, not because hes a superhero but because he is a screwed up person with many, many flaws. In him we see ourselves, messed up, making constant mistakes but for some reason we want to do good and will try the best we can to make right our wrongs. I can't wait for the next one. Also, stay for a bit more movie after all the end credits are over with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironic and enjoyable comic Marvel superhero film ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another year, another superhero film unleashed on the public mid-spring to begin the summer blockbusters hitting the cinema.For starters, I've never read any Marvel comic book, talk less of this particular one on which this film is based, so if you're expecting a review from a comic book fan, look elsewhere. But if you want to read a opinion from an everyday cinema goer, then continue reading.Acting: I felt the leading man was good in his role - he plays the deadpan, womanising and sardonic character well. The sort of hedonistic persona and charming he portrays as a weapons manufacturer works, even if his voice can seem a bit monotonous to me. Jeff Bridges' acting that really stole the show for me. He plays Obadiah, who at first is friendly towards Stark but then becomes horrified and greedy when Tony has a change of heart about his job and turns on him. I could tell he was clearly relishing the role and it's the first time I've seem him act as a 'baddie'. Utterly menacing and powerful. I thought Gwyneth Paltrow's acting as Peppa Potts was decent in places, like the banter between her and Tony but certain shouting from her towards the end during the climax came across as somewhat unbelievable. It doesn't help that the character feels quite cut-and-paste. The chemistry between Potts and Stark didn't ring true for me either - it felt unconvincing to me, and I felt more convinced by Downey Jr.'s acting in those scenes than hers. Terrence Howard was decent too, even if his character wasn't in that many scenes and felt generic.Pacing: Quite rushed to me. This is an introduction or origin story, but once the suit is built, it sort of looses it's way as it hurries to finish the film with a final fight climax. Individual scenes didn't seem to be completed in a satisfying way front my point of view and I felt like I was missing out on a longer scene -they quickly finished and moved on to the next. The action scenes in it were brief and not sustained for full enjoyment and the climax a disappointment, in my opinion. The very topical Afghanistan and the scenes where Stark is tied up and battles there do disturb but relate and update the story to today's world and conflicts which I thought was good.Cinematography: Well, I thought the special effects were terrific - the suit looked amazing on screen and photo-real and the flight scenes, if short, were soaring and fun to see. The robot-armed assistant in the lab was funny and sweet and the technology looked in ways possible, which speaking tech in the suit and lab.Music: Didn't find the score that memorable to me, but the music did heighten the mood in places but maybe another watch will make it more so, who knows? The rock songs did suit the high-flying, tongue-in-cheek and fun atmosphere of the film, though.Overall: An ironic film(in the sense that he's wounded by his own weapons, and his weapons are used against him in a sense etc), that's good and entertaining, if quite a hastened action film that has some snappy and deadpan chuckles here and there, amazing special effects and good acting mostly. Downey Jr. is an interesting, thoughtful and different superhero. Shame the battle at the end climax comes across as generic and it ends too soon, feeling too easily finished, but worth seeing I feel, if you like films of this genre - 6.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'd like to state that although I'm a comic books fan, I'm not that big on Iron Man; however, going to this movie completely exceeded my expectations.And what were they? Well, I looked forward to all the blockbuster trappings; big explosions, great special effects and since Robert Downey Jr. was in it (as well as some pretty decent actors) I assumed there'd be some _character_ in it as well. So far, even getting those things alone would have been worth the ticket price of admission.But the Iron Man movie went quite a bit further than that. The script for example was excellent - it used the normally rather boring origin part of a superhero's powers to actually both tell a story and advance the characters' points of view. We got to know Tony Stark in the process of him getting his armor - while, for example, Peter Parker being bitten by that spider gave us no insights on him.The humoristic elements similarly worked very well, dancing that line between slapstick and the movie taking itself too seriously. As bonus elements, 'real' (alright, for a comic book movie) engineering issues were more than referenced, they were true plot points - such as what portable power source could be adequate for such an energy-sucking armor, how extreme temperatures could affect its performance, or of course the obvious - how much does it weigh, and how could that be a problem in practical situations such as landing on a rooftop? I'm really happy this movie did well. We NEED to reward projects put together with such obvious enthusiasm for the material, or the studios come to think they can put any ol' crap with some special effects and a hot babe (I'm looking at you, Transformers!) and we'll go see it regardless. 10/10 from me for the best superhero movie made so far. Looking forward for the now inevitable sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moderately entertaining, but not much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good superhero movie, but I'm more than a little shocked at the insanely good reviews it's gotten. Perhaps I'm just getting sick of the superhero movie formula, at least the initial installments of them. Same old same old, really. The only real positive element of the movie is Robert Downey Jr., who plays himself as he pretty much always does. If you don't like the actor, you'll find the movie torturous. I love him, personally, and was happy enough watching him do his thing with a few big action sequences adding some spice. And you've got to appreciate the casting of Jeff "the Dude" Bridges as a super villain (kind of a spoiler, I suppose, but if you don't see that coming you're a bonehead). Favreau finds a way to make Bridges enormous and intimidating in every shot, even while riding a Segway, which is a triumph of some sort. But, really, what does Iron Man provide that no other superhero movie has before? I certainly don't see it. The character is actually pretty boring, as are all the supporting characters. Are we now raving merely because of competency?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is a one-two punch. It hits you with a great, imaginative story in the beginning and then turns into a action flick with many surprises and great dialogue. I know a lot of people say Downey is great, but he's more than great.....he IS Iron Man. The film's great direction, great dialogue(especially between Tony and Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow)) and a great comedic wit. The jokes went perfect and the crowd got the jokes and laughed. The action sequences generated the most "ooh" and "aah"'s. The acts are all great, the first was generally story and his great escape with the Mark I. The second act was him coming home and working on the Iron Man. And the third, I might not even spoil it. Just watch the trailer before you leave, get there hyped and you'll enjoy it a lot. And be sure to stay after the credits, that will leave you satisfied. This movie is flawless. Overall- 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Downey Jr. to the Rescue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the minute I saw the trailer back the summer for Iron Man, I was one of the few people that said that it was not going to be a good movie. People kept saying that I was crazy and that Iron Man was going to be the best movie of the summer blah blah blah. Well, I have just got back from seeing Iron Man and I can honestly say that it was better than I expected, but not by much.I believe that mostly everybody knows the story so I will save myself the trouble of giving a plot synopsis. But, in short, Tony Stark (played greatly by Robert Downey Jr.) is captured after being attacked by a group of violent Middle Eastern fighters. When he comes to the realization that the weapons used to capture him and kill the other American soldiers were weapons from his cooperation, he realizes that he has had his eyes closed the entire time and has finally opened them to see the evils behind his family business.Now this is probably the first comic book adaptation to have a very credible cast, and that goes to show that big names don't always make the best movies. The only rightfully cast actor in this entire film is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. He plays it as if he is playing himself and fits perfectly into the character of Stark. Terrence Howard is second billed but his character is thrown around and pops up pretty randomly throughout the film. Gwyenth Paltrow is in probably a good 3/4 of the film and is annoying every time she appears on screen. Plus, her name is Pepper Potts. If that were my name, I would probably kill myself. Finally, the worst casting possible, Jeff Bridges as Obidiah Stane, the villain. Not only is his name a killer, but Bridges' acting is some of the worst I have seen in years. He does not fit into the roll at all and the bald cap that is used to try and replicate his character from the comics just makes Bridges look like a fool and he eventually becomes the laughing stock of the entire film. Also, whenever he was on screen about to give a speech I was just waiting for him to say, "I'm the Dude." I went to see this film with a group of 15 friends and I can bet you that every single one of those friends came to see Iron Man because they expected an action movie. Well, I can say that about 3 of those 15 said that they enjoyed the film and the remaining 12 complained that there wasn't enough action. Now I am not saying that I am disappointed with the amount of action that is in the film, I am saying that the action that was included in the film was not only dull, but terribly boring. In truth, the best scenes in the film were the cheesy comedic scenes, or the scenes where Stark is testing the parts of his suits. It just goes to show that director Jon Favreau is much better with comedies (Elf, Swingers) since the action in an action-superhero movie was worse than the comedic parts.All in all, Iron Man is not a bad movie but nor is it a good movie. It is just another film; another hugely anticipated popcorn movie that will go on to earn hundreds of millions of dollars. Just like the last Spiderman, 90% of the people that view Iron Man may come out hating it, but this will definitely be one of the highest grossing movies of the year just because of all the publicity and the audience appeal. The film is not nearly as good as Spiderman or Spiderman 2, X-2, or Batman Begins but is definitely better than Hulk and Daredevil. Therefore, that throws Iron Man right into the middle of the Marvel film package, and due to the cliffhanger ending (stay till the end of the credits) there will definitely be an Iron Man 2 on the way. And whether that one proves to be better than this one, that won't truly be saying much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... is the word that describes the movie. The plot is simple but current and establishes moral responsibility. Just remember that it is a movie based on a comic book so just open up your mind, strap on and step into the world of Tony Stark as he transforms into the totally cool Iron Man. Robert Downey is the perfect actor to play Tony Startk and even gave him a sarcastically funny persona (which I hardly notice in the comic books - but hey I'm not an avid reader of Iron Man so there...). I thought Gwyneth's performance would affect the movie but boy I was wrong. She did just right. I can't say the same for Terence Howard though... he didn't seem authoritative enough - even looked like a military lap dog of Tony Stark. And Jeff Bridges playing Obediah - brilliant! Awesome CGI, awesome sound track, great cast, makes for a great start of this movie's trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of a fun adventure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Telling the story of Tony Stark, billionaire playboy that goes from selling weapons to becoming a superhero, using an ultra-advanced robotic armor. First of all, a lot of people are calling this the best superhero movie ever made. Those people are idiots. What we have here is a lighter approach to the superhero genre. One might put it next to the Fantastic Four movies, rather than X-Men. And why not? Afterall, it doesn't have racism and prejudice as its underlying theme. It's a simple, light, fun and funny movie. It's so well received and reviewed BECAUSE it's in the FF category. But it's head and shoulders above those movies. The script, though predictable and fairly simplistic, is actually coherent. The movie actually has a director and Downey Jr. delivers a very good performance. Without a doubt, that was pitch-perfect casting. Now, it's only fair to judge Iron Man for what it tries to be - a light action movie. And it accomplishes what it set out to do. Simple origin story and a first adventure. Not as complex and dramatic as Batman Begins, but it does the job. And, like Batman Begins, there's a feeling you just can't shake for the first hour or so - yeah, the movie's good, but you just wanna see the hero in the suit - THE suit. The iconic suit(cape and cowl and, respectively, gold and red). You feel like the movie drags. And it does. The action is sparse, but fairly well done, with the help of some very good visuals. But the funny little lines, the development of the suit, it all keeps you distracted enough until the climax. Then, the action delivers. But still, just like the Fantastic Four movies(particularly the first one), it feels rushed and it lacks that sense of an epic confrontation. But at least he isn't lifting a huge rock into space... So, there's humor, there's action, there's an actual story. It's as good as it gets...for this type of movie. Best superhero movie ever made? Not even close. It doesn't hold a candle to the likes of Batman Begins and X2. But its saving grace is that it doesn't try to. Its strong point is the lightheartedness, its humor - it's the first big blockbuster that made me laugh out loud since Spider-Man 3(the difference being that I was then laughing AT it). It is, however, the best superhero movie since Batman Begins and a fine way to kick off the summer movie season. Let's hope that for the sequels, they keep the direction. I'm not sure that a darker, more serious Iron Man would work as well as this...unless you're turning him into a fascist, as in the comics. In the end, I enjoyed Iron Man. Quite a lot, to be honest. Here's to a great sequel.</fullReview>

I will happily see this movie again as well as buying the DVD when it is available.I would happily pay to see RD Jr. as Ironman in at least 2 more movies. He seems born to play the character of Tony Stark. I hope that he has his personal demons under control finally and is ready to step up as the great actor we all saw so much potential in years ago.The rest of the cast is well chosen and turns in laudable performances. But they have a big shadow to stand in, namely, the Ironman suit! You can tell this was a work of love for the special effects folks and this is exactly the sort of thing that the current generation of CG can do so very well.

I think the rest of the cast was good, but lets face it Downey, Jr. couldn't be out shined. Except maybe by the man behind the camera... Jon Favreau. I'd like to give Jon Favreau a round of applause. He has my utter and complete respect, and now after seeing this film, devotion. I saw him in a panel at Comic-Con maybe 2 years back and he had said that he wanted to have the least amount of CGI possible, and if it could be built then he would have it built, but he would keep the CG down to only that which was necessary. And I have to say that totally showed in this film. I think that more movies should take a note from Favreau and don't use CGI so fiercely. Hats off to Jon Favreau, and lets give him more work shall we? Captain America, please? Well needless to say this film was excellent. As of right now it may very well be my favorite superhero film. oh and if you are a comic book fan, stick around after the credits, you will get a little surprise that may have you as excited about the future as it has me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Iron-Core Marvel Comics Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have seen many of the Marvel Comics adaptation today, ranging from Spider-Man to Hulk and The Punisher. But this is a worthy and a really different adaptation that separates Iron Man from the rest of the heroes.Iron Man is the story of Tony Stark, a playboy millionaire, who gets captured by an Afghanistan terrorist group while selling his new missile. When in captivity, he builds a new body armor to get back at the people who caught him. After escaping, he gets his idea of building a better Iron suit to protect the people and change everything in his company. The story is really well kept on the narrative, and it has the interest going on at a fast pace.Robert Downey Jr has a fantastic role. His rendition of Tony Stark is just the right thing in place for the film. A character who is living on the edge and out of control, but has his heart in the right place. Also a great act is Jeff Bridges who is the villain of the film, gives a nutty performance too. As for Gyweneth Paltrow playing Pepper Potts and Terrence Howard as Jim Rhodes, Tony Stark's best friend, make up for really good supporting performances. The casting is perfect and couldn't have been any better.The other details you would specially look out for are the VFX, cause everything is super-cool and well detailed. The action sequences are clever and engaging, never letting it fall through the movie. The story will also strike to you as a well inspired from comic books and modern day tales. This is really a great movie.Even if you feel that the first half is slow, it's an origin story. And the second half is of course the main attraction. You may even like the way it ends.I give it a really good 9 out of 10. This is a movie like Batman Begins or Robocop, it is going to be great and big.Go Iron Man</fullReview>

Robert Downey is absolutely perfect for this role. He adds the necessary humor lacking in previous superhero-movies (apart from Spider-Man, which, to me, is aimed at a different audience). Besides Downey the best addition to the cast is Jeff Bridges! He really shines as the unscrupulous arms-dealer Obadiah Stane! I'm really looking forward to the sequel rumored to be featuring War Machine (there is a small hint in this movie as well!).P.S.For those of you wondering about the (dis)appearance of Sam Jackson in the movie: please stay in your seats and wait until the end-credits stop rolling!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW!!!!!! What a film, seriously, this is one of the best superhero/comic book films of all time. I wasn't a big fan of Robert Downey Jr., but now that I've seen this really good entertainment, I feel like I'm his agent. Here is the plot summary: Weapons designer Tony Stark is in Afghanistan to introduce his newly created missile design, "The Jericho", to the United States Air Force when the unit he is traveling with is attacked by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings. Stark is then taken hostage after he is injured by a piece of shrapnel embedded near his heart. He is ordered by his captors to assemble a weapon for them and is given access to a workshop. With the aid of a fellow captive Yinsen, he puts his creativity to use instead by assembling a bulletproof suit of power armor, complete with pacemaker and flamethrowers, and uses it to free himself.Back in the United States, Stark begins to reject his own company's sale of munitions to the Middle East seeing his weapons end up in the hands of terrorists and murderers. He publicly denounces the weapons industry in general as being one completely lacking in accountability, causing Stark Enterprises' stock to drop drastically. Seeking to stop this, his business partner, Obadiah Stane, seeks to remove Tony Stark as CEO of the company in order to avoid further losses. In the meantime, Stark develops an advanced model of the flying suit he built while in captivity, complete with advanced weapon and flying capabilities. At the same time, Stane steals plans for Stark's first suit of armour and builds his own version with the intent of killing Stark. Stark eventually faces off against the villainous Obadiah Stane, defeating him with the help of Jim Rhodes and Pepper Potts.After the film's closing credits, Tony Stark returns home to find Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of S.H.I.E.L.D., waiting in his Malibu house, asking him if he knows about the "Avengers initiative".Tony was awesome, you'll get to laugh every 5 minutes or something. I expected more than action than drama, but that how Iron Man is (you have to see how he creates his armour and stuff). Seriously this could be the best blockbuster of the summer. Go out see this film.Tony Stark: Yeah, I can fly.I give Iron Man a 9.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I typically don't take the time to write something like this, but I can make an exception for Iron Man. I am a huge comic book fan, and so far many of the comic book movies have fallen somewhere between mediocre and downright crap. There are exceptions to this rule (Spiderman 1&amp;2, X-Men 1&amp;2, Batman Begins), but Iron Man dominates them all. Downey does an amazing job of portraying the character of Tony Stark and he delivers one liners like no one else can. The composition and editing in the movie is perfect and the pace felt spot on. On top of all this, the visuals and music were the best I've seen and heard yet.Let me put this in perspective for you: my girlfriend fell asleep during Batman Begins and she thought the Spiderman series was "ok." She loved Iron Man though and has recommended it to everyone she knows. For a girly girl like her and a comic book nerd like myself to enjoy it, it must be amazing ;).</fullReview>

I'm a big Robert Downey Jr. fan and if not for his presence, I probably would've ignored it. I didn't like it as much as most people, but it was fairly entertaining (and that's what I was expecting after all, we're not talking about groundbreaking film-making here and I don't think anybody expects that from this, right?) and that's mostly thanks to Downey Jr., one of the coolest actors out there, a chameleon who can play pretty much everything. Adding to the "cool" aspect of the movie, Jeff Bridges plays the villain. I'm glad that the long, dark phase of drug abuse Downey Jr. was living some years ago is over, and the man is alive and kicking to continue delighting audiences. Plus, "Iron Man" will introduce him to a whole new generation. Don't expect much and enjoy the ride; better a summer flick with Robert Downey Jr. than a dozen Michael Bays starring bland new "stars" and tanned Angelina Jolie wannabes. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is Iron Man anyway? Can we really call him a superhero? As far as I can tell, he's just a guy with a bum heart that happens to be pretty handy in the shop. His superhero development falls more in line with Batman's as neither necessarily has any special power (Wait, my bat-sense is tingling?) but rather relies on strength and gadgetry to get the job done. Even Batman has the dark history to fuel his passion though. What does Iron Man have? His day job is as an arms manufacturing tycoon named Tony Stark. He's got all the money in the world, women throwing themselves at him and the worst part is, he inherited everything from his dad. This silver spoon baby has been set his whole life and now he gets to be admired and adored as a superhero too? Ordinarily, I would give in to my jealousy and scoff at this supposed superhero but Robert Downey Jr., under the fresh direction of Jon Favreau, just makes him too damn cool for me to do anything other than love him.Aside from all this, Iron Man is also hilarious. Make no mistake; he most certainly gets himself into a number of perilous scenarios but he also manages to find something to laugh at no matter how dire the circumstances. While the original comic book found Stark in some life threatening Vietnam war situation (I am not a comic book junkie so I'm afraid I can't get more specific than that), Favreau wanted today's Iron Man to have a contemporary back story and what could be more appropriate than Stark being held prisoner in Osama Bin Laden's former hood, the mountains of Afghanistan. At first, it feels all too easy to place Arab militants as the face of the bad guys but the film vindicates its initial racial vilifying by exposing Stark himself (and therefore, America) as the supplier of these terrorists' entire arsenal. It is Stark's realization that he truly is one of the great mass murderers in American history that wakes him from his comfortable, privileged existence to a new dawn of using his position for positive change. After all, a weapon is only truly a weapon when it is in the wrong hands.IRON MAN is not without its clichés. Stark suffers injuries in the Middle East that requires him to have some form of electro-magnetic contraption lodged in his chest so that little bits of shrapnel don't seep into his blood stream and eventually cut up the arteries in his heart. So what if the ultimate playboy/loner now needs help to sustain a healthy heartbeat when he has walked around for so long acting like he never had a heart in the first place. So what if the man who has everything doesn't truly have anything of real value. These kinds of truisms are the foundation of comic book characters; what genuinely matters is how the men are portrayed and Downey Jr. was born to play to Tony Stark. After rising to critical fame with films like CHAPLIN, personal problems with drug abuse led Downey to years of type casting as characters with drug problems in films like WONDER BOYS and THE SCANNER DARKLY. With IRON MAN, it looks like he might finally be able to wipe his past clean and achieve the heights his talent has always warranted. Though his body is in noticeably better shape, it is his quick-witted delivery and cynical yet sympathetic duality that make Tony Stark the kind of guy everyone wants to hang out with or just plain be. So, what is Iron Man anyway? Well, according to this adaptation, he is the superhero for the modern era. He is sarcastic and skeptical but still hopeful and genuine with those he is close with (most notably, his perfectly matched assistant Pepper Potts, played just as delectably by Gwyneth Paltrow). He is a man who is capable of admitting his failures, not dwelling on them and then fostering a new path for himself. He is the kind of man that is both envied and looked up to. He is building himself a reputation as a superhero that can manage tremendous feats through intelligence and perseverance rather than just brawn and dumb luck. And now, IRON MAN is also a movie that offers perspective on the world around us at the same time as some awesome exhilaration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Great, all that's on is Iron Man." I said to my friend. We had missed the show time for the movie I had wanted to see. Upon first seeing a trailer for Iron Man I had low expectations. Just another poorly made comic book adaptation. It will be full of poor acting, crappy computer effects, and lots of action to overcome the lack of writing. Boy, I was wrong. Iron Man completely blew my expectations out of the water. Through the impeccable choice of characters, well placed action, and great mix of CGI: this summer's greatest action movie Iron Man is sure to please.Robert Downey Jr. is a hell of an actor. If not for him I am not sure I would have made it through Iron Man. It is rare that you find an actor that fits a role so well you forget he is an actor and think of him almost exclusively as the character. That is exactly what Downey brings to this movie. "Is it better to be feared or respected? And I'd say is it too much to ask for both?" and "They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I prefer the weapon you only need to fire once. That's how dad did it, that's how America does it, and it's worked out pretty well so far." These lines are delivered so genuinely and uniquely by Downey, you can't help but develop a relationship with his character Tony Stark that last throughout the movie.Often times when a screenplay writer can't write a good plot and can't write convincing dialog, they add copious amounts of action. Somehow, they have conceived the notion that if we are overwhelmed with action we won't notice how bad the movie is. However the audience is becoming smarter and no longer easily duped by such tactics. Iron Man did not resort to this. There is action in Iron Man, lots of action. But it is very well written and weaved perfectly into the story so as to enhance it. Iron man starts out with an attention grabbing fight scene. This is followed by many minutes without a giant fire fight where we get to know our protagonist; we bond with him and empathize with him. From then on the action and fight scenes are used sparingly till we arrive at the final fight scene between the protagonist and the antagonist.Several great advances have come to the movie industry from computer technology. One of these is computer generated imagery (CGI). CGI has allowed directors and writers to add elements to movies that were once though to be impossible, either due to price or far fetched ness. One complaint audiences usually voice is that is it too unrealistic. Not the case with Iron Man. The limited CGI use complements the movie well. Iit allows the viewer to vividly see exactly what the director and writers wanted you to see. All of this was accomplished without being annoying and causing the audience to be distracted by the effects.It is rare that a really good action movie based on a comic book comes along. Iron Man is one of those movies. Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post writes that it is full of generic fireballs and that some of the actors need to be cleaned up to make it as a sequel. I disagree. This summer's greatest action movie Iron Man is sure to please through the impeccable choice of characters, well placed action, and great mix of CGI. On a scale of five stars, I would give Iron Man five stars. I enjoyed this action movie so much I might have even paid for it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dint match up to the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the movie was getting very good reviews as the days went by after its release. i ignored them for couple of weeks. then finally having nothing to do with my evening, i went to see the movie that was making some serious dough at the box office. it was a visual treat but it fell short of my expectations. a millionaire playboy turning into a hero, couldn't go well with me. i mean batman is portrayed more human and vulnerable, makes him such a likable character. i missed that connection in ironman. in case of spiderman, i was right in the movie. after all that story buildup in the first half, the 2nd half lets itself down with a little too less to show. the only best part of the movie was Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts. she is beautiful and has suitably played her role as pepper. she is this serious-business secretary in a moment, and a romantic seductress in another. this subtlety of character change dint happen so well with Robert Downey as ironman or tony stark... the robotics and the flying sequences are very well made. liked them a lot. the key is not to be too critical in order to enjoy this movie.may be i will watch it again to soak in all the visual splendor this movie has to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has been billed as a smarter, tighter super hero movie. It's not. It's entertaining, and has all the special effects one takes for granted, but it is still riddled with the same old clichés expected from the genre. I had hoped that the movie would stay more in Afghanistan - anywhere but Calipornia - but it gets bogged down as soon as Iron Man does his one piece of obligatory super hero rescuing the average guys from evildoers, and returns to the usual (yawn) struggle with evil corporate magnates determined to make more money and stoke the ego incarnate.The audience I saw it with clapped and cheered and laughed, and I take it that the average movie goer joe is happy with being treated once again to mindless escapism for the summer. My grandkids liked it, and what else can one ask from Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VERY well done! This is even GRITTY! Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to ask ... Who better to play a middle-aged, wrung-out, loser than Robert Downey, Jr.? I say that with the utmost fondness, however, as I loved the IronMan comics as a kid, and I've never minded Robert Downey, Jr. as an actor. But in this role, he seems to have found his niche. I hope this run lasts for YEARS and gives Downey the inner Zen he needs to finish out his career with some pride.Going back to the origins, as in "Batman Begins," and a plethora of other comic book-to-movie lines (Check out upcoming X-Men "Origins" movies, "Wolverine," and "Magneto."), seems to be the best formula for launching a new franchise, or breathing new life into a dead one. It certainly worked for Batman and Spiderman, and I'm sure it will work with audiences this time, even though IronMan is a "lesser" character who usually stands in the background vying for his 15 seconds of screen time. I am happy to say that Downey and a respectable budget resolves that condition and elevates this franchise to something more desirable and far more reverent than many other comic book attempts on film.Downey really seems to connect with this character, and Gwyneth Paltrow is so funny as Pepper Potts. Yes, she's sexy, too, but she's FUNNY and so is Downey. I do believe audiences the world over will subscribe to this newly resurrected Marvel superhero in that he is completely human. You get Tony Stark, warts and all, and Downey plays him that way. He comes off so at ease in this part that it seems he was engineered specifically for this role.All in all? It may be a little too risqu?© (in places) and violent (in others) for the kiddies, but the rest of humanity should LOVE it. It is gritty and holds some thread of reality, which weaves itself throughout, although I must say that the finale is a bit tepid. It left something to be desired in the big finish and felt a tad anticlimactic. Still awesome, though.And the toys ... there are loads of gadgets, toys, and comfortably spun one-liners. This is a story-driven, blockbuster-y , KABOOM flick with very little popcorn-ery to be had, although this IS an effects BLOW OUT of a comic book flick! It features a slick production style, top notch film quality, and a superb screen play. This superhero endeavor seems to be the birth of a new (and great) franchise, and I certainly hope it will not be the last. Indeed, there are hints as to another story line for a possible sequel. Did you notice?It rates an 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I AM IRON MAN...tara tarara tararara tara rara...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a casual reader of comic books so definitely I'm not the biggest fan of the Marvel world and I don't know all the details of every Marvel story. Anyway, I do like a lot superheroes and of course their enemies (sometimes even more) but definitely Iron Man is not my favourite, probably is Spider-Man. But since I knew that they were making this film I was kind of exciting, of course for the cast too, about it and for me it was really quick it's release. The fact that it doesn't have the big publicity of films like "Spider-Man 3" or the upcoming "The Dark Knight" (even "Speed Racer" in those days has a bigger publicity with all kind of products), was also good but even with less publicity they just make a good damn thing for their business making it's release today, the day of the children in Mexico and also selling the fact that in the US it doesn't opens until the next Friday. So here I'm writing about it just after returning from the theater after enjoyed a lot this great picture.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is just a genius of technology but also a bastard. He is the ultimate designer of weapons and his company is really powerful but dealing with this kind of clients will be always dangerous. Suddenly he reborn, finally opening his eyes and waking up from a dream full of parties, women and power to realize that he was providing amazing technology to the wrong persons. He is IRON MAN. That story about the present situation with the war is really good having in Stark the kind of businessman who never cares about anything but his company's interests. Definitely this background is not important for a child but of course there is great action and great visuals. And there are many funny things especially for a really cool Downey Jr. and his character's attitude before his experiences with the terrorists. Talking about the cast, I think Downey Jr. is really good for the main role as Stark and as Iron Man, well anybody could look really cool with a suit like that. The Dude, Jeff Bridges, is also a good villain and the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow is just perfect in all the ways.Conclusion: "Iron Man" is a great pre-summer film, for me much better than the recent Marvel adaptations. I loved the trailer for Black Sabbath's Iron Man and here the closing titles are just terrific (Back in Black is also great but some other music in the film is not) but damn I didn't wait until the very end (but definitely I could watch it again) and now I know that Samuel L. Jackson is also here. F*ck right now I hate him mostly because his story with Troma but that's another story. Anyway I really enjoyed this film and of course I'm ready for the next chapter, maybe the second of 15. It's only the decision of the studio because Downey Jr. is more than ready!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not super enough...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is the first feature to be made entirely by Marvel ? a gamble which has paid off to the tune of over $350 million worldwide so far. For a non-sequel from a fledgling company that is impressive and bodes well for Marvel's reboot of The Incredible Hulk ? due in June. Comic book films are big money spinners now but the success of a new series is predicated on the entertainment value of the central character ? and in this way Hulk and Tony Stark have similar problems. They just aren't super enough...Iron Man starts with an unnecessary flashback structure, presumably to ensure some loud action in the first minute or two. Tony Stark (played with now-familiar post-rehab gusto by Robert Downey Jnr.) is the embodiment of the capitalistic, jingoistic American ideal. He has become absurdly rich designing weapons and, more significantly, has no moral qualms whatsoever about the negative effects of his work. Stark is not a nice man. Except he is. This potentially realistic and complex dualistic behaviour is lost in the film's failure to choose sides, leading us to the first of many problems; what are we, the audience, supposed to think of Tony Stark? He is presented as bright and brilliant; a charming man of the people but also as a womaniser and a warlord. This initial confusion is nothing compared to what happens later on. After a brush with death and a subsequent escape (which is accomplished in an ultra-violent fashion) he holds a hippie press conference and vows to stop making weapons for good.This turnaround is simply too fast and, as presented by Downey Jnr. with his usual twinkly-eyed glazed look, has none of the power or angst we have come to expect from comic book origin stories. His parents are not murdered before his eyes, nor is his home world destroyed. He comes across as a petulant child who is bored with his old toys. Instead of using his money to work for peace or help starving children he creates a powered battle suit and flies around the world blowing things up. Exactly how this is 'protecting the people he put in harm's way' is slightly beyond me. And the hypocrisy of the double standard is appalling ? it is only when Stark realises that (Shock! Horror!) his weapons might be used against American troops that he begins to examine his conscience.Don't get the wrong idea, there is nothing particularly obnoxious about Iron Man. The performances are light and breezy and the script is a cut about the blockbuster norm; littered as it is with a particularly dry sense of humour. The central performance from Robert Downey Jnr. is the film's saving grace but also its' Achilles heel. His presence is enjoyable on the one hand but, in my opinion, also detracts from the credibility of the whole endeavour. You keep expecting him to wink to camera and finally admit it is some kind of extravagant Saturday Night Live parody. That Jeff Bridges is really being played by Will Ferrell and Terrence Howard is actually just a cardboard cutout. I still don't get Terrance Howard. I've yet to see him raise a palpable, or even guessable, emotion in his roles ? his face seems oddly expressionless and his voice almost unbearable. He gets some good lines in this film but sounds like he's reading them from an auto cue. But I digress. As once off summer entertainment this kind of self aware film-making is bearable but I simply can't see the film becoming a much loved classic in the future.So, what does the film have going for it? The special effects are impressive, with the integration of cg and live action especially so. The set pieces, when they come, run the gamut from mundane to genuinely thrilling. Stark's armoured escape from captivity is surprisingly dull while some of the later aerial combat sequences are exciting. Once again though, the use of sfx has positive and negative effects, particularly in relation to the ending. The final confrontation has become a serious problem for the superhero film. In days of yore, special effects were difficult, so typically the best the film had to offer was saved for the ending. Now, every scene is liberally slathered with computer generated gunk. The result is explosive fatigue, a run of overpowering sequences which forgo actual affect for special effect. A dozen astonishingly well-rendered high octane scenes does not create a cumulative effect. If the same level of frankly awe-inspiring cg work is applied to the hero designing and dressing in his suit then what is left for the audience to look forward to. What makes a special effect special these days? The ending of Iron Man is another clunky computer-aided brawl, where narrative is suspended for minutes at a time while increasingly unrealistic pieces of metal and flesh beat on each other. This moment is reminiscent of a dozen other recent movie resolutions: from Hellboy to The Matrix Revolutions, all equally dull. Without vicarious involvement ? a sense that a character we can identify with is in danger ? it just amounts to so many polygons.Perhaps I've been a little harsh on Iron Man. I can't honestly say I was bored by the experience but I do feel its' major mis-steps are a symptom of a greater malaise at the heart of contemporary blockbuster cinema. If, however, your cynicism has not quite reached the pathological degree mine has you could well have some fun with Iron Man. Robert Downey Jnr., Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow are amiable enough company (even if the latter seems as though an errant puff of wind would shatter her into a million pieces) and the director, Jon Favreau, keeps things moving at a reasonable pace. Stark's character arc is minimal (more of a character stroll really) but his near trademarked delivery of PG-13 witticisms should be enough to hold your attention. Just.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The playboy wolf and genius Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the successful CIO of the Stark Industries, a weapon company founded by his father. His second in command is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who worked with his father, and his loyal and professional secretary is Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who has a crush on Tony. While in Afghnistan to demonstrate the ultimate Jericho missile developed by his company, his military convoy is attacked and Tony is seriously wounded on his chest and kidnapped by a group of rebels that wants him to assemble a missile for their use. Tony stays with his abductors for three months and develops a powerful metallic armor to escape from the cave where he is arrested. He decides to stop manufacturing weapons in his company under the protest of Obadiah, and dedicates his time to improve the armor, manufacturing it with gold and titanium and installing a propulsion system to fly. However, Pepper discovers that Tony was betrayed by Obadiah, who is using Tony's data to build prototype armor for him, transforming it in the ultimate weapon."Iron Man" is an entertaining adventure, with great special effects and good and funny story, and nothing else. However, the User Rating of Top 250: #192 is absolutely overrated and offensive to the great movies of the cinema history. The IMDb formula may indicate the movies with massive votes and high rating but never the greatest movies of the cinema industry. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Homem de Ferro" ("Iron Man")</fullReview>

He was amazing. I normally don't like these kinds of movies and wouldn't have gone to it if I hadn't known someone who was an extra, but I am so glad I did. Jeff Bridges was so good, I'm having a hard time with him being bald, but it was a good move. My only complaint, was Gwyenth Paltrow. She was horrible, it was like she was really trying to play the part, she half-you know. But other than that it was great. Special effects, whoa.Good job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Iron with a Bit of Rust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2008 the Marvel Cinematic Universe exploded on the scene and, along with Batman Begins, resurrected the genre, as well as Robert Downey, Jr.'s career. In fact, RDJ is the absolute perfect person to play a wealthy, drunken, playboy, cavalier, and talented celebrity who sobers up both literally and takes responsibility for his actions in a complex world because, well, that's kind of what his real life was like.Jeff Bridges, per the usual, does an excellent job at not phoning in his performance and once again shows his range as an actor as he did in movies like Seabiscuit, The Big Lebowski, and (especially) True Grit. It's hard to compare any of these previous roles to this current role as Tony Stark's (Downey) business partner Obadiah Stane. Public gaffes and reputation aside, Gwyneth Paltrow demonstrates quite a bit of chemistry as Pepper Potts, Stark's do-it-all assistant.Iron Man does an excellent job of developing Tony Stark's conscience as the facade of his desire to protect the nation collapses around him and transforms him into the Iron Man who can't seem to trust anyone but Pepper and military liaison "Rhodey" (Terrence Howard).The film does come off as a bit rusty, in that the villain wants no more than money and power, which sounds generic, but based on what I know fits in with the source material. Anyway, without giving much away, the villain does a great job acting and adapting with the plot developments, and in the end this bit of rust gives the movie character, just as rust does to any well-aged structure. And nearly a decade after release, Iron Man sure has aged well, possibly better than any film in the MCU, and therefore is a classic superhero movie that does just enough to earn 4 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

Robert Downey Jr is a genius but is a little selfish. He make weapon for peace, but he know his weapon is used by terrorism, and his enemy imitates his technology.

		<shortDescription>The amazing beginning of a Cinematic Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2008, the term 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' was unknown. Nowadays, the MCU is the biggest franchise in the film industry and rightfully so as Marvel Studios has consistently delivered quality superhero films time and time again. Many of which have featured characters that no one ever expected to become superhero icons. First off was 'Iron Man', directed by Jon Favreau. The MCU has definitely come a long way since then but this still stands as one of the franchise's finest efforts. Robert Downey Jr., in what would become his career comeback role, is perfectly cast as Tony Stark AKA 'Iron Man' and is backed by an excellent supporting cast. And the film gives him an excellent origin story that is actually fairly contained compared to future films in the franchise. And of course, it all ends with the first of what would become a trademark of the franchise; the post-credit scene. In this case, it's Samuel L. Jackson talking to Tony about the 'Avengers Initiative'. And that's how the MCU all got started.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can't really rewatch any of the Marvel movies without seeing them in the context of the larger cinematic grand scheme. Upgrades, expansions and awkward missteps are constantly in the back of your min while you're watching any one film. So how does "Iron Man" stack up after eight years of universe-building? Pretty damn well, actually.It's a terrific blend of origin and redemption stories, resting on the shoulders of Robert Downey Jr. (ideal casting), but there's also a great feeling of invention to the movie; whether Tony Stark's in a cave or in a lab, it's fun to watch him work. And the armor's got a great robotic look to it. It'll be tweaked along the way - but even here, it looks cool.It's not without weaknesses - Don Cheadle turned out to be a welcome replacement for Terrence Howard - but on the other hand, the sequel antagonists also haven't compared to Jeff Bridges. It's also not a glorified commercial for the next entry (surprisingly refreshing). This is my favorite Marvel movie for good reason. It looks great, the character arc is solid and it's a testament to how well a foundation can be laid.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that started an evolution of movie franchises.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the most important superhero movies because it launched a franchise that would inspire a lot of other franchises to expand to cinematic universes. This started MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).If not the first cinematic universe, it's definitely the one that popularized the idea. But through the movie it doesn't even seem like it's setting up something big and that's why the story has space to breathe which is a great thing. It has a lesser- known Marvel hero because Marvel has sold out their most popular heroes at that time. Spider-Man to Sony, X-Men and Fantastic Four to Fox etc. It also stars Robert Downey Jr., who sank really deep down at that time so there wasn't as much of a possibility for this movie to succeed, but they definitely tried and when the movie came out, the tables were turned. Robert Downey Jr. redeemed himself as the charismatic and witty scientist Tony Stark. He shines in the role and it seems like it was created just for him and no one else because trust me, after him, you will never be able to see anyone else as Tony Stark. The plot is typical for a superhero origin movie, but it's done in such a good way that it keeps you very interested. Jeff Bridges is very good as the villain in this movie and he's the second biggest star of the movie. After Downey, of course. It does include a little bit of foreshadowing, but it's nothing to distract you from the plot and those who are not familiar with the source material won't even notice it. But the post-credit scene shows us the biggest purpose of this movie, it shows us that it's just a start of something bigger and the post- credit scene is MCU's big bang moment.Not many people expected this movie to be this much of a success. It has everything necessary:it's entertaining, it has good performances and visuals, it has a charismatic main character who is also a different kind of superhero and, the most important thing, it launches a franchises that won't just change superhero movies, but franchises themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Birth of Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I had already written a review of this film, so it was a good thing that I have decided to go back and rewatch the Marvel Cinematic Universe films again (if only so I can have a better idea of what had happened previously, especially since the movies seem to reference events from the earlier films on a regular basis) so that I can review some of the films that I have watched in the past, but had not got around to reviewing. Anyway, this is the 'first' film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (though some could argue that the Ang Lee version of the Hulk was actually the first since the events of the Incredible Hulk do seem to come after it, despite there being a number of changes to the Bruce Banner's history) and it certainly has kicked off a craze, with at least two films being released a year, as well as at least two television series.Anyway, Iron Man literally sets the stage for what is to follows. First of all we have this guy wandering around saying that he is from the 'Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division' which is truncated to the acronym SHIELD at the end of the film. We also have Nick Fury making an appearance indicating that he is looking to start up a group and that Tony Stark isn't the only person around that happens to have super powers (even if those super powers consist entirely of a flying metal suit). It was probably logical to also have Ironman as the first movie since he apparently was the one who initiated the Avengers.Well, the film is basically about how Tony Stark, a billionaire playboy who happens to run a corporation that develops and sells weapons, becomes Iron Man. The thing is that he is also a playboy, and a tinkerer, which means that he is more interested in building things, and having fun, than actually running the company, which means that the company is doing a lot of things that he doesn't actually know about. However the realisation of who his company is selling weapons to comes to light when he is captured in Afghanistan after demonstrating one of his weapons that he claims to have the capability of stopping a war with one shot. Well, the problem is that when he demonstrates the power of this weapon, the other side want it as well, so they kidnap him to force him to make one.As well as being about how Iron Man becomes Iron Man, the film is also has an underlying theme about the military industrial complex. He we have a private corporation that years ago assisted the United States to develop a weapon to defeat the Japanese now double dealing ? that is selling weapons to both sides in a conflict. It is the idea that the only person who makes money out of a war are the weapons manufacturers, and the longer the war goes on, the more money that they make, which means that it is in their interest for there to be a perpetual war. However, selling to just one side in the war doesn't really help with the profits, especially since one side may have a huge advantage, however selling to both sides means that the odds are evened out, and also that the war is likely to last a lot longer.As for the villains, you sort of have two ? there is the Ten Rings, an organisation that Iron Man is regularly confronting in the comics (and while they are operational in Afghanistan, when I first watched the film I simply thought they were insurgents, or at least Taliban, however this time I realised that they were actually a mercenary force working for the Taliban), and the Iron Monger, who also happens to be Tony Stark's 2IC, who then builds his own Iron Man suit to take on Tony.As for the film, yep, it's pretty good, and I also picked up a lot more the second time round, which is not surprising since I do have the advantage of having seen many of the other films in the franchise already, so by rewatching them I also pick up a few more things, such as when Rhodey looks at one of the suits and says 'next time' which is flagging the arrival of War Machine in the next instalment. A good movie, pretty enjoyable, and I have to admit that Robert Downey Junior certainly plays the role quite well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark aka Ironman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly the best Marvel movie franchise character debuts in this movie. Yes, the obvious choice might be Spider-Man. But readers and fans of the IronMan comic know if it were scientifically possible to extract DNA from a comic book character right off the page and turn it into a real person; it still wouldn't equal how Robert Downey Jr. embodies Ironman! It is uncanny how he has captured every aspect of this character perfectly! From personality to appearance to personal problems and faults... and so much more I won't waste time elaborating on. In this first installment, the story starts off pretty much holding true to the comic book origins. It opens with a lot of action, and closes with plenty of action as well. The movie is somewhat bookended that way. But the story is not empty of action through the middle. So it has good pacing. Visually its very well done. I don't think the Ironman suit could've been done any more realistically. The humor generated fits the Stark character. Paltrow also pulls off the Pepper Potts character. There are frivolous and fluff moments in movie. And some might find it juvenile for their taste. But they usually revolve around Tony Stark's narcissistic side. True to the comic book character. And also true to the character, part of his character development is his narcissism becoming more of a surface personality trait as he cultivates more noble traits that become the deeper part of his soul. But the movie (as well as the sequels) reflects one of the weaknesses of the comic series. And that is great archenemies and villains! In the comic series it seemed like Ironman's best battles usually were against someone else's archenemy. And in my opinion, that has carried over to the movie franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fantastic birth of Marvel Studios</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 2008, Iron Man was a huge gamble. It was the first film produced by Marvel Studios who had, until then, only ever packaged and licensed it's properties to other studios. No one was sure if the company could successfully make their own feature film, let alone one with a B-List character such as Iron Man, and the casting of Robert Downey Jr didn't help matters either with many claiming the troubled actor was unfit for the role of Tony Stark. Marvel, however, had a plan they wished to put into action and though we might not have known it at the time, the studio had just struck gold.What director Jon Favreau managed to create with Iron Man was a superhero film that didn't take itself too seriously but wasn't lacking in thrills either. Sam Raimi arguably did it first with his Spider-Man films, yet Favreau perfected the formula in Iron Man and set the tone for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. Even now, 12 films in and with a 13th on the horizon, many fans of the MCU still claim that Iron Man is one of Marvel Studio's best productions which is a testament to Favreau's work, and though it's sequel lacked any real depth, it was a shame to see the director leave the series before Iron Man 3.Mediocre sequels aside, Iron Man has become a major player in the Marvel universe both on and offscreen, largely because of Downey Jr's performance. There are some actors that are born to play certain roles and though fans many were concerned about Downey Jr's casting, it's hard to deny that he is Tony Stark. The embodiment of wit and charm, Downey Jr was ? and still is ? completely believable as the reckless, billionaire, playboy philanthropist that finds himself forever transformed as a human being after a close call with death. The actors ability to portray Tony at his most arrogant and his most vulnerable proved that Marvel had heroes who were just as complex and popular as Spider-Man, even if the general public wasn't aware of them. As audiences watched Tony come to life on the big screen, however, Marvel Studios announced themselves to the world, and Downey Jr managed to reignite his career in the process. Not bad at all.Moving away from Downey Jr's scene stealing performance, Iron Man also boasts an impressive supporting cast with the likes of Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Terrance Howard all playing secondary characters. Bridges in particular impressed as Obadiah Stane, Stark's mentor turned menace, bringing a gravitas to the role that might have otherwise made the character feel less of a threat. Paltrow also proved to be a great choice for Tony's PA, Pepper Potters, the actress managing to keep up with Downy Jr in each scene, yet Howard is somewhat unmemorable and flat as Tony's friend James Rhodes, making the character seem somewhat dull. The actors omission from the film's sequels, however, have rectified this and Don Cheadle gives 'Rhodey' the justice he deserves on screen.Performances aside, Iron Man also works perfectly as an action film and features many great set pieces throughout it's runtime. Seeing Tony wearing the prototype Iron Man suit in the cave system occupied by the Ten Rings is one of the film's highlights with Yinsen's sacrifice and the exploding finale elevating the sequence above the usual heights of those often found in a superhero film. The testing process for the Iron Man suit is also a joy to watch and provides many laughs as Tony's mechanical assistants repeatedly spray him with a fire extinguisher. Perhaps the most crowd pleasing moment, however, is the sight of the finished Iron Man suit in action during a showdown with a group of terrorists in an Afghanistan. Completely CGI, the armour looks fantastic on screen and it's full range of capabilities are extremely impressive to witness, especially when Tony finds himself up against a tank. Even years after it's initial release, Iron Man still features many of the MCU's best moments, mostly because at this point in time the franchise was still unknown to us.There are problems to be found, however, and they've become staples of the MCU to this day. Though Bridges is able to provide a real presence to any role he takes, Stane is still just a 'one and done' villain without much character depth, and he's actually one of the better ones in the film series, which isn't saying much. Had Bridges not been cast, Stane may have had much less screen time and been even more of a disappointment come the final battle, so we should consider ourselves fortunate that The Dude himself was on hand to portray the character. Another weaker aspect of the film is it's pacing. While the first half plays out beautifully as Tony and Yinsen create the prototype armour, the second half feels slightly rushed due to the amount of it has to do before the film's climax. The reveal of Stane as the primary villain feels particularly rushed, coming seemingly out of nowhere in order set up the final showdown between Tony's armour and the Iron Monger suit. Thankfully, it's a showdown that's enjoyable to watch unfold on the streets of Malibu as the two men battle it out with one another.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr plays Tony Stark in the role he was born to play and one of the reasons why the MCU has grown so big, so quickly. This was the summer blockbuster of 2008 and is highly regarded by some as a catalyst for the MCU's recent success. Staying relatively true to the comic books this film spins a story which doesn't talk down to it's audiences, it doesn't ask for compassion or excuses, it just is. After a weapon's demonstration of the new "Jericho" missile Tony Stark is captured by the Ten Rings, an Afghan terrorist cell. Whilst being captured Stark sustains injuries leaving missile shrapnel on a voyage towards his heart and death. Imprisoned in a cave with him is Dr. Ho Yinsen (Shaun Toub) who builds a small electromagnet to help keep the shrapnel away from Stark's heart. Fearing death and injustice Stark starts to build a weaponised suit which he intends to use to escape his captors. It works and it inspires him to build a proper version of the suit rather than one made from bits and bobs found in the cave. Thus Iron Man is born, from the imagination of a billionaire playboy genius and as a result of death and injustice. The film follows Stark as he deals with life as the Iron Man, looking at his personal life and his business Looking at how the US Military fears his tech but also craves it, much like the Ten Rings terrorist cell who fear it but want their own version. Everyone wants a piece of Iron Man but only Tony Stark can wield it properly.This film is great, really really great in fact. It's mostly an origin story looking at how Stark became Iron Man but it's delivered with a fine mix of action, humour and CGI. There is plenty of time to learn about the backstory of Stark without having to see it all unfold on screen and Favreau directing skills deliver this brilliantly. The acting in the film is great too, like I said at the start of this review, Robert Downey Jr was born for this film, I can't think of another movie he's been in where I've been as bowled back by his performance. Downey manages to convince the audience that a philandering billionaire playboy can also have a heart and conscience without needing to completely overhaul himself into something else. The rest of the cast are equally believable from Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson and not forgetting Paul Bettany as the voice of Jarvis. Let's talk about CGI, obviously this film has CGI in it but it's believable throughout, at no point did I stop to think "that's looks cheesy" or "I can see that isn't real". All the CGI is tasteful and adds to the journey of the film. As the plot unfolds you simply can't get enough of what's happening on screen and by the end of it you'll be disappointed to see the credits on- screen. I'll happily give this film 8 out of 10. Although I'm writing this review from 8 years after the film (has it really been 8 years?!) I can honestly say that at the time I hoped this would spawn a lot more good, honest, fun Marvel movies (and it did!) :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here Comes Iron Man!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The kick off of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe started with this. Now Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige took a chance back then on a B- list superhero, a recovering actor and a comedy director and turned a concept about a man with a tin can suit into a masterpiece. Downey, Jr. makes such an impression as Tony Stark that makes you forget the comic variation was taken semi seriously. He's an jerk. But here's a perfect jerk. The rest of the cast does well too, but Downey really steals the show. It may be a very dark and gritty movie (which kick starts the voice of the MCU) but that doesn't distract from the fact how good of a movie it is. For years to come Marvel would make you fall in love with both the alter ego as well as the everyday character side. And what started as a fan boy dream would turn into a legacy to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good superhero movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first movie of a long list of Marvel superhero films. Robert Downey stars as billionaire engineer Tony Stark who, after being injured by a bomb while promoting his military equipment in Afghanistan, was saved by a doctor by having a car battery attached to his heart. Stark finds a way to amplify the car battery and builds an iron suit. He dons the suit, becoming superhuman Iron Man, and uses his powers to fight off his captives and the evil he will encounter.There is pretty good acting in the film, blending in drama and comedy, to deliver some entertaining plot elements - from Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow's chemistry to Downey's funny interactions with the machine objects he built in his office. The action was great - lots of edge-of-your seat good vs. evil battles, and I especially like the part where Iron Man fends out a band of Afghan terrorists and saving a group of villagers. The special effects and music score were pretty good as well.Again, this film is a good mixture of comedy, action and drama and, notably, is not as overly dark and somber as much of the more recent D.C. superhero films.Grade B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that kicked of the MCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is one of the best adaptations of comic book entertainment to the world of film. In my view only the Christian Bale Batman is as excellent a story and production as the tale of the Iron Man. Robert Downey Jnr is fantastically cast as Tony Stark, playboy industrialist and genius. As a weapons manufacturer and womaniser, Stark is set up as a character without morals and with only his own quest for pleasure able to match his inquisitive desire to build bigger and better weapons. It all goes wrong within moments of the opening credits though as on a trip to Afghanistan (and trust me it really does look like Afghanistan) his convoy is attacked and he is taken prisoner. From there, Stark builds the foundation of his Iron Man.It is the first part of the film that is truly awesome. Downey Jnr's own decadent lifestyle plays so well into the character of Stark and the arrogance that accompanies a genius who knows his position is delicious. His winning way with people and the awe with which the squaddies look up to him in the moment before his convoy is hit are moments of cinematic greatness.The part of the film where robots are fighting each other is less fun. I'm not a fan of the Transformers film and I didn't like the same robot action here. The process that turns Stark into the Iron Man both in the cave and then when perfecting the suit in California are what makes this film work so excellently.There are plot holes just as there are in any blockbuster. The sentimentality of the reporting on a refugee crisis is cringeworthy. The deliberate attempt to de-Arabise the terrorist group is pointless as those who fail to see the difference still won't while those who do will not be convinced. Despite all that this is still a great film. Jeff Bridges is a great presence and his bald pate and beard make his character really stand out. Bridges carries a sophistication in his characterisation that makes him a believable Chief Executive weighing up every situation to his own best advantage. Even Gwyneth Paltrow puts in a decent turn helped by an excellent mop of hair. All in all a great start to the MCU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best, and, sadly, the only good Iron Man film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it's definitely the best Iron Man movie at this point. To be more specific, I think this is the only good Iron Man movie at this point. If this movie is like the original Star Wars, the sequels are equivalent to Star Wars prequels. All though, this is a great comic book movie, I still think that Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 is a little bit better. Partly because it had a better villain and more drama. But that's more of a personal preference. (Spider-Man 2 is what Iron Man 2 should have been.)What made this movie so great, is that it had what neither of sequels had. It was well-written, well-acted, cohesive, entertaining, and, for the most part, faithful towards its source material, which both sequels ignored completely. Sorry to break it for those MCU movie fans that think that all those Marvel movies are made only for them, but comic book movies are made with an intention to pleas the fans of the comics as well. If you think otherwise, then you're an idiot. You think Marvel puts all those comic book references in movies for you? You think end credit scene with Thanos at the end of The Avengers was for you? Don't be delusional. Anyway, back to the movie. Iron Man is not as dark, deep, and cerebral as some of Iron Man's comic book stories, but it's still fun to watch, and it has its fair amount of dark and deep moments. Iron Man was always a very dark, gloomy character in the comics. At one point, Tony Stark was so damaged by his alcoholic addiction that he started to have suicidal thoughts. After all, he was created as a response to industrial complex and political environment of Cold War. This movie doesn't make Tony Stark a dark character which he was in the comics. But I was fine with that. His arc in this movie was very interesting and thematically very similar to some of his old arcs in comics. Whole point of him being ashamed of being part of industrial complex reminded me of an old story by Bill Mantlo, called "Vengeance in Vietnam". In that story, Tony Stark started for the first time in comics to question his morals and his actions when he was making weapons for war. I thought that aspect was handled very well in the movie. My main gripe with this movie will be the villain, which seems like a biggest shortcoming of all Iron Man films, and maybe MCU films in general. I know, it would have been very difficult to make a comic book accurate Obadiah Stane in a movie that is solely focused on Tony Stark's character, but there were possibilities to make him far more interesting. Obadiah Stane in the comics was a very complex, very twisted character with a very dark attitude and dark origin. He was traumatized since he was a child when he witnessed unintentional suicide of his father. After that tragedy, Stane started to show sadistic tendencies in school. He murdered a dog of his opponent in a chess play in order to win. He became manipulative and psychotic. He saw his life as a chess play in which he can't loose. He was a very subtle character with dark philosophical outlook. Well, in the movie... He's not like that. He's just a greedy businessman that wants money and power. That's about it... Again, not very deep, but I think it's works fine in a movie. And, common, it's miles better than any "villain" from sequels.And, the main reason why I think this is the best Iron Man movie, is because this is the movie that has the best portrayal of Tony Stark. I know I'm in minority on this, but I'm not a big fan of the way Downey Jr portrays this character (in sequels and Avengers movies). As I said, movie Tony Stark is not like comic book Tony Stark. Tony Stark in this movie wasn't exactly like comic book Tony Stark, but there were characteristics of a comic book Tony Stark in it. The scene when Stark says ''There is nothing except this. There's no art opening, no charity, nothing to sign. There's the next mission, and nothing else.'' is my favorite scene in this movie. Not only because it's deep and dramatic, but also because it's pure Tony Stark from the comics. People may not know, but main aspect of Tony Stark as a character was not his wittiness (which he didn't really had in comics). It's his humanity and empathy. And that scene showcased it perfectly... Too bad that the future movies butchered his character completely and made that line completely worthless, because, as we know from the future movies, Tony Stark didn't became a better person after this... He became worse and worse. And that's why I hated sequels so much. Those movies have forgotten who Tony Stark really is. They portrayed him as a some kind of a self-obsessed, narcissist douche that loves only himself and cares only for himself. Seems like filmmakers didn't get the point of what this movie was establishing. After this movie, Tony Stark was supposed to become a better person, because he finally learned what it means to be a hero. Instead, sequels completely ignored that and they made him to look even worse than he was in the beginning of this film...All in all, great comic book film, best Iron Man movie, and so on...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Iron Man Is Great And Always Will Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening credits of comic book pages flying past, you know that this will be a good movie. Whether you're a superhero fan or not, you can't help but think the guy coming out to legendary music, is someone worth watching. I find that the most exciting scenes are when Tony invents new ways for him to get the suit on. Something that we always get to look forward too in movies after. This will be so fun to see in "Captain America: Civil War. Before the attack in this movie, we are introduced to what Tony's life consisted of. We see a man who has an unlimited supply to money, has no strong relationship with another whether it is friendship or from a significant other, except for those that work closely to him. He's someone who is enjoying his young age and wealth as any other bachelor would. He didn't have to worry about being responsible and went to the beat of his own drum. That was all about to change, little did he know, so was the person he was becoming. In this movie, you won't be able to predict what is to come, and it ends up surprising you. This movie will give you hope for future Marvel movies to come. This was the start of great things coming out of the Marvel comic era. Marvel Cinematic Universe took the right step in starting with Iron Man due to him being an all around big hit that has the right attitude and confidence to pave the way for the movies that came after. Iron Man was the ultimate fantasy fulfilled as we are taken inside his suit while watching him in action. If we take a look at the beginning when he was taken by his captors in Afghanistan is when we truly began to see Tony change. We are able to see this change by how he is willing to help the man who saved him, rather than fending for himself. He was given a second chance at life to be someone other than who he was becoming. He was having fun doing whatever he wanted with the unlimited amount of money to get what he wanted. He decided to become a hero, a change that mankind needed.Downey's casting as Iron Man, made audiences skeptical: he wasn't in the best place of his career, and people didn't know what they were to expect; but that's also one reason you will enjoy this movie: no one expected such a great performance from Downey due to his questionable past. Downey puts on a stellar performance that causes you to want to see the second and third installments, along with all of the other crossover films in the Marvel franchises. Downey blew audiences away with his character, making them want a fourth film; one that has not yet been confirmed. There is no way that they could ever cast someone else as Iron Man, as they are one in the same. This film set the stage for all Marvel films that came after that were just as successful. In conclusion, you will know when watching this movie why Tony has his reasons for doing things and why you support them. He had no one after losing both his mother and father at a young age and only progressed into a better human being after becoming Iron Man. He ultimately does things to protect the people around him. The message that is displayed starts from the very beginning, when Tony does not know if he'll live and return home. When he builds the suit, a new man emerged from the cave he was held in. He had decided that he was going to help others and risk his life every day. It's your typical "good vs. evil" kind of movie. He decided to take matters into his own hands and protect people from the evil in the world. His personality had changed; the type of person he was had changed. He found his purpose in life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly Kicks of the MCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In preparation for the upcoming Captain America: Civil War film, I've decided to go back and reexamine Iron Man and Cap's previous entries that I haven't reviewed.Iron Man is one of those films that gets better with age. Even though I loved it upon first viewing, I wasn't all that pumped about going back another time. There's been so many MCU films now that it's hard to imagine one without numerous Marvel superheroes in them, but that's what is so brilliant about Iron Man. It can easily stand on its own as a singular superhero adventure, but it also presents the universe as somewhere that could have dozens upon dozens of heroes.At this point, it's hard to think of anyone else in the Iron Man suit but Robert Downey Jr. But it may be equally as hard for Downey to find a role more suitable to his acting strengths than Tony Stark himself. With the recent announcement that Downey will indeed be in the next Spider-Man installment, I can't hope but help he plays this character forever, in every Marvel film. A mixture of humor, wit, sophistication, and absolute charisma, Tony Stark may be the most engaging character in the MCU.With all that said, we only get to the rest of the MCU films if the first Iron Man works, which it does. I love the way Jon Favreau sets the tone for the MCU as undeniably dramatic but with a good amount of comedic undertones so that it appeals to all ages and demographics. When the plot of the film involves a billionaire who develops tech and weapons that end up killing many innocent people, you need some comedic relief to give the film smooth pacing.Favreau also manages to develop a romantic superhero relationship that is something you truly care about without overselling it, an admittedly difficult task. Pepper and Tony aren't your typical superhero damsel in distress type of relationship, but they also don't try and turn it into something it isn't. It's teased just enough in this movie to keep those invested something to hope for in later installments.Of course, Iron Man is one of the best superhero films of all time, but it's also just a really well made film. Sure, the villain, in the form of Obadiah Stane is nothing special, but Marvel has never had the easiest of times creating great on screen villains. But as a whole, Iron Man is phenomenal work of cinema that only gets better with age. It serves as a reminder that you can make a serious superhero film and an enjoyable experience at the same time.+Downey Jr is Iron Man+Romantic relationship that you care about+Perfect tone setting up the MCU9.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The good: Strong supporting cast. Paltrow makes a great Pepper Pots. Jeff Bridges is a bit of a scenery chewer, but he did utter the immortal line "He built it in a cave...with a box of scraps!". The smaller roles (Shaun Taub as Yinsen was particularly noteworthy) were also well cast and well acted.The great: So much of what makes the MCU special was laid out in this film. Phil Coulson, falling in love with a robot named Dummy, the Stan Lee cameo (I know he has been in others before, but it still made this movie), the humor and yet the humanity...everything that makes a Marvel Studios production great is here. The first two acts of this movie are as good as comic book movies get.The simply outstanding: Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark is Iron Man. The only comparison I can make is Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, but Depp has many other roles that he is identified with. Robert Downey Jr found the role of his life. The nitpicks: The third act loses a bit of focus, the plot twist doesn't make much sense and some mighty powerful tech is introduced and then never seen nor spoken of again.The final analysis: This is the best comic book ever made. From it, a true Universe was born and a super-star was made. Without it, there would be no Avengers and no Guardians of the Galaxy. It ranks up there with Star Wars and The Godfather (and I pick those two movies in particular) as one of the best movies of all time. It is, without question, my favorite movie in the MCU.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr. is more than fitting as the rich, intelligent, swagger-man Tony Stark. Iron Man is just a suit, so Tony is just a person. He's not a superhero, he's a man thriving in decadence, an entrepreneur with personal gain. His business, Stark Industries, manufactures and sells weapons for war. It takes his kidnapping and subsequent three month imprisonment to realise the wrongs in his life. The suits helps him right his wrongs. Obadiah Stane, work partner and friend of Tony's Father, is against Tony's decisions. With his shiny, bald head, Bridges is a brooding, intimidating figure, taking some of that huge burden laid upon Downey to do so well. The finest aspect for me (and some may disagree) is director Jon Favreau's spends more time with the man than the suit. It's about the characters, and it pays to see some real heart in a Hollywood blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Superhero Origin Stories Ever Put To Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is directed by Jon Favreau and stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, a wealthy business man that's somewhat cocky and arrogant. On a business trip to Afghanistan, he is captured by terrorists and forced to build a giant metal suit in order to escape. However, once he's back to safety, he is inspired to do a little more with his smarts than to just build weapons that kill and destroy, so he builds another suit; this one more technologically advanced that the other, subsequently becoming Iron Man.To start, this film was the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it really started it off with a bang. Iron Man is one of the greatest origin stories of all time, and one of the best superhero movies ever created. The way that Jon Favreau put all of these characters to life is very impressive, and will never be forgotten.There are very few casting choices through cinematic history that are absolutely perfect, and Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is one of them. Tom Cruise was considered for the role of Stark, and if he would've gotten it, Iron Man wouldn't be the same. Robert Downey Jr. brings Tony Stark to life in a way that didn't seem possible prior to this film. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts was also a really good casting choice. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane was also a pretty good choice. The only casting problem I found with the movie is Terrence Howard as James "Rhodey" Rhodes. Although Terrence Howard is a pretty good actor, he just doesn't fit this role. Luckily, Marvel also realized this and cast Don Cheadle as Rhodey once the second film rolled around.The directing is also very good, showing very odd yet clean looking camera angles, especially during action. All of the action scenes are directed very well, without too many cuts and many clean, long takes. The cinematography also shows itself off very well. Each wide shot, especially of Afghanistan, captures the scene very well, and advances the film.The special effects are also very good, showing off almost no obvious CG. All of the fights between Iron Man and tanks, or Iron Man and Iron Monger are great. Some of the shots, however, during a fight between Iron Man and a couple of jets, look a bit obvious in the CGI area. This doesn't hold the film back too much, but it keeps it from being perfect.Overall, Iron Man is most likely one of the best superhero stories put to film, thanks to its great cast, directing, and special effects. I'm going to give Iron Man an A-, or a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How it all began</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Iron Man" is an American superhero film from 8 years ago and it was the great revival of Robert Downey Jr.'s career. Once a lauded young television actor and Oscar nominee for "Chaplin", he quickly faced the dark side of show business, but in 2008 he pursued his great comeback. And he should not only lead the "Iron Man" franchise, but quickly afterward also become the new "Sherlock Holmes" and certainly a superior one to Benedict Cumberbatch. But lets get back to this film we have here. It received great audience numbers and critics reviews and was one of the main reasons why superhero films are so much en vogue again. But it's not all Downey Jr.'s achievement. Jeff Bridges created a nice main antagonist shortly before his Oscar win and then there is of course Jon Favreau's (an actor himself, also appears in here) strong direction and a truly excellent script for such a genre film.Its biggest strength is probably how well-structured it all is. The first third is about the hostage situation, the second is about Stark's change in character and the consequences and the final third of the film is what you may call the boss fight. I generally don't mind if we find out about the main antagonist right away, bit it was also nicely done with the path they chose here. Then again, Marvel fans certainly knew right away. It was a very smart decision. The terrorists were the main villains for at least half the film until we found out who was in charge of them really and there is one scene way into the second half during which we see they are not in control at all. It's also a decent development that will not offend people that follow the religion of Islam, who may have seen this film as too much against their faith otherwise.The film runs for slightly over 2 hours with credits and that's perfectly fine. No need to stretch it to 150 minutes and the way it is it also never drags and is an enjoyable watch from start to finish. The only somewhat negative association i had came with Gwyneth Paltrow who was occasionally cringeworthy in her few scenes. Then again, I do not see much talent in her anyway. And one notion about the Transformers-like fight at the end. I would have preferred that the way he could have won would have been with that reference to freezing armor, which was very nice and certainly would have been my preferred choice over a collaboration battle with Paltrow's character. it also would have emphasized again what they were telling us for the entire film. Stark may have been a bonvivant, but he is also a lone wolf. Apart from that, I was happy that the film focused a lot more on story than on special effects and visuals. I wish more superhero films would go that route.As a whole, needless to say now that i enjoyed the watch and will certainly rewatch the second film and watch the third at some point. And I am not even speaking about the other Avengers film that I will certainly watch at some point in the future too. Thanks to Mr. Samuel L. Jackson for leading us towards them in the post-credit sequence. As for "Iron Man", this was a pretty good effort I must say. Delivered in basically all areas convincingly and I urge you to check this one out. On a final note, I liked that they cast fairly unknown actors for major supporting parts here such as Yinsen and Raza, also something that other (superhero) film makers should adapt in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Catalyst That Sparked a Time of Renaissance for Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. Not really for what it's about but but more so from what impact it has left. I initially didn't watch Iron Man when it came out in 2008 but boy do I regret it. I waited and borrowed it from a friend about two years later on DVD. I recently re-watched it in anticipation for Captain America Civil War and it is amazing how well this film has aged 8 years later. Before going into detail, there is only one thing at the beginning of the movie that really makes you tell that it is from 2008. Early on, somebody takes a picture with Tony Stark and he requests to not see it on Myspace. Besides that one little statement, you could easily convince someone that this is a modern film (assuming that they haven't see any other Marvel film recently, which is very unlikely at this point). The plot is alright for the film but it is not the best compared to other Comic Book films but it is still fun. It is likely overlooked though by people that only saw it at release because the wonderful Dark Knight by DC came out 3 months later and many of us know what impression that left on the movie and comic book industries (but I won't go into detail on that here). The only big down side is the second act of the film is not really as good as the first. The villain (who I will not give away here) is rather boring to watch in the back half. He very clearly gave off the bad guy vibe from his first appearance. I think the biggest reason i'm complaining about him so much now though is because of the extremely memorable villains that the MCU gave us later down the line (Loki, Hydra on a whole, Kilgrave, Ultron, etc). That is likely the best thing we got from this film though. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is really the first of it's kind (but not the only anymore). This film spawned and entire universe that spans outside film but also to TV and Comics. It is amazing that we're still getting movies and shows that are technically based off of a movie from 2008 and I love it. I love everything that we got from the MCU and I love what Impact that it left on DC as well. They took a page out of Marvel's book by connecting some of their shows and movies with the Arrowverse and DC Extended Universe. This simple superhero film has completely changed the way movies are approached. We now have a series of films that will continue to go on for the foreseeable future and I love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very fun and well acted movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my first marvel movie made me want to watch other adaptations of marvel's works. The first act may be slow but there are some scenes that made me cry because of what happened to Tony Stark and changed him to become Iron Man. I have noticed a little bit of parallels with some scenes with Captain America. The people who died when they become Iron Man or Captain America the person who dies will points to their chest and to represent that they have a heart to protect the people who they cared about and I like how they reuse that same scene with Captain America. During the second act while he is building and test flying his suits I will always laugh at them because he recorded for himself and see if there is any improvement on them. Which shows of his intelligence of making things other than building engines for hot rods which he done that already and show that in the film which also makes him a car mechanic like my Dad does. (except my Dad doesn't drink all the time like Stark does) Anyways I really do genuinely feel for his character a lot because of his abuse of alcohol, his personally to be an arse sometimes, and I felt really scared at times when the shrapnel in his chest would eventually kill him someday and how he has to deal with it for a pretty long time for a good doctor to remove it without killing him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of 2008!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when Iron Man first came out in 2008, I wasn't planning on seeing it because I didn't know anything about Iron Man or even Robert Downey Jr. or I wasn't even a lot of movies back then. Back then, the only superheroes I was into were Spider-Man and Batman. But when Iron Man finally came out, I loved it, like most people. 2008 was a great year for movies like WALL-E, Gran Torino, Kung Fu Panda, Revolutionary Road, Indiana Jones 4 and of course, Iron Man. Iron Man was also gave Robert Downey Jr. (now one of my favourite actors) his big return back to super-stardom. I mean he was a rising star in the 80s and early 90s with movies like Weird Science and Chaplin (in my opinion, his best performance ever). Also Tropic Thunder which not only saved his career but also gave him another Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Iron Man is my third favourite superhero movie (next to Avengers Assemble and Batman Begins). In fact, I think it's the best movie of 2008, forget The Dark Knight. I mean The Joker in The Dark Knight was incredible but most people seem to be over-glorifying it just because of Heath Ledger's performance and death. But in conclusion, I love Iron Man and I like Iron Man 2 and 3 and of course, I love Avengers Assemble. By the way, happy birthday to the creator of Iron Man, Stan Lee!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's better, winning all that money or not caring about it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being the Marvel fan that I am was fairly excited when I stepped into the theater to see Iron Man. But believe me when I tell you it wasn't far from reluctant based off of the history marvel movies had lived up to before, so as I stepped into the theater a million thoughts flew around inside my head, all of which being how they would handle one of my favorite characters. I must say I am not disappointed. They handle Tony Stark incredibly well and having Robert Downey Jr. play him is one of the best choices I have seen for a casting decision in a marvel movie. He is a perfect blend of pretenses and intelligent with so much lip build in. Along with this, the armor is beautiful and an absolute joy to watch. I loved the back story the reworked and the fight scene at the end is so cool. Plus we get the treat of having Tony Bridges being Obediah Stane, and fighting in the Iron Monger suit. If you haven't seen it I definitely recommend it. I give it a 9/10 for a few errors but nothing-huge overall. How ironic, Tony! 'Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever! And now, I'm going to kill you with it!" ?Obediah Stane</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The third Avenger-Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third Avenger-Iron ManIron Man is a sci-ens fiction movie, where a man called Tony Stark build a iron suit. Tony Stark is acted by Ribert Downey Jr. At the first may 2008 the movie was published by Marvel. The director was Jon Favreau. After being kidnapped in an Afghan cave, he creates a unique weaponed suite of iron to fight evil. The actors performance is very good. Robert is probably the best actor to represent this cool character Iron Man. The special effects are great too. The Iron suit with its laser and rockets is perfectly done. Also the designed expertly the home is awesome. it looks very modern and futuristic. All in all the movie is great. I would recommend the film to all those people who like super heroes, action or funny movies. If you are a fan of romantic or thriller films I wouldn't recommend it for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The better Man of Steel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man was released in 2008. It's an action and comedy film of the Marvel-Studios. Robert Downey Jr. plays the main character: Tony Stark. The film has 2 sequels. John Favreau was the director.Tony Stark is a millionaire and leader of Stark Industries (arms industry). He is a playboy and has a nice house at the coast. Also he is a very good mechanic. One day he was kidnapped from terrorists . He builds a metal fighting-suit to break out. So Iron Man was born. He fought against other terrorists and saved villages. But there is a super-villain, who attacks Stark and his company? The actors are all fitting to the character, so the film looks great. The special effects are nice and looks great. The combination of music and plot let the film feel very realistic. The camera working is also awesome because it's very dynamic. So it feels like you are in the film. In my opinion its one of the best films of the last 10 years and you can see the film all the time. The only weakness is that the story is a little bit predictable.I advice watching the film for fans of superhero- movies or action- and comedy- film enthusiasts. So I give the film 9 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the MCU!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years of licensing out its marquee characters to film studios to stave off bankruptcy, Marvel finally launched its own production house to build its own cinematic universe. With Spiderman and the X- Men off their table, they gambled by turning to b-list Avenger Iron Man to kick things off, and it paid off handsomely. Because numerous prior attempts at bringing Iron Man to the big screen had failed, they have a wide-open canvas on which to world-build. The story and screenplay are open-ended enough so as not to close off possibilities prematurely, yet not so generic as to rob it of its own life. The character of Tony Stark fits Robert Downey Jr. like a glove; he fully captures Stark's obsessiveness and bemused arrogance. Most of the other actors in Stark's world seem to calibrate themselves off Downey, with Gwyneth Paltrow, Jon Favreau (who also directed) and Terrence Howard doing a good job conveying a sense of how exhilarating and exhausting it is to be in his orbit. The villain of the piece isn't technically revealed until well into the running time, but only people who've never seen a comic book won't have guessed (if only from the character's improbably evil name) the identity. This isn't a flaw -- the film doesn't have anything riding on trying to trick or misdirect viewers, but the story is structured in a way that we get explicit information only as Stark discovers it, which is an effective technique for putting us in his camp. The action sequences are everything we could hope for from a multi-million dollar tent-pole film, well-designed and executed and well-integrated into the story. I had trouble with the idea that someone supposedly as brilliant and worldly as Stark would be so naive about the geopolitical realities involved in arms dealing -- this is the source of contradictions in Stark's character with which the film tries to grapple but never successfully comes to grips. Still, it's an exciting beginning to a multi-film narrative the likes of which no enterprise has attempted in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm gonna go direct to the point in this review, i saw Iron man and i think it was amazing, its very interesting, well acted, the action is good and there is a good mix between drama and action, adding that the action scenes are great, making Iron man not only bad ass but also an interesting character, and what i actually find weird (but not bad)its that the jokes also makes this movie so good, comedy well placed in the right place with good dialogs,also the soundtrack is great.Sure Iron man is bad ass, but the character of Tony Stark is also fascinating, Robert Downey Jr. did a very good job in his performance, now i can't even imagine someone replacing him as Iron man or Tony Stark.The cast and characters are good, i like Robert Downey Jr as Tony, Gwyneth Paltrow as Peppers and Jeff Bridges, i like the chemistry between Tony and Peppers, not only made me laugh, but it also made me like those characters, i really want more of this in future films.I liked the cast, but then i saw the rest of the film cast, and then i realized how almost every character is (not tony , peppers or Obadiah) way behind in this movie, sure the dialogs and performances are greats but most of the characters ( at least for me) needed more time screen or something to make them useful or interesting enough.Other thing that i found not good or bad was the ending, so much potential and in the end was kind of weak, still liking it but it could be so much more, overall, pretty good and solid movie Iron man is fantastic, with good action and drama scenes and a threatening villain, with maybe the cliché of fighting this villain and Tony being an arrogant and changing for good at the end, but the cliché didn't bother me, i still enjoyed the whole movie and it was satisfying.I Recommend this movie, a must watch if you wanna know about Iron man.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stainless style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is effectively the film that sparked life back into the superhero genre. Being Marvel studios first solo film there was a lot riding on the film to be a success and allow the company to bring more comic book heroes to the big screen. Having Jon Favreau direct and giving Robert Downey Jr. a chance to continue his career revival as the titular hero were brave choices, but also ones which pay-off in the best way possible. Downey Jr. pretty much takes control of the film and breathes life into what could have been a dull hero. Most of all Iron Man succeeds where it needs to and offers exactly what the audiences wants with fun characters, exciting action and plenty of witty lines.Story: Billionaire playboy Tony Stark is in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile built by his weapons company. He is attacked and captured by a terrorist group, only surviving because an electromagnet is fused into his chest. He escapes by secretly building and powering a suit of armour via the magnet, which he decides to put to greater use upon his return. As far as origin stories go this is extremely well done. It plays it safe in certain areas, but it is played out with such style that it is easy to forgive. We get plenty of insights into Stark's past, who his friends are and solid reasoning as to how he came to be. I also liked how terrorism was a major theme throughout, giving the characters actions much more weight than usual.Hero: It feels like Robert Downey Jr. was born to play this role and he is succeeds in every way possible. It's all the more impressive given the difficult job of making Stark someone who is sardonic and arrogant, whilst also being charming and courageous. He handles every aspect of the role brilliantly, offering plenty of laughs and being someone you grow to care about.Villains: Jeff Bridges does a solid job as usual as Stark's scheming business partner Obadiah Stane. He does come off as a little one note and it is obvious he'll be evil from the get good, but Bridges charismatic portrayal makes the role more engaging and he does get a few enjoyably sinister moments. Faran Tahir also does a fine job with a limited role as terrorist leader Raza.Support: Gwyneth Paltrow is a mixed bag as Stark's assistant Pepper Potts. She certainly has chemistry with Downey Jr. and has some amusing lines, yet she just didn't seem at ease with much of the dialogue and wasn't that believable in the role. Terrence Howard puts in a solid performance as Stark's air force ally Rhodes. He definitely convinces as a military presence and his scenes with Downey Jr. are fun, but the role just isn't fleshed out that much. Paul Bettany provides the voice of computer Jarvis and gives the right amount of flair to the snappy dialogue.Action: The action is straight-forward and yet surprisingly effective. We get plenty of shots of Iron Man soaring across the skies and him blowing things up, with it all being shot in a very stylish way that makes it more effective than it should be. Importantly it never forgets to keep things exciting and there are some well-timed moments of humour. The climax is mainly two men in metal trying to crush each other, but even that was a lot of fun and shot with an appropriate intensity. The CGI is mostly excellent and blends in very well.Music: The score by Ramin Djawadi is based much more in hard rock and consistently excellent. The heavy guitar should isn't used much in films and that helps it standout here, giving a lot of attitude to certain scenes and helping give the film its own identity. The music when Stark first tries out the suit is pulse pounding in all the right ways.Production: Firstly the film does look fantastic. Everything is appropriately slick and stylish, but without overdoing it and that helps to retain a greater sense of realism. Setting it in California was also a nice idea seeing as we've seen so many superheroes based on the west coast and it does take advantage of the area with many scenic shots. The script is well written for the most part and most scenes flow along smoothly. The humour is brilliantly placed throughout and works mainly due to Downey Jr.'s superb delivery, whilst always managing to walk the fine line between subtle and slapstick. It's good to see a superhero that doesn't spend most of the film moping around and actually embraces what he has, it's not like that's a bad thing but it is always pleasant to see something different.Conclusion: For me Iron Man works so well because it gives the audience the perfect mixture of thrills and laughs that it appeared it would. Robert Downey Jr. is undoubtedly the star of the show and his charismatic portrayal of someone as flawed as Stark makes for the perfect centre of the film. Beyond that the action is always exciting, the score is a lot of fun and the writing is great throughout. The film suffers slightly from some plot predictability and some of the characters not being overly engaging, but they are only minor setbacks. Importantly it's easy to see why Iron Man helped launch Marvel as a cinematic force, it succeeds in making its superhero both fun and serious when he needs to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FINALLY! A superhero movie comes along that perfectly assembles all the qualities of a Marvel Comic book and neatly transfers them from Comic to Cinema. While Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002) was a fun and glossy roller-coaster of a movie it didn't quite capture the danger of Spidey's world and the character himself wasn't the heroic comedian the way fans love him. Bryan Singer's X-Men movies offered up the right quota of the mutant's dangerous and hunted lives but lost a lot of the hallmarks of the characters in terms of the iconic costumes, character trademarks and the multi-coloured qualities of a dark world. What Jon Favreau did with Iron Man is on a similar level to what the great Richard Donner achieved with Superman The Movie (1978) and Superman II (1980), and it is very simple : he made a movie faithful to its source material AND fresh and original with enough of the hallmarks of a successful summer blockbuster and everyone left the cinema satisfied. There is real heart in what Favreau did. The way he didn't shirk the icons of Iron Man as character, lovingly showing first the bulky Silver armour and then being bold enough and not in the least embarrassed to show the beauty of the Red and Gold armour in full flight. He really gets a good sense of Jack Kirby into his movie, and while it might seem petty of me to point to Iron Mans armour being correct as a sign of the movie being a success, its things like that that makes us all fans in the first place and its great when a director like Favreau or Richard Donner comes along and isn't embarrassed by the material he is working with. The casting of Robert Downey JR as Tony Stark/Iron Man was a true master stroke of genius on Favreaus behalf. I've always loved Downey's performances from Chaplin onward and i always thought he was a superstar in waiting who just needed to sort his turbulent life out and find the right role that would ignite him into super nova. With this movie he found the perfect character and he gives us one of the truly great Superhero performances, up there with Christopher Reeve as Superman in my opinion. Downey is everything the character needs to be and maybe wasn't on paper. Unlike the cliché of a brooding millionaire type it could of become ala Bruce Wayne, Downey makes Tony Stark a fun guy who lives life to the full, who is funny, a man you would like to hang out with, who enjoys life and its truly refreshing to see him take flight in the character. Downey makes the armour real, makes it come alive in the same way Christopher Reeve made you believe a man could fly. He is backed up by a great ensemble supporting cast, just as invigorating as watching Downey have fun with his character it is the same watching Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts: Supportive, warm and sexy you never for one minute doubt that she cares about Tony Stark. Jeff Bridges is an absolute sensation as Obidiah Stane. I've been a big fan of Jeff Bridges since childhood, loved him in Tron (1982) and Starman (1984) and it is great that with this movie he finally found a huge blockbuster size audience and im sure his popularity in this movie payed dividends in his winning the Oscar for best actor for Crazy Heart two years later. My only irk with the entire movie is that the plot is waiffer thin, but the great atmosphere generated by the cast and direction makes up for that. The action scenbes and special effects are fantastic and the whole pace of the movie is fun and flowing. Iron MJan is a movie that is proud to carry the name Marvel and as a representation of the Red and Gold Armour clad hero, a more faithful adaptation could not have been made. Well done to all concerned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This slick superhero movie is fast-paced and has brisk, often witty dialog, and I did enjoy it, but it's a pretty dumb piece of work. There are both the little things - the stated purpose of the gizmo in Stark's chest contradicts its implied purpose based on what happens when it's removed, the villain is far too skilled based on his experience - and the overall premise of the film. The movie's naive take on war seems to be that the problem is weapons makers and (middle eastern) warlords, as opposed to say, imperialism, greed or, more to the point, the knee jerk use of force to solve all problems. Like the movie itself, Stark has a surface revelation but can't or won't look at the deeper issues. So while Iron Man works perfectly well as a popcorny action flick, its failure to deal with issues raised by the very nature of the screenplay makes it less satisfying than a superhero movie that never raised these issues to begin with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man above all else is unlike most superhero origin story lines. Partly because everyone involved is adult and we are not dealing with teenage angst. But mainly because it didn't follow the paint by numbers storytelling we have been brought up with. Yes, the main character Tony Stark is an established, smarmy philanderer rich man. He makes weapons and gets paid handsomely for it. Jeez, this guy has more toys than Bruce Wayne. Well, that's a stretch, but he definitely has more fun. But Tony didn't witness any particular family member die. He doesn't owe a debt to a mother or uncle. He's just a guy who finally saw the wheel he created come round. And he couldn't accept it. But added to this fact, Tony isn't dealing with the complexities of teenage love. His feelings are made quite clear. And there is no need for him to let the woman he loves go in fear her life would be in greater jeopardy. Tony doesn't think like this. In this film, the origin isn't really the focus here, as the characters and the interactions. These guys love to talk and they speak with such colorful fun. Sure, there's serious business in weapons manufacturing. But when dealing in a deadly business why not at least have fun doing it. Unlike most superhero films, this one is a character film first and an action film second. Of course that is where Jon Faverau slowly stumbles. What he gets right is that he allows the action to have a good sense of "freedom". He doesn't jam the camera in between the fights. He stays back enough so we have breathing space to enjoy the flights of Iron man. What fails is that the fights aren't that exhilarating. They are a vehicle from A to B. Faverau doesn't play enough with camera angles or the choreography. It's tic- tac- toe. Robert Downey Jr has formed himself into perhaps the best adaptation of a superhero to date. To be fair, he's kinda got it easy. Tony Stark is simply so much fun. Chris Reeve had to play the noble, earnest ridden god. Christian Bale has to play the cunning and deeply scarred playboy. So including Downey in the list of these guys is worthy accolades. Still this was the most fun I've had at a Marvel film since Spider-man 2. And again, these two are comparable because those that write and direct it love these characters and want to make an honest comic book movie. I think of scenes from Spider-man 2 that resonate deep in me. The speech that Aunt May give Peter about the importance of a hero. The New York subway riders protecting their heroes identity. It's corny to the Nth degree. But it works. It works because it shows us that the people writing these projects actually believe the importance of a hero like Spider-man and they are telling you. Iron Man doesn't lack that kinda devotion. These people have something to say about the world and their place in it. Which brings me to the latest Incredible Hulk and Dark Knight trailer. Both premiered ahead of Iron Man. However one completed it's objective and the other one left a larger question mark. Dark Knight continues to show that these characters speak in a way that we normally wouldn't. They make grandiose statements. These guys have a lot of bravado to share. It's a battle in who has the better line. But what's interesting about Incredible Hulk is how pedestrian people speak. I'd settle for a "...don't make me angry" line. But what we get is banality, just without the Eric. This does not make the Hulk an uninteresting venture. But for me, I look for films of this calibure who are willing to express it's intentions. Stand up on its soapbox and say, "I am a comic book film." Iron Man has set itself above most comic book films and probably stands to be judged along the greats. I look forward to the future of this franchise. Given the choices that we will have in a couple years time, it's a welcome respite.</fullReview>

I liked Robert Downey Jr, I loved Spiderman, liked The Fantastic Four and the Hulk, so I thought - why not?A great in media res opening, and solid acting from RDJ began the film well despite the interesting, if slightly unrealistic attack on the convoy.There were many fun bits with the electromagnet - if completely unreal - but it was fun, like Spiderman before it. A success of Favreau undoubtedly, and great casting, especially Downey Jr, Bridges, Howard, and Paltrow - obviously the main cast. Interesting contrasts between the characters, fun, if short fight at the end between Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) and the take on Iron Monger, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).Overall a success: a great film adaptation of a great comic book, some stunning CGI, humorous and serious parts, and, most importantly nowadays, brilliant acting all round.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr was a perfect Tony Stark. Jon Favreau said in an interview that he did not want to make this movie cheesy because he is such a comic book fan. I give him props because he really did make a great movie. It had very small weak points which is why I did not give it a perfect rating. But the look, the feel, the image, the acting all fit together into a memorial comic movie. Which is hard to say about a lot of comic book movies. They really have to add something extra to make a great film package and that is what they did. They did not focus too much on the power of the hero, but the story which really helps. Terrence Howard was decent. Gwyneth Paltrow was pretty good and Pepper. Jeff Bridges made a perfect villain. This movie is a top for comic book movies. Great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironman resurrects careers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ironman!!! What can I say about this movie other than exceptional. This film will forever be known as the work that made Robert Downey Jr. a relevant actor again. His work as the character of Tony Stark was nothing short of spectacular. I also found the supporting roles by Terrence Howard as Rhodey, Stark's best friend and military liaison, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts as Stark's personal assistant, and Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane were also performed quite well. I also thought that it added some much need "big-screen" relevance to Jeff Bridges career. The basic premise of the film is that Tony Stark, heir to his father's weapons and research and development company is ambushed and kidnapped by terrorists that his weapons were meant to destroy. Ironically, he was kidnapped by use of the very weapons by the same people they were meant to be used against. After Yinsen, played by Shaun Toub saved is life, Stark developed a defensive suit and used it to escape his captors. After returning to reality, as it were, Stark has a change of heart about what his company does and vows to stop creating weapons. He also develops a newer version of the Ironman suit and uses it to fight terrorism. Unfortunately, Stark comes to learn that Obadiah was actually behind the delivery of the weapons and even behind Stark's assassination attempt. Obadiah creates a much larger version of the suit and what results is some of the best action seen on the big screen today. The use of light and point of view action in this film provides the viewer with a truly unique perception not typically found in modern films. One truly gets to feel as if they are in the Ironman suit, flying around the world protecting people from terroristic threats. It also gives us a look into the future of technology, and I truly believe that most of what is portrayed in this film is either possible in the near future or already in practical use. This film has created a new legacy in the comic book hero genre and has resurrected the career of an almost forgotten talent. Very well done?very well done indeed.</fullReview>

Iron Man is a movie to watch again and again. Now you are wondering why this is not a perfect ten well those reasons are that Tony is to dramatic his experience completely alters his personality after Tony has his experience he sets out to destroy his weapons. Usually he would take revenge. Also Iron Man's victories are to predictable. The only victory that isn't predictable is Iron Man's victory over the Iron Mongor. The flaws in this movie are minor and if someone asks you to watch Iron Man with them say yes, after all it got a nine out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a review of the Ultimate 2-Disc Edition DVD of the film, which comes with 3 hours and 12 minutes of interesting, informative and really well-done featurettes/interviews, 24 minutes of extended/deleted scenes(not completely done as far as I can tell; some of them make Tony an even luckier bastard than he was in the final cut), a 3 minute The Onion spoof, a one minute commercial, and last but not least, a *ton* of galleries. I watched this at the cinema two years ago, and since purchased it, and freshened up my memory of it tonight because I'm going to see the second one tomorrow. It was nice to find out that so much of the time, the suits(that look *glorious*, by the way, designs are spot-on, and they sound and move exactly right, too) are really there; this was the last thing Stan Winston completed... R.I.P., you will not be forgotten. The photo-realistic, beautiful, convincing and appropriately used CGI closes the gap, so that you cannot tell where it goes from one to the other. I should say that I am not technically a fan of this hero, but I do like him, and enjoy reading comics that he's in, including the ones centered on him. Based on what I do know of him, this largely nails the source material. This makes incredible use of different styles of editing, and practically redefines the term "effective reveal". Few origin story flicks are this entertaining. The plot is good, and well-told. Pacing is just excellent, from start to finish. It's mainly fast; however, it does allow for breathers, without ever slowing down enough that it'll lose your devoted attention. The writing is just so fantastic throughout, in fact, the few things I knew beforehand or figured out before they occurred, worked. And the comedy... I'm not kidding, everyone in this, *the AI*, has a sense of humor. Jokes and gags are everywhere in this, and somehow it still manages to be serious(not to mention that they are all funny, timing, delivery, perfect). Emotion is garnered, without slipping, for a single second, into actual sentimentality or sap. Tension is also built, expertly so. It has been said that as far as the dialog, Jon allowed for improvisation... so I don't know how much of the stuff was on the page, and how much the performers came up with, but whatever exactly took place, they had the recipe for total success. I couldn't think of a bad line(or one that didn't come off as natural) found in this no matter how bad I wanted to(I have tried, I try to dispense a healthy amount of criticism upon everything I watch). The acting is flawless(and let's be honest, Downey Jr. is *the* choice for the role; and he does as many of his own stunts as they let him). This is probably the first and thus far only case where I've particularly cared for what Paltrow gave in a piece. There is a lot of realism herein, so those prone to shying away from stuff like this are likely to have a wonderful time. The music is amazing, and fits impeccably well. All of the action is awesome, plain and simple; perhaps there could be a greater amount(though, again, there isn't a boring moment to be found in this). Please do *not* be scared off by the PG-13 rating... to provide an example of how cool it can be in spite of that, think of Hellboy. And it does take skill to accurately portray Stark without more suggestive content than this has(for a full rundown, why not sneak a peek at the Parents Guide here on the site, from what I can tell, it covers it all). Finally, if you are into this stuff, do yourself a huge favor and stay until after the end credits. I recommend this to anyone who is at least remotely into movies like this, and/or the title character. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Downey Junior plays Tony Stark a rich billionaire of Stark Industries who is kidnapped in Afghanistan. He builds a metal suit to escape and ends up deciding to fight crime with his Iron suit calling himself Iron Man.Iron Man is a great film, though not quite as terrific as the first two Spiderman's or Batman Begins (but certainly better than The Dark Knight). It has a great story some terrific action and special effects and Downey Jr just revels in his role of enjoyment bringing wit to an already decent script and humour. Terrence Howard as Rodney provides good support and Jeff Bridges as the villain Obadiah Stane is great. A terrific film this is as the story of how Stark wants and why he becomes Iron Man is built up nicely making him a more interesting character (similar to why Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins wanted and how he became Batman). This gives the story substance and the film intelligence and you actually care about Stark. I didn't love Iron Man, but I really did enjoy it. It's a pity the second didn't do as well, but this dosen't tarnish the first one's reputation. A new hero has been born.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of Marvel Comics, Iron Man is no stranger to me, and in watching this movie, I was hardly disappointed. Many aspects from the paperback issues were clearly woven into the storyline, featuring agents of the S.H.I.E.L.D. and one character who would later become known as War Machine. With every twist and turn, we are taken deeper into the destiny of Iron Man.Through amazing special effects and technology, we are given a back stage pass in watching how the Iron Man suit is developed and enhanced. We watch every trial simulation, laughing out loud at the mis-wirings and setbacks. In the end, we cheer as Iron Man comes to life and takes on a mighty foe.The one element that makes this movie so much more is the cast, and director Jon Favreau did a tremendous job in selecting the right people to step into this Marvel movie. The storyline carries heart and humor, and it keeps the action going. It is a non-stop ride to the end and worth watching over and over again, but can the sequel fulfill the extraordinary footprints left for it to chase?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not all superhero films are just for geeks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets face it. Spider Man 3 was a horrible mess. It was supposes to break summer box office records, but instead it broke audience's expectations of what was considered the last flawless superhero film franchise (excluding Nolan's Batman). Spidy's lackluster sales could have been a sign that superhero films had become super-over-hyped, perhaps reaching its plateau. But not according to Marvel Studios, the comic book company that's now a comic film production company. Marvel's first venture as a film studio; Iron Man, you know the guy in the metal suit? Well, maybe you don't. Unlike Marvel's big household names (Spider Man, X-Men, Hulk, Fantastic Four), Iron Man is considered a minor character in the Marvel universe, yet a major risk for Marvel to unveil as their opening act for the summer movie season, especially when last years fail-safe Spider Man 3 was such a train-wreck. Still, Marvel decisively put their trust in the hands of up and coming director Jon Favreau, and unlike Marvel's other minor characters (Daredevil, Punisher, Ghost Rider) they gave Iron Man a big budget with a Grade A cast and unlimited unrestraint. Fortunately Marvel's gamble paid off, because Iron Man may be the best comic book film since, well the first Spider Man.2007's comic-con offered the first glimpses of Iron Man through an exclusive trailer with an introduction by Favreau to appease the comic character's loyal fanbase. When the trailer leaked on the Internet however, the clip's merger of Iron Man footage with Black Sabbath's ubiquitous song "Iron Man" was for lack of a better word, tacky. Thankfully the trailer is the only tacky thing about Iron Man, as the film is the complete opposite, proving in spades Favreau's strength as a dramatic action film director. The story of Iron Man is the story of Tony Stark; the son of a rich industrialist tycoon who grew up not only with a silver spoon but a wit and intellect that made him a child prodigy. Zipping through school Tony became an expert in engineering and electronics; finishing MIT summa-cum-laude and helping create new technological advances, as well as becoming the natural heir to his fathers company, Stark Industries.Now of course, Tony's knack for technology will later help him in the area of armored robotic suits, but the real appeal of Tony Stark in the film is his richly sophisticated persona. Comic book Tony Stark is a stern and straightforward character, who, much like Bruce Wayne, leans towards the extravagant but is more business than pleasure. However, Stark, as played with exuberance by Robert Downy Jr., fully embraces the capitalistic side of the industrialist CEO and infuses Stark with his patented Downy Jr. charm and swagger that ultimately fits the decadent mogul to a tee. This is where Downy Jr. and Favreau shine in developing Stark; as Downy Jr. is practically the embodiment of this character in real life, while Favreau has perfected (a la Vince Vaughn in Swingers) the carefree capitalist who enjoys and revels in his capital.Although the audience revels in Stark's playboy lifestyle as well, we almost forget there is consequence behind his blithe. Stark Enterprises just so happens to be the U.S. Governments leading weapon's manufacturer and Stark's lavish empire is built on the creation of weapons of mass destruction. As Stark says "I be out of a job if there was peace"; a statement that normally would make him a corporate villain in today's world of corrupt politics and zero militant accountability, but Stark however is a CEO with a heart, (if that exists). A heart that eventually gets filled with shrapnel after nearly being blown up when he is captured by Afghani terrorists who order him to replicate a new and deadly Stark Industries missile. Confined in a cave, Stark does what any billionaire industrials would do: builds himself an armored suit and literally smashes his way out, thus, Iron Man is born. Upon recovery and return to the US, with the help of his friend, army pilot Jim Rhodes (Terrance Howard), and his beautiful and sharp personal assistant Pepper Pots (Gwent Paltrow), Stark decides to stop creating weapons for the government; a move that is defied and opposed by his corporate partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). Stark instead invests his time in making a new and advanced armor suit that he hopes will be better than any missile system.Besides the skin deep morality of over excess and not taking one's life for granted, there's much more depth in Tony Stark's plight in becoming Iron Man. Even though Stark is the embodiment of capitalism we root him not for his riches but for his sincerity. The audience cheered when Iron Man returns to the Middle East and simply becomes a one man army, literally hurling the terrorists around. In year five of the Iraq War more so than ever, America is looking for peace and solace to the problems overseas, and when watching Iron Man solve these problems in one fall swoop, it was a cathartic release of elation. In doing so, Iron Man is a superhero akin to Superman, because he lives for that old altruistic American dream that's seems so easily forgotten in today's cynical and materialistic world. Not only is this theme executed with perfection, but is also executed perfectly through the films roller-coaster superhero action tension with well balanced comic relief. All the actors are superbly cast in their roles and the chemistry between Paltrow and Downy Jr. is irresistible. Where a year ago Spider Man 3, had become too entangled in its own web, Iron Man surely has cleared those cobwebs, reminding us why superhero films are so much fun, and proving with the right intention and direction they are truly worth the hype.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvel Entertainment's most recent live-action rendition of a beloved character is the best yet. I don't say that lightly. I am a huge fan of both, the first Spiderman and X-men movies. Iron Man, however, beats them both. Robert Downey, Jr. brings his 'A' game as the Billionaire industrialist genius who's epiphany leads him to create the Iron Avenger. Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful as Stark's assistant, Pepper Potts, and gives her a depth that was years in the making in the comic books. Over all, this movie was clearly a labor of love. A number of the cast and crew, including Downey, claim to have been fans of the comic for years. Downey is reportedly to have even said he's willing to do 15 Iron Man movies. If they can keep Brett Ratner away from the project, the Iron Man franchise will be Invincible! 'nuff said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the movie that "Transformers" should have been: stimulating, witty, character-populated, and above all, fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the disastrously disappointing summer special effects extravaganza "Transformers" (2007), "Iron Man" was just the kind of movie to boost up my anticipations again for the big-budget action blockbusters. This was the sort of movie that "Transformers" should have been: action-packed, witty, intelligent, character-populated, plot-backed, and above all, fun. Whereas "Transformers" had me yawning thirty minutes in with its awful dialogue, two-dimensional characters, and lack of awe-inspiring moments from otherwise visionary special effects, "Iron Man" had me interested right from the start, mostly due to the stellar performance by Robert Downey, Jr. and although I felt the climax was a little less climactic than it should have been, the movie pulled itself through clear to the end.Robert Downey, Jr. stars at Tony Stark, a multibillionaire weapons manufacturer entrepreneur, who while demonstrating a new weapons system for the U.S. Army in the Middle-East, is captured by bloodthirsty insurgents, who critically wound him and then force him into building the same weapons for them. Dodging their supervision, Downey Jr. designs and constructs with miraculous success a mechanical combat suit that allows him to escape. Upon returning home, he immediately begins construction on a newer, better suit, which he then uses as his tool for fighting crime.It's at this point that "Iron Man" basically becomes your standard superhero movie, but it does it with such vigor and zest that one cannot help but be enthralled by it. But I think that a lot of people love the movie for the completely wrong reason. Yes, you get your money's worth with the special effects. They are terrific, just as good as the visuals in "Transformers." But what makes "Iron Man" so fun is because it has what "Transformers" did not have and severely needed: characterization. Part of the reason why Robert Downey, Jr. is so great in this movie is because he has real character material to work with. The Tony Stark character is charming because he is likable and three-dimensional, not just the standard mathematical genius who thinks he can do something good. But it doesn't just stop with him. The always interesting actress Gwyneth Paltrow gives a superb performance as his costar, but she doesn't become overworked into becoming the typical damsel in distress which we usually get in superhero movies. There is real chemistry between Downey Jr. and Paltrow, they have profound dialogue to work with, and their relationship does not evolve into a sappy overly romantic jinx.But in regards to the special effects, the genius is not because they are great, but because they are used imaginatively. Whereas the robots in "Transformers" only transformed, talked, and occasionally did some clashing with another robot, "Iron Man" uses its visuals to stimulate excitement, awe, and laughs that actually work out. But the movie does not just throw special effects after you one at a time. The movie is not about the fact that Iron Man can fly or shoot weapons and it does not lead solely up to these moments. It's just proof that special effects should be a *service to the film?part of what works, not the only thing that works.If I have any complaints, they are minor. The movie ran just a tad too for my liking and again, I felt the climax could have been more energetic and riveting like the previous three-quarters of the movie, but that's hardly a detractor from this otherwise stimulating and entertaining blockbuster.</fullReview>

Upon his successful mission and given his 3-month stint in a hell hole, Stark decides to re-assess his priorities by changing the image of his company. That does not sit well with his investors and board of directors and Stark's obstinacy only reveals and re-opens more cans of worms as the movie progresses.

This film is engrossing, entertaining and convincing. The action sequences are pretty impressive (except for the climax fight). The graphics in the film are well done without dominating the scenes. The climax fight is a disappointment.TAILPIECE: The difference between other comic heroes and Iron Man is that Iron Man is a playboy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found Iron Man to be very great and surprisingly entertaining. The beginning was pretty boring in a way but it picked up the pace and everything fell in its place, this movie was real good. The special effects they used and the cool stunts were really cool. Robert Downey Jr did a great job as Iron Man, along with the other characters. This movie has a great plot and it turned out real good. I didn't think that it was gonna be this good but I was pretty much surprised. Even though they're were a lot of talking in the beginning half, the action picked up the movie great in the second half. I love the Iron Man suit, the high-tech devices and all the technical things about it.Great Job, cant wait for Iron Man 2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoo yeah one of my favorite superheros come to life. This movie was a fantastic adaptation of the comic book series. The story was well done and moved along with smooth pace. Plenty of great action scenes that showed many levels of the suits powers. And I have to say Robert Downey Jr. was perfect for the part almost a alter ego of himself. Jeff Bridges was a evil bad guy. Gwyneth Paltrow looked good as Pepper Potts. One of the best things about this was that they built a real suit it was not all CGI like Hulk. You have to really respect that they built real suits for the special effects. Okay the real Iron man was created during the Vientam war and had multiple suits for different applications...but the concept was the same, bad guys say build me a weapon...so he does but not for them.Whoo I hope they make 4 of these!!Saw it twice in the theater and bought the DVD. Hey this may even inspire a whole new generation of robotic engineers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When they labeled this the 'Ultimate' edition DVD, they weren't joking around. There's more bonus material included in the special 2-disc edition Iron Man DVD than most people will ever find the time to make it through. And even if you're not a fan of all the extra bells and whistles, the movie itself is so entertaining it's worth adding to your permanent DVD collection. You don't even need to be a fan of comic books or superheroes to enjoy this first-class bit of film-making.There's an absolutely incredible collection of extras on the 2-disc edition including 12 deleted/extended scenes, a rehearsal sequence, a funny spoof, and Robert Downey Jr's screen test. But the highlights of the 2-disc DVD edition are the "I Am Iron Man" and "The Invincible Iron Man" features These are multi-part features provide in-depth info on the background of the character and the development of the feature film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay,first of all,why this movie is on n.237 of IMDb's list of 250 greatest movies is still a mystery to me. Yes,there is nothing ( in general ) wrong with this movie,but that is just the problem.I mean,Iron Man is not original movie one bit,yes the cast is great ( even Gvyneth Paltrou looks hot in this one! ),effects are great,but all in all,to me this is just an average movie. The only thing that is great about this movie is that the title character is played by probably the most popular actor today,Robert Downey Jr.,who is just a joy to watch.He portrays Tony Stark amazingly,and even ads a humorous side to the character.Also I love Jef Bridges as an actor that I haven't seen much lately.He does a good job playing the villain in this movie. So if Iron man 2 comes in the future ( and it most definitely will ) I will watch it...but... All in all,I give this movie rating 6 out of ten,and it gets one extra point only because of Robert Downey Jr. Again I say,watch it and you will see that this is just an average movie,there really is nothing special about this one... Does anyone agree with me?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I liked about this film is that it actually incorporates technology into it's plot, rather than simply relying on it for visual stimulation as many other films do. Robert Downey Jr. was just incredible. Right from the beginning you can't help but love him, even if sometimes you don't want to. The villains were a little typical though. And the film relies too much on action, when the action scenes, especially the final one, isn't really all that amazing. There is a great scene where Tony learns how to fly, and we see him fly over the Santa Monica boardwalk and L.A., which I found very cool.It was interesting to watch, and I enjoyed seeing the portrayal of a superhero who is a technical genius who, ultimately, uses his brain rather than brawn to... well, do whatever it is that Iron Man does.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the overblown Spider-Man 3 last year; and the special effects driven Transformers, I was beginning to think that Hollywood didn't know how to make a decent comic book movie anymore. Then Jon Favreau directed Iron Man. The first thing that he does right is casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. He brings a presence to the character that only he could and has the greatest one-liners that would even put Spider-Man to shame. Jeff Bridges, Terrance Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are also great in their supporting roles. I loved the banter between Pepper and Stark. However, some fans may be disappointed by the lack of CGI and action scenes but I think it works for the better. It's grounded in reality and unlike Transformers, this film has realistic special effects and the CGI seamlessly blends in with all of the practical effects; most notably the Iron Man suit. And after watching Stark tinker around with his first two prototypes (watching the scene in which he tries to fly is priceless), it's a real payoff when after an hour we finally get to see him in action. This makes more sense than other comic book adaptations because we get to see the suit in three different stages. And besides all the action it's the most fun I've ever had watching a movie. There are so many scenes that end with a punch you won't regret watching this with a large audience. Not to mention that it ends on a great note. Also, comic book fans will dig the hints at a sequel and especially the post credit scene. Fans in our theater went crazy. (I won't spoil it for you.) Bottom line, Iron Man Delivers what a good comic book film should. It may not have the brooding darkness of Batman Begins, or the over the top special effects of Transformers, but it's a fun movie that has a terrific blend of humor, a great story, and not to mention some kick-ass action to go along with it.</fullReview>

So If you like the comic genre movies that stick closely to the real story, you'll love this one! As for Rober Downey Jr., he was made for this role! He is finally going to get the recognition he deserves! The CGI is amazing and the wit is utterly adorable. Gweneth played Pepper perfectly as she always does. And you can't help but hate Jeff Bridges from the very beginning! You love him as an actor which makes hating him all the more perfect. I can't wait until the next movie!

		<fullReview>Iron Man. Another Marvel comic movie. That aside, it was a fun movie. Plenty of eye dazzling explosions and clever quips. Acting was good though it seems to me, someone who likes Robert Downey Jr., that he played the ruffly haired, wide eyed part a bit too much. My issues with the film were mostly of the story. Although I do recognize it is a comic book adaptation I found certain parts a little too hard to believe, even for a comic book. A certain military friend of the lead character does some things that I'm pretty sure would get him put in jail in the real world. I feel Iron Man's character was a little one dimensional, with the director attempting to fill his character in by very cliché means. He's a bad boy. Oooh look he listens to alternative rock. He doesn't follow anybody's rules. Yeah I get it. Yeah so a couple parts where I said, "Oh come ON" but it was a good watch, I was excited and clapping for some parts. I think I would have liked it in theatres, it definitely has a big screen movie feel. So while it wouldn't be my first choice in advising on rentals, I wouldn't advise against it either. This is one where you pretty much get what you expect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's amazing what a wonderful package director Jon Favreau gave us with this 2008 feature. I also have to applaud the excellent cast choice as far as appearance goes. I feel that Downey executed the role with flying colors. I was impressed with the accuracy Marvel kept with this new franchise, however, I can only say that overall, this movie came close to being a hit in my heart but no cigar.We are exposed to the whole origins of Iron Man in this movie. We are also given lots of high-end graphics, exploding action, and even a light risqué motif as we follow Tony Stark on his way to becoming the Iron Man we all know and love. I do have to say this, the movie built me up with so much consistency to the comic, non-stop action, and even though this day and age CGI is overused and has become a modern day film standard, the graphics were indeed, a work of art. Then we reach the ending. It does not matter if the movie gained 100/100 stars up until then. That ending killed it, and killed it fast. I was not pleased with how abrupt the franchise chapter closed, and found the teaser a touch cliché.So is this worth the time to watch and/or the money to purchase/rent? I would have to say yes for the younger audience. Overall, the film is a fun family feature, so do pass around the popcorn. I simply feel that it could have been done a touch different, and ended a little more cleaner. This is indeed apart of the curse of the year 2008, where a truly GREAT feature has yet to release, but I will cut this one as a GOOD film. Let's see what happens in the sequel.</fullReview>

Now Jeff has been around sound stages since he was a teen actor,&amp; proves he can do a villains role.Nearly all the action scenes are CGI (computer generated imaging).There are also many explosions.I was waiting for something exciting to happen. I guess I will have to wait till next weeks, let us hope I can tell you I liked those better.

		<shortDescription>so cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the super hero movies i've seen, this is definitely in my top 3. Going in order of Spider-man 2, Iron Man, and Batman Begins (which will probably be replaced with The Dark Knight).Some super hero movies have too many characters to have any good character development (xmen, fantastic four); and some have too many conflicts to have a consistent plot (spiderman 3...which i still love). A lot just really are not good (Hulk, Catwoman, Electra, Ghost Rider..). And a few come out masterfully, such as the top 3 that i've listed above...Iron Man is all about Tony Stark.. It goes way into detail about who he is and how he becomes iron man and his purpose and everything. He starts off as somewhat a douchebag and comes out the coolest effing super hero i've ever seen....with a purpose.It's a good combination of action, humor, fluent storytelling and action. Did i mention the action is awesome? Sure, it's quick, but it's awesome. The characters are likable and you realize that Robert Downy Jr was meant for this role. The casting was great, minus gwenyth paltrow who is not very good at acting in my opinion...also not all that hot. C'mon, superhero's love interest should be hot. ....Then again, Mary Jane in the Spider-man movies isn't that attractive...so maybe it's not a bad thing.. A hot female could distract from the main character. (that is why Fantastic Four fails, yet also succeeds with Jessica Alba).The plot doesn't move too quickly, in fact it takes its time in the first half..making sure everything is covered that the viewer should know. But the second half moves much faster..probably because this is where iron man really gets movin'... but overall it's able to keep your attention and not get boring...only when listening to pepper potts.The movie is also quite funny, all thanks to the sarcastic wit of tony stark. Stay after the credits and you're treated with an extra scene... i missed it. I'm going to have to go see it again so i can catch it. That, and it's definitely good enough to see twice.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plenty of Moving Parts In This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PlotTony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) travels to Afghanistan to showcase his new wares to the United States Army. The demonstration goes as planned, but on his way back to base he is attacked, injured and held for ransom by a local warlord. He is given materials and told to build weapons for his captors, only he plans for escape instead by constructing an armed metal suit. With the help of a fellow inmate he earns his freedom and is soon rescued. Upon returning home he surprises his business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) when he talks openly about not having his company manufacture weapons anymore. At the same time Tony is distancing himself from Obadiah he is growing closer to his longtime employee Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), but most of the hours of the day are spent designing and building a more advance version of the suit that he used to escape with.Character DevelopmentThe Tony Stark protagonist is such an unbelievably shallow character it would seem easy to let the performance just go as that, but there were degrees of change to show some growth from earlier scenes. Yet I wish Tony was not so wisecracking all the time and was a little more serious. The only thing that seemed to silence his manic streak were great pain and near death experiences. Mostly it was a consist state of clownishness. The rest of the cast played into this storm like a twister would suck up a farmhouse. Tony's character completely ran over everyone and everyone was a victim to it.ActingMost of the cast was quite enjoyable. Robert Downey Jr. played the lead well, Gwyneth Paltrow was very charming, but I will have to give the most accolades to Jeff Bridges for playing a rich and well-rounded part. He is the one who really brought this picture together.OverviewThere is plenty of moving parts in this movie so there is much joy in seeing them come together. The sides here shift and not everything is a known quality. It is clever in how the conclusion came together, which shows some forethought and planning on part of the writers and director. The overall completion definitely covers up the imperfections of the sum of its parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Jon Favreau blesses us with a masterpiece of an action packed sci-fi movie. He eloquently delivers to the viewer a movie that lives up to its expectations. Some people would go as far as to say it exceeds all expectations. In short, it is a movie any Iron Man comic fan would be proud of. Some of the notable cast members include Robert Downey Jr. who plays the role of the hot headed billionaire play boy Tony Stark who also happens to be an engineering genius, Gwyneth Paltrow who takes on the role of Pepper Potts, Terence Howard as Rhodey, air force pilot and best friend to Tony Stark and Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, Tony Starks right hand man at Stark Industries.Tony Stark is an engineering genius who runs a tech company contracted by the United States government to produces weapons of mass destruction for its arsenal. On one of his trips to the Middle East to introduce and test one of his new weapons, Tony Stark is kidnapped and forced to build a weapon for a terrorist organization. He builds an armored suit instead and uses it to escape his captors. This suit also works to keep the shrapnel from his heart. The result of a blast he endured while being kidnapped. When he returns to the United States, Tony Stark decides to abandon his passion for creating weapons of mass destruction after experiencing firsthand, the way his weapons were being used. Instead, he dedicates his time to building a more advanced and sophisticated version of his prototype armored suit. He uses this armor to defend the less fortunate.This story brings to light the social problems we face in today's world where an abundance of money is used by governments to fund their ridiculous defense programs rather than allocating resources to tackle the bigger problems such as famine and epidemics. One other movie that can be compared to this one is Batman. The rich philanthropist of a playboy who decides to use his riches to tackle social injustices and problems we face today.Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent job playing the role of Tony Stark. It is not a surprise, seeing as he and the character share a lot in common in terms of personality. He is Tony Stark through and through. If that side of the story does not impress you, then fear not because the visual effects will. The lighting alone is enough. The blue lights, the glossy finish to the brilliantly designed armored suit. All the technology! Its mind boggling. The scenes have been shot in very interesting ways to deliver the perfect three-dimensional experience. You will not be disappointed. It is indeed a sci-fi lover's dream come true</fullReview>

With a star studded cast of Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges &amp; actor/director Jon Favreau, gives this film it's edge that made it one of a kind.

		<shortDescription>Never Really Gets Started</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not uncommon for a film to take its time to really "start." It sets up the back story, establishes the characters, etc. When done right, this can be a rewarding way to begin a film. When done wrong, you get Iron Man. And when I say this film gets it wrong, I mean it like this: This film never starts. I quite literally waited the entire 2 hour run time for this film to really get moving, and it never did. One could make an argument that this is, in fact, an origin movie, and as a result, it is likely to be more slow-moving than other action-comedies. But there have been many origin stories (Spider-Man immediately comes to mind) that have managed to be thoroughly entertaining, and getting the point and origin of the main character across. Needless to say, Iron Man is no Spider-Man.As I have mentioned Iron Man is an origin story, specifically about a "playboy, philanthropist, genius" named Tony Stark. He gets seriously injured and captured by terrorists, so an electromagnet is planted in his chest to keep him from dying. In order to escape the terrorists, he builds a suit of armor, which then allows him to become (you got it) Iron Man.This is a story that could have been comfortably told in a single hour. And yet, it the run time is over 2 hours. Approximately 10 minutes of that represents the action sequences of the film. The rest of the movie is lots and lots of talking. I was amazed by how much meaningless dialogue there was in this film. The plot is simple enough. The characters are actually too simple. So I really don't understand why the majority of this film had to be devoted to conversation regarding the politics of war and weapons, and the formulaic romance between Tony Stark and his assistant Pepper Potts. It's a waste of time and an utter bore. Half of the dialogue could have been removed from the film, and nothing would be lost on the audience.Thankfully, not quite all of the conversation is unnecessary exposition. There are a meager handful of comedic scenes, that are actually very effective. Frankly, I wish there had been a greater focus on the comedy in Iron Man, because these short bursts of humor and chuckles were far more enjoyable than the rest of the film.Because even when the conversations have temporarily stopped to make way for flashy action sequences, the film is still a bore. The early action scenes with Iron Man are horribly dull, because he's essentially invincible. And even the climatic fight scene, involving Iron Man vs. the villain in his own Iron Man suit, is remarkably pedestrian; containing all the thrill and tension of a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots match.The characters are hugely under developed. Pepper Potts and Lt. Colonel James Rhodes (close friend of Tony Stark), have no personality to speak of. Tony Stark is also a fairly one-dimensional character, but he's likable enough, and receives the lion's share of the humor. The villain (the identity of which I'm really not sure is a spoiler or not, so I'll play it safe) has no distinguishing personality traits, but he's just menacing enough to suffice. And his performance is also pretty solid.The acting is decent all around. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is a perfect fit for the snarky hero. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stone is also surprisingly good in his role. And thanks to undeveloped characters, Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are utterly forgettable. As expected, Stan Lee has a quick cameo that earns a chuckle.The score, composed by Ramin Djawadi, is fairly bad. In part, because it's completely unmemorable, and also because of its rock music emphasis. The use of electric guitars, while arguably appropriate for the film, are never pleasant to hear, and all attempts at emotional or suspenseful music are generic and bland.Not so much flawed as it is dull, Iron Man is a long 2 hours. While snippets of comedy throughout are more than welcome, everything inbetween is tedious and uninteresting. Iron Man simply lacks almost any form of excitement, tension, or fun. The special effects may be shiny and pretty, but the entertainment just isn't there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Downey Jr. Sucked, Big-Time, As The Title Character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From where I'm sitting I'd say that the effeminate, "don't-muss-my-hair", Robert Downey Jr. was the absolute worst choice, bar none, to play the Tony Stark/Iron Man character.Tony Stark may have been a weapons designer extraordinaire and the darling-of-the-hour, but, hey, believe me, he certainly had a lot more money than he did sense. But, nevertheless, Tony Stark was destined to become more than just a nuts-n-bolts type of guy.When Tony wasn't designing fabulous weapons he was just a jaded, apathetic, alcoholic who really loved nothing more than to verbally humiliate, insult and degrade women.And, naturally, being Tony Stark, after he had verbally degraded the hottest chicks imaginable, they, of course, would get all wet for him. And then, without delay, it would be "wham-bam-thank-you-mam", before Tony was moving onto his next conquest.My-Oh-My! Wasn't life as a #1, billionaire, playboy just so rewarding and fulfilling? It really killed me the way that Tony Stark and Obadiah Stane kept dancing around one another like a couple of "horny-for-each-other" gays. With the way that they carried on, I was half-expecting that, soon enough, these 2 darlings would be jumping into the sack together for a little "in-out-in-out" just like a couple of randy comrades.To have made Tony Stark a "Super-Hero" at the end of this "Rocketeer Meets Robocop" flick was a literal joke and a half. Tony's change of heart from being a first-class crumb to a civic-minded do-gooder was about as insincere and pretentious as you could possibly get. And it was all made so frickin' laughable because precious, little Robert Downey Jr. was such a bloody bore and so totally unconvincing in his part.And finally - It sure helped to have the Afghanistan rebels portrayed in this film as being a bunch of absolute soul-less monsters - Real "dirt-of-the-earth". And annihilating the likes of them was so easy to do. Yeah. It was just as if Iron Man had literally wiped his crusty, tin-plated ass with them and then conveniently flushed them right down the toilet.Yep. Indeed. Iron Man is yet another prime example of why, over this past decade, superhero movies have become my least favorite genre of all (which, of course, makes them perfectly ideal for a damn-good trashing).P.S. - Did Iron Man's screenplay really require the input of 8 (!!!) contributing writers!?

		<shortDescription>I am Iron Man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is a superhero was created by Stan Lee, Don Heck and Jack Kirby and this character was published by Marvel Comics in 1963 making his first appearance in the Tales of Suspense series on issue number 39. Stan Lee wanted to create a business man superhero who dealt with weapons. He also appeared in The Avengers series in 1963 in the first issue; The character evolved over time until he finally got his very own independent series "The Invincible Iron Man" made in 1968. Around 2004, Marvel started their own independent film studio to make films based on their own comic books. Iron Man was the first film in 2008 after acquiring the rights to the character from New Line Cinema who had been trying to make a film adaption for almost 5 years with Director Joss Whedon. I was really hyped to see Iron Man hit the big screen and was wondering if this movie was going to be decent. My exceptions were perfectly correct!The plot involves the billionaire playboy, industrialist and ingenious engineer Tony Stark who goes to Afghanistan to demonstrate the new Jericho missile. After the demonstration, Stark gets wounded in an ambush and is imprisoned by a terrorist called The Ten Rings. (nice reference to The Mandarin) He is offered his freedom in exchange for building the missile he demonstrated, instead of keeping his word, Stark builds an arc reactor to power his electro magnet that keeps the shrapnel that wounded him from reaching his heart. He later builds a suit of armor in order to make his escape, after he's rescued by his friend James Rhodey, Stark announces that the company will no longer make weapons. He later on builds an improved version of his suit as well as a new arc reactor for his chest. Stark then discovers later on that Obadiah Stane is trying to replace him as head of Stark Industries. This is the Marvel film we've been waiting for a long time! Robert Downey Jr. did a perfect job on acting as the billionaire playboy, industrialist and ingenious engineer and I was totally impressed by how he portrayed Iron Man so well! Honestly, if anyone's going to take on the role of Tony Stark, I think it'll be hard for the new actor to fit into his shoes! We all want to be like Tony Stark considering how rich and intelligent he is, how he's got a personal jet with female dancers, a car collector and he is surrounded by many intriguing gadgets and technology! Robert Downey Jr. even wrote his own lines especially the Jericho speech! Director Jon Favreau choose Robert Downey Jr. because his personal problems in life shared many similarities to the character of Tony Stark. This actor is definitely a ton of fun to watch especially as Tony Stark!Now I'll go on to the supporting cast. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Tony Stark's love interest Pepper Potts. She's Tony Stark's best friend throughout the movie but by the end of the film, they become a couple. She does a good role of representing her character, she doesn't do a lot to start off with but as the movie progresses, she eventually becomes more interesting. Her relationship with Robert Downey Jr. is also fun to watch. Paltrow effortlessly sells as the assistant role. There's also James Rhodes played by Terrence Howard. He and Downey capture Stark and Rhodey's friendship very well on their scenes. While Rhodey is more serious, Tony isn't unless the situation calls for it and I like that!Finally, there's Obadiah Stane played by Jeff Bridges; he also does a great job of playing as the Iron Monger. In the first half of the movie, he's helpful and supportive to Tony Stark but in the second half of the movie, he tries to kill him and takes over his company. The rest of the supporting cast do a decent job as well especially Agent Coulson played by Clark Gregg. Also, please be aware that this movie is not about the actual Iron Man suit but it's about the man inside the suit but that doesn't stop Iron Man from being one of the greatest Marvel characters of all time! The Iron Man suit looks exactly like the suit in the comic book series and used the suit of armor from Tales of Suspense 39 and I'm proud of that!The effects for the armored suit are very well rendered and fit with the environments perfectly! From the escape scene to the fight in Afghanistan, the action and the effects makes the scenes all memorable! The soundtrack is also really good and fits well with the action! Overall, Iron Man is a must buy for comic book fans out there (including myself considering that I already owned the movie and will never sell this movie) and people who enjoy action flicks! If you haven't seen this, then clearly your missing out on such a bad ass film! I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this movie! Go see this film when you have the chance! I want to talk about the ending because I can't hold it in any longer so if you don't want any spoilers about the ending then please stop here. Nick Fury is played by Samuel L. Jackson and shows up in the end of Stark Industries to talk about the Avengers Initiative. (HOLY S***) People have been saying that they recognize Nick Fury as a white person. However, in 2001, Marvel asked Samuel L. Jackson if they can use his likeness for an alternative version of Nick Fury and Samuel agrees. The casting couldn't be any better!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(asperger review) My vote: 6.5/10, I think. I didn't really love it. Why? Because the beginning is very long, plus we have to wait an hour before we see Iron-man. There are some long scenes and that's what bored me the most. I really wanted to find it very good but it lead to my deception. Anyway I thought the technology was super good, cool! Really liked it. The actor plays very well the Iron-man/Tony Stark character. The casting is very well organized. They all have good roles. It has good, strong technology/action. The Iron-man equipment is so cool. I really like the red color on it and the light placed at the center of its body. It fits very well for a super-hero movie. It is very elegant!!! The director built an excellent one! I loved the special effect at the beginning of the film. Iron-man has excellent powers and force. He acts well in his battle against evil. I've never seen Iron-man 2 but I hope the filmmaker made it better than the first part. I just hope! Good try, anyway. My name is Constantin O'Rourke and I am fourteen years old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?Heavy boots of lead Fills his victims full of dread Running as fast as they can Iron Man lives again? - Black SabbathMan builds technological killer app. Another man takes his work and makes bigger version of technology. They fight. The story of Steve Jobs versus Bill Gates?; no, Tony Stark vs. Obadiah Stane or really Iron Man vs bald Jeff Bridges with facial hair cut in menacing way not like he had it in The Big Lebowski. Without short-changing the movie, that pretty much wraps up the plot and it doesn?t even take that much of Iron Man to dispense with Iron Man-wannabee. There was an attempt at building a morale to the story but I think it was something like weapons are bad and super-weapons are like?worse.? The real draw here is to see Robert Downey, jr. as a superhero. As daft as that concept sounded before I saw the film, Downey is Iron Man or rather Tony Stark: drunk, overindulged, immature and following in his father?s footsteps. As someone I discussed the movie with said: ?it takes a wealthy cocaine addled playboy to really capture a wealthy, alcoholic playboy?. Jeff Bridges is also not who you would think of as super-villain material but apparently he can play anything well. Seriously, when the last thing you say him in when he wasn?t believable? In short, this was an entertaining way to kill off two hours on a Friday night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I know it's a build up of how Tony Stark became Iron Man, but it would have been much better if it had more Iron Man in it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't a awesome spectacular superhero movie, but it's still well crafted and entertaining. Iron Man is a Marvel superhero that stood out to me and in this, it gave me more interest in Iron Man and even Tony Stark the man behind the suit. Robert Downey Jr. really carried the movie in this as Tony Stark, the way he acted felt close to the comic book. Not exactly like the modern comics that has Iron Man in it but close enough. This is a origin of how Iron Man came to be and the build up of it all is nicely done. The build up is a long process but I wasn't necessarily bored by just watching how Tony Stark becomes the Iron Man. Jeff Bridges did a great job playing Obadiah Stane, he didn't have a lot to work with here. But when he was on the scene his presence was ominous and fit right in while also being intriguing to watch. I watched the movie "Enron: The Smartest Guys In The Room" and he reminded me of the greedy and power hungry higher ups in a company. It's a shame his character wasn't developed all that well, but again this movie is about Tony Stark. Gwyneth Paltrow also did a good job of playing Pepper Potts, she did the perky and cute assistant thing well. The main flaw about this movie is that it just doesn't have enough Iron Man in it. I know the build up had to be a long process to show how it all happened in a short amount of time as possible but it would have been nice if it had like 2 or at least 1 more scene with Iron Man in action. Overall though this is a well crafted superhero movie that is a good blend of realistic and sci-fi that fits right into a comic book universe. It's a shame the next sequel won't be as good. But looking forward to "The Avengers" movie which is hinted at the end of the credits. This movie ended in a very good note as well and will leave the audiences excited.7.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly just more action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ironman sports a gifted cast, first-rate visuals, and is great fantasy. It's also action bloated, preposterous, and over the top. I have never been much a fan of the superhero genre and this installment in the Marvel saga only confirms my dislike. The action scenes get so stupid that you can barely focus without laughing. Some of the action is so preposterous that by the time the movie ends we almost start laughing. The acting is great though and the visual effects are impressive, but when it comes down to the facts; Ironman is just another Summer Blockbuster made for the purposes of money and an uncreative chapter of visual storytelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who follows American cinema closely, I followed "Iron Man's" marginalized cinema - - how the production apparatus inevitably imbibed the film's own narrative's formula of "using and disposing" stuff. I don't care HOW PRECIOUS Terence Howard was in the negotiating process for the negotiation of Iron Man II. The P.R. debacle of firing a black man and replacing him with another black man (even if that man was/is the most amazing Don Cheadle), was horrific. Such an exchange emerged as an egregious act of exchanging one "black commodity" for another "black commodity." And, I plan to write on the 'white boy' mentality, at end, of this director/writer.

		<shortDescription>One of the best yet from Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the success of the X-Men and Spiderman, it was inevitable that Marvel would eventually bring Iron Man to the big screen. At first, I envisioned a number of other top flight actors in mind for the part of Tony Stark but Robert Downey Jr. was not only the right choice but proved to be the main reason the film is such a huge hit.The action scenes are outstanding and the Iron Man suit is very impressive, making all the scenes in the suit worth the price of admission but the script and the performances are the real assets of this film - top rate. The witty and split-second dialogue are perfect for Downey Jr. and he plays it brilliantly - he and Jeff Bridges scenes are especially enjoyable and Bridges holds his own with the humor as well.*Spolier Alert: The scene where Tony is in his lab, first trying out his technology that will eventually become his suit - is hilarious - his charming relationship with his clumsy but loyal home-built robot assistant is particularly good but the part where, testing the suits thrust boosters, Tony slightly miscalculates and goes flying into the wall gets a laugh from me every time. The rest of the cast is good - Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and Clark Gregg as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Coulson all give good performances and director Jon Favreau deserves credit for direction, balancing excellent actions sequences with clever humor. This movie rates as one of top entries in the Marvel films - and don't leave until you see the scene after the credits.Iron Man in the upcoming Avengers movie should be a real treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The storyline centers on the billionaire CEO of Stark Industries, a major manufacturer of military weapons. Iron Man begins with the main character Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr., being ambushed and captured by war criminals abroad. Forced by his captors to build one of the most destructive missiles, Tony uses his ingenious engineering skills to build a protective bodysuit instead, based on the strong properties of iron. Using his intellect and this newly created iron suit, Stark manages to escape his kidnappers, eventually returning to the United States. Upon his return home, Tony continues to make improvements and additions to the iron suit, while at the same time trying to keep this piece of advanced technology out of the wrong hands.The overall theme of the movie is the traditional idea of a human superhero, making use of their intelligence, resources, and determination in an effort to fight evil in the world. Before Iron Man made its appearance in theaters, Batman Begins, released in 2005, emphasized a similar superhero theme. The main character Bruce Wayne, played by Christian Bale, must use his wealth, skill, and intellect in the absence of any superhuman powers to fight crime in Gotham city. Both films take a single character capable of great good, and explore their abilities to better the world, all the while maintaining two identities ? the masked superhero and company CEO.Iron Man takes advantage of unique camera angles and the historic motif. Many intense scenes in the film take place off the ground, allowing the cinematographer to bring an in-flight feeling to the audience in an attempt to keep everyone on the edge of their seat. Such camera angles support the theme by highlighting the ingenuity of the human spirit, but never going as far to say the main character had superhuman powers. The camera work does an excellent job demonstrating how Stark uses technology as an extension of his own desires and as a way to compensate for the physical limitations of the human body. The film also honors its roots by keeping the red and gold colors of the famous iron man suit. The designs in the movie align with previous images of the suit created by the film's predecessors.Robert Downey Jr.'s acting brings the quick-witted, humorous side of Tony Stark to life on the big screen. His return to film brought about a stunning performance and a box office hit. His talents along with an impressive lineup of co-stars and action sequences made Iron Man's movie debut a huge success. It was quite fitting that the leading role in Iron Man is played by someone who recently overcame personal battles and grew into his potential, much like the human superhero theme portrayed in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, I just flat-out love Iron Man. It's right up there with Raimi's first two Spider-Mans, X2, and The Incredibles on my list of favorite non-Christopher Nolan superhero flicks. To start out with, Robert Downey Jr. is simply one of the single most talented actors working today and has been one of my favorites since Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, and he absolutely rocks in this movie. He's alternately awesome and hilarious through the whole runtime, and no one else gives the quirky yet always entertaining line readings Downey Jr. delivers without fail. Also, after nearly a decade of dead-eyed, snooze-inducing performances, I have to say that Gwyneth Paltrow kind of shocked me here with hitherto-unprecedented sparkle and pep and energy. I guess the director promised her a cookie if she acted because she really lit up the scenes she was in and is one of the best superhero love interests I've ever seen on screen.But more so than love interests, we go to superhero movies for action, at which Iron Man excels. Jon Favreau had a bit of special effects practice in Elf and more in Zathura, but this was his first full-blooded action flick, and I think that might be what makes the action so damn good. He's never "learned" any of the wrong, Michael Bay-esquire action tricks of cameras haphazardly swinging in the fray or ultra-spastic cutting that makes the action hard to watch by awkwardly trying to make you feel like you're in it or something, and as a result the action scenes are gorgeous and entertaining. Iron Man fights dudes, and the camera actually stays on the action in smooth noncutting wide shots that let you see and enjoy everything. Almost every action scene in the flick is like that, shot in a wide, clean way that is so very refreshing. This gets a monumental thumbs up from me.Beyond that (this is the "checklist of other cool things" paragraph), the special effects are some of the best I've ever seen. There's nothing precisely innovative about them, but it's Industrial Light &amp; Magic at the peak of their powers, and nothing in the whole movie made me think "fake!" at all. The Iron Man character, while I had no knowledge of him before seeing this movie, is really fun and has pretty sweet powers. And the comedy in the film is incredibly strong; this has a lot to do with how funny Downey Jr. is, but the movie has a pretty massive amount of slapstick and one-liners and other hilarity (probably even more than Spider-Man 2) that won huge and consistent laughs from me.If the movie has any weaknesses, it's the plot and the music. Not that there's anything wrong with the plot at all, it just won't surprise you. It's a pretty basic and utilitarian superhero origin story, with most of the major goings-on in regards to the the villain and the hero's character progression pretty traditional. A montage of the hero honing / practicing his powers, the hero's love interest being threatened by the villain, and all that. It's just done exceptionally and unusually well. And the music, while again having nothing exactly wrong with it, lacks any truly memorable theme for the Iron Man character. Although I suppose it would be hard to make a theme more iconic than the Black Sabbath "Iron Man" riff, so they're excused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>7,9 points, I wasn't expecting that. For a movie to deserve such a high rating, it should have something special, or something new. This is a good movie, no doubt. But it isn't intellectual, it isn't moving and it isn't creative. God, it isn't even extraordinary atmospheric. Yes, it's entertaining, very entertaining - I must admit. Of course it has amazing special effects. - But that just isn't enough for me to give it 8 points. I expect more from movies.The story is bad, and totally didn't convince me. But, and this is the true strength of the movie, it's told detailed and well. If you take a closer look at the story, you will realize how simple and uninteresting it is ? but the movie does a great job of hiding it. The same goes for Jeff Bridges. He does a great job of hiding how boring his Character is. Filmmakers have such crazy freedom in Superhero movies, sadly they rarely use it. They could have been so much more creative.7.9 points for Iron man. I still can't believe it. X-men, the Tim Burton Batman movies and Watchmen are all rated worse, but are far superior in my opinion. They are more creative, atmospheric and more fun to watch than Iron Man.7 points from me. Because it's a good movie after all. I'd give it 6.5 if I could. 6 seem to little, and 7 too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now a lot of superhero movies came out since the early 2000's, it became blockbusters such as Spider Man, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk, etc. But Iron Man is one of them.It stars Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow etc.The playboy wolf and genius Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the successful CIO of the Stark Industries, a weapon company founded by his father. His second in command is Obadiah Stane, who worked with his father, and his loyal and professional secretary is Pepper Potts, who has a crush on Tony. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate the ultimate Jericho missile developed by his company, his military convoy is attacked and Tony is seriously wounded on his chest and kidnapped by a group of rebels that wants him to assemble a missile for their use. Tony stays with his abductors for three months and develops a powerful metallic armor to escape from the cave where he is arrested. He decides to stop manufacturing weapons in his company under the protest of Obadiah, and dedicates his time to improve the armor, manufacturing it with gold and titanium and installing a propulsion system to fly. However, Pepper discovers that Tony was betrayed by Obadiah, who is using Tony's data to build prototype armor for him, transforming it in the ultimate weapon.But when I came out of the theater, I was very impressed!! Just as good as Transformers.Robert Downey Jr. did an awesome job as the lead role, can't wait for Iron Man 2!!Iron Man gets 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say that I can name one particular plot twist from issue #x of series wutever. Nor do I desire the capability to do so. No offense to those who dress up in their pagan attire and go to large conventions to fellowship with their fellow fanatics, so let me just say what I feel needs to be said about this film: This here new fangled moving picture is so gol dang over rated.Special effects were good. But it ends there. No original story line to speak of. The acting by Junior was okay, maybe a notch above average, but that's about it. Though Gwenyth is a knockout, she just didn't deliver the screams and lines of devastation well enough to convince me that she's really a "damsel in distress". Th bad guy is a steryotypical bald guy who wants to make lots of things that go "Bang" and make lots of money that way. The cast is mediocre to put it....lightly. But one thing I could appreciate, besides the effects, was the one or two dialogue pieces containing some snappy banter.A 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony Stark constructs a new iron suit of destruction to use for good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the Worlds biggest creator of weaponry. He is captured by terrorists after showing the use of his new missiles and somehow escapes his enemy by the invention of a strong metal suit.If some terrorist were using your weapons for killing people, wouldn't you stop making them for one thing and try and stop them from hurting civilians. Also if you figured out your business partner is going against you for power and to take your spot, you would stop him from becoming to powerful, wouldn't you? When people are greedy they want the power and to be the one everyone answers to instead of vice versa. This movie most likely reminds me of Transformers with Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox. With aliens from space, that transform from cars into machines with guns throughout that movie to protect a cube from getting into enemy hands.Downey Jr. plays the character of Stark so well I don't think they could have picked a better actor for this role. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is convincing as a redhead and has a romantic tie in the movie to Stark having been by his side as his assistant all his years of his work with Stark Industries. Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is the bad guy in this film who just wants to be a step above stark as the CEO of Stark industries. This movie should give you a boost in your view of comic movies and have you wanting to see the next best movie with more technology, movies are becoming something different and more spectacular than we could only imagine. Plus also a romance between Potts and Stark comes into play through the movie because she has always been there for him throughout the years to help him with whatever he needs and realizes that she is the only one person he can count on in the end.Robert Downey Jr. is the son of underground filmmaker Robert Downey Sr.. His first part in a movie was in his father's Pound (1970), in which 5-year-old Downey played a puppy. During traffic stop for speeding, he was arrested for drunken driving, possession of heroin, and possession of an unloaded pistol in his pickup truck. This was his first reported brush with the law at age 31. He was given a suspended prison sentence of 3 years, and granted probation with requirements of random drug testing and drug counseling. Which was just two years before Iron Man came out. It is amazing how he changed his life around which is really someone to look up to I think, because some people can relate to his situation. Before he starred as Iron Man (2008), Downey had done films with three of the actors who played Batman: with George Clooney in Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005); with Val Kilmer in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005); and with Michael Keaton in Game 6 (2005).Continuing with his acting career Downey Jr. release of Shelock Holmes is only days away coming out on Christmas Day. Along with that he is working on the second film for Iron Man 2 to be released in the earlier months of 2010. His movie Sherlock Holmes I have only seen the preview for about a dozen times throughout watching movies or just on television. For Iron Man 2, it looks like there is to be more villains and more romantic ties with Pott's character played by Paltrow. Terrence Howard having been a fan of the comics of Iron Man plays Colonel Rhodes head of the Weapons Development. Which in part I though he played his character well so when he asked to be in the second Iron Man they didn't give him that approval to continue with his character. The actor to take the part of Colonel Rhodes will be played by Don Cheadle and the villains Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson and Ivan Vanko / Whiplash played by Mickey Rourke which are just some of the main characters to look forward to in the second Iron Man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is a remake of the bizarre and pointless Australian film Testi: Iron Man. That film was black and white and messed up. America doesn't like that sort of thing (neither do me) so they decided to turn it into an excitement film instead. Interestingly though, neither film features any appearances from any Black Sabbath member. There could have been a fight between Iron Man and Tony Iommi, or Ozzy could have been supplying Robin Downy Jr with drugs and liquor, but maybe then this wouldn't have received the U rating.The film is a rip off of Batman- a billionaire playboy who is worth millions, I can't remember his name, likes to build robots and sell them to bad guys in places like Egypt. He is bored with his life and fancies a change so he turns himself into a half man half machine half bird creature, and calls himself Iron Man. After his parents are murdered he realises his purpose is revenge. He covers his body in the latest weaponry- guns, lasers, big knifes, and learns to fly. After a brief training montage (running up hills, lifting cars, shooting targets showing his skill and fitness progress) he flies to a terrorist country and kills the bad guys. That's about it really. Quite shallow, but some good actions and graphics. I don't think anyone else famous was in the movie though I was pretty drunk on whiskey while watching it. I think it was an attempt to start a new franchise so maybe more things will happen in the next film. The Man Of Steel will return to a cinema near you next year or two! Best Scene: When Iron Man is learning to fly and he keeps zooming into the ceiling of his barn and whacking his head. What a chump!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing; good effects and two good performances aren't enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really do not like CGI. I think 90% of the time it looks cheap and phony, an opinion which is exacerbated by the fact that those "cheap" effects cost tens of millions of dollars. So I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself enjoying the effects in IRON MAN. Unfortunately, the special effects were one of the only things I did enjoy about this boring, uneven movie.As they almost always are, Robert Downey, Jr and Jeff Bridges are both excellent in their roles. Downey brings a genuine "flawed hero" pathos to his character, and Bridges is admirably malevolent as the money and power hungry villain, a reflection of what Downey would have become if his hint of a conscience hadn't finally woke him up.The Iron Man suit is a joy to behold every time it's on screen. The opening escape scene in the makeshift suit and the final battle are both superbly thrilling action sequences.Unfortunately, what lumbers along in between these scenes is largely a big bore. The screenplay is a mess, with some ridiculous lapses in logic (even comic book logic) and lousy dialog. The tone of the movie repeatedly switches from realistic and gritty to cartoonish and campy, but with no style or finesse to make the transitions work. And several scenes seem to be incomplete, as if pages of dialog were reduced to a few awkward lines.Two key supporting performances are so bad it's amazing they didn't wind up on the cutting room floor. Terrence Howard is wooden and appears completely bored with his role as Downey's military buddy. I personally am not surprised Aat his being recast by Don Cheadle in the sequel. Gwyneth Paltrow is simply bewildering as Downey's assistant, playing the part of a woman who somehow keeps this billionaire weapons designer's existence in order as a nervous, dim-witted bubble head. She joins Katie Holmes and Kate Bosworth in the "normally good actresses who for some reason turn in lousy performances in superhero movies" club.There's a lot to like about IRON MAN, but there's more to dislike. I doubt I'll be racing to the multiplex for IRON MAN 2. Then again, we have a new screenwriter and at least one better actor. Maybe getting rid of some dead weight will help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man is a Solid Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Stark is a playboy who also happens to be an engineering genius. While in Afghanistan demonstrating a new missile he has developed he's captured and wounded. The captors want him to assemble a missile for them but instead he creates a suit of super armor along with a device to prevent his own death from some shrapnel that was left in his chest by the attack and not removed by the hostage takers. He uses the suit to escape. Back in the U.S. he announces his company will cease making weapons and he begins work on an updated armored suit only to find that Obadiah Stane, his second in command at Stark industries has been selling Stark weapons to the very people that had arranged his capture to begin with. Stark then uses his new suit to return to Afghanistan to destroy the arms and then to stop Stane from misusing his research. What prevails is a new superhero Iron Man.Jon Favreau, who directs the film, was the perfect choice for Iron Man as he is a lifelong fan of the comic book hero. He even makes a cameo in the movie. The gadgetry is amazing and well done along with the computer wizardry that combined with the humor of the whole thing gives a relaxed feeling to the movie. Robert Downey, Iron Man himself, utilizes his bad boy persona in his acting characterization of Tony Stark. His performance is right on the money and very enjoyable. The weakest link here is Jeff Bridges who plays Stane, Stark's nemesis in the film. This movie is an above average film to capture a superhero in a first movie. ***/****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film, much better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man hits just about every note nearly perfectly. The tone is light but not saccharine, look is fresh, visuals beautiful without drawing attention to themselves, acting fine, writing very good, plot way better than the usual comic-inspired film. Much better than I was expecting. If this is an example of what Marvel Comics can do when it has full ownership of the movie making process, then I hope they make many more. Very, very well done in all aspects.Downey's character had a change of heart in the film, but stayed true to character. His performance was funny, touching, tough, gentle and human. Paltrow created a nuanced character with fragility, wit, grace, charm, self-doubt, perseverance. Terrence Howard played an excellent sidekick with dignity, foibles, incredulity. Jeff Bridges had the only really "comic book" bad guy role, and I found his version lacked nuance. Maybe that's appropriate for the type of character as written, but I found it to be the least convincing. His deviousness and double-crossing nature were present, but his badness was hammy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do we HAVE TO like superhero movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This must be the most overrated movie in recent years. It seems to me that most viewers and critics are afraid to be negative commenting this movie. In almost all cases, I can agree with the IMDb score. I believe this movie does not deserve more than 5, at most! IMDb does not give extra points for special effects, does it? I understand that the plot follows a story in a comic book. Well, this does not make the story any better. There is nothing new in this movie; it is all cliché to the second power. The movie is not realistic at all. Some may say it does not have to be realistic well, it should at least follow the laws of physics, should it not? The movie is well made for sure from the outside. The story is unfortunately very weak and not interesting. At couple of occasions, it tries to be funny, but it becomes pathetic instead. Oh, did I mention that the movie is too long and very slow? There are at least 40 minutes of the film that could be cut off from the movie with no harm to the story.With this huge budget, some very good movies could be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great superhero film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'm not a huge fan of superhero movies, some of them prove to be worthwhile. "Iron Man" has plenty of moments that make it an enjoyable film to watch. The scenes toward the beginning feature Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr., who plays his role well) building an iron superhero suit inside a cave to protect himself from his enemies who have captured him. These are some of the best scenes in the film, as it is fascinating to watch him build this suit from scratch. Toward the middle of the film, Stark tries to improve on his outfit, and watching his many failed attempts get somewhat boring after a while. The movie picks up with good action scenes toward the end. The final scene, without giving it away, is also brilliantly done. There are also plenty of good laughs as well. There are funny moments, such as Stark asking for a cheeseburger after returning home. It's well worth seeing, and I enjoy it even more each time I see it.. Stay after the credits for a final scene; this one is worth waiting for.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies of the Summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-So as a comics fan I just had to see "Iron Man" the first day it came out. My father and I came an hour before the showing just to get decent seating. We were pretty excited. -The hype all started about a year ago when teaser posters of Iron Man's head starting popping up at all the cons. People started to get excited for the film, but hype caught fire when the first trailer for the film hit the internet. The trailer showcased a real, modern story and a character the people can relate to. -"Iron man" is one of the top ten highest grossing films of all time. Is it due to the hype? Is it due to the massive marketing? Well, that certainly is a good part of it, but I don't feel that fully explains the film's success. -Something that I've repeatedly run across in "Iron Man" talkbacks on various forums is that fans seem to be calling the film the "Batman Begins" of the Marvel Universe. After watching the film I would have to agree with that. Unlike the Spider-Man and X-Men films (which are all good :)) the story takes place in the real world which I can guess makes it The Batman Begins of the Marvel Universe. -If you didn't already know, "Iron Man" covers the origin of the superhero. Tony Stark is presenting a demo of his new weaponry, the "Jericho", in Afghanistan. Eventually Stark is captured and taken hostage. For his life he must build another "Jericho" missile for the bad guys. Well, instead of building the missile he decides to make the pre-Iron Man suit to escape. -Something that deserves to be noted(and has been noted a lot already!)is the chemistry between Gweneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Junior. What a dynamic! And a good one too. Most movies have some of the most boring romances, however this one never seems to fall short of entertaining. -Now lets talk about Iron Man himself. Iron Man isn't exactly the most traditional superhero considering his day job is a weapons manufacturer. However that doesn't last forever. After his weapons are stolen by his captors, innocent civilians of Afghanistan are in danger and Tony Stark changes his ways. Robert Downey Junior shows such character development and is both heroic and humorous at the same time. -This is the most entertaining movie I have reviewed yet and is one of the greatest comic book films I have ever seen. Iron Man is a truly amazing movie with a good story, great action, and and unforgettable characters. A+P.S. What Marvel is doing with their new movies is very brave. Stick around after the credits and you'll see what I'm talking about. What they are doing could be HUGE.</fullReview>

Robert Downey Jr. is amazing in the lead and Terrence Howard, Paltrow and Bridges are great as well.

		<shortDescription>Hard-hitting humor...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hard-hitting humor is the saving grace: it makes what might've been just another celluloid superhero flick something worth watching. (IRON MAN also boasts what is by far the funniest Stan Lee cameo appearance ever.) Like L. Frank Baum's Tin Woodsman, Tony Stark is in search of a heart- and he finds it. It's refreshing in a big budget fx fest to find a soft, chewy caramel center. Unfortunately, the producers of THE INCREDIBLE HULK (the latest version) weren't quite as capable of finding said center. Good, but by no means the achievement that IRON MAN is, THE INCREDIBLE HULK reminded me more than a little of the original SUPERMAN serial (with Kirk Alyn), wherein our hero literally transformed into a cartoon every time he took to the skies. (I don't recall that happening in the original CAPTAIN MARVEL serial, nor the ROCKET MAN serials.) By excising the bothersome human element, the producers of THE INCREDIBLE HULK have simply given us another cgi cartoon crowded with real folks who seem oddly out of place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highest Example of Making a Great Picture and a Faithful Comics Adaptation in one Movie! See it before it's relegated to Videoland and the DVD Forever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AH! A Movie Comic Book adaptation; it's one of my favourite desserts! Being both a film buff and an old Comic Book guy, dating from the olden days of 1957, this is just a perfect sort of a review for this kid. They can be so much fun; yet, such a pain in the ass!THE latter attribute above is due mainly to the tendency of the screen writing and directorial fraternities in monkeying around with characters, identities and (so often) origins. I suppose that you could call me a sort of purist, in that sense; perhaps even a "Comicological Conservative" of sorts. Guilty, Guilty is my plea to that charge! SO, what's my penalty, the sentence already?TAMPERING with successful Comic Strips and Comic Books (remember, they're not exactly the same thing!) has long been a standing tradition in Hollywood; along with the same treatment applied to the Comic Strips/Books close relatives, the Pulp Magazine and Radio Series Adventure Characters. We suppose that this may be some way of justifying the writers' and directors' jobs and their oft outrageous $allarie$. HENCE, we saw so many glaringly erroneous examples of false adaptational zeal; that indeed seemed to have been the rule, rather than the exception. The addition of characters as well as settings and names all were deemed to be fair game.EXAMPLES abound in the Sound Serial Adaptations; such as: in DICK TRACY (Republic, 1937), the first of 4 Tracy Chapterplays, Detective Tracy's main squeeze is names Gwenn; whereas we all know that it was Tess Trueheart from day one in Chester Gould's Comic Strip. For FLASH GORDON'S TRIP TO MARS (Universal, 1938), the venue was transformed to the Red Planet from the original setting in adapting the Sunday Comic Strip continuity "The Witch Queen of Mongo", featuring Queen Azura.EVEN the best of the Comic Book Hero Serials were guilty of unnecessary variant scenarios. As case in point, we present THE ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL (Republic, 1941); which transplanted the Comic Book Origin from a deep, dark old subway tunnel to meting the Wizard, SHAZAM, in a Tomb in a remote part of Siam (which looked suspiciously like L.A.'s Griffith Park). SPY SMASHER (Republic, 1942) gave the main character &amp; Spy Smasher's alter-ego, Alan Armstrong, a twin brother, Jack! (Get it, Schultz, Jack Armstrong!). But these elements were easily overlooked. Because of the fine adherence to the rest of the story lines and the rendering of action and special effects; even the strictest of constructionists (like yours truly)could both forgive and overlook."CAMP" Humor that was injected into the BATMAN Television Series (Greenway/20th Century-Fox/ABC TV, 1966-1968) did not do as much harm; as the heart of the Batman feature was intact, the Villains were right from Comics Pages and even the best episodes were adapted right from the stories in Detective Comics and Batman Comics Magazine.AS for our brand spankin' new IRON MAN (Dark Blade/Fairview/Road Rebel/Marvel/Paramount, 2008) accomplishes much on its own; while maintaining the original elements of Origin and the general tone of the Iron Man feature. There was no attempt to improve on the original. And yet, the feature is now over 40 years old; ergo, there would have to be some certain degree of adaptation, if only to make connection with our world of today.IN updating the international situation of then as opposed to now, we find that the new production was wise enough to infuse the elements of the War Against the Islamic Fascist Terrorists; as that is surely the problem we face today. During Iron Man's original run, Mr. Stan Lee would most often use phrases such as "?.So, Red Star, You are just another Slave to Your Kremlin Masters!" ?.in addressing the Enemy. The villains were tailor made to the Cold War; such as the Red Chinese super operative, as well as Road Show Fu Manchu, The Mandarin.DIRECTOR John Favreau, who has displayed such diversity in working before and behind the camera, had the good sense to strike a fine balance between the serious and the escapist; the action scenes being punctuated by the use of great humour and fine comic relief, which hits the old funny bone of the juvenile viewer as well as the older, more sophisticated SEX AND THE CITY female set. Our favourite exponent of the smart, modern, even 'hip' humour is the super loyal (and loving) secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Her explanation of her duties to the young female reporter, recently bedded by Mr. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) being "?Sometimes I have to throw out the trash!" THE villainy other than that of the Islamist Fascist Terrorists and Insurgents is provided by one of our favourite players. Jeff Bridges provides the dangerous opponent of the enemy within. As Obediah Stane/The Iron Monger, he serves up a double dose of treachery; both with unfathomable greed in the Corporate Board Room and in the Middle Eastern Theatre of War, as a sort of 5th Column Collaborator.LET'S see, what else? Oh, yeah the original musical score by Ramin Djawadi is excellent in both the overture (theme) and the incidental music (mood &amp; action queues). It is apparent that a lot of thought was given to the original composition as it is truly fashioned to order for the Iron Man Saga. Obviously Jon Favreau had familiarity with the character from reading the "Jokebooks" as a kid and teen.AS for the Special Effects, what can we say? They are outstanding and speak for themselves. Their movement and the way they seamlessly are blended into the proceedings are as fine as those of any, even those of SPIDERMAN II and III. Man, those Special Flying FX sure have come a long way from Tom Tyler's CAPTAIN MARVEL or Kirk Allyn's SUPERMAN and ATOM MAN VS. SUPERMAN (both Columbia, 1948 and 1950 respectively).POODLE SCHNITZ!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just remember to leave your brains home, lean back, and enjoy the ride. This is a harmless movie to teenage kids and adults who never grew up (that would be me). Transformation of the main character brings some kind of rhythm to the film, but leaves the philosophical aspects of life out of the way. Computer generated scenes are good enough not to disturb. The details are even enjoyable at some points. I enjoyed the absurdity of the Playboy life in the beginning, and the shameless action scenes. If you are into engineering or science, check out how Stark does his thing. The long duration was not a problem. The balance is just right. If you are into eye candy with big blasts, this is something you should see on the big screen =D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this movie in my local cinema despite never reading any of the comics and I was pleasantly surprised. I had heard some pretty favourable reviews so I went to see it with pretty high expectations but it still delivered big time. For two hours I was glued to my seat completely lost in what I was watching and that hasn't happened to me in quite a while. Robert Downey Jr completely steals the show as the impulsive and slightly irresponsible Tony Stark. It is very difficult to introduce a Superhero to the big screen and provide a sound base for it's future sequels to build on but Iron man has achieved just that. Superhero movies have been frankly quite lame of late, for instance Fantastic Four,Spiderman 3,Superman Returns so Iron Man was a very pleasant surprise for me. Not every Superhero movie have good action sequences,have a good story and raise a political message and still be entertaining. I can safely say that Iron Man is the best Superhero movie since Batman Begins. I will look forward to future sequels with extreme anticipation.</fullReview>

The CGI within the movie was done surprisingly well with Iron Man himself and Robert Downey Jr did an amazing job and really acted Tony Stark out as I imagined him to be. In the end great actors were put into a great comic book movie who complimented each other well and it turned out to be awesome! Recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many Marvel fans out there have been treated to Spider-Man, X-Men, The Hulk, Daredevil, Ghost Rider and the Fantastic Four over the course of what we could call the 2000's. These classic comic books were taken in and made into motion pictures. I enjoyed all of them but the one I really wanted to see be made was Iron Man. Once I heard news of Iron Man being made I couldn't wait for it to come out in theaters. I didn't know what to think when I found out that Robert Downey Jr. was going to play Tony Stark, but I must say that he really surprised me. It has been a long time since I have seen him in a movie, but he really made a comeback and a huge one at that. Iron Man is by far one of the best movies of the 2008 summer season. The movie followed onto the comic book and it really turned out to be a excellent movie that every fan of not just Iron Man, but Marvel should see.</fullReview>

Iron man is definitely a movie you should buy well only if you like super heroes i rated this movie a 9 because there were somethings i didn't like. the setting of the story and the climax was great and i loved how he was able to fly. hopefully next time e will see the war machine in action next to the iron man. now thats a movie i am waiting to see hopefully it comes out soon.if your a super hero fanatic then iron man has to be in your movie library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Marvel films there is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As fans of superhero films like Spider-Man, I can say this is another nearly flawless Marvel adaptation...This film is huge fun. The film starts off great, and it continues to blast off. the pacing in this film is very well done. I have never seen an action film so well put together, scenes come and go, yet you feel you are so satisfied with what's on screen. The pacing allows us to really interact with this film. The screenplay is also strong. I have seen a lot of Marvel films, and many of them do not work. This film was a huge surprise, because I thought it was going to be ridiculously bad, and it was the opposite. The amount of 'cool' style this film has is why a lot of teens have loved it! It is so well-based, and I have never seen an action film so well received by fans. The great critiques and great fan reactions is no surprise. It was funny, light in parts, and the characters had great things to work with. The writing really allows us to see each characters for what they are, and the reason we are also is because of the acting in this film. I have to say, this film is probably the best acted superhero film I have ever seen. Robert Downey Jr. is a genuine surprise, and I think that his performance is really quirky yet magnificent. Like a lot of people, I was surprised he took on the role of Tony Stark, who is really a very money-based character. His performance only adds the great style of this film. His character has a lot of great moments on dialogue, together with Gwyneth Paltrow, who also shines when given the right wit. This film stays true to the comic books, which not a lot of people can really recognize. The action scenes are very well done. Even though there is not a lot, the film really can attract to a lot of people because of it's fun style. The special effects are also very realistic. i could not tell when i was watching the armor suit of CGI or the real one... I think this film has done enough to add to great blockbuster films. I have to say, it is as good of a film as, in my opinion, the best superhero film to this point Spider-Man 2, and a great introduction to what will become a great trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the really crappy Spider-Man 3, Marvel movies have gone back on the map with this film. This time it has the word ballin!! written all over it. Robert Downey Jr plays billionaire industrialist Tony Stark who is a baller. This man drives an Audi R8 which is one of the sickest whips ever!!! Then there are just really off the chain action scenes. I found it really tight when he was evading the F22s. You would have never seen anything like that in a Superman movie which goes to show you that this movie has some sense of realisticness (dunno if thats even a word but whatever). And this guy saves a village from insurgents, however since this is a PG-13 movie that scene was toned down a bit, but still u don't see any other superhero do that. And also what i really like about this movie is that it's really chilled out and that its not as depressing as other comic book films but it does get serious when it should. This is 2008's movie of the year. When the sequel comes out I hope that there will be a War Machine and Mandarin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i was absolutely pumped to go see this movie ever since i saw the trailer with the guitar riff to 'Ironman' by Black Sabbath. i warn you now you don't hear this song till the end credits. anyways with all that aside now comes the good bit.this movie opens straight up into the developing of Iron Man with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) going through Afghanistan with a military escort. The escort is attacked and Tony Stark is kidnapped.the movie then goes to about a day earlier showing who the character of Tony Stark is, what he does and why he is so famous. and Tony is a real jerk to a lot of people. (in this part we get to see Stan Lee as Hugh Heffner...cool)fast forward quite a bit and Tony is back in America and realised how much damage his company is responsible of with making its weapons of destruction. so he sets out to perfecting the Ironman suit, which he had already made a makeshift one back in Afghanistan.after quite a few hilarious scenes of him perfecting his suit he finally puts on the red and gold suit everyone knows and slowly starts making a difference. the great change we see from Tony Stark at the beginning to the end is very well done and actually convincing. as though this person is actually going through these changes.Robert as Tony is a great choice, and he even looks like him. he delivers great. Gwyneth Paltrow...who i haven't seen in much, is actually quite good so don't fear she may ruin it. we see Terrence Howard as Col. James Rhodes who does a fine job, and there is a scene where he hints for something to be developed in the future of the marvel world. Jeff Bridges is great to. how he works over Tony and manipulates him.this movie isn't the highest action packed movie out there but when Iron Monger comes along there are some awesome scenes between him and Iron Man. a very very good comic book hero movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this with a group of my friends, none of whom even like comic book movies. I knew that I would love this movie, whether anyone else did or not. Imagine my shock when every one of my friends said they loved it. This must mean something.The movie is based on the Marvel Comic about billionaire industrialist and playboy Tony Stark. Stark is captured by terrorists in Afghanistan and builds an armor suit to escape. Once back in America, Stark builds an updated version of his armor to take care of things here at home.I was a little worried when I heard the guy who directed Elf was going to be directing the movie, but after I saw it, I thought it was very well done. It was well cast with Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark, Gwyneth Paltrow as Tony's secretary, Pepper Potts, Terrence Howard as Tony's friend, Jim Rhodes and Jeff Bridges as Tony's rival and former partner, Obadiah Stane. The storytelling was great, it was a perfect balance of action, comedy, sci-fi, drama and a little bit of romance. And there was hardly a dull moment throughout the entire movie.Needless to say, the armor was my favorite part of the movie. Not just the red-and-gold armor, but each phase of Stark's armor. I especially loved the clunky, steel can Stark builds in the Middle East. Although not as stylish as the red-and-gold armor, it still looked cool and seriously kicked some butt. And when Jeff Bridges came out in his Iron Monger armor, Oh my gosh! I was like a little kid in a candy store. That was freaking' awesome! Summer has officially started with a bang!Whether you like comic movies, or you love action movies, this one delivers. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally they start getting them right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all of the misses and hits in Comic Book movies, it seems that the new films coming out this year are hitting more than missing. Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark. Everyone knows this. He hits the character on so many levels that it is incredible. It's amazing to see him work in this movie, he is so good it almost seems effortless. With a supporting cast that is to die for (and yes Spiderman has nothing on this movie for cast), we see each character truly come to life. Being a fan of Marvel Comics and a severe critic of their movies, it seems that they have found a formula that is working now, and the potential for the Avengers movie will keep us all coming back. Bravo to all involved in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard-issue superhero film raised slightly by good cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has gotten a lot of praise in comparison to most of the recent superhero films. For me, I thought it was a distracting film but nothing really special other than having an excellent cast. Downey Jr. is an unusual choice for a superhero to say the least. Unfortunately he's very restrained here and the performance itself isn't hugely interesting except compared to other superhero movies. He and Gwyneth Paltrow have a noticeable lack of chemistry, but I suppose that's part of the point? Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors and I loved seeing him take on a real "baddie" role even though his performance was obscured towards the end by the mechanical apparatus he's been surrounded with.To get into the real mediocrity of this movie, we could look at Terence Howard's character, the sort of friendly co-operative military figure. First of all ignoring the fact that the friendship between Stark and this character, Col. Rhodes, represents an unholy alliance between industry and military.... and the fact that nothing essentially changes in the relationship after Stark's "reformation", I'd have to ask why was the character missing from the entire middle portion of the film? It got so obvious that I said to my brother (I was at the drive-in, so it wasn't too rude to talk) "hey, we haven't seen Terence Howard in a while" and sure enough he showed up in the very next scene. It's paint by the numbers stuff, really, for the most part this film has nothing new to offer. The Middle-Eastern villain is the most hilarious stupidity the film puts forth, a kind of Osama Bin Laden on steroids.By the end of the movie the explosions and battle have become monotonous. You can only watch so much of this stuff before the drama bleeds away and all you have is empty action. I never felt like there was a moment of unpredictability or surprise in any of the fighting.Nevertheless, I wouldn't say it was a bad movie, just very average. For people who really enjoy superhero movies I would guess it is actually very good. The sci-fi elements are somewhat more interesting than usual as well. The cast brings a quality to the film that it wouldn't have otherwise, because these are not particularly well-written characters. It's a movie where the two main protagonists enjoy pole dancing on a jetplane, and it's supposed to make us feel more empathetic towards them. There is some fun to be had in the glossy way it presents its action and in the irony with which it drapes superhero conventions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to go see Iron Man on my day off , although being a huge fan of Marvel comics in general I was not really a huge fan of Iron Man but the movie was worth a check out. Robert Downy Jr was brilliant as Tony Stark , he actually reminded me of Nic Cages take on Johnny Blaze / Ghostrider . The good thing about the movie was that it tried to be entertaining and not too political which at one point became my fear in the movie. The special affects and the awesome action are what stop this movie from its storyline which although deals with Morley the birth of a hero and a little a less on the movie rolling along side , but because Robert Downy Jr was just so hilarious as Iron Man I was just willing to let that go. To sum it up Iron Man might not be the biggest or the best comic-to-big-screen action movie , it certainly lives up to it advertising and delivers and entertaining flick which is worth a look at and I certainly would not mind checking out a sequel to it.IRON MAN 8.0 OUT OF 10 FULLY CHARGED ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above Average Comic Book Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently the Superhero movie franchise the comic book industry for that matter has come under critical scrutiny and bland and UN-innovative work, work so innovative hasn't been seen under comic book artists and industry since that of Frank Miller. Both the Comic Book and Film needed a reawakening a slap in the face. Because in recent years both have not come out with material that been appealing to the mainstream. Iron Man is the first in the long time of films that has the realism and mainstream appeal that other innovative films possess.The film comes into unfamiliar territory for a protagonist thats not so down to earth a trust fund baby by the name of Tony Stark who's father created an empire of War Weapon Industry in which he inherited from his deceased father. The Protagonists appeal is his sarcasm's and wit both helping him out and causing him trouble in numerous situations. The film deals with a distribution of weapons to terrorist for intentionally antagonistic purposes. The eventual antagonist is Obidiah Stane who Co-Founded the company in hopes of appealing the weapons to just about everyone. To avoid Tony's intentions of cutting off deals with extreme organizations he sends him over to the middle east where hes token hostage. He eventually develops the Iron Man suit out crude materials later to develop the suit later on. The Iron Man suit becomes a fascination to Stark who isn't much of a megalomaniac for powers as much as he wants to study how far he can push the suit. The films sub-plot is a consistent love story between Starks personal secretary Gweneth but it becomes relentless and tiring to see sub-plots like love stories appear in super-hero movies repetitively. The film is a breath of fresh air and differs from most superhero movies and offers realism and a chance to see believe-able character Robert Downey Jr.s character reminds me of Dennis Miller . Though this is an above-average comic book film in part to the inconsistency and longevity of other films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comic book movie that's more than a cartoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The character of Tony Stark/Iron Man is like wish-fulfillment for comic-book nerds: an engineering genius, a mighty superhero, and a debonair ladies' man all at once. That combination might sound improbable on paper, but Robert Downey Jr. makes it believable, and very entertaining. He credibly shows Tony's transition from amoral opportunist to responsible hero, but fortunately never loses his sense of humor. His quick-witted, sarcastic line readings keep you aware at all times that there's a human being underneath that shiny metal suit.Indeed, it sounds weird to say this about a superhero movie, but the best thing about "Iron Man" is that it's somehow realistic. For instance, Iron Man's nemesis isn't just some random guy who dresses up in a supervillain costume and plots to rule the world. Instead, he's Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), Tony's business partner, who doesn't like the way Tony is running the company and crafts his own metal suit in retaliation. Also, it makes sense that if a superhero suddenly emerged on the scene, the U.S. military would want to monitor what was going on--which leads to the movie's best action sequence, as Iron Man is attacked by two American fighter planes. Tony Stark's Los Angeles feels like our world with somewhat cooler technology--not enhanced with extra bright colors as in the "Spider-Man" movies or extra gloom as in "Batman." The movie even has some contemporary relevance, questioning how to behave responsibly in a world threatened by terrorism.The storytelling of "Iron Man" is generally solid, though the movie maybe spends a bit too long on sequences of Tony constructing and testing the Iron Man suit, first in Afghanistan then back in America. I mean, Downey does a good job of acting with only robots and gadgets to keep him company, but it's even more fun to watch him interact with his straitlaced pal Rhodey (Terrence Howard) or his concerned and capable assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).We'll certainly see more from all these performers (except Bridges) in the inevitable sequel, now that this movie has told the hero's origin story in such an enjoyable way. Marvel Studios has definitely grabbed the brass ring with "Iron Man," its first-ever release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not usually a fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not usually a fan of comic book films such as spider man, most batman films, Superman, hulk etc but this should be grouped with Hellboy and X-Men as one of the few that really make the grade as great films independent of their comic book heritage.The acting from the entire cast was superb and the action looked polished and was highly entertaining. The thing I appreciated about this film the most was the witty and well delivered humour that credited the audience with some intelligence and didn't resort to the usual slapstick that a lot of these films tend to go for, in fact it was this feature in the trailers that really drew me towards this film and fortunately it stuck to it's word. If only Indiana Jones had lived up to its trailer, which, on seeing it for the first time before Ironman last night, was much better than the film itself.Overall Ironman is great fun and refreshingly mature (in some ways!!!) and credible for a film of its genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story started with an action/war scene and continuing it with the whole story.I like the humor in the film. The effect are all impressive. however, according to my cousin, the story is a cliché. he did not see the uniqueness of the story line. It was like watching another drama show in television. It was predictable.I agreed with my cousin. It was another Television series. After watching the film i already had a feeling that it lacked something.I agreed also when most people I talked to said that Robert Downey Jr. was not the appropriate guy for the role.Another thing is Gwyneth Paltrow's Acting. I loved her role and her delivery of line in the film View From the Top; but, this time she didn't impress me. she was like reading all her lines somewhere and she lack appropriate emotions.All in all, I give this film a 8.4 rating. I hope the next sequel will be more interesting, unique, and action-filled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! I was so happy to see a Marvel movie that didn't make me want my money back. I saw Iron Man three times in theaters, and tickets are not cheap. I don't regret spending a dime. I am not an ultra Iron Man fan, but at the same time I was very familiar with Iron Man and his background. I just adored this film. I still can not shut up about it. Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark. No one else could have done a better job. Great casting job for all of the characters to be honest. What I like most about this movie is that it's very story driven. It takes a bit to get to the action, but it doesn't bore you one bit. It's not your average hero flick and I like that! Every time I saw it, I was on the edge of my seat. I can not wait for Iron Man II! Kudos to Marvel and Mr. Downey for bringing Iron Man to life and introducing him to audiences who weren't quite familiar with Iron Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel comic book adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man isn't exactly what you would call a 'flagship' hero of Marvel's. With Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Hulk and the Fantastic Four all more prominent, it is little surprise that this vehicle had difficulty getting off the ground- so much so that Marvel got fed up and began their own film company to see it become a reality. What is surprising is that this movie is such a beauty, right up with Batman Begins as the best superhero movie ever made.The story revolves around Tony Stark, a wealthy and brilliant- though also hedonistic and eccentric inventor who is captured by terrorists and is forced to look at his weapons company through the other side. Escaping by means of a revolutionary invention, Stark returns to find that his business partners, primarily Obidiah Stane, are concerned about the direction he has the company going in. With the aid of Pepper Pots, Jim 'Rhodey' Rhodes and a collection of all sorts of robots, Stark begins to perfect his invention to put a stop to the misery that he helped create.This would all count for nought if it wasn't for the performances- and they are brilliant. Gweneth Paltrow give Potts a real verve that sparks off when her and Stark have scenes alone together. Terence Howard is very good as Jim Rhodes, providing a down-to-earth confidante for the erratic Stark while as Obidiah Stane, Jeff Bridges seems to be channeling ENRON executives brilliantly.But it is Robert Downey Jr who carries this film as the man Tony Stark himself. Downey Jr seems to be having the time of his life as he sparks brilliantly witty and fast dialogue- whether it is flirting with reporters, or calming down extinguishers ( you'll just have to wait and see what I mean...).Iron Man delivers on every level. Marvel has obviously ensured that their material is handled with care and discretion and the result is a movie that has a darker tone than any of the others in the Marvel comic book franchise, but at the same time remains much funnier as well. Oh and by the way, stay after the credits for a sneak peak of where Marvel Film may be going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a great fan of superhero-films. After watching Iron Man I was convinced this was the best one in his league (cfr Super-, Spider-, Bat-, ..., man). But to be sure I started watching all of them (the ones I bought) again. I even got me F4 and Silver Surfer (rather reluctant to buy them) and imo Iron Man is the best one. Not only superb effects (I WANT THAT SUIT!!) but also funny as hell one-liners, a decent story for its kind, great cast and acting. Not everyone will be a fan of this one, but not one single film has made this happen. But if you like the whole superhero-genre, then the change of merely liking, if not adoring Iron Man, will be rather big.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best Marvel comic to movie made in my opinion topping even the venerable X- Men. What was so great was that it captures the essence of the Iron Man's world so well. I was a big fan of Iron Man comics when I was growing up. I especially liked Don Heck and Gene Colan days of Iron Man, and this story has rich innuendos from those days like the homage to the original gray Iron Man suit, to the gold version, and to the red and gold design. What I liked especially was that they didn't try to make this Iron Man "dark" to pretend that it was a serious drama, (but it was a good drama none the less) and captures the blazing opulence of Tony Stark's glamorous world and boost it a couple more notches. This is truly Iron Man at its best, and it was the neatest Marvel character come to life on screen. I'm little surprised that John Favreau who played Foggy Nelson on Daredevil was the director for this film. He did a great job, and so did all the casts on this movie. Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow were absolutely believable as Tony Stark, and Pepper Potts. Interesting was the arranged version of old Iron Man theme song playing in the back ground of this movie on few of the earlier scenes. Keep the flames burning guys, and come up with a sequel that's just as great.**Happy Hogan makes cameo appearance as the chauffeur of the Bentley driving Stark from the airport back to the factory. Tony Stark makes you feel, he's the cool exec with a heart of steel ! (if you know where this came from, you're really an old fan of Iron Man).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There can still be good superhero movies today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After making family friendly works ("Elf" and "Zathura"), Jon Favreau was appointed to direct a new superhero movie.If I recall correctly, the first Marvel superhero movie was "X-Men". From then on, we have been bombarded with comic book characters brought to life on the big screen. Few have been great successes, mainly, "Spider-Man" and "X-Men", along with it's respective first sequels.But after four great movies, came several lack lusters ("Hulk", "Daredevil", "The Punisher", "Fantastic Four", "Ghost Rider"), that, although successful, were almost insults to comic book fans and movie goers alike.The Marvel film era was quickly falling down, and several beloved characters were given bad reps (The Hulk, Dr. Doom, The Kingpin) However, one key superhero was being left out. As the filmmaker wannabe that I am, I wondered, "I would love to make an Iron Man film when I become a director".Well, Jon Favreau beat me to the job. But I certainly don't resent him.Okay, Iron Man wasn't one of my favorites, since I didn't read any comics and just saw cameos of him in the Spider-Man animated series. But from those cameos, I saw glimpses of his powers and knew enough.Robert Downey Jr., not the classic "superheo looking guy" makes a fantastic job as Tony Stark, mixing a genius mind with careless attitude, always making acid jokes and remarks, and even after his transformation, he still is quirky and likable.Others in the ensemble cast include beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts (what a name, huh?) Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges as Obadiah I-can't-remember-his-last-name. Everyone acts great, and add their own seeds to the script.The special and visual effects are state-of-the-art. The Iron Man suit is one of the best ever made for a movie. The test sequences were hilarious and I loved them. As for the action sequences, they were superb, very well done and exciting to the last minute.The story is fantastic, and the major moral themes fit perfectly into the plot, although these don't sound cheesy, rehearsed nor like an after-school special.The score was the only thing that failed. Media Ventures alumnus, Ramin Djawadi (of "Prison Break" fame), just makes rock songs without voices. The Iron Man themes were too repetitive to be actually hummed. The lyrical moments were good, but these were few. As for the source rock music, I'm no rock fan, but they were very good.The final sequence was good, but I felt a little disappointed a it, mainly for being too short, but it's still good.I don't know if it was Jon Favreau's initiative, or the writer's, or the producers', but something was done different than the other previous superhero movies. And it worked great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Marvel" (leous) product ? Indeed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a CEO of the biggest weapons manufacturing firm addressing a press conference with one hand in a sling, munching a cheese burger and asking the press to be comfortable to an extent of sitting down on the floor itself, he himself sitting down in front of his podium! Meet Mr. Tony Stark a.k.a IRON MAN! I went into the theatre with average expectations because of the characters profile that I had some idea about myself being a huge super hero buff. I came out of the theatre only to realize that this definitely could prove a cult movie for the movies based on the same themes. I never have seen a movie that has everything in place making it just perfect! There a few parameters in a super hero film those are essential to make it live up to the comic strip version.Most important is the characterization/performance of the protagonist ? In this case what do I say. The background of the character is that of a genius, graduating from MIT at a very early age. But he is very unlike a geek when it comes to his personality - suave, flamboyant, womanizer and as Jeff Bridges puts it in the movie a person with a taste for the finest. The cool that Downey has played in the film can be compared to the likes of Brosnan and Trovolta. Everything seems to be just great about his performance in the film ? his action speaking louder than his words, be it the style of his walking, contortion of his pupil and gestures using his hands? just amazing! Another aspect is the direction ? Now that the story, screenplay are a direct lift off from the comic strip, direction brings it into 3-D, life like! Yes, that's the catch here ? it should look real. And here the director has taken it to larger than life limits, but with what perfection I must say.Behavior/circumstance ? situation ? reaction: are the three ingredients that characterize a life. Same principle holds good for the "reel" life too. This movie has it all in a balance that most just cannot ignore! Special affects? Well, there weren't any in this film as everything seemed real! If one has to fly then thrust booster in the feet would suffice right? This is what I initially thought. But it's only after I saw this movie I realized that hands play an equally essential part in maintaining the balance. Hence, the iron man has boosters in both the pairs, hands and feet. Concept? Yes! The suit! ? It was built in three stages (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(film)) ). I am not repeating the information stated in Wiki but then the Mark II design of the suit re-defines the meaning of perfection in every sense (every part of the armor assembled together in picture-perfect way). When we talk about suits then there was a recent movie ? Transformers (work of the same special effects team) that also exuberated perfection. But then there was a difference. One could feel the special effects playing a significant role in the whole existence of robots. The same is not true with iron man where the close ups on the suits are so close, that it becomes hard to believe that they are a by-product of a software.There have been super hero movies in the past and they have done well. Maybe that was the awe for the man of steel (superman) that worked with the people, maybe it were the special effects that worked with the other side of Peter Parker (spiderman), but when it comes to IRON MAN? its just the quality in every aspect that worked for the film.Not to forget, the background score of the film is very supportive with each and every moment that "flies by".April 30th 2010 is the date to look out for now!</fullReview>

So I bought a ticket to see it, and I was amazed by all the robotics, and I thought to myself, I would not mind having, an Asistant like Pepper Potts. I also think, that Tony Stark must be very rich, to have his own firm. I also think that he made, the right decision to stop making weapons, and design that very good and fast iron suit. Only that bald headed man, wanted to continue making weapons I also liked all the computer effects in the film, and the history of Tony Stark. I am fascinated by machines and robots. I cannot wait for this film to come out on DVD, I will be the first one to buy it. I liked Gwennys Paltrow, I think that she is beautiful. I am also glad her character survived and was not killed off, in the film. I like all Marvel Comic based films. I did not read any when I was a boy mind. I do not like warfare and If I had my own company, I like Tony would not make missiles or weaponry. I am going to give this film 10/10 for all the effects in it, and for the storyline. there was a lot of action and it had me engrossed for all the time it was on. I was not disappointed at all Well Done Film Team. I now look forward to Iron Man 2 a-s-o.</fullReview>

The action was realistic and engaging. I didn't really notice how "special" the effects were b/c the story and how it flowed was excellent. My son and 8yr-old daughter sat thru the whole thing. I was not pleased w/ the bedroom scene (don't see why that kind of crap needs to be in a movie - we already got the picture he was a play-boy). Even got goosebumps a couple of times w/ the American hero 'thing' and the music that went along w/ the scenes. it was well written, my kids even understood some of the good humor, and overall it was a great movie.

This film made the transformation from comic book to big screen beautifully. Everything in the film looked real as if you were there. I would have to say that this film is one of the best Marvel comic movies made yet. Kudos to the director and everyone else involved on making this great movie. I definitely recommend this movie as a must see for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, honestly, for those who really appreciated this movie but, as a cinema enthusiast, and since i think this site has got a lot of credit, i'm hoping that only serious people, who really love movies, decide to vote or express their opinion.I have got nothing against movies based on comics! I don't think it is bad because of that. the first 10 minutes are great. It starts with a good music, not telling which so i won't ruin to anybody, and we immediately see the amazing Robert Downey Jr. acting. The man is, without a doubt, a wonderful actor. Gwyneth is too, i think, a good actress and, most of all, a beautiful one. The movie is filled with cheesy lines, and really lame stuff like throwing a rocket to a tank and turn 180? and walk toward the camera, like a bad mo*** fu***! what is that? I mean, the movie is not a total crap, it's a decent comic adaption. The only reason i'm giving my opinion it's because i really don't think this movie deserves a place in the top list. not even close. I know, it's not the most important thing in the world but, we are people who love movies, we are the ones who make the industry work, we have some of the responsibility for what comes out. (this will lead to other discussion. Not important for now) People, please start seeing other things. Don't expect only the blockbusters. They are great too, i'm biting my nails for Indiana Jones, but this is no movie to be elevated to such higher state.The effects are cool, the idea is fine, and it's a humble entertainer. Doesn't pretend to be a complex or a Oscar worthy.if anyone felt offended by this, please share. I'm very willing to talk about this and all the amazing and infinite things we can talk about movies. Thanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm sure its fun, i just don't get it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forgive me for being pretentious, but the majority of action/adventure/hero films leave me cold. This was no exception. It all began rather pleasingly, and dare i say even bravely, as the narrative tackled the contemporary issue of Western military in the middle east. It was all slightly glossy, but with some good one liners to keep it enjoyable and some impressive camera work i was beginning to really hold out hope for something that could rival the x-men series in terms of mixing mass taste enjoyability with depth and intelligence.This view began to wane at about an hour in (and i'd already had to forgive at least two slapstick moments of stupidity when the man would have died - i was honourably suspending disbelief). A seemingly good narrative evolved, the story then stopped progressing. In relation to Jeff Bridges character, someone who could have been a good and symbolic villain became a caricature of silly destruction not to be taken seriously. What could have been a developed narrative about the western obsession with weapons and dominance explored in an enjoyable way became just another silly yarn about very comic book bad-guys and a cheer-a-long, charming super hero. And don't even get me started on the ridiculous battle of the iron men at the end (never mind that it took the genius Stark months to build and master his machine, Bridges can build a bigger and better one overnight!)..Maybe i think too much about things. Maybe wanting even the slightest amount of subtlety, depth or intelligence in a film of this nature is asking too much. either way this was a silly film that, though managing to hold my attention and stave off bum-ache, i will not be re-watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I thought Miss Paltro was going to drag the movie down just a bit but Downy has enough power to pull the movie to the very top of the charts. My 36yo son loved it also. A 9 from him and we paid $10 per to see it. He did not have free coupons for this week from the distributors so we went full fare, food and all! We were still happy 100% with the action and at times there was a bit of great humor in action scenes. Downy was a show stealer perfect for the part. I can not wait to see him in the new upcoming Hulk movie where he shows up as Mr Stark no suit so far.Worth owning when it goes to DVD. I will get it in 480 not sure if it is worth a $34 fee for Blue as the basic 480 disk will look great on a high def screen after being up converted to 1080...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comic movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last summer season, fans and critics were disappointed by what Spider-Man 3 brought to the big screen. This year, the highly anticipated comic book blockbuster movie Iron Man blew fans and even critics away. According to the critics, Iron Man is considered one of the best comic book movies of all-time and possibly the best of all-time. I totally agree with them and this is what comic book films should be like. Fun and entertaining! Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark) is a billionaire, genius inventor and a playboy man who is kidnapped and forced to build a missile by some crazy terrorists. Instead of building the missile, Stark uses his creative and genius mind and builds a high-tech suit of armor. He battles the people that kidnapped and escapes from the nightmare. When things get out of hand at his weapon manufacturing company, Stark thinks there are better things to do than just weapons, become the Iron Man.I thought the storyline was great and well develop. It flew well and is not a complicated story to understand. What I like about the plot is that there are major reasons why Stark wanted to be Iron Man. I'm not going to say any reason because I don't want to spoil it for you.By far, the best thing in Iron Man was the brilliant performance by Downey Jr. The way he acted brought great things to the film. Downey Jr. was born to play this role and he absolutely masters it. The supporting cast did a great job also. Gwyneth Paltrow was a good choice to play Virginia 'Pepper' Potts. She was natural and delivered a pretty good performance. Jeff Bridges did a nice job also. He played a good villain, not the greatest one, but a good one. And finally, Terrence Howard as Jim Rhodes or Rhodey or whatever you want to call it. I can't wait to see him as War Machine.The visual effects in the movie are amazing and very realistic. The CGI work was also great. I really like the shine in Iron Man. It looks real and that's what you are looking for when it comes to f/x and CGI. The action and humor in the film is incredible. Especially the humor! You'll probably laugh through most of the flick.Iron Man kicked off the 2008 summer season with great entertainment and it delivers in every possible way. The film, in my opinion is way better than the Spider-Man and X-Men movies. Even though I'm a fan of both trilogies, Iron Man is those movies that you want to see it a million times. If you anything to do at your house, I suggest you spent two hours at the movies and see Iron Man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a person who never read the comic, I enjoyed this movie a lot. The acting is pretty good, the story line is fast paced, the action scenes play out very well, and everything seemed to tie together nicely. Now I have heard from some friends that the portrayal of Tony Stark is very much like the comic portrays him, I don't know that as a person who never read the comic, but as for the movie on it's own, I liked how they showed a little bit of background and his lifestyle before he becomes Ironman. Downey is quite believable in his role and Paltrow and Bridges play well. While I thought it could have used some more action scenes, the flick works well as it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given that over the past eight years or so we've seen three X-Men movies, three Spiderman movies, two Fantastic Four movies, Batman, Superman and the Punisher, it's not hard to imagine a few people rolling their eyes as Iron Man, the latest superhero franchise turns up this Spring. Cast all those aspersions aside though folks, years from now people will be talking about the first time they saw Iron Man with the sense of wistful nostalgia usually reserved for the likes of Jaws. This is one of those movies that reminds you why you keep going to the cinema: pure escapist entertainment that for two hours provides the perfect break from Council tax, mortgage repayments and neighbours throwing four month old watermelon slices at your conservatory windows.The somewhat familiar story revolves around Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr), a billionaire weapons dealer with a penchant for fast cars and loose women. His self-absorbed life comes to sudden end though when he gets captured by Afghan rebels after demonstrating his latest super missile, goodbye California Condo, hello dusty pit of hell. Tasked with building them a missile, Stark turns the tables on his captors by fashioning a formidable armoured suit Macguyver style out of their weapon supplies and smacking them into oblivion. A free man again, he returns to America and brings a burning desire to correct some of the wrongs he's helped to engineer with him. That and a massive great hole in his chest.From here the story follows typical superhero-origin archetypes but is still constantly watchable thanks to Downey Junior's charismatic performance. His Tony Stark is a walking charm offensive without any nauseating smarm (thank the lord Tom Cruise did not get it) and manages to exude chemistry out of everyone he comes into contact with. Nailing every single one-liner, it is abundantly clear why his GI bodyguards in the opening scene are so starstruck; if you're in this man's presence for more than a few seconds you will want to be him. Heck, even the anthropomorphic robots in his lab enjoy his company.Granted, by the time the first hour has gone by and our hero still hasn't put on his iconic red and yellow suit, some of the ankle biters might get a bit impatient but the payoff is well worth it. His brawls with the Afghan militia are eye-popping enough but his closing battle with the Iron Monger (think over-sized alter-ego) is the real clincher. It's a barnstorming highway smash 'em up which puts the ADD camera of Transformers to shame. Parents need not fear though, this is not violence, it's action. There is no blood to speak of and even the potentially harrowing scenes of villages being raided or young American soldiers getting machine gunned fail to put a downer on the colourful escapism.The film also boasts the strongest supporting cast since Batman Begins and they all do their best, but despite Terrence Howard's matey military liaison and Jeff Bridges oozing menace, this is still very much the lead's show. His star quality practically drips off the screen and combined with the outstanding set pieces, turns what could have been yet another production line origin movie into the best blockbuster of the year so far. And make sure you stay to the end of the credits, it's well worth it.</fullReview>

Iron Man's missiles would do nothing and he would be crushed by the mean green fighting machine! Hulk is the greatest! For anyone who disagrees, Hulk wins in the comics and therefore wins in a fight. I like Robert Downey Jr. but Edward Norton is amazing! Ang Lee's version was bad, but this version is going to be sweet. Just look up the trailers on you tube and see for yourself.

		<fullReview>Director Jon Favreau scores a hit with his movie adaptation of the popular Marvel Comics character, Iron Man.It's the story of wealthy, weapons-manufacturing, industrialist playboy, Tony Stark. During a particularly harrowing abduction episode Stark uncovers some disturbing facts about his organisation that make him rethink his approach to life.Putting the wealth of resources at his disposal to good use yields the titular character. Iron Man is a super-soldier of sorts with all manner of modern gadgetry and weaponry on tap and ready to take out the "bad guys", whoever they may be.Favreau makes a good call to update what was initially a Vietnam-themed story and reset it in modern times. Instead of "Charlie" we have dodgy, desert-cave dwelling, quasi-Afghan Mujahideen providing the revised backdrop.On a technical level, the film is very satisfying - the visual effects are a treat, the story moves at a good pace, and the supporting performances are up to scratch.But let's be clear: Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is the centre piece of this film. And it's a tour-de-force, effortlessly capturing the complexities of the Tony Stark character.The vagaries of Downey Jr.'s personal life add an unexpected dimension of realism and credibility to his portrayal, enriching the Stark character well beyond Marvel's original design.So Iron Man's comic-book fans can rest assured that their hero has been treated with requisite respect. There's also plenty of sequel potential, making this the first instalment of a lucrative new franchise.Comparisons are inevitable between Marvel's Tony Stark and DC Comics' parallel character, Bruce Wayne (Batman). Although Batman is a more leading character in the DC universe, Iron Man's relative obscurity presents no impediment in this film, and he holds his own admirably.With a new Batman instalment slated for later this year, Iron Man sets a very high bar for big releases as we enter the blockbuster season. Iron Man vs Batman will be a box-office showdown not to be missed!</fullReview>

Yes, they are neat. Could it be that it involves the Middle East, and Americans can't seem to get enough of that right now? Yes, it has cultural relevancy. Could it be that the spring line of movies has sucked so bad that it doesn't take much to impress me at this point? Yes, that's quite on the money.For me, I love any movie where a power hungry person changes their tune and makes a mental shift. Downey gives a solid performance as someone who has seen the light of day and wants to change his ways. It was fairly clean, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll give it a 6 because the effects were such that everything looked physically real. Nothing too shiny, gravity actually exists, things like that.But honestly, this movie just drags in places where the director thinks he is developing character. But he's not. RDJr. is wooden, Jeff Bridges is phoning it in, Gwenyth (sp?) is simply awful with no personality (what's new?).One more "evil corporation" movie in the books. And setting this movie in the pseudo real world just makes it confusing. What the heck is Jim Cramer doing plugging his stupid "Mad Money" show in this movie? He's a clown for one thing, and it takes us COMPLETELY out of the alternate reality universe, as does the whole Afghanistan thing (despite us not actually fighting Taliban or Al Qaeda there?).But on the plus side, there were a lot of AUDIs in the movie, including my new favorite car the A5/S5, so that's a plus. And a modified Boeing BBJ digitally changed to have some weird tail section.But considering all the hype and the positive reviews, I was expecting something, I don't know, great? Or visionary if flawed, like the original Tim Burton Batman. But we didn't get anything but a hack written, hack directed, phoned in acting movie with really good SFX.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a meteoric rise from first-time film making Marvel Enterprises, we get to see an action-packed, funny, and eye-popping movie with a perfect cast and an even more perfect script.To start with, IRON MAN needed a great lead character. Tony Stark is known to be cocky, good-looking, and an all-around bad-boy. So who better to inhabit this persona than Robert Downey Jr. (GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK). I think most people know Downey Jr.'s difficulties and run-ins with the law over the past several years, and I could think of no one better to pull off this character than someone who has some of those very same flaws. You also need a good villain, and Obadiah Stane was the perfect stab-in-the-back. Played very well by the surprising Jeff Bridges (TIDELAND), I found myself repulsed by his money-mongering ways that Tony (Downey Jr.) wants so badly to be rid of after considering (and witnessing) the human cost. We get a bit of romantic/sexual tension, too, in the form of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow, PROOF), Tony Stark's life secretary. The drop-dead gorgeous dress that Potts wears to a dance and the subsequent almost-kiss make for some of the best tightly wound scenes between a man and woman within a comic-book-to-film venture.Another huge plus for the film is the amazing CGI. Never once will the audience believe they aren't watching real life. This is, in part, thanks to Downey Jr.'s incorporation into these scenes as he tries and often fails to get his Iron Man suit off the ground. It's also hilarious to watch Tony Stark admonish his robotic gadgets as they try to help him but, more often than not, hurt him in some way (by spraying him with a fire extinguisher, for example, even though there's no fire).I also really enjoyed the perfectly timed dialogue: Stark: "Okay, seriously, I feel like you're driving me to court martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forest..."Jimmy: "We can talk, sir."Stark: "Oh, I see. So it's personal. Alright."Ramirez: "You intimidate them, sir."Stark: "Good god, you're a woman! I honestly couldn't have called that. I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first."Ramirez: "I'm an airman."Stark: "Well you actually have excellent bone structure there. I'm having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?"This kind of snappy dialogue is sprinkled throughout the film and keeps the viewer laughing and interested the entire length of the movie.Plenty of times movie-goers have seen films with a lot of action and no substance, but Iron Man happily ? and easily ? gives us both. It's well-deserving of the title "blockbuster." And if you really want to see what lay ahead for Iron Man, please stay til after the credits have finished rolling. You'll be exceptionally pleased if you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Iron Man" Is Great Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Marvel Comics, science-fiction, super-hero saga "Iron Man" (***1/2 out of ****) qualifies as a lightweight load of larger-than-life nonsense that consistently delivers thrills, chills, and surprises throughout its entertaining two hours and six minutes. Indeed, "Iron Man" rivals "Spider-Man" as one of the best superhero movies. For the record, Marvel Comics honcho Stan Lee and his team conjured up "Iron Man" back in 1963. What differentiates Tony Stark from other superheroes is that he forged his own super powers. Think of Tony as a modern-day equivalent of Vulcan, the mythical blacksmith to the gods, because our hero can wield a forge to fashion weapons.Basically, "Zathura" director Jon Favreau's "Iron Man" amounts to an origins epic. Like "Blade" (1998), "Spider-Man" (2002), "The Punisher" (2005) and "Fantastic Four" (2005), all modeled on the vintage 1978 super-hero origins opus "Superman: The Movie," "Iron Man" introduces its quirky super-hero character and shows us how he acquired his name and reputation. People that have never read an "Iron Man" comic book need not worry. Favreau and his quartet of clever scribes, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby of "Children of Men," Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway, provide all the essential information that you need to know about our "Iron Man." The most remarkable thing about "Iron Man" is that it is a summer superhero actioneer with a grown-up hero that is significantly older than the typical superhero.News reporter Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb of "The Skulls") reviles roguish billionaire armaments manufacturer Tony Stark (a charismatic Robert Downy Jr., in a Van Dyke beard) as a merchant of death who shows little remorse about the death and violence that he reaps with his state-of-the-art technology. Instead, Tony wallows in booze and broads. In his corporate jet, for example, his sexy flight attendants double as pole swinging strippers. It seems that, like oil magnate Howard Hughes, Tony inherited his weapons plant from his late father, and he has carried on in the finest family tradition with new and more devastating armaments. Tony qualifies as a na?ve patriot. The armaments that he invents are designed in his mind to keep America safe and strong. Tony flies to battleground Afghanistan to demonstrate his latest top-of-the-line guided missile--the Jericho?to the military. Afterward, swarthy Taliban-like terrorists wipe out the Army convoy with which Tony is riding and nearly kill the arms tycoon with one of his own weapons. When our hero recovers from his close shave with death, he learns that a kindly doctor Yinson (Shaun Toub of "Paradise Now") has inserted a magnetic device in his chest to keep the shrapnel from the missile from killing him. The villainous insurgents hold Tony hostage in a cave, and their leader, the evil Raza (Faran Tahir of "Charlie Wilson's War"), orders our hero to build them Jericho rockets. Of course, Tony refuses to accommodate him. Instead, he shapes a suit of crude armor that enables him to spew napalm from his wrists and fly. Originally, in the 1963 comic book, this "Iron Man" exploit occurred in Vietnam when our chief adversaries were the Commies.After his miraculous escape, a morally reconstituted Tony announces that Stark Industries will no longer manufacture weapons. Stark's older, wiser business partner Obadiah Stone (Jeff Bridges of "Thunderbolt and Lightfoot") steps in and tries to downplay Tony's sudden pacifism. Meanwhile, the wicked insurgents dig up the remains of Tony's prototypical suit of armor that he used to escape from them in the desert and try to reassemble it. Similarly, Tony sequesters himself like Dr. Jekyll in his own research laboratory and starts from scratch on the suit. Occasionally, he relies on his loyal girl Friday, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow of "Great Expectations"), to run errands and tie up his loose ends. Tony's closest friend, U.S. A. F. Colonel Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard of "Hustle &amp; Flow"), serves as his liaison with the Pentagon. At one point, Rhodes drums up a cover story to prevent his own bosses from knowing that Tony was responsible for the crash of an F-22 supersonic jet fighter during a mid-air collision between the jet and Tony in his new souped-up Iron Man outfit.The foursome that wrote "Iron Man" provide our hero with a challenging villain in the person of Jeff Bridges. The laid-back Bridges looks particularly sinister because he wears an Abe Lincoln beard but keeps his noggin freshly shaven. Bridges never tries to appear intimidating and seems all the more intimidating. Favreau and his writers are politically correct to never identify the Afghan antagonists either by religion or ideology. Oscar nominated leading man Robert Downey Jr of "Chaplin" makes a terrific career comeback with "Iron Man." Downey languished throughout the late 1990s in a number of lackluster roles after his highly-publicized bouts with drug dependency. He brings an energy and sense of humor to his super hero conspicuously absent from his competitors. "Iron Man" has already recouped its $140 million budget and the franchise is off and flying high with a sequel projected for 2009. Moreover, Downey's Tony Stark character is scheduled to appear briefly in the new "Incredible Hulk" movie with Edward Norton later this summer. Altogether, "Iron Man" is a far cry from "RoboCop" meets "The Iron Giant." Despite its outlandish premise and predictable climactic showdown, this smartly-made, super-hero yarn doesn't take itself as seriously as the new "Batman" movies but still delivers the goods in slam-bang fashion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it opening night. I consider among the best of the Marvel movies thus far, on par with X-Men 2 and Spider-Man 2.Downey is absolutely brilliant as Tony Stark - a genius piece of casting on so many levels. As a long time Marvel reader and Robert Downey fan, it was great to be able to "read into" the performance the idea that Stark - although he is madly successful - is a fragile human being with a crippling addiction. It'll be great when and if they get to the alcoholism in Iron Man 2.It seemed to me to be an altered retelling of Iron Man 198-200 by Denny O'Neil (from 1985). A classic in my book!</fullReview>

The dude plays perhaps the best villain in movie history. Doweny is and always shall be Tony Stark.

		<fullReview>Iron Man The trailer for this film spoke volumes. The film... speaks an entire library. It falls in line with the great superhero films, like Spider-Man 2 and Batman Begins. And in some ways, tops them. Such is Iron Man.Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a multi-billion dollar industrialist who made his money from weapons development for the military. After experiencing the destructive nature of his arms first hand while a hostage in Afghanistan, Stark feels it necessary to change his life's goal, much to the chagrin of his business partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). Keeping Stark on track and in line are his assistant/love interest Pepper Pots (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his military liaison/best friend Jim Rhoades (Terrance Howard). In order to combat his former war profiteering ways, Stark develops an advanced suit of armor with the latest in robotics, computers, weaponry and metals, leading him to be affectionately known as the Iron Man.In recent years, mostly since 2005's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Downey has become one of my favourite actors. and the character of Stark/Iron Man is the best for him. Or maybe he's the best for the character. The thing fascinating thing about Stark is his motives behind being a hero. With Batman it's revenge, Superman the desire to do good and Spider-man it's guilt. But with Iron Man, it's atonement. Stark experiences first hand the wrath of his weapons. And then he realizes that he has to do more than just denounce weapons production. He has to right his wrongs. Only way to do that, is to be Iron Man.And that's where Downey takes over. Downey has a knack for playing uniquely troubled characters. Tony Stark is one that he deeply understands, as he himself is a fan of the comic book. Downey figured out the character, and enveloped it. Too many times we had Brandon Routh as Superman or Tom Jane as The Punisher. But with this, it was Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man.But Downey, as talented as he is, did not make this flick on his own. There was the bizarre, inexplicable romantic chemistry between him and Paltrow, as his long suffering assistant Pepper Potts. The two actors have had very different careers, and never in a million years would I have picked those two to portray romantic leads in a film. But for some reason, it worked. The fact that they are so different, and so are the characters, made it work.Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, Arlington Road) is an actor, who if you were to ask me to define his career, I couldn't. He's played a multitude of characters in a myriad of different genres. But his turn as the villainous Obadiah Stane/War Monger is a fantastic look at a villain. He wasn't the traditional villain. He wasn't driven by hatred for the hero, or megalomaniacal desires. He's driven by protecting his own interests in war profiteering. He's the embodiment of true villainy. He's looking out for number one, and he's protecting his greedy interest. He's got no real regard for anyone else, just himself. He's the perfect counterpoint to Downey's Stark.Director Jon Favreau deserves a lot of the credit for this film. He kept the reigns on the story to keep it from getting too out there, and actually explored the practical science of Iron Man. Sure you have to suspend some disbelief as several pieces of technology don't exist or completely defy laws of physics. But a lot of it is very interesting. And Favreau, like Downey, knows and understand the material. He was able to respectfully bring Iron Man to the big screen.I highly recommend this for anyone. It combines what made the dreadful Fantastic Four popular and what made Batman Begins so damn good. It finds the balance with light fun, hard core action and in-depth character study.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Love Iron Man!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man was phenomenal! I loved it and I can't stop gushing about it. It was that good. I mean, it might as well be, given it made over $100 million opening weekend.First of all is the cast. Robert Downey, Jr. was born to portray Tony Stark. He portrays Stark as the smart, arrogant magnificent jerk that he is perfectly! And I loved the way he slowly grows a sense of moral consciousness as he does everything he can to correct the wrongs his company has done. Gwyneth Paltrow does a spectacular job as Pepper Potts. She was smart, loyal, witty, and dare I say it, kinda hot. I like Terrence Howard as James Rhodes. He didn't have many scenes, but he did fine in the ones he did.The story was pretty good. It follows the comic book origin pretty closely. As mentioned above, it's mainly about Tony Stark, the futurist businessman and inventor, kidnapped by terrorists and forced to build them their weapons. Instead, he builds an armor and uses it to escape. After returning from his imprisonment, he realizes that his company has been supplying the same terrorists with its weapons and decides to put a stop to it. So he build his own armor and becomes Iron Man to stop them.In conclusion, the movie was awesome. There's great action, humor and characterization. It's worth it to see Iron Man in action. I can't wait for the sequel (Oh, trust me, there will be a sequel).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man is an exciting beginning for the summer movie season</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I have long been a fan of various superhero movies, I admit I only have a passing interest in the "Iron Man" comic books since I only read some '80s issues my brother owned when Tony Stark was suffering from alcoholism and a black associate had taken the mantle. That said, this was a pretty cool action movie directed by Jon Favreau with some subtle humor shoehorned in courtesy of Robert Downey, Jr. as Stark and Gwyneth Paltrow as his associate Pepper Potts. What a nicely romantic team they play here! While there's also Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges to fill up the capable supporting cast, I must mention Clark Gregg as a SHIELD agent who has his own amusing moments in his brief scenes with Ms. Paltrow. He's a regular on "The New Adventures of Old Christine". There's great drama in Afganistan and plenty of kick-butt action in whatever city this movie takes place in that I was wholly enthralled the whole way through. With a sequel already being planned, I wholly look forward to the next adventures of Iron Man! P.S. Check out Stan Lee being mistaken for Hugh Hefner here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE GREATEST Superhero comic book movie I've ever seen!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, it was even better than spiderman. Why? Well, can Spiderman shoot out blazing fire cannons and torpedoes and shoot bullets like a machine gun, lift cars and throw them, crash through concrete walls and floors, and fly faster than a jet 100,000 feet in the air?! I Don't THINK SO! Come to think of it, I don't know any movie comic book superhero who can (except superman of course, but iron man looks MUCH cooler than superman). Anyway, to sum it up, this movie was an excellent summer blockbuster and just blew me and the audience away. The action scenes, the special effects were AMAZING. Rodney Downey Jr and Jeff Bridges were superb and so was Gyweneth Paltrow. Lets face it people, excellent cast/acting, excellent plot, excellent effects, and excellent comic book superhero book hero make it just that....an EXCELLENT movie!! This is one of the very few films that actually deserves to be in the top 250.I was was so hyped up after the movie but became even more hyped when after the credits they let you know there's gonna be a sequel!! WITH THE GUY FROM SNAKES ON THE PLANE(yes, I know his name. I just said that for humor) YES! An iron man sequel! ....In 2010...but hey, I can wait!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW, that is really all I can say about IRON MAN. This film has everything you could want from start to finish. The action is top notch, the comedy well timed, but one issue the film has is it is too damn short.Robert Downey Jr, finally cleaning up his act has shown the world he has what it takes to be a star, and to lead a cast of great actors in the summers IRON MAN. Director Jon Favereau made an excellent choice and he continues to show why he is a director on the rise.The film just keeps giving and giving and never stops, it makes you wonder why every comic book film can't be this great. Maybe Sam Raimi should take notes from this picture before he touches another Spider-Man film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While 'Iron Man' was enjoyable, it didn't meet the expectations that I had based on the critics' glowing reviews of it as I headed into the theater.The main culprit for making it just an "all right" superhero movie are the unnecessary scenes at the start of the film that makes me go sour on it from the beginning.However, the movie does pick up from there, as Tony Stark learns that his own creations are being used for the destruction of Americans after being captivated for three months in Afghanistan.From there, the audience is caught in a flurry of exciting action scenes, with some great special effects and heroic moments, as well as a surprising betrayal to serve as the plot twist. Just the concept of Iron Man, especially is suit, is very cool. But unnecessary scenes, not to mention an unconvincing villain, make this a film that doesn't quite deserve all the glowing recommendations it's receiving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad, not too good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man was an okay movie. I went twice, and I'm thinking about going in for a third viewing. But I'm sorta disappointed, because I am a comics collector and I know how great a potential the character has. What we were given here - and I might be able to forgive Hollywood for it, but Marvel Studios? - was a movie where the acting worked very well, and things looked good, but the plot and story were mediocre at best. The origin story was too long and not "important" enough - I mean, why would this terrorist guy make Tony Stark build him a Jericho missile when he already had several of them (we *see him using them* later in the movie)? Just to get one more? And that's the whole setting for the situation that creates Iron Man? I'm sorry, but that's effin' thin. No points for cleverness there. The visual effects were very good, but I say again that the story was too thin. Too many scenes were too predictable, incl. much of the end. And though the acting was good, the characters had little depth, especially Stane. It's cool enough that they used the Iron Monger story from Iron Man #200 (which came out in 1985 and was the culmination of a long story arc), but it would have been much cooler if they'd introduced Stane as Stark's partner and waited until the second or third movie to have him come out of the closet as a villain. And now that terrorist guy (who's supposed to be The Mandarin, Iron Man's arch-nemesis) is apparently going to build an army of Iron Men, or something like that, for the next movie, making the villains in that one armored as well. Can we please stop filling up Iron Man movies with Iron Man knock-offs? God knows there're enough of them in the comics. At least pick the more interesting ones, like the Mandroids or the Guardsmen.Actingwise, the news is almost all good. Downey Jr. performs to near-perfection and is very believable. Most of the cast is very good, right down to the guy playing Agent Coulson. I only have two gripes, one small and one bigger. The smaller is that Gwyneth Paltrow is a bit wasted on too small a role. Sure, it's an important role, and she plays it superbly, but... I don't know, I just think there should be a bit more to her role than this. More screen time, certainly. Well, maybe in the next movie. The bigger gripe is the only one of the actors who doesn't work for me at all: the guy playing James Rhodes. He's not right. He's not the cool, no-nonsense, hands-on, likable, masculine, pilot grunt that he is in the comics. His own man, a Han Solo-like scoundrel and ladies' man. Oh no, in the movie he's a big-time establishment stooge; a member of the weapons-industrial complex, a typical narrow-minded army man, speaking in an ever so slightly nasal voice. And I hate to pull the color card, but he's not as dark as he is in the comics. Why are Black comics characters always lighter - or should that be whiter - in the movie versions (cf. Storm in X-Men)? Well, what they've done, character-wise, is to turn Rhodey into the War Machine character from the horrifically bad '90s run, where he had a (never satisfactorily explained) falling out with Stark and got his own comic book. So the movie Rhodey is that guy; a weapons freak whose personality is inconsistent with the one he had in the far superior '80s stories. Nobody's got Zagnut anymore...So you see, there are things to complain about here. That Marvel Studios have focused more on the actors than the substance of the story shows you how much they care about the comics: about zilch. They just want to do a commercially successful movie. Make money. Bah! They're as evil as the cigarette manufacturers Ezekiel Stane blew away in Invincible Iron Man #1! Ha! :-)Anyway. Entertaining movie, if rather short of perfect. But enough for a 8 rating. The next one will probably be better. Against the odds, I remain optimistic. It's the only way to live!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transformers = 10x BETTER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Transformers is the winner here...OK, Wasn't a big fan of Iron Man during my childhood years but I certainly loved the suit with the armor and abilities that came with it as it was one of my favourite superheroes on my list. Up until this day, I've bought into the hype of this movie after my thorough research of the films reviews from countless movie critics.Disappointed? Yes &amp; No. (POSITIVES) First of all, great casting. Downey Jr and Gwyneth certainly have chemistry. Second, great story, predictable but holds up in the comic realm. Third, awesome suit and probably the best hero suit out there so far.(Negatives) Story Progression. Unnecessary scenes in the beginning delayed much of the action with too much yappin, not that it wasn't vital to the plot development but it was long winded where it could've been summed up in 10 minutes rather than 40 minutes. *** Spoiler *** The scene where he built the first Iron suit in the cave was just impossible with bare hands considering flame throwers, thrusters and missiles were installed in the prototype suit. Come on BARE HANDS?? In a CAVE?!!! i mean CMON SERIOUSLY?. Whether you're a genius or not, its too far fetched considering everything was built with a screwdriver and hammer. I don't care if its impossible but at least make it LOOK like its possible. For instance, if the terrorist had an underground semi factory for assembling arms, then THAT would've been believable to a certain extent. It's just weird how the final suit was built with his engineered robots/technology when from what it looks could've been accomplished with his bare hands as evidently seen in the cave scene. *** Spoiler Free ***Moreover, some critics claim that it's "Action Packed" haha, well no it isn't. Only one action scene was memorable. I'd say the total action in the entire film is about less than 20 minutes interjected here and there throughout. Humor was short lived. A "haha" in 3-4 scenes tops and nothing more.Settings &amp; Environment was lackluster in particular the non action sequences. Battles at night just occur waaay too often these days in superhero flicks and they all occur in the last battle...it's not like Iron Man's Batman okay? Music. Well I don't remember any from this movie, could use some majestic tunes like the ones in TRANSFORMERS, SPIDERMAN, SUPERMAN &amp; BATMAN. (John Williams, Danny Elfman etc. you name it). Hardly any tunes to defines the hero IRON MAN. Closing Statement:HAD high potential but came up short overall. The limited action sequences were spectacular in some scenes while others were just OK. The armored suit was a real treat, however the special effects weren't awe inspiring. I'd have to say hands down to Transformers and grant the nod to their special effects over Iron Man. Robots in transformers, the transition from a car to a full fledged technological beast was probably the most complex transformation I've ever witnessed on a big screen. Let alone they had like what 8 different robots to work on compared to the lonesome Iron Man. Don't get me wrong, it looked fantastic as Downey suited up but wasn't the best I've seen since Transformers. If you're deciding between Iron Man and Transformers and haven't watched either of them, my pick is Transformers as it's packed with intense action/adventure/comedy/music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kept asking myself, "why Robert Downey Jr." for this role? The movie answers the question. Literate, urban, and sardonic IS an area Downey can project well. I should never have had a doubt.I went to see this with trepidation. A lot of it frankly. Clearly RDJr. has been working out and taking care of himself. Gweneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts was a good idea too (despite the silly olde skool name* her character had) and she played it beautifully.But what really impressed me was two things. A Stan Lee inspired film that stuck very close to the original story line. The biggest major change was in the locale of Tony's injury from Vietnam to Afghanistan. Necessary since there is nothing dangerous to American military going on in Vietnam these days. Beyond that the story was very very close to that envisioned by Lee and Lieberman. Right down to the multiple suit designs.The second was the very excellent use of CGI. It wasn't overpowering. It was designed to WORK with the plot and characters. It was just enough provide the suspension of disbelief that this movie requires.The suit exists...even the idea (new) that certain parts of the suits design acted as control surfaces in flight...and it's an awesome source of power seemed real.It was very well done.There will be a sequel. There's no doubt about that. Downey is the perfect choice for a flawed industry mogul who slips into alcoholism.* A pepper pot was a term for a hot women who enjoyed having fun and acted out her wildest fantasies. This is a term from the thirties. A time that predates even the comic book.</fullReview>

Robert has done a really wonderful job. He matches the character so well, that you just feel so attracted to it. The visual effects are seamlessly brilliant and will take your breath away. I think for me this film has bagged the place in top 10 in my list. Please please, for the first time I am telling someone, this is a must watch. It is amazingly and deserves even more than 10. I had thought that this film, would also be like the other comic book adaptations, but it just blew me. The whole story flows so well that i could go again and again and will not be bored of the film. You can feel the character in you when he is built up. The whole sequence of the body being made in the cave was brilliant. And, the visual effects sequence, of his transforming into his new suit is really rye candy man. The best part is the way Tony Stark as a person is shown. Like the way his life is shown, it is just brilliant. His house is so sexy, that anyone would love to have it. All the characters have done a damn good job and a special applause for Robert. Way to go MARVEL... yeah... it was fun</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Terrific screen adaptation of Stan Lee's comic creation brings Iron Man to life! Directed by Jon Favreau ("Swingers" and Tony Stark's chauffeur) the film blends extraordinary special effects and CGI with some wonderful acting and explosive action.I have long been an admirer of the talented Robert Downey, Jr ("Chaplin" and "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang") and only wish he could keep it together in real life so he could work more often. Favreau really allows Downey's knack for deadpan wise-cracking to play a huge role in defining Tony Stark ... the brilliant, billionaire, playboy, inventor and business tycoon who becomes Iron Man.Every good comic book hero requires a terrific nemesis and Jeff Bridges is wonderful as a shaved-headed Obadiah Stane (and Iron Monger). Bridges and Downey are both top level actors and definitely bring a touch of class to the film (similar to Christian Bale as Batman). The supporting cast is rounded out by Gwyneth Paltrow (rarely seen on screen these days), Terrence Howard and Paul Bettany (the voice of Jarvis - Tony Stark's home based A.I. system). Creator Stan Lee also has a brief cameo as the guy Stark mistakes for Hugh Hefner (actually a pretty funny moment).The only thing keeping this one from greatness is there were just no surprises or twists in the story. We spot the bad guy early and the story travels a pretty familiar arc. Still ... this one is loads of fun and a visual smörg?sbord. Tip: stay til the end of the credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quick review here.You can breathe, fanboys. 'Iron Man' lives up the the hype (unlike that godawful '300'). Robert Downey, Jr. is effective and funny as Tony Stark the profiteer-turned-mechanical-superhero. The action scenes are truly awesome. Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard's poorly written roles are outdone by their finely tuned performances. (Although I did laugh harder at Paltrow's "hohoba" rant in 'Proof' than at any time in 'Iron Man'.) Jeff Bridges is especially good (in an equally bad role), as the John Malkovich/Darth Bill Gates villain.It does seem at times that the screenplay only requires clever dialogue for Downey's character. This nearly lethal habit gets annoying after a bit (I mean after the first five minutes).'Iron Man' is doesn't contain anything new or original, but the performances are excellent, the special effects are exhilarating and groundbreaking, and the inept screenplay does have its moments with some clever dialogue. This is stuff for a particular audience, if you get what I mean.2.5/4</fullReview>

Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful too.But we're in the middle of this awful war now, and this movie gets a lot of stuff wrong. It gets a lot about the Middle East wrong, and it gets a lot about the US wrong.And yeah, this is just an escapist fantasy, and that shouldn't matter. But it kind of pulled me out of the story a little bit.There's this problem I have with so many movies now. It's not peculiar to this one at all. But it's about these violent fantasies we have, and which dominate our movie screens.We keep ourselves immersed in stories in which violence is not only justified, but unavoidable. That's the premise, and then we sort of gleefully sit back and watch as the hero incinerates the bad guys with his flame thrower. And you can't say, that's wrong, because the premise is that the bad guys are really bad, and the hero didn't have any choice.I think this stuff is a lot more toxic than we usually acknowledge.But the two leads are so good here I almost didn't care.

		<fullReview>Very similar to the approach Marvel had with it's Fantastic Four series and other marvel movies; lots of one liners, new model cars (and other shameless displays of endorsements), and cute/kinda lame cameo's by Stan Lee (I love the man but the joke is losing its luster). But you know what, it still was entertaining. Really it was. Hulk (first one), Daredevil, catwoman, punisher, etc. Those are all beneath this one and will probably always reside in that section of the totem poll because they were exceptionally horrible.The only notable complaint I had with Iron Man was this; Gwyneth Paltrow needs to learn to act accordingly in front of a green/blue/whatever screen. There were chase sequences where her character was in danger yet she reacted as if she were missing a flight or an elevator. Just didn't feel the urgency.Otherwise: Downey is still a remarkably efficient softener and Jr. pulled off the acting with flying colors.Oh yeah, I enjoyed leaving the theater with a Sabbath soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent comic book adaptation- others could learn from it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Iron Man' has to be up there as one of the best comic book film adaptations and is certainly one of the most enjoyable films of the year so far. The film, based upon the Marvel comic, centres on billionaire Tony Stark, who has continued with his father's successful weaponry business. However, when a trip to Afghanistan to sell missiles to the US military ends with Stark being held as a prisoner of war, he begins to see the darker side to his work and resolves to change his ways by using his technology and intelligence to do good. And the first step to doing so is for Stark to become Iron Man...Robert Downey Junior is not exactly a big named actor but he easily steps into the role of Tony Stark, the spoilt playboy, and Iron Man, the hero Stark strives to be. Perhaps his own personal issues helped mould Downey to play a role of a man who realises he has to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions but, whatever the case, he definitely brought strength to the character, walking the careful line between delivering jokes and sustaining the serious nature to the film. He was well-supported by a wonderfully evil Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard as the loyal best friend who perhaps will play a larger role in any future sequel and Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's personal assistant who keeps him grounded. Shaun Toub also made his presence felt as the short-time mentor who sets Stark onto his path of heroism.When it comes to the visual effects, 'Iron Man' had it nailed. The action scenes were breath-taking without compromising on the script (since there is nothing worse than a film with excellent CGI and rubbish storyline). As it should be, the plot was what made this film so successful. Unlike other adaptations, specifically 'X-Men', this film never pandered to kids and maintained a more mature storyline and development of the characters. Stark wasn't turned into a twelve-year-old, there were no wee moppets popping up to appeal to children nor was the villain of the piece some two-bit, two-dimensional terrorist.This is an excellent film that should appeal to those who love action flicks as well as comic books/sci-fi. Here's looking to a sequel being released some point in the near future because it is certainly a franchise Marvel should expand upon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other reviews I've read have been mixed, so I was worried that my eager anticipation of this movie was unwarranted. Thankfully, Iron Man turned out to be a rather enjoyable experience for me.Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as the movie's protagonist: genius inventor and weapon's tycoon Tony Stark. He starts off as snarky and arrogant, but he undergoes a change of heart (both figuratively and literally) after he's captured by terrorists who use weapons he's manufactured to do their dastardly deeds. He escapes, thanks to a suit of armor he built on the fly, and vows to use his technology for the betterment of mankind rather than it's destruction. He returns to America, retires to his fancy seaside condo, and begins work on a second prototype of that same suit of armor.As I mentioned before, Downey's performance was fantastic. The supporting cast was pretty good overall as well, particularly Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's perky assistant Pepper Potts (alliterative names are so fun, aren't they?). The only chink in the armor, as far as the cast is concerned, is Terrance Howard. He seems like he's going through the motions, like a high school freshman who doesn't want to be in the play, but his parents forced him to audition for it. His role isn't that big, thankfully, so his lackluster performance is tolerable.My one and only gripe, and one I'll probably get flack for, is that there's not enough action. I like superhero movies with an engaging story and dynamic characters, and Iron Man's characters and plot are well rounded. But more emphasis is put on plot development than blowing stuff up, rather than finding a balance between the two. "Spider-Man" and "Batman Begins" are movies that have successfully found this balance, which is what made them so great.That doesn't mean Iron Man is terrible. In fact, it's far from it. The action that IS there is beautifully orchestrated, the special effects are top notch, and the script is well-written. Throw in the best cameo by Stan Lee since "Mallrats", and you have yourself a great superhero movie.Not a bad way to start the summer...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it after hearing an incredible review from a fellow movie buff friend and... I don't quite understand how IMDb has given Ironman the 99th top movie of all time. It is by NO means that great.After the lights went back on my friend next to me said "That was Great!" I quickly out of frustration said "uh, no it wan't" I then got into several arguments over the weekend over it.I found the movie entertaining and exciting but over all it was just another forgettable movie. The character of IronMAN was weak and we were punished with poor story and writing with such lines as: "I can feel it in my heart" and "I LOVE THIS SUIT!"x3 It wasn't great by any means. It was fun for sure and maybe even "good" but not great. Our grand kids will look back in 40 years and say "They made a movie for that?!" In conclusion, it was fun, weak, and foolish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man rocks!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't want to hear from those comic book readers on whether or not this is a true representation. This is the movie, and it rock! Robert Downey Jr. was born for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man, and I cannot wait to see him later this Summer in The Incredible Hulk, and in Iron Man II, which just has to be made.Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts is just the hottest assistant a man can have, and I cannot, for the life of me, understand why he is not... every day.The two of them together is just screen magic and the banter between them is just so charged with sexual energy - it is just amazing.Terrence Howard was great as his Air Force buddy, and Jeff Bridges was perfect as the man you wanted to see die - every more than the terrorists, and you know that is the truth.The special effects were absolutely out of this world.If there is any criticism of all of this movie, it is that it could have been more adult. A little fun with Leslie Bibb, the stews on the plan giving us a real pole dance...Ah, but they have to tone it down to get the bucks from the teens.It still rocks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first Marvel masterpiece?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now don't get me wrong, I am a fan of many of the other Marvel comic-to-movie series thus far. I really like the X-Men movies and the Spiderman series comes in at a close second. That is not to say that Marvel's movie career has been spotless (Hulk anyone). But, for the most part, the comics have translated into solid movies that do a decent job at living up to their comic book legacy.However, I feel that Iron Man is far beyond any other comic book movies to have been released thus far. It combines a compelling story with great action and stunning CG visuals. Also, I felt that the casting (Downey Jr. especially) was very well done. Everyone seemed to fit their role quite well. One thing that did surprise me (plesently) was the amount of humor that was incorporated in this film without making it too cheesy. I have often felt that the constant one liners have brought the level of the Spiderman movies, and ESPECIALLY the Fantastic Four movies down below their potential. However, the comedy here fits, quite well I might add. There are certainly a fair number of one-liners, most of which are delivered by Tony Stark (obviously), but, for the most part, they don't seem to bring the film down at all. There's no denying that the Fantastic Four movies felt hammy, even childish at times, simply because it was like one big joke.That being said, this is a superb film, and I really cant praise it enough. As always with the Marvel movies stay after the credits, I'm not giving away any spoilers, but I will say that fans of the series will be pleasantly surprised.Wonderful film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Marvel Comics-Based Movie Adaptation...until the last two seconds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man was one of my favorite comic book superheroes. In many ways, he was the Marvel equivalent of D.C.'s Batman, but also the Dark Knight's juxtaposition.Well, leave it to Marvel to so totally screw up the character, as of late, that I can hardly stand the guy any more.That being said, "Iron Man" is, indeed, the finest film adaptation of a Marvel Comic book. It eclipses all of Marvel's other cinematic efforts, even the fairly flawless "Spider-Man 2" and "X2: X-Men United." Robert Downey, Jr. is awe-inspiring as Anthony Edward Stark and his alter ego, the Golden Avenger. It's good to see Downey in top form and he ably proves that he can play the good guy, the action hero, and the star of a huge summer blockbuster.And that's exactly what "Iron Man" is. A huge summer blockbuster. But, the film is also really grounded in reality, features snappy dialogue, and at times, is genuinely funny.Jeff Bridges is terrific as the classic '80s comic book villain Obadiah Stane. He's so nice and charming as Stane, that when he transforms into the villain of the piece, it's quite alarming and disarming (well, at least to those who don't know anything about Iron Man or his rogue's gallery).The film's features spot-on special effects and some great animatronics/costuming work by the legendary Stan Winston. The only time I could tell the "real" Iron Man from the CGI one was when he moved. Otherwise, the transition was flawless.I so totally fell in love with Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's stalwart assistant Virginia "Pepper" Potts. Now, here's a Marvel-based redhead we can get behind after the dour, sour Mary Jane Watson of the last two "Spider-Man" films. Paltrow is absolutely gorgeous as Pepper, and you have to love the way she teetered about in those heels while on the run from danger.The film features a cameo from the Marvel secret agent organization, S.H.I.E.L.D., which has been transformed into an American agency here. And I love the way they are integrated into both Tony Stark and Iron Man's lives. However, why the filmmakers (and more than likely, Marvel's editorial department) chose to have Stark reveal his secret identity at the film's close is really beyond me. What's the point of superheroes at all if they don't have secret identities (the Hulk and a few others notwithstanding)? Yet, much of that shock and disappointment is made up in the post-credits sequence featuring Samuel L. Jackson as Nicholas J. Fury, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s public director basically recruiting Stark and Iron Man for the Avengers, Marvel's premier superhero team (think Justice League).Despite this tiny little gripe, "Iron Man" is amazing, truly amazing. And since Marvel actually financed this small film, hey, they might actually make some money from it this time.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man's real suit is iron clad Robert Downey Jr's performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man, being generally regarded as a second tier superhero was a startling surprise for me as I happened to like it very much. The performance of Robert Downey Jr., who fits comfortably into the role of Tony Stark with his charisma and his intro as a superhero is among the best I've seen. The movie does an amazing job of not alienating the audience unfamiliar with the comic background. Tony Stark's background story and characters are introduced reasonably well. His witty and sarcastic behaviour embodies the Tony Stark from the comic books along with his irresponsible, rash, and womanizing behaviour is all captured well in the movie. That is why I feel Robert Downey Jr. propels this film so well and no other actor alive today can contest his performance as Tony Stark.The film's pacing for most of the part does move along and in no way I felt bored a moment. Even though the story may seem slight in depth when compared to Batman's origin, it still is effective in this context. The action scenes were outstanding and though some may feel not enough I think seamlessly blended with the story with just the right dosage. The visual effects were superb and well done in almost every aspect and was pretty much void of any campiness or overtly done scenes. Iron Man's armour suit experimentation scenes and transformation are well worth the price of admission alone.As for the supporting cast, Jeff Bridges was great as a bad guy even though the motive behind wasn't compelling but understandable as a plot device to further the story for future sequels. Terrance Howard seemed pretty much at ease in his role but I expected more of him in the whole scheme of it which I believe he's being set up for something later. Gwyneth Paltrow was good for most of the part except she seemed to lose some spark near the last hour of the movie.The score of the film had a different feel for the film and I did not quite enjoy it from that perspective, it was as though something lacking in punch. Also the dialogue and script was fine with some funny lines but nothing memorable for me stood out except for few of Tony Stark's delivery.Overall, a very well balanced film that is full of exuberance and it is Robert Downey's iron cast portrayal that soars this movie in a similar vein as it did for Christopher Reeve in Superman and Christian Bale for Batman Begins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow what a marvel!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW!! first of all i have to say that marvel should go solo in regards to making movies as what a difference it made this film is excellent and worthy of the 8 out of 10 i gave it. As Robert Downey JNR is perfect for this role as later on Tony stark lapses into alcoholism as did Downey for a brief period also the chemistry between Downey and Paltrow was fantastic they had a real buzz together and what a film for her to make her comeback the action sequences were exciting and believable they excel the fight scenes from fantastic four which look like they were lifted from a Childerens TV show. The reason why this film does not receive 10 out of 10 is because there are a couple of things that slightly annoyed me the first being their was a little bit to many jokes in their it sort of lowered the tone a bit. The second being that Terrence Howard was wasted in his role they cast this well known face and didn't bother to use him really at all. Overall however i think that this film was a no holes barred thrill ride from start to finish and dare i say it the best of the marvel line up of films so far can't wait for a sequel!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rob't Downey hits one out of the park - with a lob from Jon Favreau</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bad news? The movie lurched to an unsatisfying ending, I thought. But, don't worry, by then it's all anti-climax anyway. 7/8ths of this film is pure joy, straight out of the best comic book experience you ever had. Somehow (director) Favreau's captured it all on film with Downey's and Paltrow's and Bridges' help, all of whom are dead on. I especially liked Downey's portrayal though Paltrow is pure million-dollar assistant. And Bridges makes a wonderful Obadiah Stane, genius Tony Stark's greedy chief executive. Out of the leads, it's only Terrence Howard who seems a little out of step, but not enough to get in the way. The middle eastern bad guys, on the other hand, are wonderful without the slightest condescension.The special effects are beautifully done with only a couple of minor exceptions. But it's the story's unfurling in its own time that made the movie especially delicious in my opinion, and that must have been the scriptwriter's and director's doing. Best of all, as the whole smartly executed mess starts to come in for a landing, you know as surely as you know the sun will rise tomorrow that there will be a sequel and, for once, you can't wait. Is this a guy's movie? I really don't know. I saw it at a matinée with about 6 guys and one woman and she was inscrutable. I suspect she was a bit out of her element. There is a lot of shooting and flying and tech stuff, not the usual female bill of fare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man IS the movie to kick off the summer movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TO begin with, I am not entirely a fan of comic book movies and I have only seen a handful in my life (X-Men, 300, Sin City and Superman Returns). So when I first saw the trailer I wasn't particularly hyped. However, that was stupid of me because Iron Man is great film that even people who don't regularly read comic books can throughly enjoy.The story is about a millionaire named Tony Stark. His company, Tony Industries create weapons and he is extremely well off. One day, when he is in the middle east showing off one of his newer weapons, he is attacked and kidnapped by terrorist. After being demanded to create a missile for them, Stark create a crude powersuit and escapes their clutch. When he returns, he began to work on a much more fine tuned suit.To begin with, all of the acting is superb! Especially Robert Downey Jr. He really brings out the character. None of the character is shallow or overacted. The humor has a good mix of seriousness, humor and action.Many superhero movies tend to have too long of an introduction. Iron Man's intro is absolute perfect. It gives you enough information to make you excited for the rest of the movie without being too long.The special effects look stunning. This is one movie you will want to see in theaters for the experience. Everything looks very believable. I even go to a point where I think the special effects look superior to Transformers.So are there problems? The biggest problem I had with Iron Man is how the final "giant skirmish" was rather underwhelming. It doesn't last very long and the way it ends is kind of lame. The general plot structure also doesn't stray too far away from the superhero movie mold. But that is not really a bad thing.The ending, although abrupt and unexpected, is very original and satisfying. Overall, Iron Man lives up to the hype that was projected by its fans. A great, fun popcorn movie that sure make you hope that future superhero movies will as good as this one (Lets see what happens with The Incredible Hulk). Don't miss out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unspectacular. Stygian. Tedious. Youth Hostel. These are just some of the terms you will never hear in conjunction with 'Iron Man,' the latest Marvel superhero brought to life with hundreds of millions of dollars for the big screen. Happily, it belongs far more to the 'X-Men' and 'Batman Begins' camp more than it does to the poorhouse inhabited by 'Ghostrider,' 'Daredevil,' and 'The Fantastic Four.' However, 'Iron Man' appears to be holding back slightly throughout (clearly for the sequel), which prevents it from properly cementing its status as one of the frontrunners of the superhero genre.Iron Man works due to Robert Downey Jr. It is as simple as that. With any other actor in the role (except perhaps Christian Bale; obviously not an option), the character of Tony Stark would have been an annoying, conceited and unfunny idiot with a beard. Therefore, the film could not work. Downey Jr, on the other hand, becomes Tony Stark incarnate. He makes him likable and believable, especially during his transformation from carefree playboy to killing machine. Unlike other superhero movies, where upon gaining their life changing powers the protagonist becomes a total do-gooder with absolute values towards right and wrong, Tony Stark remains grounded in his own world, maintaining his own flawed set of beliefs and essentially continuing to live as the same person. Due to his status as a playboy there is no blatantly proposed love interest which is a relief because nobody goes to see a superhero film to watch the protagonist try to find true love (think about that, Batman.) Sure, eventually Tony will bed his assistant, the outlandishly named Pepper Potts (a shrewd Gwyneth Paltrow), but not in this instalment so nobody has to worry. Also, as much of Terence Howard's role as Colonel Jim Rhodes (the future most imaginatively titled superhero ever, War Machine) was cut, there is little focus on characters who aren't Tony. Downey Jr has all the time he needs to mould his protagonist into a real human being. Conveniently it also leaves much more time for seamless CGI ass kicking which, with the exception of the final battle, leaves you wishing Tony Stark spent more time in the suit than he does designing it. One case in point is when the 'Man is flying at the speed of sound when he is shot from the air by a tank. After falling hundreds of feet to the ground he stands up, sidesteps a second tank shell and then destroys it with a flick of his wrist. It is so cool. Explosions and death for all.'Iron Man' does not deserve congratulations all round though. Director Jon Favreau decided at some point that, instead of a final battle between good and evil which would uphold the intelligent atmosphere created by the rest of the film, he would direct the sequel to 'Transformers' instead and shoehorn it in. Because apparently that is what everybody wanted. Iron Man battles the ingeniously named and similarly attired Iron Monger (played camped-up villain style by Jeff Bridges), who take turns to punch each other through buildings. When they tire of this (not soon enough), they fly into the air and punch each other some more. Finally, they fall to the ground, punch each other in the helmets a little and then the entire audience has a seizure and dies. It is such a letdown. Sure, Jeff Bridges' character was a little cartoonish in relation to the darker tone pervading the film anyway, but that doesn't mean that the final twenty minutes of 'Iron Man' should be the equivalent of watching somebody play a video game.Aside from this, 'Iron Man' is still easily able to support its reputation as the first of this Summer's 'must-see' blockbusters and, with Robert Downey Jr wholly committed to the character and the inevitable sequels, it could supersede 'Spiderman' as Marvel's flagship franchise. The creases just have to be ironed out. As Jim Rhodes says, "Next time, baby!"</fullReview>

Jon Favreau's direction also promised a bit of humour, and it didn't disappoint. There were times when the whole audience was laughing. The action is good, fast-paced and exhilarating, the effects are suitably amazing and I don't know too much about Iron Man but I did some research before I saw the film and it seems to be well cast. The acting is what you'd expect for a film like this, the great cast all do their job well.All in all, a solid superhero film that while not in itself memorable will keep me looking forward to the next one, as it should. Let's hope the quality stays consistent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man is a great movie, solid like a piece of steel!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to many people I didn't read this comics. I only knew the name of this Hero and that he wore an armor. Then I can't compare the movie with the BD, I can't simply speak about the movie. And it's more than enough. Before I see it I was scared that it would be like others totally failed (at random, fantastic 4). But Iron man is not one of these piece of these bad movie. The movie has much qualities particularly great acting, visual effect... Robert Downey Junior is not the most famous actor in Hollywood hence I'm very surprise how he mastered Stark character. He play perfectly this eccentric billionaire, all the film is based on the starks character. It's almost the Downey Jr one man show, but that not damages the movie quality. Effectively the other actors are really good and find their place in the show. In particularly Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) whose the relationships with Tony are very funny. By the way humor is very well inserted in the movie especially by Tony. Besides the great acting the movie benefits from impressive visual effects. Particularly during the Iron Man scene of flight and fight. Of course it the least it can be for "Iron Man". To summarize Iron Man is a success, brilliant mixing between great visual effects good acting and humor. This movie is as solid as a piece of steel! You can definitively go watch this movie. No you must go! Great job mister Favreau!!!</fullReview>

The effects and action are quite good, though people may have wanted more. I left the theater satisfied! Overall, a highly entertaining superhero movie thanks to the great performance by R.D. Jr. This is my second favorite superhero movie of all time after Batman Begins (Though I think Dark Knight will soon take the top spot). However as far as Marvel movies go, this one is by far the best (sorry spider-man, you promised more!). All comic movie fans will enjoy this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than I thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the last years we have been witness of an endless number of comics's adaptations to movies. Most of them have resulted films more or less entertaining or achieved. Only characters like Batman on Nolan's hands or even Reimi's Spiderman or Singer's Xmen have been the most redeemable, others like Hulk or Fantastic Four have been good for forget it. Just when I thought that Iron Man would fall on this kind, I took a big surprise.This Marvel's hero adaptation destroyed all my expectations. And is that from beginning to end Robert Downey Jr. completely takes the entire film. Tony Stark's character is perfectly accomplished and makes that everyone believed his performance. But if that weren't enough Iron Man is surrounded by and endless number of characteristics that makes it appealing to all levels.This adaptation remains faithful to comic's story, the action sequences are well distributed along the plot, the romantic tension between Downey and Platrow works all time, the Bridges evil dazzles as their performance and the cynicism of most of the sequences makes story fresh and specially striking. But to this should be added the historic contextual framework because fits perfectly with the currently world situation and specially United States that lives in this crossroads between the peace with weapons or without them.Iron Man is entertaining from beginning to end. Nobody would believe that this could be the best summer film but I can assure you that if the majority of movies that will come has the same quality that this: wow, this could be the best summer talking about movies. Because definitely the film's end leaves you wanting more, and this is just starting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man surprised me for it was more than I expected - it actually went more for the 'background story' of Tony Stark, than the easy way out as most summer blockbusters of Marvel/DC comics to the big screen - lot of action and little story. Iron Man is one of those comics though that has a story to tell first out and I'm glad this development chose this route. This I found most refreshing and entertaining - leaving the door open for another installment that CAN be more action packed.Robert Downey Jr., is a good cast for Tony Stark - showing you how womanizing, alcohol-drinking, egotistical, M.I.T. Magna Cume Laude Tony Stark develops into Iron Man. Gweneth Paltrow was ...okay - not much to crow about as Pepper Potts ...anyone of a number of actresses could have done the same. The actor they SHOULD be talking about is Jeff Bridges. He did quite the bang up job for this installment - showing how corporate hierarchy works and how he intended to keep his star shining in the pecking order - internationally...devilishly good. A very entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved it...do you need more than that? Okay the comic geek who red a huge chunk of every appearance of the character was pleased in spirit if not in action. Like the first time we saw and heard Wolverine's claws come out in the first X-Men movie, the moment that kind of sold me was when the camera pulls back to reveal Tony's mansion-and it was Tony's mansion (Later the comic book team Avengers' west coast headquarters). At that point I knew it was all okay, at that moment the geek went away and said they got it right and calmed down.yea its an origin story and yea you know how its going to come out- but the neat thing is there is a sense of danger, that everything may not be okay-hey Tony is injured in the opening minutes so you know he can and will be hurt. I love that its an origin story that hasn't been done to death-thank god Ironman was never Spiderman so his origin was never the stiff of endless spoofs and rip offs. Best of all I love the characters. All of the characters are there and they are real. Sure there is slight modification for the real world but they are there and you care about them- so much so that the action almost seems like an intrusion into the rest of the film. I especially liked Jeff Bridges as Obediah Stane. At last he gives a real performance and not one of his lispy toss off appearances of late. Here we have a wonderful evil man.I don't want to spoil it by saying too much...If I have any complaints- and there are two- its first that the film is almost too breezy. Its moves like the wind from start to finish with Robert Downey giving one hell of a central performance (He holds it all together). However the problem is that the meat seems to be missing-or at least invisible. Yes I know its not needed but I would have loved to have seen more of the back stories and subplots hinted at and that bleed off the screen. I love that the world and the people all exist outside the film-however I wished we could have seen more(though I know that would have slowed or killed the flow of the film). My second complaint is that the effects are at times too CGI. Its not so much the look- but the weight-when we see the later suits in action they don't have a real world weight. Its a nit pick, but it bothered me that such a wonderfully fun film missed something so tiny.Still I loved it- 9 out of 10 on the pure fun scale. No it ain't high art but it is a great thrill ride-and as for the post credits bit- Oh yea I'm there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, they made a comic book super hero film that was true to the source material (in spirit anyhow) and a great film! This film has action, heart and impressive special effects that didn't seem (oh no not another CGI shot again), a good plot, a great hero and a great villain.Robert Downey Jr was fantastic - and a lot of the films success rests on his bravura performance.In fact the movie was SO good, I really have to struggle to quibble with it. OK, having the Vietcong as the enemy wouldn't fly nowadays, but did we really need to have Middle Eastern terrorists? Do we REALLY need yet more stereotypes that Muslims and Arabs are cold blooded killers bent on mass destruction? Yes, I know they never were explicitly labeled as Arabs/Muslims, but they came across that way anyhow. If they wanted to make these 'generic' terrorists they could have been "white English speaking" folks. It would have worked the same.Aside from this (and many would not even care), the movie was fun, fast, exciting and I can't wait to see it again and buy it on DVD! Not sure how many other films I felt that way after leaving the theater.And, those after credit scenes - WOWZA!!! Worth the wait!!</fullReview>

Even the CG was really well done and looked great.To help you understand why liking this came as such a big shock to me, here is a list of Marvel based movies I really didn't like: X-Men, Spider-Man, Daredevil, X2, Hulk, Spider-Man 2, Elektra, Fantastic Four, X-Men: The Last Stand, Ghost Rider, Spider-Man 3 and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.I heard Iron Man is the first movie to come out of Marvel Studios. If this is a sign of what Marvel Studios is going to do for these movies, then I think there's a chance I may not be disappointed in the future. I thought the new Hulk movie looked pretty good from the trailers, but if Iron Man is an indication of what Hulk will be like, I can only imagine it will be fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than xmen and spiderman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the story starts out, man captured, man tortured, man build suit of armor to kill terrorists, then man raise hell and kill bad guys in the u.s. But the premise is so much more, its multi-layered fun and what Hollywood has been waiting for. Partly everyone wanted to see a comeback from Robert Downey Jr. and we got it, he is perfect in this role, funny, the movie would of sucked if it was anybody else ex:tom cruise. the action in this movie is amazing cgi and an estimated 180 million dollar budget definitely was put to good use. Rarely in superhero movies we get this much comedy and rarely is it that the superhero was part of an evil corporation and changes has views and defends the good. Jeff bridges: where the heck has he been, his portrayal as the main villain in this movie is well catered, no big lebowski though. Gwenyth paltrow gave an excellent performance, one of her best in my view. Terrence Howard: good job. I think this is better than xmen and spiderman because this wasn't as well known as those comics, but it packed a punch, if portrayed well this could be one of the best superhero movies ever and it is. Go see this movie and make sure you stay after the credits for a little tease.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I think of action heroes, I have to admit that Robert Downey Jr. would not be on my list. I thought he was still in jail/rehab for DWI's or something. But when an actor does a surprisingly good job, it makes the movie that much better. Much like Damon did for "Bourne" and McGuire did for "Spiderman", Downey delivers an excellent performance. The effects are well done without being overwhelming, there's a nice anti-war message without being hokey and though the potential romance is a little predictable, it's a great flick. It's not too violent for the kids and 7 and 4 year old loved it. Is this the turn-around Downey? I sure hope so. He's come a long way since "Less Than Zero". Way to go Downey!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't see anything really wrong with this movie, save for a somewhat rushed final act. Okay there's this.SPOILER!Villain Jeff Bridges is shown having trouble getting his Bigger Iron Man thingie buildt-traditional yelling at the guys in the white coats stuff-but sure enough, there he is, driving Robocop II around, flying it around like a Jet fighters, using it's weapons etc-almost as if he were testing out a Minivan. I'm not so sure about that instantaneous learning curve, lemme put it that way....But the rest-the stuff showing Downey as Iron Man, Downey as the Hugh Hefner/boozy Howard Hughes cross, the captivity, the interplay w/ Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow-that's all aces. I loved Jarvis. I really liked all the flight scenes and his taking out the Taliban/Mandarin guys in Afghanistan.Sure it DOES follow a traditional Origin storyline, and sure you want More, if anything-but-face it, this is what you want in a comicbook hero film.***1/2 very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really nice surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a fan of Iron man as a comic, but know a bit about the character, so when I heard they were doing a film I was not really that bothered about it. When the trailers came out i was not that impressed, so even considered giving the film a miss....However I gave the film a go and was really glad I did.The story is a great origin story, we get to see why Tony(Downey Jr) needs to become Iron man and see how he changes as a man. We get to see him develop the suit and see how he changes from selfish weapons designer, into a selfless hero. It has funny moments, quite a few serious ones, a dash of romance and a healthy dose of action, which enables this film to appeal to a large audience, as there is something in there for everyone. It also has great re-watch potential.Downey Jr, plays Tony Stark really well, he adds a flare to the character and also at times brings real weight to the role, he also has a very dry wit, which makes you laugh, but can then switch to serious and makes you feel for the character and what his mission is.The supporting actors were also good, from Jeff Bridges, plays a great villain, who you can believe and Gwyneth Paltrow, plays an effective personal assistant/love interest.It is a self contained movie but also manages to set up sub plots, so there is still room for all the characters to grow in the sequels if they wish.The good thing about the film is that it gives nods to the fan boys/girls but not overly so, so comic fans will get a blast from the movie but non comic fans can also enjoy it too and are not left out of the loop. So it is a film which appeals to all.In terms of effects In the trailers I saw some bad CG but in the finished film the The effects are outstanding. You can see that all of the budget is on the screen and effects that looked bad in the trailers look great in the finished product. This combined with some good action sequences, make Iron man a very good action movie.To Summarise: The film has great acting, a great story with good effects and action, this is a must see for all and I can not wait for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun and serious film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man has a nice contrast for an action movie. It has a gritty theme to it which is derived from real life and yet it's able to hyper it up without becoming totally unappreciative. The performances, special-effects and cinematography of the film all work for the comic-book movie.The only problem I see with the film is that it fails to set itself firmly apart from the rest of the Marvel Mythos Films. It has its own cast of characters but they all appear to be hand-me-downs from the rest of the Marvel films in some ways. The climactic clash in the latter half of the film also felt predictably obvious. We already have the X-Men and Spider-Man movie franchises to offer us the big duke-it-out fights and I just wish they could have come up with something more original for Iron Man.Altogether Tony Stark has never been one of my favorite comic-book characters, but the movie version of Iron Man is none the less worthy of watching. I'll also probably want to see the sequel but it just fades in many ways when compared to the other Marvel Features.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shellhead flies to victory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? My childhood favourite Marvel superhero gets a movie worthy of his name and is probably second only to Spiderman 2 as the best Marvel film yet. The offbeat, yet interesting casting of Downey Jr as Tony Stark - as offbeat as Kelsey Grammar as Beast - provides as character study that keeps you hooked through the expository scenes. Manchild Stark is sleazily likable enough and Downey conveys a jaded world-weary tone with his posture during the scene with the pole-dancing stewardesses. This is a man ripe for a fall and his scenes with the Afghans have all the urgency of an Oliver Stone movie. Yinsen is interestingly expanded upon from the Oriental original to an intriguing figure who gives Stark his heart back in more than one sense of the word. The original grey armour is plausibly rough-hewn and its nice to see Stark is a ruthless combattant who has no qualms about sending baddies off to a nasty end - how does that match with an Avengers oath. My one complaint is that there are few action scenes for shellhead. The story of how Stane develops his Iron Monger armour is a nice twist and Jeff Bridges - an unlikely choice for the main baddie - comes across as an intriguing variant on John Huston in Chinatown - outward bonhomie occasionally slipping to show the dangerously hollow man underneath. Gwynneth Paltrow has a gawky charm as the lovelorn but unappreciated Pepper Potts though I'm more of a Bethan Cabe man myself and the final clash with Stane is bog-standard - but roll on the sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "slightly great" superhero treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings about this movie. Robert Downey is great - as always. The way delivers his witty lines (many of them his own creation), the way he expresses emotions with his eyes - you don't find those often in superhero movie. Paltrow was delightful, thanks to her lines, while Bridges and Howard were slightly forgettable. I heard that Howard's screen time was cut a lot, and it shows (I don't even know why he's there).Though the movie succeeds at depicting the human side of Iron Man, I still think the switch from weapon tycoon to "save the world from weapons" hero was a tad too fast. In the comics the physicist imprisoned with Stark was Stark's idol; here they hardly knew each other, so it wasn't that convincing when Stark was so affected by the physicist's death. I mean, of course he saw that his weapons were being sold to the terrorists and whatnot, but...come on, he produces weapons - couldn't he have foreseen that, at least once? But overall, it was a very enjoyable movie. Well-structured, well-scripted, well-acted, well-CGI-ed. I'd prefer it to be a little bit more emo, like Batman Begins, but it seems it's gonna get real dark and real emo in the next 2 sequels. Will be looking forward to that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man revives Superhero genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since 'X-Men' was released in 2000, the superhero genre has been a constant on our screens. In the last few of years, the novelty looked to have finally faded, with films like 'Daredevil', 'Superman Returns', 'Ghost Rider', 'Spider-Man 3' and the "Fantastic Four' films failing. However the genre has been given a boost thanks to 'Iron Man', the best superhero film since 'Batman Begins' and will rival its sequel 'The Dark Knight' (out in July) as the big blockbuster movie for 2008. The plot concerns Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) a prodigal weapons manufacturer (who inherited his company ? Stark Industries - from his late father) who likes to drink and party, with secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) ? and Jim Rhoades - his only allies. On a mission to Afghanistan (which is updated from the Vietnam setting in the comics), he is captured and forced by terrorists to build his new weapon, the Jericho. With some help from Yinsen ? who builds a magnet which keeps the shrapnel in Tony's body from reaching his heart - Tony creates an "Iron Man" suit and escapes. Upon reaching home, he announces that he's downgrading the weapons part of his business, which doesn't sit well with Obiah Stone (Jeff Bridges) who's only concerned about the bottom line, and lusts after Tony's job. Stone, desperate to have the company for his own, builds his own suit (from remains of Tony's original suit left behind in Afghanistan) to become the "Iron Monger". Seeing the destruction his weapons can cause if in the wrong hands, Tony vows to harness his "Iron Man" suit to save mankind. 'Iron Man' works for a number of reasons: It manages to balance the necessary origin story with enough action and humour to keep the audience interested; Robert Downey Jr is fantastic as the troubled genius Tony Stark. He manages to portray the hard-living, slightly egotistical Tony with humour and avoided making him look like a complete jerk; It's very well-written. While it's a touch over two hours, not a moment is wasted. Like every good movie, nothing in 'Iron Man' is accidental. There's even time for an obligatory cameo from Stan Lee, and a nod to Rhodes' appearance as Iron Man's partner. Overall, "Iron Man' is brilliant. Downey Jr is superb is his role and is one of the most charismatic heroes since Christopher Reeve. With numerous sequels all but guaranteed, filmgoers will be seeing a lot more of 'Iron Man' in years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Downey Triumphant as the Invincible IRON MAN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although not as well known as other Marvel Comic icons as Spiderman or X Men, this film adaptation of Iron Man works due to the sure hand of director Jon Favreau (Swingers, Elf) who cleverly mixes action, drama, humor, and a totally winning performance by comeback actor, Robert Downey Jr. In terms of a first film showing a superhero's origin, it is the one of the best to date.Billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is a weapons manufacturer whose cavalier attitude and playboy appetite are matched only by his sheer genius in technology. On a tour of his weaponry in Afghanistan, he is wounded in the heart by shrapnel and captured by rebels who order him to build a super weapon of mass destruction. With the help of another civilian, Stark changes up and instead builds a powerful suit of high tech armor that sustains his weak heart and enables his escape but not without a price. Guilt ridden and traumatized by his experiences, Stark has a literal change of heart and alters the militaristic direction of his company much to the chagrin of his elder partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). A couple of friends, his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and military liaison, Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), stick loyally by Stark's side despite his earlier predilections. Intent on improving and perfecting his Iron Man suit, Stark experiments with its design and takes dangerous risks. His mission is to utilize his Iron Man technology to fight the evil in the world, starting first in Afghanistan. When the truth comes out about what Stark Industries is really doing with weapons sales, it leads to a deeper conspiracy and a battle of titans as Iron Man meets an old foe.Buffed and in terrific physical condition, Downey is quite convincing as the prodigy whose initial devil-may-care attitude must undergo a transformation. (It is not without irony that the role and the person should merge in light of Downey's real life, personal setbacks.) The movie rests on his shoulders, and he makes the most of his role. Bridges is great at playing a businessman with a sinister agenda. Paltrow strikes sparks with Downey and you yearn for more scenes with the two of them. The same goes for Howard as Stark's best friend. What is a little hard to swallow is how Pepper and Rhodes could put up with such a pompous persona in the early goings.Favreau has an amusing bit part as an assistant to Stark. Further, the robotic voice that assists Stark in his technological work is actor Paul Bettany! And yes, Stan (the man) Lee, one of the comic book creators, has a fleeting cameo.The scenes, which show Stark developing his updated Iron Man suit and test-driving it, are realistic and at times amusing. The Iron Man suit 2.0 is a marvel of construction and is the coolest thing imaginable. There is no way that this concept of a hero could have been rendered as convincingly even a few years ago. My how movie magic has caught up with these stories finally and done them justice. It is clever how the film incorporates the original Iron Man design (which brings to mind a sort of poor man's version of Robocop) and progresses through its more modernized version. Pure fans of the original comic (including myself) are thrilled at the reverence paid to the classic beginnings.There is an aerial battle between American fighter jets and Iron Man that is a lot of fun. The special effects, while being among the most realistic and cleverly used in any action film, are well integrated with the strong narrative. Despite the eye candy, you get the feeling that the filmmakers never lose sight of what the story is about and how to stay focused on the characters. The pacing is excellent.In terms of subplots, the Afghan conflict hits close to home with the current war in Iraq. Also, the secret government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. gets an introduction as support for Stark and figures to have a bigger role in future Marvel movies; don't forget to stay until the credits are done for a bonus. The film has an edge about it in dialogue and theme, and is better for it especially in the final scene, which is surprising and has implications for future adventures.I would put this film on par with Batman Begins and Spiderman, not bad company. While not as emotionally stirring as the best moments of X Men United or Spiderman 2, this is only the first of what likely will be a long running franchise. If the sequel can maintain the same quality as this effort, we could be in for the best superhero movie yet! And lest there be any doubt about Favreau's ability to take on comic heroes, don't worry; he understands what they mean and how to do them justice. He 'get's it'!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great guns of Zeus! This is exactly how a summer blockbuster should be made. I wouldn't change one thing about it. Kudos, Marvel. Kudos, Jon Favreau. Kudos, Robert Downey Jr. Jon's recipe for the summer blockbuster:Start with: 1. A believable incredible plot. And no - that's not an oxymoron.Mix in a little: 2. Classically rendered, yet not over the top, CGI.Add: 3. Controlled sustained performances. Cook for 120 minutes with: 4. A tight, never-a-dull-moment script (so no weepy, teary eyed drama jerkers coming out of nowhere) Finally garnish with: 5. Humor and potentially some of the best cheesy one liners to be used in a superhero movie.And serve! We, the audience, will lap it up like the Apple pie mommy made! Puh-leese Marvel studios - can you make your other superhero movies as much fun to watch as this one? Pretty please. I know you didn't oversee that monstrous awfulness that was Spidey 3. But there's still some bad taste left from that experience. And you've made me like one of the superheros from your roster that I never really cared about that much in the past.Oh boy, oh boy!

		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to get tickets for Iron Man on its opening day. I had been eagerly anticipating the movie since seeing the first trailer months ago and was excited by the strong cast and having Favreau as director. With all this hype I was fearful of being disappointed. Thank God I wasn't. This movie met and eventually exceeded all of my expectations.Robert Downey Jr. is outright amazing in this movie and is definitely back in the A-list of his career. Even Gwyneth Paltrow, who I have NEVER been a fan of, was believable and very likable as Pepper Potts. One thing I liked was the way this movie was able to change and poke fun at the Iron Man mythology of the comic books without completely altering the character. The script took advantage of having such a strong cast and let them dominate the film rather than making the special effects the star; which usually happens in superhero films like this one. The fight scenes, while fantastic, were secondary to the growth of the Tony Stark character. The final fight scene was exciting and never overdone. Many other superhero movie franchises could learn from this film. Just because much of the audience is fanboys doesn't mean the film has to be silly or even pretentious.Non-fans of the comic book will like this movie as well. It was very well done and I'm now looking forward to future Favreau projects. I'll happily buy this on DVD. It was never overly violent or bloody and had only semi-strong language at most. Take the entire family. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is another film in a long list already made and to come that have made the jump from comic book page to the big screen. Some have failed miserably, like Catwoman, Ghostrider, Batman and Robin or Howard the Duck, and some have broken through magnificently, The Crow, Sin City, Superman and X-Men to name a few. This doesn't mean that everyone will like or hate them or that they have stayed true or run amok from the original creators interpretation. Some have not worked as a film and others have.I am not a huge reader of Iron Man but from what I remember and have researched the story stayed similar to the comic books.For me though we are in a time of great imagination and technology and films like Iron Man could not have been done even 10 years ago.The plot was solid and the character believable, thanks to a good script and a wonderfully light and subtle performance from Robert Downey Jnr, all added to a slick and witty piece of entertainment with outstanding CGI.Will it stand the test of time? Who knows? I predict it will do well. Better then the awful looking next appearance of Hulk, coming soon, but probably not as well as the next Batmn installment which I look forward to with drooling mouth.For comic fans everywhere films are here to bring you out of the static imagined world of the comic, which is totally fantastic don't get me wrong, and into the big bucks of Hollywood. All need to change in some way for the transition and the end result will tell.Some will stink and some will rock. But I am eager to see more.This latest marvel of Marvels for me is fantastic and worth every penny you spend on it.Peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wisely adapting the most reality-grounded aspects of Tony Stark's origins and adventures to becoming the "Golden Avenger," Jon Favreau has brilliantly balanced the elements that create an entertaining movie ? let alone an enjoyable superhero movie. With a competent cast of A-list actors, Iron Man should easily please both die-hard fans of the superhero as well as general audiences seeking an epic thrillride.Arrogant, womanizing playboy Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has it all ? beautiful women, a powerful weapons-manufacturing company, and more money than he knows what to do with. On a business trip to Afghanistan, Stark's convoy is ambushed and the billionaire is taken hostage by terrorists, while also sustaining a life-threatening injury. With the aid of fellow prisoner Yinsen (Shaun Toub), Stark tricks his captors into believing he will agree to their demands of building a dangerous missile ? instead he devises a technologically advanced robotic suit of armor to assist in their escape. Once freed, Stark reevaluates his life's work and the lethal side effects of his company's intentions that he so blindly ignored. Constructing an even more elaborate and effective suit, Stark becomes Iron Man and vows to save those he has placed in harm's way.As with the origins film of any superhero franchise, plenty of care must be taken with the development of the primary protagonists. Favreau has found a delicate balance between back story and high-flying adventure, leaving Iron Man void of any dull moments. Action junkies may find the number of fight sequences a little on the slim side, but Stark's transformation from selfish playboy to noble superhero is interesting enough to counteract the lack of nonstop explosions ? in fact, the final showdown of the film is actually rather underwhelming when compared to the engaging progression of Stark's character.While it may be true to an extent that Robert Downey Jr. has fallen into the steady path of playing himself in every movie, those with a healthy knowledge of the comics will likely concur that Downey's portrayal of the fast-talking, sarcastically quirky Tony Stark is exactly as it should be. Stark's character is believable, flawed, and realistic ? one easily identifiable with and worth rooting for in the battle against evil ? and Downey Jr. has found the perfect equilibrium of quick wit and confident bravado for his armored superhero. A surprising amount of humor has found its way into Iron Man, primarily thanks to Downey's assured performance and his interactions with an equally able cast. Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's clever assistant Pepper Potts holds her own against Downey's scene-stealing verbal antics, and even Terrence Howard gets to deliver some slick exchanges. An almost unrecognizable Jeff Bridges injects the immoral Obadiah Stane with enough cunning maliciousness to create a worthy opponent for Stark (only going slightly overboard in the film's climax).Virtually all comic-based entities will bear harsh scrutiny from the legions of faithful fans, and Iron Man is no different. Favreau's decision to adapt the Golden Avenger's reality-based escapades to create a more believable hero should please newcomers, while longtime fans of the character will enjoy the numerous winks and nods thrown in especially for those already familiar with Iron Man lore. Since events in the comics involve everything from time travel to alien dragons, slight artistic changes to the superhero's origins for the sake of a wider audience should be expected and not entirely unwelcome. Certainly many minor inconsistencies and faults (such as an over dependency on technology to solve problems) can be dissected by excessive analysis, but for its ability to produce pure, mesmerizing entertainment, Iron Man is a glowing success and a promising start for both the crimson hero and this year's summer blockbusters.- Joel Massie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is not your typical superhero movie. Forget the screaming fans, the nerdy boy who becomes the hero, the mad scientists and the radiation experiment gone wrong. This is perhaps the perfect superhero movie. From the mind of Stan Lee comes Iron Man played brilliantly by Robert Downey J, a film with comedy, jaw-dropping effects, great villains, unique action sequences and a plot that would make Spiderman's missions look quite lame. Robert Downey Jr. Is perfect in the role as the owner of a company which builds weapons. Frankly I could not have thought of a better person in the role as Tony Stark. If you enjoy movies like Spider-Man, Transformers and X-Men then this movie is for you. The Incredible Hulk and the Dark Knight have some very stiff competition at the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gold and Titanium Alloy Man......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>....................................just doesn't sound quite right.Jon Faverau scores a hit with this latest Marvel adaptation. Much like the initial entries of Spiderman, X-Men and MAYBE even Fantastic Four, the production values in this latest sci-fi/comic adaptation are tight and worth the exorbitant admission price. Story line, screen play and script are all good and well executed. Glad to see that 'Marvel' has created it's own production company. I think that this can only help in delivering projects which are truer to original concept, both now and in the future. This movie is one to see in the fancy theater, particularly if it has a giant screen and great sound system.The integration of topical events into the story line provides a credible backdrop to the milieu. The plot was interesting and flowed well, although credibility must be suspended during certain parts..... but hey, it IS a movie and I had no problem buying into the story. CGI technology keeps getting better and better and this film takes full advantage of that.Robert Downey is very good as Tony Stark and I must admit that I've never been a huge Downey fan, but he pulls it off as the somewhat arrogant, wise cracking genius billionaire wunderkind. I've got new respect for him. Jeff Bridges displays versatility with his portrayal of the corporate baddie, Obadiah(?) Stane....he is impressive in this role. In my view, he has elevated himself to the next level of acting credibility AND capability...BRAVO,'DUDE'! Gwyneth Paltro, as Pepper Potts, looks pretty but is bland and forgettable in her portrayal of Tony Stark's assistant. A better casting choice would have helped here. Batman's 'Alfred' she is not. Jon Faverau and Stan Lee are seen in very brief cameo....cool !There's no cussing, nudity or overt sex in this film. There is, however, lots of action, effects and stuff blowing up. I found it to be a satisfying experience. I just hope the sequels will not disappoint, as they have with so many similar franchises.......I rate it 8.5.........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why isn't the sequel in the works already?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Marvel over DC, but I didn't know anything about Iron Man. So, I read the article on Wikipedia and was glad to do so. Jon Favreau just caters to comic book readers and at the end there's a huge twist.If you don't go in without knowing about the story, it will still be a really good movie, but you will miss a few very well placed jokes about a sequel and who will be in it. Robert Downey, Jr. is perfect for the lead role and the supporting cast was great as well. The effects like the other person said, were not overdone and very believable. It made for a more flawless movie. I was also glad not to see any stupid montages. Most of the time that is just a way to cut corners like in Fantastic four. If you are going to do the origination story, give it as much substance as possible. This is the second best Marvel movie I've seen. Spider-man 2 still reigns supreme. Note: Stay after the credits, there's a little something at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great start to a promising movie viewing season</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, this was a surprise. I went in thinking this was an action film and find it is an action enhanced drama. A bit preachy at times but only in light the of current state of a world in chaos, the movie works through its plot at a steady pace slowly building towards the eventual showdown between good and evil. For a plot, you discover that our hero builds and sells "bad" things that hurt people and destroy countries until he is thrust into a situation where he comes face to face with his own creations. Stocks start tumbling and the government begins to panic when his conversion takes him to a place where he wants to save the world instead of control it through fear.The mechanics of this movie are fun, even for non-geeks. Not that we haven't seen some of this action before: The Human Torch in Fantastic 4 and of course the sequences of conversion used in Transformers were a little on the obvious side. However, the one thing that was injected into Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Stark was a live sense of human trial and error. The development of the power source was a little hard to believe, seeing his first prototype was assembled in a cave with very little technology to help him; but once he starts putting the armor in place his obsession swings into overdrive. If a movie pulls you into an experience that the current character is witness to, I call that a successful filming.I have no problem with the idea of kids watching this, though for both kid and the rest of the audiences enjoyment an adult should be with them if they are under 12. It's tame on any intimacy, and though it is there, it briskly moves on mainly to emphasize the developing characters. It's fun. It's bold. It has some cool action scenes that are highly geeked out. It is a movie where the CGI and gadgets support the script instead of the other way around (A failing many movies make).This is a great start to what is looking like a great blockbuster season. -BPS: You need to sit through the credits for a surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up until now, my all-time favourite superhero movie was the superb Batman Begins - but Iron Man trumps it. Other critics have mentioned that it doesn't have enough action scenes. Well, it didn't seem like that to me. In fact, it's a long time since I spent such an enjoyable 2 hours in a cinema. What carries this film along between the action scenes (spectacular and funny when they come) are the smart, snappy script - full of brilliant, laugh-out-loud one-liners - and the excellent performances. I even found Gwyneth Paltrow watchable, which is a bit of a first. Jeff Bridges, too, turns in his usual goods. But the star of the show is, of course, Robert Downey Jr. At first, I couldn't imagine him in the role of a superhero - but he carries it off brilliantly. I was reminded many times of his character in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. He plays it with that same blend of quirkiness and sass. After this, other superhero movies (Batman Begins aside) fade into the background. None of the bum-aching tedium of the Spiderman or X-Men franchises. And not a whiff of taking itself too seriously, either. Excellent soundtrack, too. A superbly entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll say this, I've never been in love with the Iron-Man comics. I have always felt that if Marvel could find a way to translate the character to the big screen, however, the results would be awesome. If this is a preview of what the summer movie season has in store, we are all in for a treat. This movie belongs in the categories with Batman Begins and the first Spider-Man installment. In fact, as a franchise, if the writers can continue to come up with believable plot lines and villains for Iron-Man to contend with, Iron-Man could supplant Spider-Man as their best box-office hero.You can get a plot summary elsewhere, I just want to say the story was good, the cast was great and the action sequences were excellent.Definitely worth the price of admission....a few times *******slight spoiler below******************************************* To all those people who said Sam Jackson wasn't in their version of the movie, I ask if they waited around until after the credits. He does make an appearance as Nick Fury, standing in Tony's home in Malibu after all the credits roll. Here is where I beg Marvel to NOT MAKE AN AVENGERS MOVIE. Didn't you learn anything from the Fantastic Four and X-Men. Movies about groups of super-heroes are terrible because there isn't enough time to deal with all the characters. Why do you think DC never makes any movies about their super-groups (with the exception of the upcoming JLA movie, and I'm not too optimistic about that one either). Just a suggestion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful. Great summer blockbuster. Favreau, Downey, and Paltrow are magnificent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, why didn't someone think of this before? If you're going to make a superhero movie, why don't you get a truly great actor for the title role? Well, that's because most great actors are not the summer blockbuster type (see Daniel Day Lewis or Philip Seymour Hoffman). However, in Iron Man, we get to see the talents of one of the greatest actors of his time, Robert Downey Jr., in full force. Simply, he is the best, perfect, and only choice for the role of Tony Stark. Is it because the role is eerily similar to his personal life? Is it because he fits so well with the style of character Stan Lee created? Who knows...All that matters is that Downey gives, far and away, the best performance of any of the superhero actors (Maguire, Bana, Affleck, Bale, Gruffudd).Billionaire/genius/playboy Tony Stark has it all. Until he's kidnapped by terrorists in Afghanistan. Forced to build a missile for the terrorists, he instead builds a massive suit of armor to escape them. Upon his return, he decides a few things: his weapons manufacturing company will no longer make weapons, and he will fight evil by recreating an even stronger model of the armor suit and becoming what he was destined to be: Iron Man.I've already told you how great Downey is, but the movie has a great supporting cast (and is just as high profile and surprising as Downey himself) including Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, and of course the magnificent Jeff Bridges. Paltrow and Howard each give good performances that are to be expected of them. Paltrow also looks extremely gorgeous as Pepper Potts, and the chemistry between her and Downey is magical. Bridges is great as the film's villain Iron Monger. Definitely classic.Jon Favreau's direction is great, and also makes me wonder why the other superhero movies didn't have FANS as their directors...it totally worked here. Favreau gets the mood right, as it's not as dark as you'd think, but it doesn't need to be because Stark's alcoholism has been cut out of the film, and it's basically a good vs. evil story. It's a simplistic plot, but it works. Favreau just GETS the characters, and that's what makes it so good.The special effects and comedy are top notch. You can tell there's a lot of improv in the dialog, especially between Downey and Howard. After watching this, it came as no surprise that the effects were done by the same people behind Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End and Transformers. Nothing looks fake. The film balances the action and calm very well. It's very well edited and has good pacing. The film also has 'sequel' written all over it. The ending alone is enough to make one, not to mention some of the lines from Howard's character make a sequel obvious and of course, the Nick Fury sequence after the credits. And guess what? I'll be first in line for that sequel, because it'll be awesome.I'd recommend Iron Man to everyone 12 and up, mostly because of the violence and a brief sex scene in the beginning of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summer gets an Iron Boost!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Summer season is here and this year it gets an iron boost from finally a new marvel comic franchise hopeful. Having no expectations for Iron Man I was more than surprised with how much I enjoyed it.This time the Iron Man-to-be, Tony Starks (Robert Downey Jr.), is a weapons manufacturing billionaire, not a nerdy college student. He doesn't need to buy a car to win over his childhood sweetheart, but instead has a super-sized garage with six cars and an assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow) who gets rid of his one night stands. In short, he lives it up in all the luxury one could dream of.While visiting a US base in Afghanistan to sell more of his weapons, the humvee he is riding is ambushed and he is taken captive by Afghani insurgents. They force him to build them one of his famous bombs, but instead he builds a great big metal suit! A suit which he uses to escape back to America successfully, and once home starts building a better one. Seeing the destruction of his weapons when they fall into the hands of insurgents he wants to shut down his weapons company. This does not go over well with a few people and brings us to a climatic fight between a villain (I will let you be surprised who it is) and Iron Man.The casting was perfect. Robert Downey Jr. plays his part as the fast-talking, careless billionaire who gets a reality check brilliantly, and Gwyneth Paltrow is immensely entertaining as Pepper Potts, his cool, calculated assistant. Together they have the perfect amount of chemistry that only increases your desire to see Iron Man II.Iron Man is a strong beginning to what will hopefully, yes I am actually hoping for more, be a successful franchise. Unfortunately with it being a good beginning, is where it faltered, only a little. First you could really tell it was setting up for more as there are actually very few scenes of Iron Man flying around (there are actually many more scenes of Tony building and testing his Iron Man suit) and secondly the end battle was not as spectacular or even intense as most superhero climaxes and ended rather quickly.Still Iron Man is a strong, very strong film to open the Summer Season, and does not disappoint. The mark of a good film is when, even with a running time of 126 minutes, it leaves you wanting more!</fullReview>

He really pulled it off nicely.Jeff Bridges turned in a great performance as the villain. He played the part of Downey's evil corporate partner perfectly. Gwyneth Paltrow played Downey's assistant (loved the name "Pepper Potts") and did it well.The techies who did the special effects deserve much of the credit for making this movie the success that it is. It was simply amazing how they were able to create the "Iron Man" model.The ending was perfect, without spoiling it for anyone, it wrapped up the picture very nicely.Wonder what they'll cook up for Iron Man 2?</fullReview>

Iron Man, despite the worried chatter online, is perfectly cast with Robert Downey, Jr., Terence Howard, Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow.The story was believable (well, you know, for a comic book) and the performances from all the actors were great. The special effects are outstanding and the distortion-laden guitar score is perfect.Definitely Mr. Favreau's best directorial effort to date. Zathura was good, but Iron Man blows it away. Ranks up there with Batman Begins and The Punisher (2004) as one of the best comic book adaptations to date.I can't wait to see Iron Man II, although with the new Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and Ant Man movies in the works, we might all have to wait for The Avengers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironman: A Robert Downey Jr. vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, the pun is definitely intended, as this grade-A, summer blockbusting, popcorn flick does it's damnedest to launch Mr. Downey into the rarefied stratosphere of A-list action-adventure superheroes. The plot is this: Billionaire playboy, Tony Stark, makes a sizable living creating incredible weapons of mass destruction, but gets his come-up pence when he is attacked and kidnapped by bad-guys that use the very weapons he creates. Nearly mortally wounded, and forced to create weapons for his captors, said playboy creates the ultimate weapon to effect his escape, and vows to destroy his creations that have fallen into the wrong hands.Mr. Downey does a fabulous rendering of bazillionaireTony Stark, the freewheeling, womanizing, morally aloof heir to a multinational, military-industrial weapons conglomerate, Stark Industries. To say that Mr. Stark is wildly indifferent to the woes of the common man would be the understatement of the year, based on the astonishing lifestyle that is evidenced by some of the sets that were created for this movie. From the sprawling, sensual, high-tech, cliff-side mansion, the private customized jumbo-jet, and the warehouse-sized garage full of motorcycles and super-sexy sports cars, everything about Tony Stark and this movie bows to the whims of ultra-technology taken to its logical extremes. Mr. Stark has gadgets that put James Bond's Q to shame, and Mr. Stark's world of Human-Artificial Intelligence interface, Rock-Star like notoriety, and obligatory carnal acquisitions are the stuff of tech-no-geeks', comic book nerds' wet dreams. Yes, Robert Downey Jr. does succeed in making mutant, uber-geek, hyper-genius quite glamorous and cool.It doesn't hurt that Marvel Entertainment hired a director that actually might have read an Ironman comic book in his lifetime. Jon Favreau, most noted for his tongue in cheek romantic comedies, and as Ben Affleck's side-kick in another Marvel movie, Daredevil, takes the reins and ably delivers the first knockout blow of the summer. Major nods go to Mr. Favreau's vision, Lucasfilm Industrial Light and Magic special effects wizardry, and the army of CGI artists, and puppeteers that actually create the very credible illusion of the Ironman armor. Such attention to intricate detail easily a rival, if not surpasses the wonderful robotic limbs of Doctor Octopus that were seen in Spiderman 2. Mr. Favreau also casts himself in the movie as one of Mr. Stark's bodyguards, Hap Hogan. The plot itself seems a bit sluggish in parts at first, but is never dull or uninteresting. Robert Downey Jr. is in just about every scene, but it appears that Mr. Downey was born to portray Tony Stark and the sleek, shining golden knight, Ironman. The action sequences are fast and frenetic, the comedic turns aptly placed, and the operatic villainy of Jeff Bridges' Obediah Stane quite well received to produce the next heir apparent to the title of "best comic-book movie ever" in Marvel's library of comic books brought to the screen. The only possible draw-back to such a very handsome essay would be the short two-hour running time, and the under use of some of Hollywood's heavy hitters. Gwyneth Paltrow is a very comely Pepper Pots, Mr. Starks major domo, but seems to have little to do in this outing. The attempt to create some sort of sexual tension between Pepper Pots, and Tony Stark falls noticeably short of the mark. Terrance Howard's, Major James Rhodes, although a necessary character to remain true to the Ironman comics, is almost seen as an after-thought in the movie. Mr. Howard seems just a bit envious of not playing a bigger part in this obvious box-office rain-maker.Jeff Bridges does bring just the right touch of malevolence that is expected in such comic-book movie fare, but he doesn't get opportunity, or necessary screen time to flesh out the character of Obediah Stane. Finally, although credited with being in the cast, if you're looking for Samuel L. Jackson, you'll just have to wait for it. Mr. Jackson's only part to play in this matter is to offer a hint of things to come. There's no telling what Marvel Entertainment plans to assemble, hopefully, in the very near future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Plain And Simple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never was a big Iron Man fan. Don't get me wrong he was a good Avenger (for all you non-comic book fan's out there The Avengers is Marvel's version of The Justice League, again for all the non-comic book fans The Justice League is DC Comic's big superhero team more commonly known by their Saturday morning cartoon title The Super Friends)but Iron Man never did much for me as a solo character. Don't get me wrong he's had some good stories, like the alcoholic story line (where Tony Stark becomes such a drunk he has to give up being Iron Man) and Armor Wars (where evil bad guys get a hold of Stark's Iron Man technology and he has to fight like 8 billion Iron Men)but other than that he's never done much for me, so when i heard that an Iron man movie was being made i just shrugged it off, and held no interest.it had a few strikes against it for me. The first being Robert Downey Jr. was casted as Iron Man/Tony Stark. He's a good actor, but an action movie star? no way. The second it had Gwyneth Paltrow in it. I'm just not a fan of her's. Third was that Jon Favreau was directing it. I like Favereau, but i wasn't so sure that the man who directed the family comedy Elf (one of the ONLY good Will Ferrall movies)was the man to direct a big budget superhero action film. Then i saw the trailer.So needless to say, not caring to much for the character, but having great looking previews, I broke the news to my wife that she didn't have to see it, and headed to the local multiplex with my good friend Joe Lane, and special guest Paul Romanski (I hope that's how you spell it)and saw Iron Man. I have to admit i left the theater with an ear to ear grin on my face. Iron Man is a blast and I didn't want it to end. The summer movie season has kicked off and is off to a good start, if Iron Man is any indication.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a billionaire industrialist that owns Stark International, a company that specializes is manufacturing weapons of mass destruction. While in Afghanastan, demonstrating his latest weapon to the military, The Jericho Missle, Stark gets attacked and kidnapped by terrorists. They give Stark an ultimatum, build the terrorists a Jericho missile and be set free (yeah right) or refuse and die (like they wouldn't kill him any way). The thing that really scares Tony is that the terrorists all have Stark International weapons throughout their camp.Tony decides that instead of building them a missile he builds a suit of armor that looks like the Tin Man from The Wizard Of Oz on steroids, to bust out of and destroy the camp he was held captive in. The suit has machine guns, flame throwers, missile, and a jet pack. Tony succeeds and makes it back to civilization, which he realizes is not the same and makes some changes to his tin man suit,updating it and making it more modernized. Stark becomes Iron man, a superhero that doesn't attack normal criminals like muggers and thieves, but instead fights terrorists. That is how simple the plot of Iron Man is, and it kept me entertained for two hours and change.Iron Man, as much fun as it is does have it's faults, slightly. Terrance Howard (a very talented actor) seems almost wasted as James Rhodes, Starks best friend, Gwyneth Paltrow (who plays Pepper Potts, yes that's her name) comes off yet again as nothing more than a ditz, and Jeff Bridges (who plays Obadiah Stane) still plays the same roll in every movie.The shining spot of Iron Man is Robert Downey Jr., who proved that he deserved the roll. I almost forgot the Downey was playing Iron Man/Stark and that it wasn't Stark ripped right out of a Marvel comic. He was great, and I can't see any one else playing the roll. It's rumored that Iron Man and the upcoming Incredible Hulk movie will lead into an Avengers movie, with Downey appearing in The Hulk as Stark. We'll see about that one (rumors were Samuel L. Jackson was supposed to make a cameo in Iron Man as Nick Fury, and he didn't). If that happens remanis to be seen but Iron Man is left wide open for Iron Man II. No big surprise there.I would see Iron Man again in a heart beat, although i can see some people complaining that they will feel the film is to story driven and not enough action. where i come from I call that a good beginning.On a scale of 10 I give Iron Man an 8. Go, check your brain at the door, and have fun. I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a weapons manufacturer, Tony Stark is also one of the most well recognized men in the world due to his billionaire status forged by his genius. After showcasing a new missile, known as the Jericho, in Afghanistan, his convoy is ambushed, and Tony is taken prisoner. Spending three months captive in the mountain range, Tony is forced to rebuild the Jericho missile for his captives. Tony instead designs a device that keeps his body from dying, due to the shrapnel he received from the ambush, and as well a robotic suit to help him escape. With these new inventions, and experiences in captivity, Tony Stark's view on his life, takes a drastic change.One thing Iron Man's story is not, is hard-hitting, which is disappointing considering the films opening half. It is relatively simple to follow, and a tad frivolous, but the film is quite enjoyable nonetheless. The script is well-formed, following a logical structure with some genuinely good humour to boot, and it's only imperfection comes in the form of a very clichéd villain. This element also forms some predictability in the film's plot, but it is a minor issue at best. An element which did irritate me was the level of convenience within the story. Yes, most films have moments of convenience, but Iron Man makes them quite noticeable. Such an example being how Stark's laboratory of sorts, somehow is able to be used as a launching pad for getting the Iron Man armour attached to Stark, without there ever being any mention that Stark modifying the place for such an action. It is as of the laboratory was built for that purpose the entire time and it just feels a little off-putting. This makes the concept of believability strained somewhat, even within the context of the film's universe, and it is not just limited to this single occurrence, but a few others, such as how the Iraqi guards had no idea or any suspicion on what Tony Stark was building, even when they had security cameras all over Stark's cell.Thankfully the acting is of a good level, with Robert Downey Jr. stealing the show, with his performance as Tony Stark being absolutely perfect. Be it when Tony is acting in a casual free-spirit manner, or when he is serious, and devoted to cause for a better world. Performances by Jeff Howard, Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow make for commendable efforts, but sadly the latter two have a few awkward moments where they seem honestly bored with the material or incapable to convey the right emotions, such as Paltrow in highly tense scenes. But perhaps the worst example of acting comes in a very unlikely form: Stan Lee's cameo. Simply put, it was horrible and clearly not well thought out.The computer graphics are at times are amazing, but at others times, a bit of a letdown. The good times sport some impressive visuals, especially the sequence with Iron Man flying while attempting to survive an attack from two fighter pilots. Yet this doesn't stop the film having sequences where the Iron Man suit looks like a cartoon rendition, seemingly negating the realistic concept of the film in general. Action sequences are quite fun to watch with some excellent visual effects, but it is a pity that the final fight is far too short and somewhat of an anticlimax, and thus never fully satisfies the concept of the fight in its entirety.I also felt the directing to be disappointing. Jon Favreau has some good moments, and I go back to the Iron Man and aircraft sequence, which really is outstanding, but Favreau has this annoying habit of having a left to right sweeping scene transition. It is as if he was trying to create this comic book effect with the transition and this ultimately comes to my main complaint of Iron Man: it is unsure whether it should attempt being a realistic portrayal or remain like its comic book form. It is a hybrid, but one that doesn't work all that effectively. It can be annoying to see a scene that resembles a good quality film, just to be followed by one that seems straight out of a comic book. How the sequences are structured in both mediums work differently, and are, in this case, not aptly suited to be used side-by-side. I feel that if they wanted a realistic approach, to go full out with that and not diverge into comic book proportions, and vice versa.The film is virtually without any swearing or nudity, but there are some implied sexual imagery, such as the very brief encounter with Tony and a female journalist in his house. The extreme violence is left for off-screen purposes, and involves a lot of killing with armed weapons, and the cries of the victims are quite noticeable. The on-screen action is pretty much the standard comic book hero affair with lots of melee combat, and explosions.Iron man is a wonderful example of a good comic book-to-film creation. While lacking the same maturity of Batman Begins, Iron Man proves to be the best Marvel film available, ousting out the likes of the original Spider-man and X-men 2. And this is because the film doesn't attempt to dumb itself down to appeal to a greater audience, or focus itself on too many elements: it keeps things relatively simple. Instead Iron Man tells the story of Tony stark, a man callous about the world in general, transforming into a man who respects not only himself, but those around him. With very good acting, a well structured story, Iron Man's only problems are a few inconsistencies and its inability to support a dual personality approach. It's no Batman Begins, but then again, it doesn't need to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Kick Off to the Summer Lineup</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Playboy rich superheroes are in, officially. First the Dark Knight makes a splash with Batman Begins taking superheroes dark and non-super dare I venture and now we have Marvel's version which is much splashier and glamorous. Tony Stark is Iron Man and Robert Downey Jr. is both with ease and flare.The updating of the character for Iron Man comic enthusiasts works quite well as it keeps the original gray, large, and bulky design. As well, the filmmakers threw in as much of the Marvel lore of the character as they could from SHIELD to Jarvis, not the butler but a slight variation given flare by the voice of the wonderful Paul Bettany. For those interested in more nods check out the final scene at the end of the credits.Robert Downey Jr. is the king of the show though despite the ultra-cool and slick looking Iron Man suit and all the effects around it. He grabs hold of the spoiled rich boy persona and exudes confidence and silver tongue as the CEO of Stark Enterprises. He is a genius as well as a patriot of sorts or rather he becomes a patriot through the events of the film. His character's complexity is in the fact that despite his well-meaning attitude, the attitude, which comes across to the public, is kind one of an attention-seeking star. It is an allure of the character, but also a defect as it is hard to believe he is doing this for selfless reasons. Downey portrays all this quite well making for a well-rounded blockbuster central character.A strong group of characters and actors surrounds Tony Stark / Robert Downey Jr. One of the top amongst them being his secretary Mrs. Pepper Potts played with charm and some sass by Gwyneth Paltrow. She is obviously the heart of Stark, his closest link to humanity up on his pedestal. Along with Potts are Jim Rhodes, and Obadiah Stane, of business relation and the only other human strings Stark has, a family of sorts for the young genius. Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges play each respective character and offer the friendship side of Stark.Spoiler Alert Along with being, the father figure of sorts Obadiah Stane gets to play a more complex angle. He gets to play the close to the heart villain much as Ducard was in Batman Begins. He doubles to fill to voids and does so quite adequately if a bit heavy handily. The Iraq War is a dated but timely affair to trace the hero to, but it works. The villain of course is one dimensional, but that is all right for an escape film like this with far bigger than life characters.In all the film is great kick off to the summer lineup and the best Marvel has to offer since Spider-Man 2 in 2004. The effects are pristine and the action raw and fun as well the humor is generally on target. It is safe to say this is the best fun I have had in the theater all year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really, the best adaptation of a comic I've seen in years - much, much better than Ang Lee's Hulk, Batman Begins, or Superman Returns. I'd even say it's a bit better than the Spiderman series.The plot contains most of the necessary elements for the first story of any superhero. There is an origin story, how Iron Man is created, as well as the motivation for the main character, and the eventual discovery of worthy villains.What separates Iron Man are a few things. The script is excellent, the effects are excellent, the technology is at least mildly plausible (to the point the suspension of disbelief isn't absurd, as with Superman), the plot involves contemporary elements (terrorism, arms merchants), and most importantly, the acting is superb.Robert Downey Jr. is superbly cast as Tony Stark. I cannot imagine anybody else playing this role. But the supporting cast is good, esp. Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges, the latter of whom is hardly recognizable as Stark's longtime partner.Some advice for anybody seeing this film: stay through the entirety of the credits.</fullReview>

Their wasn't as much action as I expected, but when the action scenes did happen they were very intense. I think that this movie will be enjoyed and will do well in box office. As well it should do good. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. It was fun for older people, teens, and even the young kids. The movie was not very bloody and didn't have any sex at all. So for the parents who want to take their kids it was fine. The beginning started off right away with a bang. It had a lot of intense action and was exciting. It was even pretty funny throughout. Mostly it was Robert Downey Jr. making many jokes. He was very fun to watch and did a great job. I think he was the best person for the role of the iron man. It was fun and interesting watching him put together the iron man. I liked how he made different examples. He made the first one and then made another one. I think this was a very original movie. The acting was very good. Especially from Robert Downey Jr. who played the iron man. I think that everyone else nailed their job as well. The story was very good as well. I liked how their was a lot of flying and battles between the iron man. The visuals were so amazing. I think they should win for best special effects. Overall this was a very fun movie to start the summer off with. I think this was a perfect super hero movie and will be for a long time. It was exciting, entertaining, and fun to watch. This was definitely well worth your money. Go see it and give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with something to entertain everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know a lot about comic of Iron man, so I went along with an open mind. Unlike Spiderman and the fantastic four, where I already knew the source material, I could watch the film without making comparisons to the comic. My opinion, and thats all it is, is that Iron man is the best comic book film I have seen. The film has everything that an action film needs, great one liners, excellent action sequences, brilliant effects and great acting. I cant say enough about Robert Downy Jr, excellently cast. The only drawback for me was the final fight scene. without giving anything away I thought it was a little flat for a final battle in a superhero film. However, its a tiny drawback and there is a lot more in the film to make up for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rusty but amusing superhero reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of spider-man and batman comics. Unfortunately I've never been so interested of Iron man. To me he was always just a part of Avengers, nothing big. I was hoping this movies would give me a spark of interest about him and I would start to be a fan him too. Unfortunately it didn't do that.After Sam Raimi elevated Spiderman to the wide audience and Christopher Nolan rebooted the Batman legend into a masterpiece trilogy it is not a surprise all other superheroes were on queue for rebooting too. Iron man seems to have his audience and movie gained some positive ratings and massive fan phenomena but overall the movie cannot be compared to the previously mentioned or plenty of others superhero movies.The big problem with the movie is that it takes nearly one hour before any interesting action begins. The whole desert scene is very slow and somewhat ridiculous. Also the main villain is fairly easy to recognize since the first moments. Final fight with him is more of comical than epic. I couldn't help but laugh to this growling giant robot.On the other hand, the movie isn't hopeless and it has its moments. For example the sky and the flying scenes are very well made. They have a very nice tension in them. The fallout from the sky actually feels in the stomach.The character, Tony Stark, is a positively different kind of a person in his normal life. Unlike overprotective Peter Parker or Gothic, lonely knight Bruce Wayne, he is very open and even ruthless millionaire which makes a nice difference to the other superhero reboots. The ending where he breaks the cliché of the secret identity is a really effective ending to otherwise fairly average movie. Robert Downey Jr. seems to obviously enjoy his role as Tony Stark and he is a joy to watch. (Although my problem with him was that I saw his Sherlock Holmes movies first and I couldn't help but thinking him as Holmes kicking criminals' asses in robot suit after getting bored of his restricted detective life where such actions weren't possible.)There is a possibility that I outlooked this movie because I have never been interested about Avengers but I can still safely say that this movie wasn't near the other successful superhero movies like Spiderman, Dark Knight, Watchmen or even, IRONically, Kick-Ass. Although this was a somewhat pleasant movie to watch, I still suggest watching those movies first before spending time with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Makes a Good Comic Book Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There 3 key components to making a great comic book movie: 1) Casting 2) Writing/directing and 3) Consideration of the source material.Iron Man takes a character that has flourished in the walls of the Marvel Universe for 50 years, yet never really broke across mainstream media in the way that a Spider-Man or a Wolverine has, and pushes him to the forefront of the mainstream. Why was Iron Man such a great movie, not just as a comic book movie, but also as a MOVIE movie? 1)Casting - Who is the best actor in Hollywood to play a borderline narcissistic, alcoholic, eccentric billionaire playboy? How about a real-life borderline narcissistic, alcoholic, eccentric, billionaire playboy? The casting (and performance) of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark was about as perfect as you can get. He truly brought Tony Stark to life. And what is a good hero without a good villain (nothing in case you were wondering). Enter Jeff Bridges. He did a superb job opposite RDJ as Obidiah Stane.2) Writing/directing - There is one word to describe the writing in this movie; smart, both from the overall plot to the dialog from scene to scene. The lines were crisp and often humorous yet still keeping in the action movie frame of mind; the perfect blend of cliché humor and serious dramatic fare. The directing was also top-notch (not what I would have expected from Favreau, but BRAVO). The story is perfectly paced and the action scenes are crisp and do a great job avoiding that annoying shaky-cam style of action that for some reason is so popular nowadays. There is also much taken to really develop the characters so you understand them and can relate to them as real people.3) Source material - Fanboys will forever whine about certain aspects of comic book movies stating "that's not how it happened in the comic". That's the point. No one wants to see a story ripped frame for frame out of a comic book. Comic book movies are meant to be a re imagination of the source material; something that tells a new story yet still remains true to the most important aspects of the source. Iron Man does that perfectly.I will admit that my one gripe with this movie is that I would have liked to see a little more action in the suit. The biggest issue with this movie is it does something that far too many action movies do with the final fight scene. It sends the hero in half cocked (or in this case at half power basically) and has him get whooped by the villain up and down yet somehow manages to miraculously pull out the victory.Again, that's my ONLY gripe. That really doesn't detract from all of the other fantastic aspects of this movie. Still a solid 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid introduction to the Iron man character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance Tony Stark isn't the sort of person you'd expect to become a superhero; he is a genius who has made his fortune inventing and selling state of the art weapons systems. At least he was until he is captured by insurgents in Afghanistan and learns that it isn't only the good guys who use his products. Once they have him the insurgents instruct him to make them a version of his latest weapon; instead he makes an armoured suit that renders him bullet proof and even enables him to fly. Using the suit he manages to escape and when he gets back to the United States he renounces the arms trade much to the consternation of this erstwhile partner. Tony now devotes his time to making a new improved version of the suit which he uses to protect the people that where being oppressed by his company's weapons. He isn't the only person with an armoured suit though; his partner Obadiah Stane is building one too and when it is completed he will attempt to destroy Tony.I found the earlier parts of this film to be the best; Robert Downey Jr. did a good job as Tony Stark making his damascene conversion from arms dealer to protector of the innocent believable at the end the story was just about two giant robots? I mean men in power suits fighting; although I'm sure that is the scene younger members of the audience will enjoy most. Jeff Bridges also put in a good performance as bad guy Obadiah and Gwyneth Paltrow was fine as Tony's PA Pepper Potts. I was rather pleased that they managed to avoid the cliché of Tony and Pepper becoming a couple even if it was hinted that they might become one in the future. Unlike a lot of super heroes Tony Stark has no problem with killing his enemies and the weapons he uses may mean some parents might not thing this film is suitable for younger children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine retelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fine retelling of the Iron Man story, with Stark, the best of the Marvel heroes because he is so believable...A genius who turns his near-dead body into a super-hero's through tecnnology not magic or alien origin, etc. Robert Downey, Jr. is right on form as Tony Stark, making him a bit less noble at start. Jeff Bridges plays a fine snarky nemesis and the story is solid as Stark seeks redemption for his past. The one drawback is Paltrow as the love interest...The chemistry just isn't quite there. However, the story is set early enough in the relationship and paced fast enough to carry you over the clumsiness of the feeling-out love scenes. Either Gwen's gotta go or they've gotta learn to strike some sparks. But, it's nice to see our greatest younger actor hit his stride again. May we continue to see him on a role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit overrated as far as film enthusiasts rate it, but it's still a great summer blockbuster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Credit IMDb) Tony Stark is the complete playboy who also happens to be an engineering genius. While in Afghanistan demonstrating a new missile, he's captured and wounded. His captors want him to assemble a missile for them but instead he creates an armored suit and a means to prevent his death from the shrapnel left in his chest by the attack. He uses the armored suit to escape. Back in the U.S. he announces his company will cease making weapons and he begins work on an updated armored suit only to find that Obadiah Stane, his second in command at Stark industries has been selling Stark weapons to the insurgents. He uses his new suit to return to Afghanistan to destroy the arms and then to stop Stane from misusing his research.My problem with The Iron Man movies always consist of one sole thing, Tony Stark! His pompous attitude is hard to deal with, no matter how much charisma Downey has. Therefore this pegs the movie down a few notches for me. I also wasn't wowed like many other people were by the action scenes. I certainly enjoyed my time with the movie, I loved the cool attitude it had about itself, and it had many memorable characters, but I just didn't buy into all the hype. I know it sounds like I dislike this movie, but actually that is very much far from this case. I like Iron Man a lot, it's a great film for the genre, but I just don't think it was the second coming of Super Hero films like people claimed it was.Performances. Robert Downey's charisma manages to make Stark bearable, but boy is it hard to bear down and accept him. His arrogance had me annoyed on many occasion, and unlike the 2nd film, it does a great job of balancing him out, and rescuing his likability. Terrance Howard is a hoot as Rhodey, and did a far better job then Cheadle did. Jeff Bridges is absolutely wonderful as Obadiah. His sheer presence along helps the movie, but he managed to make the character memorable. He is the perfect foe for Downey. Gwyneth Paltrow is classy and beautiful as the infamous Pepper Pots. She made a great love interest for Downey, and I enjoyed the chemistry they had with one-another. Clark Gregg is amusing in his role as The Agent.Bottom line. Overrated a little bit, but I still enjoyed it very much. It has plenty of action, and funny situations to entertain us all. Don't go in expecting the greatest Marvel adaptation of all time, and you'll have a blast.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the first 30 minutes are very well told, in my opinion the storytelling has some weak points from there. Okay we are dealing with the realization of a comic hero here, so let's not overrate that.So the plot is kind of typical for a superhero movie, I'd say the closest related hero is Batman, because he also does not have any talents by himself but is relying on technical gimmicks. Just as Iron Man does. I really liked the acting, but there were a couple of scenes that I thought were a little stupid. Oh, and the product placement of Audi was a little to obvious for me.I rented this movie because the sequel is opening today in German theaters, but I will save my money and wait for the DVD, I was not into this enough to go and see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man started out pretty well, with a violent attack by the Taliban resulting in our hero being captured, but from then on it just set up loads of movie standard clichés until the predictable end.For those not in the know, Tony Stark is a genius inventor of weapons, making a fortune from war and such like, living a playboy lifestyle while Gwyneth Paltrow looks after him and his business partner Jeff Bridges makes up for Stark's lack of public face. When Stark is captured in Afghanistan and forced to build a rocket for the baddies, he sees the error his ways and instead builds himself an Iron Man suit.What then? Well, we get an awful lot of interaction between Downey and Paltrow, an awful lot of footage of him testing his suit and an alarmingly large of amount of moments where you'll think to yourself 'I knew that was going to happen'.That's the worrying thing about Iron Man - It's got great effects and such like, but the story itself is just textbook Hollywood tosh - You know who the bad guy is, you know what's going to happen at the end, and even the clever part involving various devices for keeping Stark's heart going should be accompanied by a large sign saying 'foreshadowing'.And he didn't even iron anything! Not even a shirt or a pair of trousers...bleh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different kind of superhero movie, but in the vein of "Spider-Man"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I say that "Iron Man" is a different kind of superhero movie, I mean exactly that. But it's closer to the "Spider-Man" movies than "The Dark Knight." It's intelligent, but not dense, or hopelessly grim. It has a sense of fun, which is seriously helped by a number of Robert Downey Jr.'s one-liners.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the Bruce Wayne of weapons design. He has more money than he can count, and is probably the world's biggest celebrity because of it. When captured in Afghanistan, he creates a prototype of a suit to become Iron Man. Thereafter, much to the shock of everyone who knows him, he decides to become a humanitarian. But that's not as easy as it sounds...The best part of "Iron Man" is that it doesn't follow the usual superhero movie plot trajectory. It goes in different directions, with more intelligence than usual, yet director Jon Faverau keeps it feeling the same.However, the movie is let down by the casting. Robert Downey Jr. is so talented that he needed a way to break out into the mainstream again. Because "Iron Man" accomplished this, it succeeded. Strangely though, the script lets Downey down. True, its a great performance (as only Downey can give), but once he gets back to the states (about 20 minutes into the film), he becomes a lot less interesting. Again, this isn't Downey's fault, it's the screenplay's."Iron Man" suffers from too much star power. It has a cast of great actors, but there's not enough screen time to let them develop full personalities. Gwyneth Paltrow is a case in point. In films, big stars generally play two roles: main characters or cameos. Pepper Potts is neither. She's in-between, and because she has so much screen time, we expect more from her (I'm not a Paltrow fan, but this isn't her fault). The same problem she had in "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" applies here. She doesn't do well in action movies. Still, it is to her credit that she's doing something to help her fame OTHER than posing for Vogue magazine. Terrence Howard is solid as Rhodey, Starks' friend and military liaison. Jeff Bridges is sorely miscast as Obadiah. While he has moments of effectiveness, overall he doesn't belong here (even with the unrecognizable facial transformation).Still, "Iron Man" must be judged based on its intentions. Does it entertain? The answer is a resounding YES!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgivable flaws, great action time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard for me to say if this is the best comic book adaptation because I really don't know so much about Iron Man. But, as a movie lover, I can say that it's a great action movie based on a comic book most of all for its cast and for bringing to reality something that comic book lovers were so desperately wanting. The story itself has some flaws, but that's also predictable as it's impossible to tell a great story and also be an action movie and ALSO a blockbuster within 2 hours.As said before, 2 hours is a very small time to tell Tony Stark's story and how he became Iron Man in a acceptable way as happens, for example, in Batman Begins. Jon Favreau made miracles, but it's kinda hard for me to accept in the movie the fact that Tony, from one day to another, created a complex iron suite like playing Lego and learned how to fly in a few tries, it doesn't matter how much intelligent he is, it doesn't fit. Not even Super-Man could learn how to fly in a so small time as Tony or Obadiah, this one a lot worst because he learned how to fly in minutes. But that's okay... this abstraction of time is forgivable. Also, it's hard to imagine that he could just insert something on his chest or a woman could just put her hand into it and he never died of infection. Tony Starks knows a lot about science but nothing about medical precautions. How smart he is!The cast is interesting. When I heard for the first time that Downey Jr. would be playing Iron Man I thought that producers were crazy because Downey Jr. has nothing of a hero. But, yeah... after watching the movie and understanding the character's personality, now I understand why he fits so well in the character. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts is kinda funny. I'm not a fan of Gwyneth's work because I think that every time she performs, she's performing not a character, but Gwyneth herself. But for the first time for me seems that she's performing something a little different from Gwyneth, I mean, she has facial expressions in here and not that watery face, dead eyes and inexpressive voice as usual, she just seems different, I don't know exactly why. Anyway... Jeff Bridges is good as always, kudos for him once again.The direction is effective, linear as the plot. Jon Fefreau plays it safe during entire movie. I would never imagine that he, as an actor or a not so known director would make his first 150 mil blockbuster. I would do the same if I was in that condition.The visual effects are just perfect. There wasn't any moment I stopped to say "That's a CG! That's not...". Iron Man is not a CG doll as Spider Man seems sometimes, it really seems that there is a real someone inside that iron suite. Also, they did an excellent job working on it and creating an armor that seems a lot realistic.For the fans, I could imagine how they felt when I was watching the DVD. The option screen shows Iron Man in a 360? angle, it's just awesome!It's a great action movie, Iron Man is a little unusual from all the heroes out there and Downey Jr. increases its personality. The flaws are there all the time, but they can be forgivable. Just enjoy it like popcorn.</fullReview>

Seemed much darker in a way and how it was just very tough old armor that was put together. The newer armor, while it could fly, could not look as crude and menacing.And its a shame Howard will not be back for the 2nd Iron Man movie. But that is OK, so long as it is well made I will watch it. And if its a train wreck, which I doubt, then I will still watch.One of the best superhero fictions I have seen. "A"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comic book adapted films just don't get any better than this. And this isn't your casual viewer talking. Iron Man, or 'shell head' as he was nick-named in the marvel comics, was a huge icon for me in my formative years. I was an avid marvel comics geek when I was a kid (not so much in my twenties and thirties thank goodness) and Iron Man was my favorite book of them all. So the jump to big screen for this one meant a lot to me.Well let me tell you, Favreau didn't disappoint this die-hard. All the main elements of Stark and his world were depicted in an electrifying, larger than life, accessible in relation to today's societal/technological climate, manner. Sure, fantastic enough, but somehow made believable...well, believable enough to enjoy immensely anyway.The character development was crisp and the plot moved along at a spanking pace. There was not a wasteful moment in the story-telling. The effects were dazzling... and easy on the eyes since CGI rigid bodies (namely things made of metal) always look more realistic than flowing, organic forms.Watch this and love it like it did! Iron Man still rules! I still want to be Tony Stark!</fullReview>

You can tell the movies had effort put into it but it felt like something was missing.The Ending was appalling and immediately sparked IRON MAN 2.Im not a big fan of this film but kudos to the people who made it.STAN WINSTON ROCKED AT MAKING THIS THOUGH SO KUDOS TO HIM AND R.I.P STAN WINSTON.</fullReview>

Extraordinary U.S. arms dealer Robert Downey, Jr. is captured by Afghan terrorists on their own turf and must escape by creating his alter ego---the titled character. Now he is a Captain America-styled modern-day freedom fighter who uses state of the art technology and high brow intelligence to fight the dreaded opposition. Jeff Bridges has a predictable role as Downey's would-be associate. Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard supply uninspired supporting roles who do nothing to advance the film's sporadic tone and helter-skelter approach. Downey, Jr.'s supposedly revolutionary role as Tony Stark is little more than a mediocre caricature of an old idea which has never shown much depth or complexity. Based on a comic strip first created by Stan Lee in 1963. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film This Year So Far!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is so far the only decent film this year. After seeing the poor performance of Cloverfield and National Treasure 2, 2 of the biggest hyped films of the year, I thought that most of the films budget is being spent on the marketing instead of the actual film, but I'm glad to be proved wrong by this film because it was completely awesome.Filled with action, romance, some witty humour and excellent stock characters, (especially the "Dummy" robot, that was fun).Storyline was excellent, a child prodagy grows up to be owning the worlds biggest weapons manufacture. He's arrogant, a womenizer, a drunk and doesn't really care much about anything. He goes to Afghanistan for a weapons testing (which is a really awesome weapon), and then gets captured by terrorists and gets a magnet strapped to him to stop him diing.Now I've never read any of the Iron Man comics, so I didn't know what to expect, but now I just want to read the comics.Now what really made this film work, was the twist in middle. The main enemy was not the terrorists, but one of Tony's best friends, now that was shocking, and paralyzing device was just so cool, and the battle at the end was great and funny.Also the magnet thing strapped to his heart was the icing on the cake. The utter suspense of thinking that it will short circuit anytime and then he won't survive. But really how does he take a shower or go swimming, won't the thing short circuit.Now the thing that I did now about, was Nick Fury and Shield. I was actually waiting for that because I knew Iron Man was apart of it. And then after the credits, when Nick just randomly appeared, I knew at that moment that the sequel is going to be completely awesome.Another thing, the funnest part has got to be the part near the beginning when that terrorist dude dies for trying to get a headshot on Iron Man, but the bullets gets him in the head. VEry funny.Well I guess that raps it up, next film is Hancock, see ya.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely amazing. I thought that RDJ was an odd choice for Tony stark and that Gwenyth Paltrow was even weirder for pepper but when i saw it... They had great chemistry on screen and the writing was great for their characters. Personally my favorite line in the movie is after Christine Everheart woke up and went to find tony and Pepper says "I do anything and everything Mr. Stark requires. Including occasionally taking out the trash. Will that be all?" The movie had brilliant action scenes and falls into the same category has the 3 new superhero movies(iron man, batman begins, and spider man 2). If it doesn't receive an Oscar Nod this year I'll be shocked. Some of the scenes with Tony's computer and the virtual pieces of his suit are absolutely flawless. I can't say anything bad about this movie.One thing i suggest you say if you are going to see this with someone who hasn't seen the movie yet is to wait until the credits are over. There's a very interesting clip at the end.There are at least 2 more superhero movies this year which i cant wait for(The Incredible Hulk and The Dark Knight) and in the Incredible Hulk TONY STARK MAKES AN Appearance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To be perfectly honest with the cast of all of these movies I'm not surprised that there so highly rated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just a stupid anti-intellectual pile of drivel. Literally, I almost left the theater when he was building an Armor Suit in a cave in Afghanistan. How disrespectful is this to engineers and the scientific method of trial and error? Never mind crashing with broken armor, (but no broken bones). At least if they gave him "super powers" it allows the viewer to suspend disbelief! There was some humor which redeemed the movie to 2 out of 4 stars. The Pepper Potts banter about taking out the garbage (she-journalist) and the robot arm. Some of the holographic computer manipulators were actually legitimate science fiction.However, the dry conclusion and a lack of caring for the actors, led me to actually leave the theater a couple minutes before the closing credits. this is something I almost never do.</fullReview>

But it's ridiculous that people are calling this a "thinking man's" superhero film. Those are some seriously low standards ... ;-)Ask yourself: how good would it have been without Mr. Downey?

		<fullReview>I didn't know if I would like it because it's based on a comic book (I have nothing against comic books, other than the fact that I'm a girl and I never got into them). But, it really was awesome! The plot is absolutely amazing. It has all the necessary requirements of a blockbuster (action, humor, suspense, romance). Gwenneth Paltrow did an awesome job (the only other movie that I've seen with her in it that I liked was Running With Scissors). And I had no idea that Robert Downey Jr. was so HOT!!! So, if you're a guy, you're probably laughing at me right now, but I don't care, because you probably already wanted to see this movie. This review is for all the female's out there who are hesitant to see the movie. I say it is worth it just to see Robert Downey Jr.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man Rocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Iron Man" is great. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing. I was completely surprised by Director Jon Favreau's "Iron Man". "Iron Man" never struck me as the most compelling superhero, after all his powers derived from the high tech metal suit. Despite the army of screenwriters?Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway, "Iron Man" evokes spectacular visual excitement and a great character arc. Downey at the beginning is so out there as hysterically arrogant billionaire CEO Tony Stark, who asks at a demonstration of his latest Stark Industries weapon, "Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both?" In dramatic transformation as hero, Downey later poignantly confesses to Pepper Potts (beautiful Gwenyth Paltrow), "?I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right." Robert Downey Jr. has always been his generation's most talented actor. It is gratifying to see him back, recovered, and at the peak of his powers.Yes, "Iron Man" is perhaps the coolest cutting edge technology display. However, it is Downey's masterfully balance of comedic and dramatic power that amazes. He is also supported by great actors?Oscar winners and nominees. Terrance Howard plays Col. Jim Rhodes, who is Tony Stark's Government liaison, is smart and quietly solid. Gwenyth Paltrow plays to her strength in her light comedic romantic role. She is brilliant and charmingly goofy as Stark's loyal assistant Pepper Potts. Jeff Bridges is the charismatic dark force of Obadiah Stane, Stark's partner at Stark Industries, whose true intentions are murky. All this and watching Iron Man jet super sonic in the heavens makes this one the year's best and coolest movies.Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is boy genius from M.I.T., who is now CEO of his late father's Stark Industries. Stark Industries is the world's largest Defense Contractor, and Stark himself is anointed the "Merchant of Death". His father's partner Obadiah Stane (Bridges) remains Tony's business partner and confidant. In a weapons demonstration trip gone amok in Afghanistan, Stark is mortally wounded, and held hostage by "freedom fighters". Along with fellow prisoner Yinsen (strong and endearing Shaun Toub), Stark rigs an ingenious power generator for his damaged heart that keeps him alive. At the same time, he creates the prototype "Iron Man" to affect his escape. This forever alters and transforms Stark, who now honors the words of Yinsen, "Don't waste your life." Returning back home Stark announces to the world, while eating a cheeseburger, that Stark Industries will no longer manufacture weapons of mass destruction, much to the chagrin of Obadiah. Stark secretly develops the "Iron Man" suit for himself at his ostentatiously high tech Malibu estate. Stark comically and intensely works on the crimson and gold "Iron Man" amidst his Audi sports cars and cool cyber toys. Downey looks great bulked up, and artistically executes physical comedy genius. Here Paltrow brings her best. Her Pepper feigns disinterest in Stark, but her unquestioned loyalty hints at her true feelings. Downey as Stark also plays brilliant and aloof, who finally gets a clue about making a difference in life and Pepper. They are so amazing and funny together. Bridges as Obadiah emerges as the visceral threat. Of course "Iron Man" veers into darker conspiracy, and the battle of good against great evil. Director Favreau orchestrates the CGI battle with pathos and style. "Iron Man" at its best is visually breathtaking."Iron Man" is one the year's best movies and Robert Downey Jr. returns with a spectacularly multidimensional and powerful performance. What Downey does is not conventionally acknowledged with awards, though it really warrants it. The special effects particularly the Iron Man rendering is so cool. "Iron Man" has a strong story and great actors. See "Iron Man".</fullReview>

But the Iron Man who succeeded to make the very hard equation to collect all the entertainment factors in one movie.

		<fullReview>Excuse me while I recover from the shock and amazement caused by my extreme surprise that this is an excellent movie. I expected the usual vacuous Hollywood hokum with the usual Hollywoodish heavy handed combination of outlandish special effects masking a superficial story and two-dimensional characters and instead was treated to an actual well-acted, well-crafted science fiction story with actual character development within the framework of an interesting plot. Robert Downey gives a marvelous, surprisingly powerful performance as a hugely wealthy, arrogant arms merchant who undergoes a major personality transformation - for the better. This movie is entertaining from start to finish and is worth watching.This movie is, for Hollywood, a rare combination of special effects extravaganza combined with a substantive story that actually has some dramatic content. This movie dramatizes the problems caused by industrial activity that gains profits through war and how special interests can completely drive and distort a country's foreign policy. That there are some in our society who reap huge profits off the suffering of others is a sad commentary, which is a theme of this movie. The Iron Man is representative of what happens when someone decides to take the high moral road. To survive, the main character has to literally wear a suit of hard metal to fend off the attacks from those whose profiteering schemes are now threatened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if you are not a Marvel Comic fan there is fun, drama, action, science fiction, &amp; a great story line involved here. The story cleverly tells the story of how Iron Man became a super hero. The special effects leave nothing to be desired...each shot is just as good as the next. I was pleasantly surprised by Robert Downey's ability to make the character very real and very likable. It is definitely a great story of good vs. evil and does not take too much brain power to enjoy each moment of the story. Much like the Spiderman movies you will find yourself flying out of your seat when the action takes place and rooting for the good guy throughout the movie. Make sure you see this at the theatre or you'll wish you'd gone instead of renting it in 7 months!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark from the Marvel comic; a flamboyant billionaire inventor who runs a weapons company. On a trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate his latest invention, the Jericho Missile, he is kidnapped by terrorists and made to assemble one of these missiles for them. Instead, inside the cave in which they have imprisoned him, he builds the prototype Iron Man suit, and effects his escape but during so realizes that his company has been arming the bad guys of the world for years, a fact that does not sit well with him. This is what changes him and sets the table for the rest of the movie. The visual effects are great, RDJ inhabits the role very well as he suffers a bout of conscience in his chosen field of work. Hs decision to become someone that matters by donning the Iron Man suit makes sense. I felt by the middle of the movie that it could very easily have sputtered to a halt, but that feeling was quickly dispelled, because the character is shown to be the type who will never sit around as long as he has some cool toy to play with. And as Iron Man, the playboy has a purpose. It may be standard comic book morality, but it works. There will be sequels, and hopefully they will be almost as good as this one.</fullReview>

I wish I could have the leather jacket he wears when he went on the private plane to Afgan... then become a human-robot with his super power technology. I would ask everyone to go see it, it is AWESOME! The story line, the make up, the view and camera works are just wonderful. It is a big inspiration for robotic technology in the 21st century.

This movie was absolutely excellent. Just simply excellent in just about every way. When I first saw the preview I really did think that it just going to be a geek flying around in a suite. But this was not just the case. Although, I did not read the comic books, I have to say that, this was indeed an excellent comic book movie, and one the best that I have seen. It has excellent special effects, excellent character development, some humor along the way, and fallows a great flow. Our hero know as Iron Man does not start off as a hero, instead he designs his suite over and over again to test it out, and then final takes action. He learns how his design works, and how to use it as well. I have to say that this film kicks the a** out of Spider-Man 3. Although, I did enjoy Spider-Man 3, but Iron Man is so fantastically put together that it kicks the F****** A** of Spider-Man 3. If you did not enjoy Spider-Man 3, you should enjoy Iron Man. This films sets the mode for the start of a great summer of comic book fans and comic book movie fans. Go see it, go see it. It was worth the money. Bravo, bravo!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a modern day DaVinci, tinkering with his gadgets while his weapons company happily builds and supplies the most modern and devastating of killing machines to the highest bidder. And he is a playboy to boot, ignoring the ever faithful Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow), and flitting from babe to babe. Then the unthinkable happens - he is shot up with shrapnel, kidnapped, and confronted with the cost of his company's business ventures. He needs a battery powered magnetic device in his chest to keep the shrapnel from entering his heart and is forced by his kidnappers to build a destruction device. But what emerges is a breathtaking Iron Man!! Of course there are whys and buts when he gets back. And since he is a Marvel comics character he has to undo all the wrong his company had been doing. There is a baddie who is bigger than the Iron man. Many breathtaking flights and shoot-ups later, good does triumphs over evil and all is well with the world! Iron Man works because of Robert Downey Jr. He injects just the right amount of wryness, urbanity and mischief into the role to make the Iron man much more than a mere superhero. Gwenyth is decent in a small and undetailed role. Jeff Bridges is very great in a larger than life role. After many a superhero film that failed to click we finally have a worthy successor to Batman Begins. Yet another superhero has arrived - welcome!</fullReview>

The movie is funny, smart and has just the right mix of action and plot. The characters are deeper than I had expected, with top notch acting. The CGI was flawless, to the point that you really didn't notice were the real shot started and the CG stopped. I loved it so much I'm going to see it again. After a long run of bad comic book adaptations Ironman had shown me something new! Also don't forget to watch it until the credits are over for another little extra piece. This said, it doesn't surprise me that they signed part 2 after opening weekend. I've also heard talk of an Avengers movie. Can't wait!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Enough Action: Movie Saved by Downey Jr.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie benefits greatly from the disaffected cynicism and wounded idealism of Robert Downey Jr., but suffers from a paucity of white-knuckle action. (Downey is as usual Downey, always the same character.) Too much time spent building the iron men, not enough using them.What little power FX violence there is, to tell the truth, isn't all that imaginative, all that thrilling, especially by today's standards. Movie lapses too often into lulls in action.Villains are relatively uninteresting, not that scary.Paltrow, for once, is just right (childbearing has made her more of a woman, less mannequin).For once, too, a comic-book action-hero flick worth seeing.Opinion: Big-budget FX-heavy blockbusters are currently the best Hollywood can do, best suited to the limitations of mainstream commercial American film-making. Naturalistic mature adult drama, by contrast, is practically nonexistent. The simple comic-book universe, leavened by self-conscious pseudosophisticated irony, is ideally suited to the corporate hounds of Sunset Blvd, to their crippled creativity and imagination, to their cowardice and addiction to manipulative digitization. Are we losing our ability to tell each other stories, to share a common dream? Whereas cinema used to spring from the stage and literature, it now derives from the pulp pages of comic books.No doubt, we can look forward to endless sequels, each worse than the one before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.): "Is it better to be feared or respected? And I'd say is it too much to ask for both?" Iron ManYes, the suit is impressive, a self-contained rocket launcher cum flying machine, but still earthly enough to show some marks from bullets.The opening sequence of Iron Man sets the stage for the film's ironic view of the arms world: Stark rides in a Humvee in Afghanistan only to be wounded by enemy fire generated by his own company. His subsequent incarceration in a cave, culminating in creating the iron outfit not only sets up the rest of his days as super hero but also profoundly changes the way he looks at armament as deterrent.As Stark is played by the mercurial Downey, the sardonic attitude is only a verbal spar away. Downey's checkered life of drugs and irresponsibility helps infuse Stark with the humanity and vulnerability that make him a hero we all can identify with.Superior characterization, effects, enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man is Pure Gold *several spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would have known that Iron Man would be such a hit commercially and critically? This is not just a great movie, it's a milestone for the legacy of Marvel. The film brilliantly blends action, special effects, a top-notch cast, and smart dialogue all in a two-hour film. Robert Downey Jr. gives a very charismatic and energetic performance as Tony Stark/ Iron Man. Even though Iron Man is heavily computer generated, Robert Downey Jr. somehow manages to stay at the forefront of all the explosions and CGI. For once the CGI does not overwhelm or disintegrate the story or characterization. Terrence Howard, Gweneth Paltrow, and Jeff bridges are also equally impressive. The story begins with Tony Stark billionaire, playboy, inventor, and superhero. While traveling in Afghanistan he gets captured by terrorists who want him to build one of his own missiles. He has shrapnel caught in his chest from an explosion and he needs an electromagnet to keep him from dying. On his life mission to end war and violence he strives to build unbeatable weapons. He soon creates an early metal suit and breaks free of his captors. Back home he wants to get rid of missiles and other nuclear weapons to try a new approach. He builds himself the famous Iron Man suit and then the story kicks into high gear. Little does he know that some of his friends oppose his new plans for world peace. Especially his top adviser Jeff Bridges who has other plans. Iron Man is the perfect film to start off the summer season. It reminded me a lot about Robocop which dealt with a robotic human being who served justice, battled an internal conflict with himself, and saved the day with notoriety. GO SEE IT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I became a Robert Downey Jr. fan when I saw the movie "Chaplin". I then caught him in a few other movies, one of them, notably, is "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang". In "Iron Man", Downey Jr. uses a sort of sarcastic humor that is nothing new to his fans. Like everyone else, I too was skeptical about Robert Downey Jr. in a superhero role, but man was I wrong. He is what made this movie, in my opinion. Now, Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow did great jobs in their respective roles. But Robert Downey Jr.'s humor and humanity, added with amazing special effects, make for a movie that is well worth the $7.50 I paid for the ticket.I hope that this makes Downey Jr. the star he deserves to be.</fullReview>

He still manages to keep a sense of humor about him despite all that is happening. Paltrow is his unrequited assistant, Pepper Potts, and Jeff Bridges is the double-dealing Obediah Stane. All of the actors seamlessly meld into their characters.The story is very true to the original comics by Stan Lee, with updates to make it more contemporary. (In Lee's original, Stark has his origin as a prisoner in Vietnam.) Unlike a lot of Marvel Adaptations, they've made the story captivating, even if you are a hard-core comic fan who already knows the tale.The special effects, unlike some of FX sequences, are good but don't dominate the story.

		<fullReview>I've never been a fan of iron man, I just slightly knew who he was and I usually only see movies where i know there's many great actors present. So I was very skeptical when i found out that Terrence Howard (which i've only seen in 50 cent's get rich or die trying') and Robert Downey Jr. (never seen him in a movie before) belonged to the main-characters.Thankfully the trailer was really cool so i couldn't help myself but to see it... and i'm glad i did. The movie was excellent. I laughed more to this movie than i do to most comedies and it made me more excited than most action-movies. The only words that came out of my mouth on the way home was "wow" and "I must see the sequel, NOW!".Terrence Howard was great and i couldn't believe that it was the same actor from get rich or die trying'. Iron man, who i barely knew, became one of my favorite heroes and I almost feel obligated to see more movies with Robert Downey Jr. because of role in this masterpiece. All the other actors were great as well but these two caught my attention most.The story "how Tony Stark became Iron Man" worked better than i expected and the movie caught and held my attention from start to finish. The movie was so interesting that the time just flew by and that is very rare!I know that i've not said anything bad about the movie yet and frankly, there is not much bad to mention. The only thing that made me disappointed was that even tough the movie was almost two hours long, it felt short. I could easily have watched another 20-30 minutes of Iron Man, this year's coolest and funniest superhero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parental Warning! A comic book movie not for the wee ones!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally on IMDb I only contribute about movies that don't get heavily reviewed, but I felt I could contribute with a warning for parents. This may not be a movie for very young children. It's not that the violence is especially bloody, mostly it is not, but young children tend to relate to other young children in movies and there are a few scenes of children facing violence which they may find disturbing. I won't be explicit because I don't want to check the spoiler warning. Children over 10 should be OK, but at the showing I attended there were children much younger than that. Unfortunately, many parents are going to think their 5 year old may enjoy it because it's "just a comic book movie" without realizing that comics today aren't their Grandparent's comics. In today's comics superheroes have sex and sometimes they even die. I doubt you'll hear many people warning parents about this, as we've become so used to violence. But if you would be concerned about your 5 year old watching another 5 year old facing the possible the murder of their parent or even their own death, then you may not wish to let them see this.</fullReview>

Every time producers get in the way of these things, they ruin them, and let's face it, it is usually the jews who want to produce everything and not do any work, just make money off of everyones work.

		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr plays Tony Stark a billionaire, genius weapons manufacturer who gets injured by one of his own company's bombs whilst travelling in a combat zone.Not all the shrapnel can be removed from his body so to keep the shrapnel from puncturing a major ventricle he has an electromagnet inserted in his chest to hold the shrapnel in place and keep him alive. He then invents a tiny power reactor to power the electromagnet and a prototype armour that he uses to escape his captors whom are trying to force him to build them a missile.Once Tony has returned to the United States he has a change of heart and announced that his company will no longer build weapons. This causes his company's stock to plummet and Obadiah Stane gets a court injunction freezing Tony out from his own company.Tony perfects the Mark II armour and uses it to destroy caches of his company's weapons being stockpiled by warlords in the Middle East. In the meantime Obadiah Stane uses the remnants of Tony's prototype armour to create the 'Iron Monger' but needs the mini power reactor embedded in Tony's chest to power it.John Favreau has done a fantastic job adaption Iron Man to the big screen. John's version of Tony Stark is spot on. Tony is arrogant, brilliant and compassionate in equal measure and all aspects of the character are explored.I also liked how the military were portrayed. The Marines/soldiers were regular young people with personalities just like real life soldiers/marines are and it was the weapons corporations and top brass that were rightly the villains of the piece.Obadiah Stane was also brilliantly realised by Jeff Bridges and the Iron Monger armour was truly menacing, the total opposite to Stark's svelte red and gold armour. The special effects in this movie were terrific and some of the armour's gadgets when used in combat were suitably advanced just like in the comic books.Overall I really enjoyed this movie. There was plenty of action and comedy and a good storyline. If you enjoy superhero films or just good action films then I definitely recommend this to you if you haven't already seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man in Iron Script &amp; Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen all of Marvel's movies...but this one,in one word...WOW!!!The action starts almost immediately and only stops at the very end!! The cast is,in my opinion,excellent!Robert D.Jr is great and he's a believable Iron Man and Jeff Bridges,man,unrecognizable but still great! The CGI is very good,not top notch but just sufficient to show that this movie means business,and the way Tony Stark builds his prototype and later is final suit is just...well,just see it to believe! It has humor,serious,love,flirt and action scenes...what else do you want???Don't listen to the negative critics (without reason in my opinion),go see this movie,you'll not be disappointed,money well spent without a doubt! I'll give it a 9/10 because it misses just a little more action,but hey...maybe in Iron Man 2 no???!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpectedly Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back at the time, when I was small, I remember playing one of my favorite games ever, the marvel super heroes fighting game, and I usually use IronMan and SpiderMan as my team. They're as marvelous as ever. But still, as everyone know, IronMan is not as popular as Spiderman, or Wolverine, or any other super heroes character.And here we are, watching one of the Marvel super heroes character being made into a movie, and I have to say, it turns out real great. Too great perhaps, thinking that this is one of the not-so-popular super heroes.The story itself is about a millionaire (Tony Stark a.k.a Iron Man), who is an expert in building weapons for dealing (or people called it, weapon manufacturer). He is a genius one, I told you. And I will say, that he is a rather unique...And the story about Iron Man, begin, when Stark was held captive by a group of terrorist, and in that event, he sees something, that make him realize, that what he's done this whole time, was not just for peace, but rather for war that ended up in taking a lot of casualties. After he realizes that, he then try to develop an armor suit (and later on, will be recognize as the Iron Man), and used it to do some protecting work for the people who suffer because of weapons (especially in this case, his own weapons, his own products) The story is well developed, and all of the actors and actresses are great. The visual effect is just like the mini version of transformer, although not as complicated as the transformer, but still a magnificent one.A nice movie for kids, adults, and all super hero freaks. It got the action, drama, comedy, and some awesome fighting scene.I rate it 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Explosive and well informed film that's shows the action as raw and gritty. And that's suits this flawed action hero just fine!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Iron Man" is clearly not as well known to the masses like "Superman" or "Batman" yet still this is a superhero that's interesting and his character flaws make him likable as Tony Stark/Iron Man comes with no boyishness or glower he's just all action packed business! Robert Downey Jr. with his troubled past and rocky personal life was well suited to play a flawed and hard living character like Tony Stark. Stark is a hard partying, womanizing, high tech celebrity weapons magnate who's loaded with money and lives the luxury of fame. Yet when he's wounded upon a trip to Afghanistan a raw and gritty transformation takes places as Stark becomes a hulking machine type rocket man! The film then shifts off to the great special effects we have became so used to in action movies, yet the theme of the character transformation so dominates the film from the development of his body chest suit, to the making of his clicking limbs and flamethrower arms all rounded out perfect when he's topped off by a medieval knight mask to become "Iron Man"! Stark/Iron Man fooled his captures by constructing a cluster bomb they demanded only he built a mechanical alter ego to fly to freedom! And his goal is to destroy all weapons that he once created, as he now wants to fight for peace.The film is really a great characterization of a flawed man being transformed into a superhero even though the action and special effects are good. Supporting performances are well worth mention from Jeff Bridges as Stark's former friend but now evil corporate partner with his shaved head and beard intimidating. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts who's Tony selfless assistant and Paltrow gives a cute spark like twinkle to the role as the chemistry and sexual tension between her and Downey is well shown. Overall this isn't the greatest attempt at a superhero film clearly falling short from the feel and excitement and thrill of "Batman" or let me say even "Superman", yet still with Downey's performance and the action plus with the way it tells of the transformation of a flawed soul into a superhero most film watchers and comic fans are compensated in a grand way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Iron Man" - Marvel Comics' man of steel... um, iron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Iron Man," a cinematic adaptation of the popular Marvel Comics icon created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Don Heck and Larry Lieber in the early 1960s, is in many ways one of the best comic-to-film adaptations out there (perhaps because Marvel chose to fund this one themselves - the first move of its kind for this sort of movie). Despite having the usual trappings of the usual origin story, "Iron Man" is pure fun. What makes this story stand out are two key factors: the smart-a**ed performance of a newly-reformed Robert Downey, Jr., and a smart-a**ed screenplay by Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway.Working behind the camera (and sharing an on screen cameo) is director Jon Favreau of "Swingers" fame. An admitted Marvel Comics aficionado, Favreau seemed to be the perfect guy to direct an adaptation of Marvel's Man of Steel. Of course, I've never been able to land a copy of an Iron Man comic myself, but I've always admired the character (those who have read my reviews know that Spider-Man is my greatest comic book superhero). As an aside, fans will also realize that Iron Man served as a partial inspiration for the landmark sci-fi picture "RoboCop" (1987), and the character is one of the many aliases of Wu-Tang Clan rapper Ghostface Killah, and his 1996 debut solo record was appropriately named "Ironman."As billionaire industrialist Tony Stark - who is in some ways analogous to DC Comics' Bruce Wayne/Batman - Robert Downey, Jr. is one of the smartest (and unlikeliest) casting choices for any superhero character thus far. He's got the smart-a** attitude, the irresponsible playboy demeanor, dry humor, vibrant sexuality, and the cool slyness of any man at ease with his wealth. While the comics had a Tony Stark who journeyed to Cold War-era Vietnam, Our Hero is now seen demonstrating his company's weapons technology in war-torn Bush Regime-era Afghanistan.After his U.S. Army convoy is attacked, we next see Stark being held captive by Islamic militants who want him to help build them one of his most lethal and effective "toys" from scratch. Stark, who now wears a device that helps keep shrapnel out of his heart (compliments of a fellow benevolent prisoner), thinks otherwise. Using the raw materials at his disposal, he plans to engineer a daring escape plan by constructing a powered suit of armor.After this huge action sequence, Stark returns to California's Stark Industries a changed man. No longer the arrogant rich-boy he was before, he has seen the light; undergoing a sort of philosophical awakening in Afghanistan after seeing the militants use his own weapons against U.S. forces there, he ceases weapons production at Stark Industries, much to the mortification of his business partner and surrogate father figure Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who eventually uses Stark's own technology against him to become the armored super-villain Iron Monger. Along for the ride, of course, is Stark's pretty assistant Pepper Potts (an amazingly well-cast Gwyneth Paltrow), who he starts putting the moves on and she seems to return the affection; there is also loyal best friend Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), who in the comics, of course, eventually becomes War Machine.Yes. "Iron Man" is one heck of a fun ride. Yes. It is incredibly well-acted and directed. Robert Downey, Jr., an alcoholic himself and whose drug problems are well-documented in the annals of Hollywood celebrity hell, is perfectly cast as the rich playboy-turned-superhero Tony Stark/Iron Man. Stark's change-of-heart business philosophy and alcoholism battles and many personal demons were well-documented in the comics as well, thus furthering the true-to-life superhero portrayals defined by Marvel back in the '60s when the character first saw print. This is all something that Downey, Jr. plays incredibly well in the film, and it seems he not only looks like Stark, he IS Tony Stark. Also, most superhero movies make the mistake of having the protagonist just jumping into fray; not so with "Iron Man." Here, Stark's becoming the iron-clad superhero is a process, with a number of technical glitches that provide plenty of humorous bumps along the way to keep it from ever getting boring.Since the movie is typical superhero origin story stuff, it falls victim to it as well. The film of course ends in a fantastic super-powered showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger that kind of wore itself out after a few minutes in. We've seen so many of this stuff in the origin stories before, so let's just hope that like "Spider-Man 2" (2004) - the greatest superhero movie ever - "Iron Man 2/Iron Man Returns" takes the time to really explore the depth of the character and make good with his many personal flaws.9/10</fullReview>

Seriously, get out of the house and go see it! The story line can only be matched by the awesome display of special effects! Some great laughs to be had too! I was absolutely blown away. I knew Favreau was a true talent, but MY God Man!! I grew up reading all of these comics, Iron Man was never really that high on my list of favorites. After seeing this today I'm thinking of cracking the spines of my "mints" to take another look. I was really into The Avengers. I think I've read just about every issue in print. With that you get "some" of Starks adventures, but only intertwined with S.H.I.E.L.D. Then the whole "East Coast, West Coast" I hope Favreau's focus continues down this path. If he can bring this flavor to Iron Man, I would love to see more!!!! Top Notch Cast! The acting was Incredible!!! Favreau You are THE MAN!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Iron Man for the midnight opening and I was very, very pleased with what I found. As a fan of the Avengers for many years, the movie was a breath of fresh air and definitely set my heart and mind racing for what was to come. Not only did I come out of the film anticipating a sequel, this did what I thought was impossible and supplanted Batman Begins as the best superhero movie to date.Iron Man follows the story of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), a multi-billionaire and genius who personally designs much of the technology his company creates and is known as a weapons manufacturer. He's also inevitably a playboy and arrogant in his own success. However, while doing a demonstration in Afghanistan he is captured by the Ten Rings, an Afghani terrorist group, after his convoy is attacked and destroyed. During his captivity, he realizes that the weapons he built are being used by the enemy to kill American soldiers and resolves to fight a different kind of war. He escapes the terrorist facility by building a suit of armor which makes him a walking machine of destruction. However, when he returns home, he realizes that his work is not over and resolves to make the perfect machine for fighting crime and also attempts to discover who sold the terrorists their weapons from within his own company.A lot of comic book favorites are featured in the film. Pepper Potts, his assistant (and later wife in the comic) is portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow, and his friend Jim Rhodes also makes an appearance as Terrence Howard. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane is no less a powerful character. Perhaps the most powerful "guest appearance" is that of S.H.I.E.L.D., the spy organization universal to the Marvel Universe, and the idea of trying to bring the entirety of the universe together through the movies.What truly drives the film is how complex and powerful Downey's character is as Tony Stark. He not only manages to convey the typical jingoism and pomp that is associated with the Marvel Universe equivalent of Bruce Wayne, he also ties it into the storyline with incredible finesse. As a character, while watching the film, I literally grew to become fond of Stark, despite his flaws and his shortcomings, and if that happened, I have no doubt that Favreau and his team succeeded in making a fantastic film.I found no faults, and recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Invincible Iron Man - almost perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was uncertain how this movie would be when I first heard about it. I'm not too familiar with most of Iron Man's enemies and wasn't sure who could pull Tony Stark off and do the character justice.I'm happy to say that all of my concerns were brushed aside with ease. RDJ is absolutely perfect as the billionaire/heavy drinker Tony Stark. The bad guys that take him prisoner at the start of the film are your stereotypical Arab terrorist types, but pay close attention to their name and the emblem they use for their organization... This is awesome foreshadowing to comic readers. They'll be back for a sequel, almost guaranteed! The "super" baddie of the piece is Iron Monger - who is very ably played by Mr. Bridges. The final showdown vs. Iron Monger was pretty good, but a point was deducted for that battle's somewhat cheesy dialogue choices.The principal villain in this film isn't Iron Monger, in my opinion. I got the vibe that Tony Stark's irresponsibility was truly the big antagonist of this film, as his first act as Iron Man is to take the weapons his company manufactured out of the hands of those who would do his country harm.Overall, this is one fantastic and entertaining movie, highly recommended!</fullReview>

All I have to say is watch The Incredible Hulk, because Iron Man just may be the biggest movie of 2008!

		<fullReview>I read a few Iron Man comics- it had its moments- but it was never a major buy on my hit-list back in the day....So its credit to the writers,director Favreau and the wonderful turn by Robert Downey Jr, that this film hits the mark so well. The pithy one liners fly back and forth, the practical &amp; visual effects are seamlessly integrated and the secondary characters all decent. Aside, that is, from the insidious cardboard cut-out Taliban-like fundamentalists! It could have had more action maybe, but I think they are leaving a trump card when it comes to the inevitable-and welcomed- sequel. Jeff Bridges fleshes out a fairly straight forward,"I thought you were on my side" bad guy part. The other supporting cast of Paltrow and Howard are also very likable. But this is Downey's show and he plays his "Bruce Wayne for Real" part with relish and quick fire wit. If you are interested to sit through the end credits you will also get to see a famous Hollywood players cameo-introducing future possibilities for the Marvel Universe.........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Attended an special advanced screening last night. This Movie Rocks! Kudos to Jon Favreau and company for Iron Man! IMO, JF joins Singer and Raimi in the top 3 pantheon of Superhero Directors.The casting is so MONEY! Stark the Playboy/Iron Man the Avenger is a tailor-made role for RDJ...welcome back and enjoy the Cristal. Supporting actors/actresses all portrayed well too. LOL Bridges' Neidermayer scene wailing on poor engineer who's no Tony Stark (is that a pledge pin on your uniform?)This movie has the perfect balance of humour, action, story, character development, but what steals the show is Mark 3, 2, 1. Even though we've all seen numerous trailers and spoilers (can't avert our eyes), seeing Shellhead finally assembled before our eyes on the Big Screen is a MARVEL! Mark 3 is everybit the kickass Avenging arsenal that die hard truebelieving Marvel comic fans have long waited for.It would have been good to see a classic comic supervillain, aka Mandarin, instead of a power hungry Obadiah Stane in his corporate takeover bid. It also would have been interesting to explore Stark the alcoholic, but again this impacts the movie flow/mood/tone.Nevertheless don't wait for DVD, get in your "FunVee", see it on the Big Screen and get ready to be blown away!JF/RDJ Green Light for Iron Man 2!</fullReview>

I heard he's gone through some hard times in the past but I think this movie is gonna be the great turning point for him. Other casts are also good in here except Gwyneth Paltrow. Her presence is little weaker than other superheroe movies. And third, overall tone of film is just right fot this type of movie. It's not too heavy and not too light. My only complaint is music. It's not bad but I prefer Danny Elfmann style like spiderman. All in all, Iron man is a surprisingly good movie and definitely woth the money.</fullReview>

Basically, there's not enough action. Robert Downey Junior does what can reasonably be expected with his 1 dimensional womanising misogynist whist everyone else barely registers on the radar. There's a ridiculous sexual subtext between RDJ and his PA and some blokes from a shadowy government agency appear twice, without reason, then disappear again after doing nothing in particular. All in all a waste of screen time for most of those concerned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to watch the TV-series "Iron Man" when i was small and quite enjoyed it. I had seen the trailer running and heard many people praise the movie for being absolutely brilliant. When a friend of mine asked if i wanted to come along to watch Iron Man, i thought i might as well, and went in expecting a decent but probably over-hyped movie.How wrong i was.This movie is amazingly well done and really lives up to all the hype. The story is well written, never over the top, and there is never a dull moment, it's just entertainment all the way through. When i came out of the theater i couldn't understand where time had went.The acting is also superb, and I especially enjoyed Robert Downeys performance. He really fits the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man perfectly.Beside the superb acting and story, one should also note the very well done CGI in the movie. Some of the best I've seen in a long time. It's absolutely beautiful, and never seems to be over the top or in any way trying to "take over the movie", as it tends to in some movies where the story itself is too vague to hold the movie up.Overall a very entertaining movie, worth multiple viewings. Acting, CGI, Story... everything is well done. Some of the scenes have an almost epic feel to it, such as when Stark first appears as Iron Man.Marvel taking over and making their own movies is definitely one of the best decisions they have ever made. They are considerably better at making movies themselves and it is something they should have done long ago. Ecspect to see lots of good new superhero movies coming out of Marvel in the next years!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man Is Made Out Of Gold.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Stark is a wealthy weapons manufacturer on a routine trip back from a demonstration of his latest weapon, when he is attacked by rebels who want him to build his latest weapon for their own evil gain. Taking shrapnel to the chest, he must have a pacemaker like device on at all times in order to live. After escaping his captives, Stark sees a new side to life and wants to protect the people who have died from his weapons. Thus creating Iron Man.I've read a few issues of Iron Man, enough to know what the story is about, who the characters are and what to expect from the film. I never went in with high expectations, wanting it to be the best thing since sliced bread, and I left the theatre with a smile on my face. Iron Man is the firs real summer blockbuster movie to grace the screen in a long time. Filled with humorous dialogue, great casting and high flying special effects, Iron Man is one of the best comic book adaptations ever put to film.With the announcement of Robert Downey Jr. playing Tony Stark, I knew John Favreau was the right man for the job. Downey has shined a light on himself so bright that I expect more leading roles to come his way. With perfect comedic timing and a dramatic arc to boot, he has created one of the most compelling comic book characters on film to date. With Peter Parker we are beaten over the head with his love for Mary Jane and his guilt for his uncle, we never really get pass this. X-men has too many characters to keep track of for us to emotionally connect to one central character. Iron Man manages to make a womanizing, alcoholic, weapons manufacturer actually likable. All of that is because of Downey's charisma. Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have much to do here, but she makes the material work. Howard was a little off his game. His presence wasn't there. It seemed like he wasn't confident enough in this role and it was really out of place. Jeff Bridges is menacing in the looks, but comedic in the dialogue. I don't know if it is my hours upon hours of Lebowski watching, but I just did not find Bridges voice to be menacing at all. I kept hearing the dude. He wasn't threatening enough.Iron Man sets itself apart from other comic book films (except for Batman Begins) with how serious it is. The film prides itself on being more realistic then what one would think. This is accomplished by focusing more on the man inside the armor then the high flying rocket shooting, breaking sound barrier hot rod red "superhero". This is because Iron Man is simply that....a man. He has no special powers, no enhanced ability. He has loads and loads of money.The problem with most origin stories is that it has to set everything up. It doesn't have the time to have fun with the story and make it seem really dangerous to the characters. Iron Man has a lot of set up and little delivery on the action. There are two scenes in which Stark throws on the suit and does actual battle. Not including the cave made promo device. This has pros and cons, it does make the film seem more plausible. I believed a lot of what was happening, until the final fight scene. Unfortunately, that final fight scene doesn't knock anyone's socks off. It doesn't blow our minds, it's too generic and the suit, environments and weaponry were not used to their full potential.The special effects are well done, nothing too jaw dropping. It seemed like the crew knew what they had to do and just went for that. Nothing seems to be trying to grab our attention, it all fits naturally. Some scenes are bit off and noticeable CGI is used, which may be distracting to the eye. Specially when Downey is sitting in front of the TV and he has the armor suits arm on his right arm.I'm impressed with Favreau. I wasn't a big fan of Elf and Zathura was garbage. With Iron Man Favreau has found his calling. I hope he doesn't try anymore kid films and sticks to what he knows and does best. He never let the content get away from him, considering it is so huge and upon first glance, would seem out of his league.Iron Man is a fun ride that kicks off the summer blockbuster trend. While it is not as good as X-Men 2 or some other comic book outings, it is indeed one of the strongest ones. With the inevitable sequel, we will get to see what Iron Man can really do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Total Package - Downey is Perfect - Can't Wait For Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>24/M/Detroit - This movie was spectacular. I've never been too familiar with Iron Man but Tony Stark's character is awesome and it's a much different kind of super hero movie. A manned super hero, gotta love that. The special effects were sense tickling, the action well spread throughout the movie, and the funny spots had the whole theater erupting. Robert Downey Jr was perfect for this role, I can't believe the directors originally wanted a 20 something for the part. All in all very entertaining to watch and when the credits rolled I couldn't help but think "man I wanna see the sequel right now". Very good please keep these movies coming...CAN'T WAIT for the Incredible Hulk!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than matched my expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outside of Batman Begins, it's my favorite superhero movie and Downey Jr. gives my favorite performance in said genre. He took his normal hilarious personality and charisma, which works incredibly well for the character, and added touches of internal angst in the struggle of trying to make right for all the wrongs he has committed in his life. It works well as a character study of this complex man, and as a massively entertaining blockbuster. One of the most entertaining films I've seen in quite a while, and Downey Jr. kills once again. The action sours high, the characters are rich and the entire ensemble gives good support to the man of the hour. It really is Downey's film; nobody could capture this essence so perfectly and I don't think there's an actor around who I enjoy performing more than him. It's ridiculous that he actually had to fight for this role, because he is just too perfect. I'd go into more detail, but you get the picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Don't Have Words To Tell You How Great This Movie Is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband and I went and saw "IronMan" tonight. I really can't describe how wonderful this movie is from start to finish. Everything from the beginning credits to the entire ending credits was wonderful. I predict Academy Award nominations galore especially for Robert Downey, Jr., Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Terrence Howard did an outstanding job with his character but his role wasn't as large as the others. I don't want to spoil the movie by telling you details of the movie. Just make sure you go see it soon and on the big screen. I wish we had IMAX here to show it on the really big screen. Just make sure you go see it. By the way, you can tell at the end, they have set this movie up for a sequel and I'm glad they did! Can't wait for the sequel. I had read that Robert Downey, Jr. was making his permanent comeback and that his problems are behind him and he proved it in this movie. He is the greatest actor of his generation...I firmly believe that. Go see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A steaming Pile of Stark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't get past the opening. They opened with Stark being a drunk and a whoremonger.In the first battle, a guy screams at him and then he gets ripped apart. The Humvee that Stark is in gets riddled with holes from the projectiles. Stark would have been liverwurst at that point.Then we find out that his heart condition is now merely shrapnel.And that's all I could stand.Why couldn't they make an Ironman movie about Ironman? Why did they have to make one about some god-awful person who was only fit for a Kardashian wedding.They could have had a decent movie that was faithful to Ironman and used the same plot.Extremely poor if you like Ironman. Maybe okay if you favor crap.I won't regret not seeing this turkey, but I do regret the five minutes that I spent seeing how badly they treated a pretty decent character.This movie gets one star for the casting. Robert Downey Junior is a true piece of trash, and his real life fits exactly the despicable person that they turned Tonly Stark into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers: Now I have to tell you up front, I had never heard of the Ironman character until this movie came out. But the word everywhere was that this was one of the best superhero movies to date so not being a theater goer, I eagerly anticipated it's release on DVD. What I saw was horrible. Yes there were some cool scenes of him flying around in the suit, most of which I had already seen on Ebert &amp; Roper. I'll admit, this concept had potential, but the plot was horrendous.First of all, I for one, am truly sick to death of hearing about Bush's wars in the middle east and setting most of the movie in Afganistan was a horrible idea. I go to such fantasy movies to escape reality, not be reminded of national tragedy. Besides in superhero movies the villains are supposed to be larger than life. This is about as cheesy as the old comics from the 40's showing Superman fighting Tojo, etc. Setting this in Afganistan very much dates this movie and as current events subside, this movie will become unwatchable in a generation. Imagine if Tim Burton's Batman was about not Batman confronting the Joker, but Batman taking on Manuel Norriega, the victim of the regimes propaganda machine at the time. No one would watch it today, fortunately Tim Burton knew better than to give us such trash.Another thing that didn't work for me was the flipping back and forth in time. This is confusing, even in a show I like such as NBC's HEROES. I'm not too fond of this technique and wish it were kept to an absolute minimum. And where it works is where the jump is a foreshadow of the very ending like Lawrence of Arabia, or Fight Club. This movie started out with a random scene from the middle of the movie. The chronological storytelling in Spiderman would have been much better here, especially as Ironman isn't as well known to the public as the Superman, Spiderman, or Batman characters.But the most truly dreadful scene that caused this movie to jump the shark in my opinion was were he invented the Ironman suit as a hostage in a cave. This was so utterly ridiculous, the most sophisticated technology yet created by man in a medieval lockup. The creation of the second suit in the lab I could see, and I wish that point is where this movie began and they rewrote the whole script without the Islamic terrorist crap. On the bright side I did like Robert Downey Jr's work in here and also though Jeff Bridges did a decent job with his new creepy look. But all in all this was a waste of a DVD rental fee and I now have little faith in the taste of all these teenage video game nerds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The special effects in this picture are good but not much else worth saying that about this movie. It is made for people with juvenile minds or for those who take comfort in reading comics. The plot so called is about a super rich and clever arms' dealer who decides that he will create an iron 'superman' to fight what he perceives to be injustice. Where this movie errs badly it is pure and ridiculous science fantasy yet it brings in real life war torn Afghanistan and starts preaching politics and other self interested propaganda. The lead actor and actress are totally miscast and are wholly unconvincing; she thinks by just posing she is putting in a decent performance which she does not, and he is no hero and neither acts nor looks the part. The film is far too long. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It will entertain, it will make a lot of money, and it will be in the top 250...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MY GOD, I nailed it! It is in the top 250! Thank God for the 13 year old fanboys, I'll tell you that much. Anyways, Iron Man IS a great way to kick off the summer. This movie has everything to make the next door cinema snobs scream at the top of his lungs with disgust: predictable storyline, unrealistic BUT fantastic CGI, Robotic action that will make Michael Bay learn a thing or two, and Robert Downey Jr. playing, Robert Downey Jr. Comic Book fans are in heaven with this one, and others will love it still. Unless, you are that certain cinema snob I was talking about earlier, now go back to your Rashomon and Bertolucci marathon's please, and STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT A COMIC BOOK MOVIE.Iron Man is the story about a superhero that has a suit of destruction. Kinda like Batman, Iron Man doesn't have any superpowers, but he does have wits, smarts, good looks and most of all, issues. In the movie though, Jon Favreau doesn't come all the way and decides to delve into the dark side of Mr. Tony Stark, but that's okay, because the rest of the movie is well done. After the powerful weapons manufacturer, Tony Stark, finishes showing his prototype to military leaders in Baghdad or whatever, he is attacked and held hostage by a guerrilla group, that ultimately wants him to build an atomic missile. Tony on the other hand builds a suit...OF DEATH. This part of the movie is incredible, showing us the Old School Prototype of Iron Man, making us Comic Book fans very happy. Then eventually after he kills everyone like in the Trailer, he escapes and gets back to his home, and decides that his company will quit selling weapons. After all the media attention Tony is getting thanks to this announcement, he is adviced by his powerful bearded friend and partner (The Lebowski) that he should take some time off so that he can get his act together. Tony of course takes this to heart, just so that he can start to work and perfect the suit we all have come to know and love. Of course there will be things that will not make Tony's life any easier, such as a back stabbing- power hungry villain (guess), learning to fly and a crappy love subplot with Gwyneth Paltrow(out of all people). The script is yes, clichéd. But is it entertaining? Of course.Iron Man has a very good cast. Unfortunately, not that well handled. You see, apart from Downey, the rest of the cast offer passable performances at best. You can expect people like Terrence Howard, Paltrow and Jeff Bridges to do great performances. Well, not so much here. Just...Okay. HOWEVER, Jon Favreau offers a heartbreaking performance in this film, truly one for the ages. Just seeing him in his pointless cameo makes me all giddy inside with emotion.The music? Bleh. Even if it has Suicidal Tendencies, I could care less for a lame hard rock soundtrack with yes, a Back In Black song...again. Cinematography is alright, nothing to write home about. But what the hell am I talking about? Kids just wanna see the effects, and boy, does this movie have them! Marvelous CGI on Iron Man's flying and fighting capabilities. And the final fight with Iron Monger was awesome, really pulling off what Michael Bay thought... he was pulling off.Overall, Iron Man deserves your 10 Dollars. Iron Man will love your ten dollars so much, that he will give you an extra scene after the credits, just so you can drool all over your Avenger's Comic collection back when you get home. Even though it isn't the BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVAHH!!one!11!! it is decent, and it will make you happy. A 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Average Superhero Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** This review does include SPOILERS! Don't worry, I'll tell you when they begin! ***"Iron Man" is a combination of great acting and good direction combined with an average script and mediocre film score.The best thing is clearly the choice of Robert Downey, Jr. in the lead, along with all of the supporting casting. Lots of great actors and all good performances.Jon Favreau does a good job, here tackling a much larger production than he has in the past. He's said to be an actors' director, and that proves true here. The characters really pop off the screen and that's what makes this superhero movie unique! Of course, Favreau really should have stayed out of the film himself. He has a strange, small role that just makes it seem like he wanted to be in the movie, with no real purpose for doing so.What I didn't like as much was the script. Lots of good elements, but it's weighed down by what I would call Origin-Story Syndrome. By having to tell us all about how Iron Man came to be, the movie kind of becomes a procedural. Lots of explanation, and not as much time for adventure as you'd like.It is weird that there are still problems with this. The first major superhero movie, 1978's "Superman" got it right the first time. Why all subsequent superhero movies couldn't take its example is beyond me. "Superman" laid out the origin part of its story in the early part of the movie, and got done with it. The rest of the movie was a straight adventure, with the origin stuff all done.But, one movie after another since then didn't get the message. "X-Men," "Batman Begins," "Fantastic Four," etc. all got weighed down by Origin-Story Syndrome. Too much going over how the superhero(es) came to be and not enough straight adventure.The other element that I wasn't excited about was the film score. Not something everyone would be concerned about. But, that standard rock-pop music stuff just has no real energy to it. Good film composers are pretty much non-existent these days, and this movie's no exception! Too bad, because a good film score definitely would have helped make "Iron Man" more fun and more exciting.*** SPOILERS START HERE! ***Okay, now to comment on plot points and stuff. I thought it was kind of weird to start with Tony getting hit and abducted in the beginning and then flashback 36 hours or whatever to see his life just before. Immediately, the movie's rhythm is knocked off kilter. Didn't understand that decision.Stark's escape from Afghanistan takes a while to come together. This once again goes into the whole Origin Story problem, where we're taking a lot of time getting to the adventure part of the movie.The following part with the whole corporate espionage stuff almost feels like "Star Wars: Episode I" did with all its political stuff. Also, the final confrontation between Iron Man and Iron Monger kind of felt like the ending of "Fantastic Four" with a battle confined to a city street at night. Kind of small scale for a big-budget movie like this.The film does have lots of good ideas. The problem is with the pacing and the energy. It just seems like things are kind of casual and Stark at times seems a bit laid back about what's going on. Even in his final line, "I am Iron Man" he seems a bit low key. C'mon Tony, say it loud and say it proud! The script and the direction just could use more snap and energy. I got the feeling that the screenwriters and director seem like they are working hard at getting the job done, and not enough time getting into the material and feeling it.*** END OF SPOILERS ***Overall, a good superhero movie. Now that the whole origin story is over, let's get to a straight adventure story and have some real fun with it!******* (7 Out of 10 Stars)</fullReview>

Robert Downey Jr. does a fabulous job, the CGI is not really noticeable, The SPFX compliments the film &amp; doesn't overwhelm it. The characterizations are strong &amp; likable, good dialog &amp; plot &amp; the action level is just right. Even if you're not a comic book fan or even a big fan of Iron Man, you should still find plenty of well paced entertainment &amp; fun from this picture. Definitely a 10/10 in my book. My only hope is that The upcoming "Incredible Hulk" film is done this well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All I can say is Marvel has redeemed itself!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 3 and Ghost Rider SUCKED to the highest extent of the comic-to-movie craze of the millennium. 2007 was a bad year for superhero movies so I came in with low expectations to see Iron Man. The previews looked good but I feared I will be disappointed again and suspect that Marvel has lost its touch after the first two Spider-Man and X-Men films. Well, to be honest I was THOROUGHLY impressed and ENTERTAINED at the same time!!! This film EASILY blows those two crapfests mentioned earlier out of the water completely with an intelligent and well written plot, good acting, action, special effects and most importantly character development, something Sider-Man 3 completely neglected to do. The less said about Ghost Rider the better. But the real star of the show is no doubt the unlikely casting choice of Mr. Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark/Iron Man. His performance really caught me off guard in almost every aspect as a charming, no-nonsense, weapons-making womanizer whose at first glance "imbeded" with man's destructive nature but ultimately rises with a heart of gold. Gwyneth Paltow is both sexy and sweet as Stark's secretary who keeps him from slipping further; nice to see a woman whose smart and sexy with real depth in a comic book movie. Jon Favreau's direction is top-notch and knows the material well; moreover, this is the first Marvel film made independently of any major studio. I also like that the Iron Man armor is a combination of CGI and practical effects, helped along by Stan Winston, the king of practical movie effects and his work and attention to detail is very impressive as shown in the past. Though there's lots of humor in Iron Man, it never becomes overbearing and OTT like Spider-Man 3 whose idea of humor is more on the lines of an SNL sketch. My only negatives are some underdeveloped characters and the liberties taken with the Iron Man comics (Tony Stark being captured in Afghanistan rather than Vietnam, not delving into his alcoholism) but those are miner hiccups in an otherwise stellar movie.In conclusion: Iron Man is the best Marvel movie made and I'm eagerly awaiting future installments and after seeing this awesome film I can say wholeheartedly and sincerely that Marvel has truly redeemed itself. See it and be blown away!!!</fullReview>

We never cared about the superficial superhero, whether he lived or he died. No character development or growth at all. Just so much eye candy for people who love special effects. Actually very similar to 2012 in that respect. Try to just shut your brain off when the movie starts and just enjoy the pretty colors. If I could give it zero stars I would.

		<shortDescription>Comic Bookish in a Bad Way; Best Part: The Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Iron Man"'s best feature is its cast: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terence Howard, Clark Gregg and Shaun Toub are all serious actors who have been in actually good movies. They can afford to slum in drek like this. They don't slum, though. All of them act up a storm, as if the script were actually worth something. Good for them. Robert Downey Jr. is fascinating to watch, and Gwyneth Paltrow is adorable and appealing as something of a female lead (remember, this is a movie for boys.) Otherwise, though, "Iron Man" is not one of those comic book movies like the Christian Bale "Batman" or the over the top, guilty pleasure "300" that transcends its genre. "Iron Man" is an obvious, pathetic fantasy for men and boys who are insecure because they feel unattractive, weak, stupid, and incompetent. Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is granted superhuman powers of intelligence, sex appeal, and power. The movie, heavy-handed and obvious, announces, within the first five minutes, that Tony Stark had sex with all of Maxxim's cover models, and, presumably as part of his super powers, he apparently did not contract one social disease by doing so. Stark goes on to seduce a woman who hates him, and, again this is all within the first few minutes. He stiffs his friend to play dice in Vegas, he flies his private jet around the world, and, in a cave, using scrap metal and an open fire, he invents a wearable suit that resists close range automatic weapons fire. He also, for some reason, inserts a glowing device, that looks a lot like a smoke detector, into his chest. Tony lives in a spectacular house in Malibu, he parks shiny sports cars where the camera will be sure to see them, and a train of white, black, young, and old sycophants follow him around, complimenting his every move. Gee, Tony, you're a genius. Yeah, yeah, blah, blah, whatever. Even within the boundaries of comic book movies, none of this is believable, and it's frightening to think of the childlike minds that will find it appealing.The movie lacks a strong narrative drive. Tony's agenda, his enemies, his location, and even his Iron Man suit, change too often. The movie is chopped into episodic bits. The plot twists are not surprising.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shiny Kitsch for Kids Only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost: if you are an adult and you would like to identify yourself (a bit) with a fictional character then you have to chose a CHILD CHARACTER (Harry Potter or Lyra Belaqua for e.g.) because the fictional adult characters are so childish they need to be told not to suck on their thumbs. And where the moral would be: For a start we got a careless billionaire making megabucks on gun manufacturing and trading. Then he realizes that guns are bad (not spoiling the buzz about the moment how he comes to this conclusion...) And what's his next move? To build an armor full of missiles and set out self-judging like Charles Bronson in Death Wish. Great pattern for kids, huh?Same childishness goes for the Actions Department: as if the people responsible for this crap were giving out Iron Man toys to some 5 year old kids and copied their playing with them, then added some CGI and tapped on each others shoulder for good work. Pityful. My three stars needs some explanation then: one for good casting (even if it's wasted grossly) and two for the Iron Man outfit which is the only one so far (amongst the Marvel adaptations) that truly resembles the original. Badly hurts that we're not spared from the sequel as it seems there is an audience out there that is completely ignorant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man (2008) The story of Tony Stark a mega rich industrialist whose company make and sell the finest modern weaponry has a sudden crisis of faith when he is captured by Afghans during a visit to Afghanistan to promote his new Jericho super-missiles. As he spends weeks in a cave in the middle of nowhere, Stark realises that his weaponry falls into the wrong hands and immediately condones his actions. To escape from the cave he builds a metallic suit with some kind of mini rocket boosters and he escapes fashionably to go back to the USA. From then on Iron Man is born...Robert Downey Jr. who is an excellent actor, mostly taking small independent film projects steps up to play the cool Tony Stark and he successfully manages to create one of the greatest superhero personalities on the screen to date. His performance is effortless.Alongside Downey Jr there is solid support from a great cast including Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard who all add flavour to the whole film.Breathtaking special-effects, mind-numbing action sequences, astonishing visuals, Iron Man will not disappoint. For anyone who has enjoyed Spider-Man, Batman and even the lesser Fantastic Four this should be an exciting event.One of the best superhero films to date and this year's first solid blockbuster film.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so Super</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand the hype from the true hard core Iron Man fans of the comic book. Went with my brother, who is one of those and he loved it. Me....not so much. Special effects, humor all fine. Downey, Jr. I could buy. The problem for me was the suspending of believability,I had a similar problem with the 2nd Indiana Jones Movie. I know it's fantasy, I know it's a comic book, but if you get out of the cartoon world at least try to have action that is somewhat believable. The whole sequence with him building that first Iron Man Suit in a cave ....Yeesh! Plus dropping 500 feet from the sky and getting up without a hair messed up just made me groan. The plot was shaky. Now, I didn't mind a little politics in there. Certainly the idea of our enemies getting hold of the weapons we build to defeat them is probably more true than we care to think about.That being said, I find it impossible to believe that the Jeff Bridges character (and he does give a great over-the-top performance)as the CEO of the world's biggest arms manufacturer would be zipping around 3rd world countries personally to oversee his black market arms sales and deal with petty warlords. But hey, the film delivers some great CGI moments, the Iron Man suit is spectacular and Downey is a good choice for the character. Everyone else liked it so go and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's loud, it's lame and after all of the hype should make a trillion dollars as the same ready to mix super hero recipe follows all of the directions in this overcooked CGI spectacular of blowin' things up real good. Updated from its comic book beginnings to our present century of world terror I M villains are the usual suspects of semi-literate hateful Afghans and greedy American capitalists strikingly familiar to the same difficult types encountered by Super,Spider and Bat mans.Tony Stark, brilliant inventor and mega rich arms dealer goes through a moral conversion after being wounded and captured by Afghan terrorists. Managing to build an armor plated flying suit under the eyes of his moronic captors he escapes to fight another day, this time in a really neat looking metallic model. When Tony wants to do a one eighty with the business his evil partner attempts to thwart him. Who shall win this titanic struggle of good and evil? Who cares. We're here to be visually mesmerized and that we are but only for brief periods and with the same twists and turns crashes and explosions that every mega budgeted fiction fantasy flic offers.Robert Downey Jr. as the I Man is a brilliant piece of marketing in art imitating life. The one time drug sodden loser like the comic book character has managed to rise Phoenix like from the ashes of a ruined career and parlay it into what looks to be a mega money maker for the next decade. Downey is the right choice but hardly tested as an actor since a super hero's emotional range is very limited (it's the reason villains are so much more interesting)but he does manage to bring a cool hipness to the square super hero model. Jeff Bridges overacts a tad with an evil Daddy Warbucks impression and Gwyneth Paltrow as suffering girl Friday Pepper Potts seems to be in the downward spiral Downey was with the culprit not being drugs but lack of talent.The special effects are predictably spectacular and there's a heavy metal music score to bludgeon you along the way as the assembly line plot unfolds with less grace than the first Spiderman and even less humor and suspense than Robo-Cop. You seen one you seen 'em all. This is a newer but not improved hybrid model of a crowded field and it is more tin than iron.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So George was wrong. Tony Stark does wear clothing under the armor. I always hoped he was naked. Oh well.Iron Man was a weird time. I enjoyed it overall quite a bit, but there were moments when I just didn't give a damn. My issues are minor, but for nit-picking semi-comic book nerds, they are just. My earlier comic book experiences with Tony Stark gave me a completely different impression. Stark is more of a gentleman like character. And though Downey had to include his attitude into the role, it still worked. One thing I did not care for in the slightest was the News Reporter gal. Her role was annoying (I get it), much too distracting and just a weak part of the script. And she never got her "come-up-ins". Stupid chick even interrupted when she wasn't supposed to! She should have been booted outta there! There were a couple talky parts, I suppose to add depth to the friendships, but overall they were just boring and felt unneeded. Again, minor issues that don't take anything away from the main aspects to the film.But the action, special effects and acting by Downey and Bridges were all really good. Actually it may have the best effects I've seen yet in a super hero movie. But ya can't forget about the effects in Howard the Duck. And Favreau did a decent enough job as well. Overall, this should be a really fun on-going Marvel movies series. If you want an entertaining, great looking action flick, look no further.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With this film, Marvel's little known comic book superhero is immortalized. The film is big, spectacular, fun, grandiose... in every sense.Robert Downey Jr is terrific as Stark as he shows charm, wit, brains and brawn. His lines are spot on and he brings seems to make Stark into his own, as they have similar traits, making him blend well into his character and making it likable. Jeff Bridges does a convincing Job as the villain. Terrence Howard is okay as Stark's Air Defense pal, and it's nice to see Gwyneth Paltrow in a major film after a long absence, she is simply adorable in this film.The special effects are nicely handled and realistic, and it shows the film's $150 million budget. To quote a fellow reviewer, it's nice to see the use of CGI to the fullest and utmost extent, especially the construction of the suit. The action sequences are handled nicely thus provide excellent eye candy, making them exhilarating. Kudos to director Jon Favreau for really keeping his promise.Great lines, great actors, excellent action scenes and special effects, this movie has the ingredients of a popcorn masterpiece. See it with a bunch of friends, who knows, I'll maybe see it again. This is an excellent way to start the summer, and also the best superhero film since 2005's "Batman Begins", and that's saying something.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall value: 8.9/10Delton</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adequate Cure for Cinematic Anemia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The crown prince of America's premier weapons manufacturer Tony Stark (a sober Robert Downey Jr.) grows a conscience after being captured by terrorists in Afghanistan and decides to fight for what's right in an innovative piece of body armor technology that will henceforth be known as "Iron Man" in Jon Favreau's predictable but fun Marvel comic film adaptation.Wisely abandoning the corny mawkishness of the "Spiderman" films and the recent attempt to revive the "Superman" franchise, "Iron Man" instead offers up some light satire, bright-eyed cynicism, and an attempt at witty banter. The always lovely Gwyneth Paltrow is a delight as Stark's sassy assistant Pepper Potts, and it's nice to see her doing something light and fun for a change. Also part of the off-kilter cast are Terrence Howard as Stark's inexplicable military friend and Jeff Bridges bald and bearded as Stark's mentor (and dun dun dun...enemy?) Downey Jr. apparently ad-libbed much of the dialog, which sometimes falls flat, but for the most part works. It's certainly far more enjoyable than the typical fan-boy in-jokes that plague most comic book movies.Certainly this is no "Batman Begins" in terms of depth and scope of drama, but with slam-bang special effects and an effortless feel (despite a slow build up to the action), "Iron Man" certainly fits the bill as a better than average comic book/action film. Is it any wonder critics and audiences have embraced it so warmly after suffering through loud obnoxious dreck like "Transformers?" While it has been a bit oversold, "Iron Man" proves that great special effects can be built around a smart story that doesn't have to pander to the lowest common denominator. Until "The Dark Knight" it will have to cure our cinematic anemia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly fun! The trailer definitely underpromised and overdelivered. Watched Iron Man as requisite summer movie blockbuster viewing; ended up happily enjoying it. The incredibly talented Robert Downey Jr. made Iron Man work by animating the character with his own inherent eccentricities.Iron Man draws several parallels with other superheroes. For one, he has a lot in common with Batman. Just like Bruce Wayne, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is a rich, orphan playboy gifted with the aptitude for high technology. Instead of having the elderly Alfred as butler, however, Stark has personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), a pair of artificially intelligent robots (adorable scene stealers that have adapted puppy-like personalities) and best friend Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard). Just like Superman, he sleeps with a reporter, Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb), and has someone close to him for his arch nemesis.Writer/actor/producer/director Jon Favreau is a revelation, helming this action-adventure flick with disarming deftness; it's clear he enjoyed directing this film. How can he not with an unexpectedly well-written, relevant script and a talented cast that includes the chameleon-like Jeff Bridges and cameos from Stan Lee and Samuel L. Jackson. The special effects are excellent and the editing was just right, even if it runs over two hours. Overcoming its corny name, Iron Man has all the makings of a successful franchise!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One asks himself what if Marvel or DC Comics did not exist what would become Hollywood ? I mean once had been cradle of art and creativity these studios are throwing their resources , talents and investments to make clichéd worn out predictable comic book adaptations nowadays. In a few instances they are OK in artistic sense due to talented acting , decent and deep characterization and finely balanced dramatic writing with CGI or special effects are as required nothing more nothing less. (no matter how impressive they are)Unfortunetely Iron Man does not belong to this category. This is a movie produced and edited as a video clip. It has every cliché imaginable expected from a big but empty headed Hollywood blockbuster inspired from comic book aimed for 15 year olds. Cartoonish characters , sterile environment , lots of CGI , lame jokes/humor , unbelievably silly story (he made a super powerful weapon suit inside a cave ? PLEASE !!!) , hot chicks , fast cars , US Army being source of goodness around the world , swarthy Middle Eastern looking like bad guys who are evil just sake of it ( and getting their asses kicked of course as always) , an arch villain who boasts a lot , a final boss level showdown where superhero thriumps without any cost or after consequence....I understand there are lots of fans of that kind of things but frankly I am bored with them...I can endure even ignore clichés or predictability if movie presented something new , unique or original...Nope everything went down exactly I predicted above.....As for acting it is hit and miss really...Robert Downey Jr. shows a really decent performance here since his character Tony Stark is the center of story. Unfortunetely his character is nothing more than a Bruce Wayne wannabe. Mrs Patrow is usual damsel in distress...Jeff Bridges is usual uber nemesis without maniacal laugh or mustache twirling (he does have a beard though) Terence Howard is just awful. He doesn't have even a slight military presence....I see this as a trend....Comic book superhero adaptations just aimed to entertain and please fans of genre or very young or sub educated people who can be dazzled with CGI , explosions and awful characterization/dialog. Due to money making reasons (undeniable result of Hollywood becoming an industry to make profit) it is a popular trend now but this is not cinema.....I do not see a future for Iron Man (in creative sense) except a few sequels then audience will probably shift to next superhero like Superman , Spider Man , Hulk , Fantastic Four etc or its sequel/remake....They are basically same unfortunately...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from a brilliant film but still a bright, breezy and enjoyable summer blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up, Tony Stark was always good with machines ? very good. This pleased his father, who was equally as skilled and had built his internationally successful weapons company up from the ground with the sole aim of arming his country to help them win the wars they face. When his father died when he was still young, the company went into the safe hands of friend and partner Obadiah Stane but, at 21, Stark came back onto the scene as head of the company and, it must be said, something of a playboy with a deserved reputation for loving woman and having a general cavalier attitude to life. However a weapons demonstration in the Middle East changes that when he is captured by terrorists and made to build them weapons. He escapes by building himself a mechanical suit and blasting his way out, but the experience has changed him and on his return to the US announces that the firm is dropping out of arms manufacture ? an announcement that dismays Stane and the board, but not as much as his other plans would.Iron Man was more or less the first big film of the summer and, unlike the blockbuster season of 2007 it was a good start because Iron Man pretty much did everything that a Blockbuster should. It is big noisy fun, with good action sequences, comedy and effects and it is yet another superhero movie ? which is the only thing about it that gave me cause for concern. The thing is, as good as some of them are, we also have lame ones where the focus is on the effects and nothing else. Iron Man is not the new Batman films but nor is it anywhere near the level of Fantastic Four, if anything it is like what one would want Fantastic Four to be like. I say this meaning that Iron Man has a solid plot (although the "developmental" film is generally the "easiest" one to get right), fun characters and a good sense of humour thanks to the character of Stark ? I mean, I like Batman's tortured psyche as a subject but Stark would be a lot more fun to hang out with.Towards the end, the plot suddenly moves past the developmental plot line and gets to the "conclusion". It is noisy and not as exciting as I would have liked but it is good enough to satisfy those who want to see their money up on the screen. For me the rest of the film was stronger as it focused on Stark, who is nailed by a perfectly cast Downey Jr. His acerbic sense of humour and real lifestyle of excess helps the film and he is an enjoyable centre piece who remains a presence even when he is just a CGI effect on screen. Paltrow looks good and fills the undemanding role well despite me personally not liking her that much. Bridges was a solid presence for the most part, even if not that much is made of him, while Howard is a good name to allow the series to continue with stars on board. I didn't think that Favreau would be up to the task since this is really his first big budget action film but, while not anything special, he did a good job and perhaps it helped with the humour to have him on board but we shall see if he returns with Iron Man 2 (which I'm assuming is a given as a project).So OK we have the Batmans and other good films this summer but for simple popcorn enjoyment, Iron Man holds its own. Don't look for a lot of soul searching (Stark's change of heart is more a plot device than a subject for exploration) but if you would solid action, some good laughs and a generally enjoyable product then this will fill that need till the next one comes along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Downey owns this solid, if uncreative, origin story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summer blockbuster season has indeed come and "Iron Man" is a fine film that provides a solid diversion through the course of its running time - at least for the first hour. But it's always good to see Robert Downey Jr. and it goes without saying that, despite equally impressive performances from the supporting cast, he owns this movie.Based from yet another Marvel comic book superhero, Downey is Tony Stark, a genius billionaire industrialist who has amassed his great fortune by developing weapons for the US military. On a trip to Afghanistan he is captured by terrorists, is held hostage and forced to build a weapon for his captors. He instead secretly builds a power armor that would help him escape and keep him alive from a shrapnel that has been embedded in his heart.He escapes and upon his return to America, he develops a more advanced suit, giving him superhuman strength, capable of flying and firing missiles among others, whereupon he is dubbed as the Iron Man.While the movie begins interestingly with glimpses of Stark's confused character, it stalls during the second part where the uncreative riffs of an origin movie seems like obligatory parts director Jon Favreau and the screenwriters are too eager to be done with. Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's PA Pepper Potts is charming, but Paltrow doesn't exactly have chemistry with Stark. Terrence Howard as Stark's best bud Jim Rhodes is slightly underused and one wishes there would be more of him in case a few more sequels are underway.As for the obligatory villain, a bald and bearded Jeff Bridges effectively plays an otherwise drab villain on Stark's teacher and business partner Obadiah Stane. There's no depth in his character and he's about as cartoonish as a villain can get, so to speak. The climactic battle between him and Iron Man isn't that exciting either.Retconned to modern times, it's not just about some teenager with personal vendetta to deal with; it's about a man riddled with guilt and a global issue to deal with. It's just disappointing that Favreau would bypass Stark's conflicts for the obvious and less trappings of a summer blockbuster.Still for the most part, the movie's entertaining. There's some great CGI, some humor all around - mostly from Downey - and a couple of action sequences that are better handled than the climactic one. Plus it's pretty easy to cheer for the hero even if for most of the time he's battling enemies who have no chance of winning.So while "Iron Man" isn't a lock on achieving an A-list status in terms of superhero movies, it gets its job done and leaves one hoping it earns enough at the box office so we'll get to see more of Downey as the eponymous superhero, and crossing our fingers it will be better now the conventional part's done with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not terrible, but almost. Robert Downey Jr. got a nice payday from this and he did what he could for the lead character of Tony Stark, but let's face it, John Favreau basically makes kids' films - and that's what Iron Man is - a movie for the 8-12 set.It's not even worth wasting too many words on this executive-notes-cut-and-paste formulaic piece of mass-market dreck.Suffice it to say too much time is spent on the backstory of how Tony Stark becomes Iron Man; there is the now standard betrayer/arch-villain antagonist (Jeff Bridges slumming); and the ditzy love-interest assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow doing, well, what she does).This is a kids movie, but even at age 10 I would've only given this film 4 out of 10 stars.And the fact that this is a critical as well as commercial success - and is rated over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes, and over 8 stars here on IMDb bespeaks of just how low standards have fallen. The audience not only doesn't expect any better than this - they now consider this low level of art worth over 8 stars on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man was not the revolutionary movie comic book movie people were claiming it to be. In fact it was a rather disappointing film. I thought it was corny and even more backwards for the state of comic book movies than anything else.The acting was good when it came to Robert Downey Jr. He was the only reason I had any respect for this film at all. It lifted the movie up from garbage to mediocrity. Terrence Howard who I am not fan of was very annoying to me and Jeff Bridges was about as under utilized with his abilities as he has ever been.The directing was below average in that the action seems were un-satisfying and the film failed to engross me whatsoever. I tried very hard to get involved in the movie but the movie just felt like it was dragging on and it only got worse. The conclusion was bad and the supposed great writing was non-existent in my mind. The effects were very good but I was not put into awe by them.I obviously did not enjoy this film but if you are a die hard comic book fan you probably will enjoy this. If you are a movie fan though and are looking for something different in a comic book movie watch The Dark Knight not Iron Man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw how many people rated this pile of crap higher than 3 stars. This has to be the poorest comic book adaptation I've seen since the '70s Captain America, and that one was actually faithful to the source material. After reading a few comments by those persuaded of this being nothing short than the second coming of Christ, I stumbled on a reviewer that praised the movie for its limited use of CGI. Limited? Sure and I assume last summer's Transformers was shot with full scale models animated via stop motion! Anyways let's skip to the review.Acting: None of the characters ever felt real at any point in the film. All of the actors just seemed to go along with the lackluster plot for the sake of their paycheck. I don't blame them though for they didn't really have much to work on in the first place, which takes us to...The Story: Now I am wondering: was anyone actually paid to "craft" it or did the producers resort to their dyslexic monkeys writing team once again? Because if realism was what they were aiming for then they pretty much missed the target here. And speaking of it, am I the only one who's sick and tired of this trend of putting super heroes into the "real world" and having them fight off Islamic terrorists? I mean, was it so hard to have Iron Man squaring it off against one of its arch-nemesis like the Mandarin?The Action: Or should I say "lack there of"? Seriously whoever goes in the theater expecting to be entertained will be harshly disappointed, 'cause even though the CGI may be appealing and well executed there hardly are more than 5 action sequences in the whole movie (suit testing and final battle included)! The only thing that it's worth to mention is the robotic arm that Tony Stark keeps in his basement, for in its scarce screen time, that little articulated mechanical limb succeeds in conveying more personality and genuine emotions than the whole human cast does (or not) in about 2 hours! That cute little fella should be given an award for its performance.Is there anything else to say? Yes, but I think it's been amply covered by the other realistic reviewers (i.e. those who rated this 4 stars and less). And yet I'm puzzled: has mediocrity really replaced the standards for excellence in the mind of the public? Doesn't anyone remember the quality of movies of yesteryear? No need to go back that much; let's take 1984's Ghostbusters as an example: funny movie, great SFX that still look good by today's standards and an engaging story which sucks you in as soon as you suspend disbelief. Please, tell me what was wrong with that! What did we do to deserve to be punished with such an awful mass of sub par, over-hyped, crappy and amateurish assembled images that Hollywood dares calling movies?!To end this review, I can only say I'm glad I didn't pay for it and I feel for all those who were tricked into spending their cash on it.

		<fullReview>I wrote some political interpretations about this film. The whole text is here in my blogspot blog sceneinpolitics. It's far fetched, but I thought it would be fun to do. Here's a part of text:There is a lot of different political toposes and lot of different ways to analyze this film, but I will raise up couple of ideas that seems interesting for me. First is the films admiration of technology. It follows through every aspect of the movie: lets face it, Tony Stark or iron manis nothing without all that fancy gadgets and fire power. The people who achieves their goals are people with technology. Especially iron man: because he has superior technology, he can not be beaten. Iron man depicts technology as the reason for success and people without technology can't achieve as much. Technology is seen as a resource for power.But the movie doesn't only see technology as positive. Technology can make its users as dependent for it. Tony Stark literally can't live without technology: his body functions because of that weird shining light (shining light can be seen symbolizing life power and goodness: think about how for examples angels are usually imagined).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is one of the only superheros I can find myself completely loving and admiring, up there only with Peter Parker. Few characters, in my opinions, are as interesting as their superheros, and as far as film-portrayals go, Tony Stark and Peter Parker have been treated with excellence and respect. Christopher Nolan's Batman series was a monstrous success, but I didn't find myself caring much for Bruce Wayne as a person. I saw him as more than a shell, but had no real passionate, human connection with him that would seem like a personal relationship. It's not a fault of Nolan's filmmaking or actor Christian Bale himself, I just didn't find much personal investment with Wayne.Parker and Stark bring a more recognizable, forceful energy to their legacies. Parker's charming geekiness, naivety, and understandable anguish during his time as Spider-Man provided me with total joy and excitement. In contrast, Stark brings a different energy to the table, a collective, narcissistic one that I usually loathe. And yet Robert Downey Jr. Makes no missteps as playing this kind of cocky, self-indulgent character. He comes off as a force of total energy, making his cockiness actually kind of charming and elegant.Downey Jr. is a big part at why Jon Favreau's Iron Man is such a big success. I always look at superhero epics as character studies before special effect showcases, which some may find to be irrelevant and rather expecting of me. The way I see it, if you plan to make a film based on a specific hero, you are required to give back story, character development, insight, and a reason for the viewer to care about him and hope for him to succeed. Favreau does this and more as Iron Man is one of the best superhero films of the new decade, exciting, perilous, uncompromising, and simply a joyous experience.The film concerns Stark's rise from astronomically intelligent philanthropist/playboy persona to a crime-fighting, high-flying superman in an enormous, full-body iron-suit. There's also explicit detail in the relationships of Stark's life, one being Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts, his highly-competent assistant, and Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane, his business partner. There's an equal balance between character relations and satisfying action, and neither plod along or become unearthly long. Favreau is smart about his placement and vision; Iron Man is shot and conducted on a grandiose scale, uncompromising in its clarity and visually arresting in its imagery. One of the most common things I see in superhero epics is their hunger for enormous sequences and their struggle to achieve that. Here, the film simply doesn't know how to fail and that's a huge strength.Several scenes show the complexity of Stark's mentally draining process to become Iron Man. Stark's energy very much comes out here, especially when he's faced with criticism from people like Pepper and Obadiah. His unfathomable intelligence and cocky exterior makes up for a somewhat present feeling of inferiority. It subtly seems that Stark uses defense mechanisms such as cockiness to make up for feelings that he may not live up to the expectations brought forth by his father.Yet this is not a pity story or a disposable action film. This is a promising picture, with mesmerizing action sequences, plotpoints that deserve your investment, characters that earn their business to be liked, and a film that deserves a viewing on your part. Iron Man hardly ever missteps; it's as dynamic and as confident as its title character.Starring: Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jeff Bridges. Directed by: Jon Favreau.</fullReview>

As Stark is a brilliant genius but also really arrogant and does not care about his being smart. As he goes to Afghan to help the military sell off his own equipment.Only to get caught and wounded. He is then captured and tortured into building stuff for the enemies. But that is when his life changes forever and he builds armour with the help of a new friend also captured, who lost his own family.As he helps kick butt but it changes his life forever! As he is approached when he gets back to the USA and gets approached by SHIELD agent Phil Coulson to help them fight crime.While trying to get and test out the right kind of armour. As it takes a few tries and he manages to ruin his own cars in the process and mansion. But really it begins to work in his favor! He later is shocked when his mentor, played by Jeff Bridges in a rare villainous role, is helping out the enemies in Afghan actually with his own Iron Man armour.He must face his second in command and mentor in a good vs evil showdown.Downey Jr and Gwyneth Paltrow as his second in command in the office and potential love interest have good chemistry as Paltrow is the perfect "straight man" to Downey Jr's antics.Great for the comic book fans and even non comic book fans like myself to see a great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW! Iron Man. This was great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I might get clobbered for saying this . . . .but, I liked "Iron Man" better than "The Dark Knight" This movie had everything that you want. Great cast, Great Story, Great Special Effects, Good Humor, Lots of Action, A Love Story, and betrayal, and a good musical score. What more do you want from a movie. This had it all.Its the Story of Tony Stark and how he becomes Iron Man. He's rich, He's immature, and he's a genius. The movie does a very good job of showing Tony Stark evolve into a more mature man as he finds new purpose in his life following a capture in the Afghanistan Desert. The movie does a brilliant job at bringing both his struggles as he becomes a better person, and his battles with evil, and the betrayal of his own company's CEO who becomes the villain. Great, Absolutely great. I loved this movie. All of the actors were perfect for their roles. I wish they all could be this good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offers great entertainment value but the final act of the film destroys an otherwise great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often considered one of the best Marvel films and all round, one of the greatest superhero films alongside Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight, Iron Man is a much talked about film being released back in 2008. I myself have never seen Iron Man until just today and well?.The story to Iron Man is very similar to that of Batman Begins. The film starts off by fleshing out our main character through a series of flashbacks, which to my money, is the highlight of the film and easily, its strongest part. Through these flashbacks, billionaire owner of Stark Industries realizes that he has the potential to help the world and be a protector by building his own suit.Is this story line familiar? Well, yeah! Despite an ordinary story line, the film is directed stylishly if one may say so. It does most certainly have some great moments and is visually impressive and offers some great entertainment. Structurally, very similar to Nolan's 2005 film, Batman Begins, Iron Man is a typical superhero flick that dwells deep into the character of Tony Stark during the first twenty minutes but soon falls apart in a certain way. Possibly matching the first half hour of Batman Begins, this film then really introduces us more to Stark's real personality. Despite losing some of the best moments, and losing any real desperation and emotion, Iron Man then plays along well by a great mix of humour and seriousness. Thankfully, the tone to the film is not upsetted nor unbalanced by two opposing tones.The biggest strength to the film is easily the first twenty minutes but the final confrontation of the film is quite ridiculous, in my opinion. Best described as a goofy confrontation from say, 'Superman' and 'Superman II', the film truly falls apart in the final act from what may otherwise have been a truly phenomenal film that could match the superhero brilliance that the Dark Knight is.Christopher Nolan's Batman films have something very strong about them and that is the villain in each film, who has a real goal that he strives for. Whilst Ra's Al Ghul challenged Bruce emotionally, the Joker did strategically and Bane did physically but the villain in this film, whose name I will not spoil, doesn't seem to have any real urge. Whilst the Joker recited "That's what happens when an immovable object meets an unstoppable force", the villain in this film recites extremely corny one liners and various lines similar to this, "Don't worry. I upgraded my suit!" This would work well in a Superman film, which knows itself as corny but here, in a movie that despite having humor, takes itself seriously, the final act cannot be taken seriously but more of a joke and thus, ruins that proportion of the film and brings it down to a good film, and only a good film.Iron Man may be visually appealing and certain immersive early on but a weak final act and an extremely weak villain make this, still a fun and entertaining film, but a bit of a disappointment. That being said, it's a movie that is most definitely worth a watch for superhero fans and action lovers. I can only hope that Iron Man 3 improves upon these weaknesses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it came out in 2008 and i loved it so much, i loved all the characters and I felt protective over the main character (Tony Stark). I could really see it as being believable as it was so intense with life making decisions. the computer graphics were absolutely amazing and the fight choreography, general choreography and role play was excellent. the choice of actors/actresses were perfect for the movie and that really helped bring them more to life. the story and script were astonishingly put together and well related to each character from MARVEL Comics. Overall this is a fantastic movie and i recommend this to any one who is a MARVEL or Iron Man fan of the comics and series. The director Jon Faveau pieced the cast and crew together and played as a key character really well. All aspects of the movie are amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Superhero Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is a superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Directed by Jon Favreau, the film stars Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark, an industrialist and master engineer who builds a powered exoskeleton and becomes the technologically advanced superhero Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his personal assistant Pepper Potts, Terrence Howard plays military liaison James Rhodes, and Jeff Bridges plays Stark Industries executive Obadiah Stane.Tony Stark is a wealthy philanthropist.In addition to being filthy rich, billionaire industrialist he is also a genius inventor. When Stark is kidnapped and forced to build a diabolical weapon, he instead uses his intelligence and ingenuity to construct an indestructible suit of armor and escape his captors. Once free, Stark discovers a deadly conspiracy that could destabilize the entire globe, and dons his powerful new suit on a mission to stop the villains and save the world. Jim "Rhodey" Rhodes, one of Stark's colleagues, whose military background leads him to help in the formation of the suit. This is an appealing superhero movie. It's also clunky. It's welded together out of disparate pieces that clank and ping. Though at times it's leaden, Iron Man also has enough moments of pizazz to intermittently soar.Robert Downey Jr. gives a nicely sardonic performance as Tony Stark, a rich playboy and the brilliant heir to his father's weapons manufacturing dynasty.He powers the lift-off separating this from most other superhero movies.Overall,this is one smart, high impact superhero movie one that even non-comics fans can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a couple of almost-flops by Marvel Studios, I was worried that this film would not be as good as the X-Men Franchise or the Spider-Man Franchise. But that is all it was, worry. From the very first scene, I was convinced that Robert Downey JR was Tony Stark.This being set in a decade far from the Vietnam War years where Iron Man had his birth, they altered the origin story just enough to fit into the 2008 time-frame of this film. That, and the emergence of Computer Technology that he Original stories did not have access to. Other than those slight changes, this film chronicles the Origin of Iron Man in almost the same way the original comic book stories had been written.Rather than being captured by Vietnamese, Stark is caught by a group called "The Ten Rings" - Which refers to Iron Man's ultimate nemesis, The Mandarin. And although he does not appear in this film, we do feel his presence hidden deep in the story.Faran Tahir (The Captain of "The USS Kelvin" from 2009's "Star Trek") is Raza, one of the Mandarin's Hands who has been collecting Stark's weapons in the Middle East. Shaun Taub is "Yinsen"-A Kind man from the city of Gulmira, who has saved Stark from that piece of Shrapnel hanging poised to enter his heart.Just as in the Comic, Stark uses his own weapons to build the first Iron Man suit and he kicks his captor's arses, and the way this was filmed, was that the director Jon Favreau re-created some of the most notable frames and poses from that first Origin Story.What makes this film remarkable, is the perfect marriage of CGI and Practical effects. This was done so well, that it is impossible to tell where the elements actually switch.Even Stark's Malibu Home is a CGI creation, but as Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb) looks out toward the ocean from Stark's home, the CGI aspects of the shot are totally invisible.Jeff Bridges is Jeremiah Stane, who has an agenda that we only learn about toward the end of the film. Terence Howard created "Rhody" who would later become War Machine. This role was taken over by Don Cheadle in Iron Man II and he played it as Terence had laid down.Favreau had to put over 30 years of Iron Man into a two-hour movie, choosing just what to include must have been difficult. This film ends with an epic fight between Iron Man and WarMonger, something which happens much later in the comic book stories.Stark's Butler "Jarvis" is actually an A.I. built into his home, this is another difference between the classic comics and this film.The main tension is between Stark and "Pepper Potts" (Gwyneth Paltrow). This is also the first appearance of "Agent Coulson" (Clark Gregg), a SHIELD agent who appears in several more of these Movies. Favreau himself plays "Happy Hogan," Stark's Chauffeur.And all trough this film are little hints that The Avengers are going to Assemble, soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is the Batman Begins of the Marvel universe. It shows the origins of a great superhero, done by a very good director, a fantastic actor in the title role and pretty good writers. I loved the part, when Tony Stark was in the cave building the MK I armor and then escaping with it, I also enjoyed the stuck-up character of Stark and the way Robert Downey Jr. portrayed him. I don't know if Tony had the electro-magnet in his chest in the comics as well, but I really liked the idea.This movie is the first that leads up to The Avengers and at that it's great, because, unlike Captain America, it totally stands on its own and it doesn't keep reminding you that it's a prequel, other than the obvious post-credits scene. On the other hand, I don't know which one was first, but Iron Man kept reminding me of Batman. A lot. Tony Stark is a rich playboy, Bruce Wayne as well. They both live through a tragic experience and thus decide to become superheroes. With their money and brain they create their suit and ultra high-tech gadgets to fight terrorism/crime. Pepper Potts+J.A.R.V.I.S.=Alfred Pennyworth, Rhodey=Robin+Gordon. Just sayin'.The movie is highly enjoyable, a great fun, packed with action and also some laughs. Ramin Djawadi (one of my favorite composers) did a fantastic job in scoring, Jon Favreau's directing was great and JEFF BRIDGES! was a kick-ass super-villain. I recommend it to anyone who likes superheroes, but those too, who just love an entertaining action movie. Maybe they'll learn to like them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel goes nuclear!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Marvel Studio film entirely produced in-house had a lot riding on its shoulders. The possibility of creating a new franchise beyond the co-production of the X-Men films, the Blade films as well as introducing another 'layer' of superheroes beyond the big three (Batman, Spiderman, Superman). Initially, when news reached me of the original story being updated and set in contemporary times instead of the Vietnam setting of the comics, I assumed this was the first of many rusty nails that would make Iron Man a failure.Luckily I was proved extremely wrong. The film instantly grips your short and curlies (as they are fondly known) and doesn't let go until end credits. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man was a masterstroke of casting, he brings the perfect amount of arrogance and unpleasantness balanced with the change in attitude and character that being Iron Man brings. Opposite Downey Jr. is the frankly stunning Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, a fantastic character with enough depth and drive to make him more than Downey Jr's equal. Much like Loki in Thor and Avengers Assemble, Marvel knows that the secret success to any good superhero film is the villain and they have the material to select the very best and bring them into a real world setting successfully.I say real world rather than comic because director Jon Favreau goes to extraordinary lengths to give the film a realistic setting, even the idea of creating an Iron Man comes naturally to Tony Stark given the situation he finds himself in and the actual building and refinement of the Iron Man suit is built on a bed of science and extremely realistic. It is a joy to watch Tony Stark build his suit and even peripheral machines and AI are given playful and entertaining personality with very little effort. This film had a lot resting on its shoulders and it more than succeeded, spawning a direct sequel in 2010 and a third being filmed soon for release next year as well as the runaway success of Avengers Assemble. Marvel hit the jackpot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sow, now that we're on the time that The Avengers is released, I decided to review all the movies with the super-hero characters that will all be mashed up in the The Avengers. Iron Man is without doubts a modern classic, Robert Downey Jr. was perfect for this role, the directing was great and script, oh my, the script was absolute genius, they wrote an amazing script that doesn't have those typical clichés that a superhero movie has, this one was about a guy that instead of being bitten or drinking a liquid, he just created his own suit, and that man is a rich guy who loves to invent, party, money and girls, how awesome is that? Sow, if Iron Man is this awesome and I was able to watch it thousands of times, than The Avengers will be terrific.====Iron Man====Overall, Iron Man is a highly recommended movie, I loved it and it's one of my favorite movies, it's a visual effects feast, it's full of terrific action scenes, it's very well-acted by everyone in the cast (Downey, Paltrow, Bridges, Howard). I'll never forget this movie that is highly entertaining, full of action and it has a great dose of humor (mostly) because of Downey, who was just remarkable playing Tony Stark. One of the best movies I've ever seen and one of the five best superhero movies I've ever seen. Couldn't be 1% better, for one simple reason, it's 100% good.10/10</fullReview>

The characters are believable, Gwyneth Paltrow is back once charming and Robert Downey Jr. is for me a class cast (as I said, I know the original comic is not as accurate). The Iron Man armor looks like lace, the whole movie for a second one pays attention to what real armor - which is computer animation. There was even partially, if not Downey Jr. wearing the whole armor adds the rest to motion capture.Here I would be notified that a Part 2 is exceptionally happy times correctly.

		<fullReview>The effects for this movie are ground-breaking. Unlike a lot of recent superhero movies where you can see what is CGI and what's not, the flying sequences, fighting action and explosions all integrate seamlessly and are completely convincing. Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as a rather dissipated 40ish drunk and former whiz kid who still has talent and charisma enough to get by, but needs a purpose. Art imitating life? He gets it when he finds his weapons are being sold to both sides in the current Afghan conflict, and decides to intercede as Iron Man. Downey is his usual likable self and Gwyneth Paltrow plays his girl-Friday-but-not-love-interest secretary with understated style; their relationship is actually charming and credible, a rare thing in action movies. The movie itself strikes a deft balance between shoot-em- up and peacenik sensibilities as the hero strives for peace and justice through superior technology and firepower. This is also rare and welcome in the action movie genre, which tend to perpetuate Reagan-era right- through-might attitudes. Entertaining, smart and very watchable, this movie is highly recommended by me.</fullReview>

Plenty of eye dazzling explosions and clever quips. Acting was good though it seems to me, someone who likes Robert Downey Jr., that he played the ruffly haired, wide eyed part a bit too much. My issues with the film were mostly of the story. Although I do recognize it is a comic book adaptation I found certain parts a little too hard to believe, even for a comic book. A certain military friend of the lead character does some things that I'm pretty sure would get him put in jail in the real world. I feel Iron Man's character was a little one dimensional, with the director attempting to fill his character in by very cliché means. He's a bad boy. Oooh look he listens to alternative rock. He doesn't follow anybody's rules. Yeah I get it. Yeah so a couple parts where I said, "Oh come ON" but it was a good watch, I was excited and clapping for some parts. I think I would have liked it in theatres, it definitely has a big screen movie feel. So while it wouldn't be my first choice in advising on rentals, I wouldn't advise against it either.

		<shortDescription>Not quite as perfect as it is made out to be, but "Iron Man" is a complete and utter blast, and Robert Downey Jr. proves himself again! Great fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jon Favreau's 2008 release "Iron Man" is the first entry in "The Avengers" cinematic universe. (thus far comprised of "Iron Man", "Iron Man 2", "The Incredible Hulk", "Thor" and "Captain America: The First Avenger", with a full-fledged crossover feature coming out this Summer.) And as an introductory films to the saga, it functions quite well as an origin story for one of the main characters- Tony Stark, aka, Iron Man. It is a lot of fun to watch, and has a lot of awe-inspiring action and great humor, with memorable characters, that suffers from a few minor drawbacks that prevent me from giving it a perfect 10.Robert Downey Jr. plays billionaire genius and playboy Tony Stark, owner of Stark Industries, a military contracting company that also dabbles in different fields. When Stark visits Afghanastan to show off the newly developed "Jericho" super-missile, he is captured by a terrorist group called the "Ten Rings", whom want him to build them their own version of the missile for their activities. Stark is gravely injured, and shrapnel from one of his own missiles is wedged in his chest, where it slowly creeps closer and closer to his heart- which will eventually kill him. With the aid of Yinsin, a fellow captive, Stark builds a miniature "Arc Reactor" (a powerful source of energy) that he implants into his chest, attached to an electromagnet, to keep the shrapnel out of his heart. Secretly, while he allegedly works on the missile, he actually builds a suit of armor which he uses to escape in an incredible and explosive escape sequence. Upon getting home, he realizes the error of his ways, and against the wishes of Obediah Stane (Jeff Bridges, his mentor and father figure), he closes down Stark's weapon development devision and secretly builds a newer, faster and more powerful version of the suit that he dons in order to protect innocent lives from evil. He becomes "Iron Man", and must defend the world when he realizes that weapons from Stark Industries, including the dreaded Jericho missile, are being sold under-the-table to groups including the Ten Rings.The film is very much a light-hearted, fun and wild ride. It is full of some outstanding action and very decent effects (though I was never 100% impressed by the CGI used on the Iron Man suit until the sequel, which improved the effects), and has a lot of great characters and plenty of good humor.Downey is a revelation as Stark. He plays the role right on the edge between likable jerk and unlikable playboy. And he balances it perfectly, changing just enough by the end of the film to redeem his earlier, loathsome activities. When we first meet him, he's full of himself, and very much a bragger who sleeps with women nonchalantly and doesn't have respect for anyone else- whereas after his escape, though he's still a bragger and a playboy, he seems to have more respect for his life and that of others, and while remaining the same playful fool in spirit, becomes more responsible.Gwenyth Paltrow plays a good but slightly undeveloped role as Stark's secretary and kind-of, sort-of love interest Pepper Potts. Bridges is fun and intimidating as Stane. Also noticeable is Clark Gregg as Agent Agent Coulson, from SHIELD, an organization which is first hinted at in this film and becomes more prominent in later films. (Don't worry, that's not spoiling anything)The real star of the film is Downey, though, and the incredible suit he builds. A lot of the film is devoted to his development of the suit, and his early missions. And these are the most fun parts of the film. This is where the main problem sets in- the script (written by a team of screenwriters) is far too basic when the plot begins. You will be able to guess every twist and turn, and it moves just like every other Superhero origin movie (like "Spider-Man" and "Batman")- it's all too predictable and familiar.That being said, this is still a solid, fun films. It's got a lot of heart and a lot of incredible action, and it's a blast to watch. I give it a great 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

The idea of the film is excellent, and the idea of a genius hero who is also a careless playboy creates a brilliant contrast to the comics. However, I would have liked to have seen some more armours and characters written into the film such as 'Crimson Dynamo' or 'Hulkbuster Iron Man'. However, I can imagine these characters will be featured in the other instalments of the franchise. The characters in the film were excellent, with Robert Downey Jr giving a star studded performance as tony stark. The CGI was incredible, and only when our hero starts flying I realise the suit is not real. Fans of adventure and action films will enjoy this, and the film is not one of those 'car chases, weapons and bikini babes' sort of films. The whole family will enjoy the film, and even the girls can sit down with the boys have a jolly good time with this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK as some may know I'm not a fan of the sequel to this film but I adore the original film of Iron Man. Yes before you continue to read I will be just kissing this movies ass this is just a warning. So Iron Man is not my personal favorite superhero but he is one of the most interesting. I see him as Marvels Batman but less moody and more fun loving.So the plot is a origins story of Iron Man being I never read to many of the comics I don't know if how he made the suit is exactly like the movie or not and honestly I don't care because I love what they did here. So I am not going to go into the plot too much you got Robert Downey Jr playing as Tony Stark and he is perfect I am honestly yet to see a movie where I dislike him even if I don't care for the movie Robert always gives a stellar performance. Then you have Jeff Bridges who plays Tony's business partner note he is bald so if you have seen this cliché before you know what is going to happen.I used to hate the fact that most of this film was Tony building his suit but the second viewing I did notice how that suit defines the character so him building the suit we see a build in character as well. The thing this movie does great is that is just hints at the Avengers here and there and at the end but it doesn't stop the main story so it can just be like oh heres that movie coming out and yadda yadda.The writing is top notch you suspect it to have some cheesy lines because it was a comic movie and it doesn't. The director Jon Favreau does great and I do want to see him make more then just Iron Man.Overall for those who haven't seen this all two of you buy this film it is just one you will want to own and pull out on a rainy day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Surprised Me!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually hate Superhero movies, most of the times for the same reason: they don't seem believable. And that's a great thing about Iron Man, it involves only technology, so you'd believe stuff from the movie could happen in 50 or 100 years.The storyline is really well written, too. It begins when Tony Stark, a rich, playboy guy who owns a weapon industry, ends up as a hostage by terrorists using the same weapons he developed. When he manages to escape, he decides to destroy all weapons he created.Another remarkable thing about the movie is the acting, Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow have great chemistry together, and their romance, even though seems as if it was between ten years old kids because of their constant arguments, is really exciting and fun. Robert's character is really likable even though he's a total jerk, you feel as you actually wanted to be him.Well, that's pretty much it, so even if you don't like superhero movies, give this one a try, you might like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best superhero movie besides the dark knight!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been a ton of super hero movies coming out lately and i mean a ton. Im not a big fan of superhero movies usually but this one blew me away. I like it the story line is actullay possible and not just some mutation nonsense. The acting is awesome in this the special effects are great and so is the story line. It is just an all over very enjoyable fun ride.This movie is about very educated,technological mastermind Tony Stark (Downy Jr)who is kipnapped while his convoy is ambushed overseas. The terrorists take him to a cave and make him build his world famous Jericho missile. While in captive instead of making the missle he stumbles upon the greatest technological discovery of his career. Using this technology he creates the best weapon of all time and becomes Iron man.This movie is really good. Robert Downy Jr gives the performance of his life, hands down his best movie. The action sequences are intense and the jokes are funny. This is a great movie for anyone who loves comics books or action movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was awesome from start to finish, it was entering, funny, and cool to watch.. I loved how the suit was used and constructed it made the movie that much more better. This kind of reminded me a bit of the dark knight but instead of being dark this was just fun to watch. Not only was this fun to watch it also had a love interest in it as well which worked in the movie because it did not just focus solely on that but it balance it out. This is sheer movie magic to be hold and wowed me at every moment. This movie gave me a rush and is a blockbuster hit that shines very brightly and is a total knockout. Its a total rush and is extremely pulse pounding. Which is why this movie is a real winner in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron-Man. Still the best Marvel movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who has read Iron-Man since his inception in comic-book format, I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this movie. It has managed the leap better than any other comic-book movie I have seen before or since. (Though I was also pleasantly surprised that Thor worked too; just not as well.) While the Hulk (as in the version featuring Ed Norton) had a lot going for it, the decision to mess with the look of his antagonist (The Abomination) was enough to annoy me as a comic purist. As did the immense amount of fiddling on Spider-man, the X-men (both versions now) and The FF.These characters have survived for nearly half a century now, without having to screw with them. It's a shame that the producers of these movies feel they have to change the fundamentals of characters for 'the new viewing' audience.Somehow, though, the way this was dealt with in Iron-Man has made it much less annoying. (Of course it probably also helped that RDJ was cast as Stark. I had been suggesting him as either Tony Stark or Steven Strange for about 10 years prior to the advent of these movies. His characterisation did not disappoint either.) Iron-Man 2, on the other hand, I found did let us down. Too much involvement in Whiplash and not enough in the Rhodey/Stark or War-Machine/Iron-Man relationship. Quite frankly, not enough real action either. This said, Marvel has always thrived on good characterisation of it's villains, so I guess I should reserve criticism on that basis. In my (humble) opinion, this still remains the bast adaptation Marvel have produced thus far. (Obviously, the Dark Knight remains the best that D.C./W.B. have produced.)I'm just glad that I've had the opportunity to see these movies in the first place. Though, I did see them coming back in the early 1980's, and had hoped to be involved in bringing them to the screen at one point. Ho-hum, such is life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, it's a super hero comic book turned movie, so to suspend your disbelieve is a requirement rather than a suggestion. Still, on my third viewing I couldn't ignore the plot holes any longer. I stopped counting after half an hour when it felt that EVERY scene led to a new question mark in my mind (the miracle of Tony Stark who seems to be an iron man even without the suit is just one). And still I love this movie. It's fun, it has the typical super hero mentality (and I loved the comic books), it's flashy and gaudy, has good pacing, a soundtrack that appeals to me, and... it has Robert Downey Jr. The best 3 seconds of the movie are when, during the first test-flight, he has a near miss with the freeway and laughs out in glee. Tony Stark is a crazy fearless genius who celebrates challenge - and life. After Downey's performance, I can't imagine anyone else playing that role. So, suspend your disbelieve on all levels, and enjoy RDJ!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An explosive blockbuster!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superhero movies are often tricky to make. One has to stay true to the actual character, and be careful not to disappoint fans and also give it a wide enough scope to suit larger audiences. They can be cheesy, fake and boring or exciting, realistic and entertaining. Iron Man is definitely the latter.While I was never a fan of the comics (in fact I'd never read them)the movie was brilliant! While some superheroes tend to be a bit fake (Hulk), the concept of Iron Man is completely believable. The story is fast and exciting, same goes for the action sequences. The first appearance of the primitive suit out of the cave is epic, and the rest of the movie flows effortlessly. Throughout the movie, I never missed a point. Beginning to end, I was hooked.But the best part, the acting of Robert Downey Jr. Downey plays the part of Tony Stark perfectly, a charismatic, quick-witted millionaire playboy...He makes it seem effortless, using his trademark humor and his natural charm to make a good movie, become great!Full of good humor and amazing action, Iron Man is the ultimate superhero movie and is just as good in the genres of action and science- fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Otherwise fine and watchable, it does lack1. background research related to Afghanistan 2. Proper casting or, if Mr. Perfect must make it then make-up, costumes and language tutoringPerhaps a third of the film is set in Afghanistan and there is no word in Dari or Farsi. Some of the guys can arguably be Pakis, yet no Pashto. Not even Urdu, just plain Hindi. Hindi? Whyyy? Since when have Indians got to guerrilla camps in Afghanistan?I can admit to the Arabic, yet, the writing (on munition boxes and on the building) is nothing like the Nastaleeq required by the Persian tradition; it was rather plain old Tuluth. But the guys were nothing like Saudi as one would have expected (wahhabi) but looked very Middle Eastern (Palestinians or Lebanese, probably)And why was that guy allegedly speaking Hungarian? A guy with a Muslim cap and long, curly, black hair? Hm!And the scientist knows both Arabic and Hindi; very good for him! But he says he's from Kumira, which is in Bangladesh. He doesn't look Bengali at all. Perhaps high cast Indian, or a forgotten Muslim after the Partition.And Stark says "shesh, besh' when playing backgammon. This is cool! While proper in an Afghan or even Middle Eastern Arab mouth, to have it said by the very American character out of the blue (with no other instances of any foreign language in the film) is ... funny.Finally the refugees - they look more as of they came from Srebenica than Herat. The way women have their scarves tied under their chins is not proper (very Balkanic actually). And, why were there Caucasian looking men pursuing them? Wasn't the 'terrorists' band' supposed to be composed of the 'enemy'?So, when Stark is done with the bad guy, he throws him in the afghan refugees' midst and says, in plain English "he's all yours' - like a regular Afghan would be fluent in English.Then, what language is Obadiah speaking when visiting the camp?And, the music has - sometimes - a sound of tabla, but so hidden that you'd miss it easily. No harmonium? It would have been so easy to find something better!Finally the boy runs and shouts "baba" - the single consistent thing.And the sweet guys responsible for this marvel (sic!)?Is the ethnic localisation so superficial because it is supposed to be seen by people who don't understand?</fullReview>

And it makes sense. You see the weapons you have made in the hands of the terrorists, you don't sit back and philosophise, you bam.It's as simple as that.

		<shortDescription>Considering I am not much of a fan of superhero movies, this one is a success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw this movie last night on DVD. Despite doing exceptionally well at the box office, I just never was that interested in seeing IRON MAN and only watched it after a friend gave me the DVD. In hindsight, I am glad I saw it, but think you should know at the onset that I am not a huge fan of superheros and comic books. This means that the film did manage to win me over but also that I have no knowledge of the story nor do I have the devotion to it that a typical fan might have. Take this for what you will.Since there have been a bazillion reviews for this film already, mine will be rather short and I won't even bother discussing the plot--others have already done this very well. Instead, let's first talk about what I liked. The film was very slickly made and I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of the film. The Iron Man character and how he came to be was original. Also, I was thrilled that Gwynneth Paltrow's character was NOT like the one she played in SKY CAPTAIN (uggh)--having a tiny bit more depth and not behaving as stupidly. Robert Downey was very good as a world-weary jerk who grows as a result of his near death. What I didn't particularly like was Jeff Bridge's character--it just wasn't interesting and Bridges seemed awfully one-dimensional. Additionally, while I am sure fans loved the final portion of the film, it was a let down for me because it was all action. The previous 3/4 of the film was bolstered by good writing and dialog, but the end was all special effects. Still, I must admit that they were very, very good special effects.Final verdict--A very good comic book film but not quite as well made or as interesting as THE DARK KNIGHT.FYI--The character "Pepper Potts" appears to be a homage to the ladies played by the Monty Python actors in their series. Series regular, Graham Chapman, coined the term "Pepperpot" to refer to these dowdy and severely unattractive middle-aged "ladies".UPDATE 7/2010--I just re-saw this film and the second time I was even more impressed with it. Robert Downey's great performance, the terrific soundtrack and the wonderful plot--it's simply an amazing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Computer Animation &amp; Stan Lee- A Modern Marriage Made in Heaven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stan Lee &amp; his comic character creations are a marriage made in movie heaven. The success of the Spider Man series has proved this. This is the latest creation from Stan Lees characters of Marvel Comics. It is an entertaining film.Genius Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the successful CIO of the Stark Industries, a weapon company founded by his father. His second in command is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who worked with his father, and his loyal and professional secretary is Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who has a crush on Tony. While in Afghnistan to demonstrate the ultimate Jericho missile developed by his company, his military convoy is attacked and Tony is seriously wounded on his chest and kidnapped by a group of rebels that wants him to assemble a missile for their use. Tony stays with his abductors for three months and develops a powerful metallic armor to escape from the cave where he is arrested. He decides to stop manufacturing weapons in his company under the protest of Obadiah, and dedicates his time to improve the armor, manufacturing it with gold and titanium and installing a propulsion system to fly. However, Pepper discovers that Tony was betrayed by Obadiah, who is using Tony's data to build prototype armor for him, transforming it in the ultimate weapon.There are some sparks between Paltrow &amp; Downey Junior which can be developed. This is not as strong an entry as the Spiderman series yet because it falls a little short on story. This is because these script writers just wrote their first script with Lee's material. Maybe with more development and the next sequel which is sure to be coming, it will get stronger. There are a lot of good things here though.It appears that casting of Starks &amp; Pepper are right to carry this series on. I am wondering when &amp; if they are going to try to bring Thor, the God of Thunder, another of Lees characters to the screen. That shall be a major challenge. With a stronger story line &amp; more development between Stark &amp; Pepper, this can become as strong as the Spiderman series. Stan Lees material being brought to the big screen is becoming a blessing to modern film viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The superhero fad rolls on. Many were predicting that the comic-inspired flicks would burn out with Iron Man, but the wise decision to cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead put paid to that theory. At this juncture in history, the man can do no wrong.The story is so familiar as to be a side-issue. Arms manufacturer Tony Stark has an epiphany after being taken hostage in Afghanistan. This brings him into conflict with company bigwig Jeff Bridges, whose bald pate is strangely if crudely menacing. Yes, it is another tale of "You were like a father to me, but you've betrayed me," a la Minority Report, Mission Impossible, LA Confidential... But the obviousness of the plot is done in a nudge-wink style, as if to say "Sit back and enjoy the action sequences and Downey riffing off in his own inimitable style." And there is a lot to enjoy. Downey lights up every scene he is in. He is funny, intense, sardonic, passionate... The chemistry with Paltrow works extremely well, as does the homo-erotic undertone to Downey's relationship with Terence Davies. No doubt those two will get to scratch each other's eyes out in a sequel.I'm not sure the franchise has the legs of a Spiderman or Batman, but the initial outing is a fun ride if you are in the mood for light fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Stark, billionaire American industrialist, is kidnapped by terrorists whilst demonstrating Stark Enterprises' newest missile system in Afghanistan. The terrorists force Stark to build them one of his weapons. Instead, he builds a giant armoured suit and escapes. Flying over the desert, the suit malfunctions, and Stark crashes. He wanders around for a bit, and is rescued by American troops.Upon returning to America, Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) feels guilty about his company's warmongering, so develops a new version of his suit which he can use to destroy those of his weapons that have fallen into the hands of terrorists.Finally, you might say to yourself, a comic book movie that deals with current political issues. Unfortunately, no. After Stark repents and devotes himself to ridding the world of the evil that he has helped create, we are treated to an hour and a half of Robert Downey Jr. flying around in what amounts to a humanoid racing car.Admittedly, any Hollywood blockbuster that attempts to explore the politics around the "War on Terror" deserves some respect. But I can't help but feel disappointed when a film goes so far toward a critique of US foreign policy, only to pull it back in the final third in favour of the obligatory action-packed climax.Politics aside, Iron Man is entertaining enough. Downey Jr., a controversial choice at first, is well-cast as the billionaire playboy- cum-superhero. (I wonder where they got characterisation?) Rumours that much of the film's dialogue was improvised seem likely, as Stark has all the wise-cracking charisma we're used to from Downey Jr. The problem is, Downey Jr.'s star persona, even in Stark's private moments, never lets any real emotion to the surface. We never get a genuine sense of why a man would throw away his entire life to fly around in a robotic suit.The film tries to use the supporting characters to represent other aspects of American politics, but it can't quite pull that off, either. Colonel Rhodes (Terrence Howard), Stark's best mate, is a by-the-book military pilot, and obviously meant to represent the dilemma the American military finds itself in, forced to fight unnecessary and unwinnable wars. But he does absolutely nothing. And Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane, Stark's business partner and analogue of militaristic capitalism, always seems one step away from holding a white cat and laughing maniacally.Jon Favreau has certainly crafted an entertaining comic book movie. The decision to set Iron Man in California, instead of the otherwise seemingly obligatory New York, does give the film a distinctive feel. It's just a shame that a film that, in its opening scenes, proposes to deal with important political issues, eventually wimps out and descends into the same old blockbuster chicanery. In that respect, summer 2008's other movie event, The Dark Knight, shows us how it's done. Christopher Nolan's film keeps its political viewpoints under its belt, only allowing us a peak when the narrative demands, and so allowing us to make our own interpretations; while Iron Man wears its political heart on its sleeve, and therefore shows the world just how shallow it really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Dialogue. Good CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Genius Industrialist Tony Stark (Downey) decides to give up his selfish playboy ways and help mankind after a life threatening experience. He dons a suit of iron to do this.Okay, now we have another Super Hero from the Comic Books. Let's see who is left: Plastic Man, Mandrake the Magician, Captain America or was that Captain Marvel, Green Lantern, Green Arrow, Wonder Woman (the TV show doesn't count), Aquaman. Yes, I am going back in time as I do not know the names of the newer Super Heroes. Well, we have Superman, but not Superboy. Hmmm??.This movie was okay but there were many things not right with it. First of all the dialogue was truly bad in many places, and attempts at humor didn't quite make it. The dialogue in the scene with Pepper (Paltrow) and Stark where he asks her to remove a copper wire from the electro-magnetic device in his chest (you had to be there) was embarrassing to say the least. For the rest of the movie, it felt like much of the dialogue was dubbed in. Even Terrence Howard's dialogue was bad - he is good, the dialogue given to him is badly written. If the writers were using dialogue from the Comic Book, then they needed to upgrade the verbiage. In a Comic Book, it works, but in a movie not so much. Now, when we have a super hero we see him or her saving someone and the saved person is very happy and thankful to have been saved. Didn't happen here. The occupants of the car that Iron Man does save were truly, hysterically terrified. Hell, I was even cringing. This needed more of the saved people showing more appreciation for having been saved. A few lighter moments like that would have gone a long way to a better review.Robert Downey Jr is quite good and his facial expressions almost made up for some bad dialogue. I looked forward to those expressions. They are really good. But, truth be told his dialogue was better all the way thru. Just his. Just so you know. Jeff Bridges as Stark's partner was good, but again his dialogue needed help. He has a new look with beard, and bald head, but he is still one of the most under-rated actors around. Shaun Taub as Yinsen, the bad guy, was terrific. Paltrow was unaware in this movie, not sure of where her marks were and her demeanor as the "love interest" was lost in translation. Now, what was the "okay" part here? Why the CGI, of course. But, keep in mind even good CGI does not a good movie make. Remember Transformers?Violence: Yes. Sex: Not really. An attempt was made but they fell off the bed. Nudity: No. Language: No and that was a break.Rating: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is cool. It was great that they picked Robert Downey Jr to play the lead. Too often they choose very clean cut bland types and then the super hero movie becomes bland, with no interesting dimensions. That is why Spiderman was so popular as both a comic book and as a movie.The director did a great job of capturing the feeling of the Iron Man comic book series. The cinematography was really good and the scoring fit in just right.Nowadays, with all of the special effects that it requires to make a movie, Iron Man steps up to the plate and still keeps it interesting. Although, like many other cinema devices, computer generated effects will soon overstay its welcome. Audiences will probably again look for "story." Iron Man fulfilled it's promise to telling a good story. But big special effects projects beware - We're getting used to the effects, concentrate on story!I recommend Iron Man and am anxious to see where they go with a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had fairly low expectations for Iron Man. It was fun, looked great but lacked substance.The biggest problem for me was Jeff Bridges/the villain was not developed at all. The following about sums it up: *There was an early scene that quickly shows Robert Downey taking his business back from Bridges.*There's also a scene or two showing Bridges' concern for Downey's wanting to make changes in the business.*Then Bridges turns into a supervillain with a suit like Iron Man's.There was no sense of conflict, threat, or drama. And then finally the CGI-heavy ending is so loud and explosive, I walked out for 5 minutes to get some air and let the chaos wind down a bit. I would not recommend Iron Man to anybody other than superhero movie fans and others looking for a simple, fun time at the movies (or home).Good, not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Robert Downey,Jr is perfect for this film. And he really played it perfectly. I'm so excited to see him again in the Avengers movie.But 1 thing confused me was during the Fight Scene of Stane &amp; Stark in the iron suit; Obadiah Stane told the Ironman this line "FOR THIRTYYEARS I'VE BEEN HOLDING YOU UP. I BUILT YOUR COMPANY FROM NOTHING."Isn't it that during end scene of the HULK movie (starred by EdwardNorton, Liv Tyler &amp; Jeff Bridges), Stane was drinking and telling the bartender to "reload" after each shot of his drink. Suddenly came TonyStark and said he wanted to talk with Stane regarding some military etc, etc.If they met just after the failure of the hulk project, how come did Stane tell Tony Stark that he's been holding him up for 30 years?</fullReview>

Poor Robert Downey Jr.WRONG This movie was the most fun I have had at the theater since Transformers. Excellent &amp; Intelligent special effects, to the point dialogue and story line and best of all...

		<shortDescription>Solid Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with high expectations. With its knack for combining high-powered action sequences with character personality and humor, Marvel as an independent studio should exist for quite a while, at least until it makes Ant-Man.For you action-junkies, you're going to be sorely disappointed. There are action sequences, but this movie refreshingly focuses on the personality behind the steel. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic. He's probably one of the few who could make the lovable arseface character of Tony Stark believable. Much of the humor comes from the spot-on delivery of his lines alone. The other performances do not disappoint, but you will remember Downey's multi-dimensional portrayal long after you forget Terrence Howard is in this movie.The film looks at the origins of Iron Man, who is created out of Tony Stark's encounter with morality after he realizes the weapons that have made him rich are fueling terrorism. While traveling in the Middle East to promote his latest invention, he gets captured by terrorists who want him to create a replica of his latest invention for their own personal use. He escapes with the help of his astounding brilliance and an unlikely ally, and returns home with a need to rid all traces of the empire he's created for the future good of humanity--much to the dismay of his co-workers (played ably by Howard and Jeff Bridges). Said co-workers--one of whom is not what he seems--disagree with Stark on whether weaponry ends do justify means as Stark turns his attentions to a new project to make sure terrorism can never use his brilliance for such atrocities again. This leads to the creation of Iron Man.The script is excellent, something that's usually sub-par in an action movie because filmmakers think special effects can compensate for it. Iron Man isn't as fast paced or Transformers, but the dynamic acting of Jr. and the witty script make the dialogue-heavy scenes interesting. Without so much reliance on action scenes to carry this film, the audience gets to know and relate to every aspect of the characters, much to Iron Man's advantage. Iron Man doesn't forget to blow stuff up, but shows the human behind the iron, which makes a more powerful impact than any missile ever could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all , major tribute to the producers, director, scripter for bringing an epic story on to our big-screens. The secret in all superhero-like movies, is the ability to impregnate "una pelicula" as Italians would say, with the life of the comic books. It is known that a comic book movie is good, if it is transposing a replica of that story, with good scenery, acting, and of course, special FX. Iron Man is such a great mixture of all this , sheds a tear.The actors ... well I barely heard of them &lt; no offense &gt; .I can't seem to remember any particular "famous" movie I've seen them in. That actually was the big surprise, to see remarkable acting from not-so-known Hollywood pieces. Although some characters were "out of the pot", with no base or connections to the script, placed in just to fill the picture, the story was quite catchy, and I must admit I liked it in a "delicious" way. The combined drama / action with humoristic scenes and laugh-coated dialogs were 45% of the success.I enjoyed the movie and I recommend it to all Marvel Comics fans , especially Iron Man fans. I give it a 9 out of 10. Bravo !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>firstly it does in fact live up to a lot of the hype thrown at it. The first half of the film is a little slow but gives us a fairly good insight into the character of Tony Stark.Once we see Iron Man hit the screen its what most fan boys would have wished for, he doesn't look silly. In fact the CGI is pretty damn amazing.The second half of the film is a lot faster and more entertaining.The dialogue is funny and sums up a lot of the characters, there were a few set ups for a sequel which apparently is in the works already. There were some great comic references including the usual cameo by Stan Lee.Robert Downy Jr is amazing as Tony stark, surprised me a little but in a good way, he really fit the role well and showed what I know of Iron Man pretty close to the comics.Also I will say the ending was a little bit of a shock and instantly made me want to watch the second when they make it, best ending of any comic movie, except maybe Batman Begins.Definitely recommend it, they have made a fun film for not only comic fans but normal cinema goers, will be a big hit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Iron Man' is separated from the generic crop of superhero movies in all the best ways possible. 'Iron Man' maintains a tremendous energy throughout its running time and the action scenes are eye-popping. Iron Man's suit literally shines as he zooms across continents and dodges jets. It features an excellent ensemble cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and Terrence Howard. But the person who truly distinguishes 'Iron Man' is Robert Downey Jr., who stars as our fearless hero as Tony Stark who builds the suit from scratch. There is not a single disappointing or slow scene in this movie. This is easily one of the best superhero movies of all time, arguably even the best. Welcome to the fraternity of superheroes, Robert. Expect to stay for quite some time, as 'Iron Man' will inevitably spawn a sequel, if not a trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These days the so-called "Marvel Cinematic Universe" (or MCU for short) is an intricately planned and tightly controlled juggernaut, but back in 2008 it was just an idea. Kicking things off with Iron Man, a heretofore B-list comic book character who had arguably the least name recognition of the main Avengers, was a risky but ultimately shrewd move. But perhaps not as risky, nor as shrewd, as casting Robert Downey Jr. and hiring Jon Favreau to direct.Downey *is* Tony Stark, lifting the movie to another level with his considerable charm. The rest of the cast round out nicely, with the normally shrewish Paltrow at her most likable, Terrance Howard working well against type as the straight-laced Rhodey, and Jeff Bridges looming large over things as the unsurprisingly sinister Obadiah Stane.If it takes a bit too long for Stark to get inside the suit, and if the finale isn't quite as epic as it could've been, I think we can forgive it. There wasn't a template for 'Iron Man'. 'Iron Man' *was* the template.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat over-rated but still a good superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching Iron Man a few years ago and thinking it was reasonably average. Then all this talk recently about Iron Man 3 persuaded me to watch it again. So I did. Although I enjoyed it more this time around, particularly Downey Jr.'s take on Tony Stark, I still can't help feeling it was rather over-rated.What really made the movie sparkle was Tony Stark- his character was unusual for a hero , confident and witty , yet Downey Jr. fits right into the role and it paid off. Jeff Bridges was also a formidable villain although I'm not too crazy about the ending sequence. The story was good , it was innovative, yet always remaining faithful to the original comics. Most importantly it was believable - which is of course the most important feature of the super-hero genre.On the other hand, it never really had me in awe. Sure it was entertaining and pretty cool but there were never any real 'wow' moments , no truly iconic scenes. In this way, it can't really compare to either of the first two spider-man movies , both of which are more memorable - not just as super-hero flicks but as general blockbusters.Iron Man is never short on entertainment , always benefiting from the charisma of Tony Stark and fine action set-pieces. Not by any means marvel's best adaptation, but still worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going back to this movie, it's good but has some serious flaws. The ending was the worse bit, where he was fighting the bad guy in a very technologically advanced killing machine, was about 2- 3 feet away firing machine guns, and rockets and couldn't hit Stark... who was hanging from a support beam. The movie although a comic book movie has a few scenes that are really shy of bright.There was a scene where Stark goes flying like a rocket and lands on his back , destroying his entire suit but isn't harmed. I know it's a movie, but some of the levels of stupidity in this movie have nothing to do with being a movie... it's just bad writing. How can I believe that the villain can't hit a target 2 feet away, even if it were damaged how hard is it to shoot a rocket at a target manually or hit something with a high power machine gun? There were other flaws. Though no super hero movie is perfect that was pretty bad, the ending fight scene of this movie was like something out of Batman and Robin it was so laughably bad.It's mostly a good movie but it's got some weak spots and I give it a 6 out of 10 upon revisiting it.</fullReview>

To see 'tough guy' Faran Tahir in a comedy was also a bonus- he is great as a cold-hearted Abu Dubai bad boy! As always, Terrence Howard is on hand and is just awesome- who is more funny than him? His facial expressions alone deserve comedy awards!!! True this film is not gonna win any awards but who cares?! It has a great supporting cast, all of whom play their parts perfectly! Its is funny, enjoyable and a really good holiday picture. Great for kids, adults, teenagers, whoever!! You're gonna laugh and thats what a comedy is for!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man - Cardboard Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never particularly interested in Iron Man. No special reason, just didn't get the chance to read any of these comics and the character didn't appeal to me that much. Nevertheless, I watched this film expecting to be somehow enlightened about the (possible) dark origins of The Iron Man, and getting a bit of action. The result of my curiosity has been utter disinterest and disgust. Iron Man tells the story of Tony Starks, a weapon dealer, a playboy, a care-free guy with an over-sized ego. After getting kidnapped by a Middle East guerrilla in order to get him to build one of his hi-tech missiles, Tony is able to build a prototype of the exo-suit Iron Man IN A CAVE, FROM SCRATCH, AND BEING Continuously MONITORED BY HIS CAPTORS. That's right, he does this without these Middle East army people suspecting much. Don't ask me how though. The plot continues with more nonsense and your typical bigger than life ego show. Don't expect any war within Tony ala Batman while he struggles with a dark past or something similar. Tony Starks seems to be a shallow human being who loves himself, end of the story. I cannot help but wonder if the people reviewing this film before me actually watched the same flick. "A flawed character that becomes honorable"? He doesn't change much through the film. "Well-delivered script and sufficient plot-twists to keep you engaged"? Honestly, any Gardfiel episode has a much better script and twists. I also read that this won't disappoint Iron Man comic fans. I can only wish that the comics are actually better than this. Otherwise, I pity anybody attached to the misadventures of this fictional individual which biggest concern in life is to spit out a joke every time he opens his mouth. The only good points are the CGI and the action in the second part of the film.</fullReview>

While Robert Downey is not my idea of Tony Stark, he is at least his usual charming self and entertaining whenever he's on-screen. The problem comes whenever he dons the armor suit: it's cartoony and not terribly convincing. The CGI is like something from a video game, and I suppose that's what this movie is targeting: young white males who spend half their lives playing video games and seeking their connection to the big screen. I also am not a big Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but she gives it her best as Pepper Potts, Tony's perky and devoted secretary. This is simply not a film for adults, but then again, what comic book-derived movie is? The character of Iron Man actually is at his best in those endless Marvel Comics cartoons made for TV.</fullReview>

I am also unfamiliar with the comics themselves. So I didn't watch this movie with high expectations, not at all.And still, it bored the hell out of me. Terrorists kidnap the most brilliant weapon manufacturer in the world? He escapes by building a robotic suit instead of the missile the terrorists wanted him to build? And the suit is powered by a battery that he just happened to create while in captivity? Was that the plot of the comic? Because usually even the worst comics have a plot!And then the casting. I like Robert Downey, even if he hasn't acted in anything decent lately. Jeff Bridges? A favourite of mine. Gwyneth Paltrow, yummy! I even like Terrence Howard. And what did they achieve? Absolutely nothing! NOTHING! Not that they played badly, but they just couldn't do anything within the script!What else is there to talk about? The special effects? Some flashy lights and then lots of explosions. Oh, and a flying robotic suit.Bottom line: lousy story to begin with, but scripted even worse. Avoid!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is nothing wrong with The Iron Man, the only problem is there is nothing in it which makes it better or memorable than any other comic come film venture in recent years.The Iron Man has the same formulaic structure of that of other comic adaptations, which one cannot criticize, as it is what such fans expect. However, it does not grip-you, instead it is rather run-of-the-mill fare, with some nice comedic asides and some good special effects.Robert Downey Jnr is obviously the pivotal actor in this film and makes a likable hero in the form of Tony Stark. Indeed, Tony Stark is a a cheeky and affable character but he has no personal intrigue or circumspect attribute which one can associate with Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne. For this very reason it feels like The Iron Man is going through the motions of bringing the story to life rather than trying to capture the audience. The Iron-Man is a pleasant, friendly and harmless picture but this combination does not make engrossing cinema. If you are looking for a film without having to do much work then Iron Man is the right film for you, otherwise I feel you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just.... terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, ignoring a complete lack of respect for the viewer's suspension of disbelief and a few major plot holes, the film was, well, still pretty terrible. To sum it up: if you're going to make a super-hero movie, make a super-hero movie. This seems like its just the back story for the sequel (which I'm sure is due to be thrown at us any moment now). What plot there is seems to have the subtlety of a crow bar and was shoved down the viewer's throat with the care of a run-away train. Tony Stark, our protagonist, is the lovable sap that acts as the face of a weapons company who is blissfully unaware that his products are being used on both sides of the battlefield. It takes a kidnapping for him to figure it out, and he returns blissfully angry as hell, not doubting for a second the other heads of the company until it is, again, spelled out for him. This lovable idiot, although completely inept at common sense (as well as being without the ability to solve simple problems with his hot rod without his computer), manages to design, fabricate, program, and perfect only the most advanced weapons system ever using stock components and he does it in a CAVE. Not to be underdone, when he gets home, he does it again, I suppose, just for the hell of it. Still rightfully angry as hell, he blows up some stuff, enrages his enemies, and blows up some stuff. The movie (and I mean the movie, not the production staff) think that it's so clever in this depart from the traditional superhero storyline that it flat out screams it through several passages with somewhat less than witty dialog.I mentioned the plot holes earlier so here's a few examples so I have two: First, when Tony has his power generator removed from his body, he wants to die rather quickly, although the magnet that this powers doesn't pump blood, it simply keeps shards from moving into his heart which, one can assume, being shards, are not on a death wish, they are inanimate objects that shift over time. Secondly, the character inside each suit is impervious. You can put me in whatever suit you want, if you drop me from a mile onto concrete, I WILL DIE (not limp away with a scratch on my head). The suit is the superhero, not the person.It all boils down to this: Drawn-out narrative, relatively major pot holes, and completely one dimensional characters who make the same faults as EVERY OTHER SUPER HERO VILLAIN EVER.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I am surprised that so many people liked this movie. The movie is not special, the effects are, but to me special effects don't make a movie. I just could not stop thinking about the Imagination Land episode of South Park where they are trying to explain the difference between a story with a plot and a movie with just special effects. The storyline in Iron Man was ridiculous; the main character is very annoying with his tsunami of flat one-liners, he almost looked like a caricature. There was no character development, the moral was cheap (proof that Tony Stark has a heart, come on), the storyline very predictable, Terrence Howard complete unbelievable as a war general and Jeff Bridges as an evil guy who suddenly decides to drive to some terrorist camp in the heart of Afghanistan (that's just a twist, not a plot). Iron Man is a typical movie that was shot with a big budget but suffers from an uncreative director with no sense of humor. The special effects look awesome but the story is sooooooo thin that it ruined the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? This film was brilliant. I'm a sucker for superhero films, but Iron Man was so much more than I expected. First of all, lead man Robert Downey Jr brought so many facets to his role. I was super-impressed. His one-liners were certainly a high-point of this film. And his reformation is, thankfully, believable. It's deep, it's actually something that would change a person like Tony Stark into a humanitarian (kind of). Then was the villain, I believe his name is Razza. I loved his character development. He wasn't just some war-lord. No, he was power hungry. I loved the allusions to Genghis Khan. It made him so believable, especially considering that our world runs on fighting for power these days.Hm, what else? Great decision to modernize the film and set it in a time younger audiences can relate to. Great script, although I think Pepper could have been better. Paltrow did an okay job, but there were a few moments that her character had me rolling my eyes and saying "Wow, this girl is dumb".Overall, and incredible flick. Great graphics (Tony's computer equipment was awesome), and kudos to the machines in his lab who helped to provide a great amount of comic relief to this film. Not to mention the killer soundtrack. Brilliant. Loved it.</fullReview>

Soon after would his convoy is ambushed by a group of terrorists using his own companies weapons. Although he is fatally injured the terrorist group has a doctor who performs revolutionary pacemaker surgery to keep him alive and prevent shrapnel from shredding Jack's heart. They have kept him alive in order to get Jack Stark to build new missile weapons for them. Instead he build the prototype Iron Man suit. From this point I was getting Deja-vu for the "ROBOCOP" film. In the Iron Man suit Jack makes his escape and gets rescued and returned to his great empire at home. Here we see his assistant Pepper Potts, the newly and obviously surgically modified transformed Gwyneth Paltrow, assisting him with his most personal chores such as seeing off young sexy reporter groupies and performing Heart pace maker surgery. Jack eventually discovers via the same sexy groupie reporter that his late father's former partner and major shareholder , Obadia Stone ( Jeff Bridges) is selling STARK weapons to enemies of the USA in Afghanistan and that he ordered Jack's murder in Afghanistan in order to take over STARK which makes you wonder why he let him survive in the first place. There are some great visual effects in this film but the final showdown is a copy of "ROBOCOP" even in the way Jack Starks IRONMAN defeats the much more powerful and larger Obadia Stone's IRON MAN. Like Transformers this film has little to offer except flash special effects scenes which getting a bit passe every time they are used in this way.I am giving it two stars for its entertainment value for young teenagers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said? Iron Man rocks. Plain and simple. If you have not seen this movie you should kick yourself five times and run to the theater, ignoring the pain in your buttocks. I'm sure you know the story by now; billionaire inventor Tony Stark is kidnapped by terrorists while demonstrating his latest weapon thingy. The terrorists demand that they build this weapon for them to use. He "agrees" so long as they provide him with materials. While there he enlists the help of a scientist named Yinsen* who helps him to build not a missile, but an armed and bulletproof mech-suit. Stark escapes, destroying all of the weapons the terrorists stole, and has a change of heart. He decides that his company, Stark Enterprises, will no longer manufacture weapons, and instead, focus on humanitarian research. This doesn't sit well with his business partner, Obidiah Stane, who seeks to get rid of Stark so he can run the company, and use the technology for his own maniacal deeds. Yes, Stane is the villain. The next half hour or so is devoted to Stark building and trying out new versions of his armor, so that he can carry out his desire to do something more with his life. Ironic that he uses the most sophisticated weapon in the world for this. Eventually, we learn that Stane is utilizing the original Iron Man suit to build his own version.* I don't want to spoil too much, so you'll have to see the movie to find out how it all goes down. The first thing I have to comment on is the casting. All of the actors fit into their roles in ways that transcend the normal superhero movie. Especially with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. Downey brings a smugness and a sincerness to the role that I don't think many actor could have pulled off its like Ron Pearlman as Hellboy, you can't imagine anyone else doing it. The story is also top notch, allowing the audience to get to know the characters while telling a narrative that is simplistic, yet deep. This story is executed very well, thanks to director Jon Favreau. Faverau's work spans several genres, from the comedy "Swingers" to the Christmas film "Elf" to family adventure movie "Zathura." This tendency to lean to the more family-friendly or comical, left me to wonder how Favreau would pull the movie off. I'm glad to say, he did it wonderfully. His style has a realistic yet fantastical quality that other directors, who choose one or the other, lack. It is this willingness to blend the real with the unreal that makes Favreau perfect for adapting the Marvel comics. The effects? Breathtaking. You'll find yourself literally drooling over scenes of Iron Man flying and fighting terrorists or Iron Manger. Some have said that the end battle resembles "Transformers." Well, of course! It's essentially two robots fighting in a city, how could it not look like "Transformers?" Is the movie perfect? No, but then again, no movie is. At times, there can be lapses in logic, but for the most part all the technology is kept close to real life. Also, there is one instance of Jeff Bridges, as Obidiah Stane, yelling, and at that point, he kind of turns into William Shatner. These complaints are relatively minor, and overall, this film is very enjoyable. Of course, no newspaper review is complete without a bad pun, but the only one I can think of at the moment is; it kicks brass. Ignore any nay-sayers, and watch "Iron Man." "Iron Man" gets Five Godzillas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally Something to Rave About</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very skeptical when I purchased my 'senior' discount ticket. I mean, Robert Downey, Jr. as an action hero? Was this going to be another two hours of special effects and endless explosions, fights and chases? Much to my delight I found a well acted, directed, edited and written film. "Iron Man" is by far the best movie I've seen in at least two years. It had everything. A story line! An absolutely stunning Gwyneth Paltrow. An Jeff Bridges without his trademark mane of long, greasy, dirty hair. I'll say a little prayer that Downey stays off the booze and drugs as the clever ending surely implies sequels. Bravo to the whole crew for a rare cinema surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie changed the way i watch Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could not believe my eyes as i watched Iron Man on May 2nd, It was the best movie i have seen (besides Transformers). I think Robert Downey Jr. was perfect for Iron Man, I could really see he wanted this role. He was perfect for Iron Man like Tobey Maguire was perfect for Spider-Man. I would recommend this film to anyone. It really is a good movie. I only wish they did not end it so soon. The balance of Action, Comedy, and Drama was absolutely perfect. I think Jon Favreau was the perfect director for Iron Man, I also loved the cameo that Stan Lee made as Hugh Hefner. I think this movie also had great comedy too, It was not supposed to be a funny movie but surprisingly it was. So all in all this movie rocked my world. I give it a 10 out of 10, I would give it an Infinity out of 10 if i could. The game is also good. So if you love Movies, than Iron Man is The perfect film for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never read the Iron Man comics, so was extremely pleasantly surprised at the plot, acting, direction (not in Afghanistan? Wah?) The only thing I didn't like was the sound track was not memorable. But it was so unexpectedly pleasurable and satisfying, I'll wait a couple of weeks and see it again as I'm sure I missed a lot of the stunning special effects which had to be extremely cleverly constructed or used an unimaginable amount of computer memory.I really want to see a "Making of" because I want to know HOW DID THEY DO THAT?

		<fullReview>Iron Man rocks!!! If you didn't watch it yet, you're wasting your time, go and watch it now, and if you have already watched it, watch it again!I wasn't expecting this to be the great movie it is... I didn't expect it to be that success... And I really didn't expect it to be rated in IMDb's Top 250. But when I saw it I knew I was wrong.Iron Man showed me that simple stories can become great movies. We have a very nice script, we have huge actors(by the way, all the four main actors have been at least once nominated for an Oscar) , we have life lessons, we have great characters and so on... What else would we want in a very nice film?Robert Downey Jr. brought us one of the most captivating characters of all time: ladies' man, funny and who after some happenings get responsible for his acts. Gwyneth Paltrow is so beautiful and cute as Potts. Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard made also great jobs.Jon Favreau was the great surprise. After Elf and Zathura we couldn't expect too much, but now, I see that if he has a good script on his hands he can do wonders like he did in Iron Man.With a nice and rocking soundtrack, visual effects that could be better in my opinion(but it doesn't spoil the movie), a perfect script, wonderful shots and so on, here is one of the greatest movie of all time, which is worth to watch, and to have it on DVD.I hopefully wait for a sequel, with all the original cast and crew, so that Iron Man 2 can be as perfect as the original one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Long Back Story Here.... But I'm Excited for the Sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew the old comic book character of Iron Man, but I was not at all that familiar with the back story. This movie is a complete history of the origins of Iron Man. All you need to know about Tony Stark the man in the first few minutes. Then they went into extensive details on how he developed and perfected Iron Man. It was this part that dragged a bit for me. I just felt this went on a little too long. This protracted phase of the movie makes it NOT kid-friendly.The production design was excellent. It was great to see the prototypes of the Iron Man costume before he decided on the final sleek look with the red metal. Stark's cliff-side house and sports cars looked great, and of course, his assistant Pepper Potts (an uncharacteristic yet memorable comeback by Gwyneth Paltrow) and his other girlfriends also looked great.I was a skeptic when I first found out that Robert Downey Jr. would be playing Tony Stark, aka Iron Man. He just did not fit the superhero type, nor the millionaire genius playboy type of Stark. Contrary to popular sentiment, even after I watched, I still found it hard to accept Downey in this character in most of the film. The last scene, though, in the press conference, was a scene that somehow seems only a character like Robert Downey Jr. can pull off. I loved that scene and made me optimistic about the sequel.As for Jeff Bridges, it was great to see him back in great form and looking so different. Debit is that you can see right through him from the start even if you did not have any background of the storyline in the comics. His character Obadiah Stane was very transparent and shallowly written.Nevertheless, the flying and fighting action sequences were breathtakingly shot and very exciting to watch. They were all fast-paced and realistic. The CGI was not obviously evident. I felt though, that the finale battle with his rival giant robot Iron Monger seemed so anti-climactic. His final victory was quite unconvincing because Iron Man even had to ask for Pepper's help. Huh??? Overall it is a good enough movie, especially for a first in an apparently planned series. They had to spend a lot of time establish the character first in this installment, OK understood. Hopefully the sequel can give us more of the action we seek, since the back story is out of the way. Can't wait for the next one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can honestly say that this is the best movie i have seen in a long time. Their was a good mix of everything, good acting, good effects, good directing, i cant find one flaw.If you compare Ironman to some of the other comic books turned movies(Incredible Hulk, Spiderman etc..) I would have to say that Ironman was done the best by far. All of the others use to much special effects it gets to bogus, Ironman keeps it simple and in this case, it works.One of the many good things about the movie, is it gives you a little background info so even if you haven't read the comics you can still follow the story line just fine.Acting wise, id say all of the actors did a pretty decent job, Robert Downey Jr.(Tony Stark), was the cocky, entrepreneur that stark is supposed to be. Gwenyth Paltrow portrayed Pepper Potts excellently, and frankly, all the actors did a good job no over acting, and no underacting.The directing was surprisingly good, no stupid computer graphics when it wasn't needed, no ridiculous views, and no real dead spots in the movie, there is always something that makes you want to watch on.I would just like to end of with Bravo Jon Favreau, Cast, and crew thank you for the great movie. I cant wait for the Sequel! Biehn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was excellent in every way. Action, chemistry, metaphors, character development. But most importantly Robert Downey Jr. kicked ass! His portrayal of Tony Stark, exceeded my expectations. He pulled it off with a finesse, better then Toby Maguire, Christian Bale, and other poorly portrayed super hero's, he owned the part. Plus he still looks HOT. Gwenyth Patrow is also a comeback worth seeing, as Pepper Pots, Tony's doting assistant. In the movie romantic sparks flew between her and Tony, which was very entertaining, although nothing happens. I've seen it twice and I would gladly go again[= So go see it. It has a lot to do with the US's current affairs, and is very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie rules, so most of the movies i watched which were based on comics like Spider Man, Fantastic 4 kind of did not have that superhero magic, iron man has that and much more; first because it is the most real superhero action movie, when i say real I mean Tony did not mutate or got some special powers over night... he made them actually, and thats cool. Then again the acting is good and the story is yet simple and very exciting, the movie left a feeling of being too short but almost 2 hours are pretty much enough for this kind of movie... The CGI are great the animation and effects are done very well. Robert has acted his role as Tony Stark or Iron Man very good yet funny and at the same time serious. So the conclusion is the title of this comment. Fans of not so realistic action movies will enjoy this one i promise. P.S. Aah i almost forgot, keep watching after the credits...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man Movie Overall Well Done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This much anticipated Iron Man didn't disappoint. The logistics of how to make Armour that appeared authentic and potentially functional was accomplished extremely well, and computer graphics were exceptional. Robert Downey Jr. was the perfect person cast for this role, and he brings his quick wit and intelligence to the role to reflect the complex personality of Torny Stark. The storyline was modified significantly form the original story and covers a bit too much content, needing some background information in future filled in more thoroughly. Staging was great, costumes wonderful. Supporting cast of Jeff Bridges as Stane was an excellent choice - very ominous personae and we are left to the end to figure out his true colours. Gweneth Paltrow was totally miscast as Pepper Potts, and has the chemistry of wet bread (she should be replaced in next movie with someone with some acting talent and chemistry with Downey). Rhodey could have been cast better as well - he was too "pretty" and was not tough enough, didn't reflect what i thought of the armed forces character (add James Earl Jones voice and we would have been there). Tony' struggle with alcoholism wasn't' touched in this movie, nor was his friendship what Hap, his chauffeur. All in all a good movie. Work on supporting cast though..much improvement needed there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was by no means an Iron Man fan going into "Iron Man". I was when I left the theater though.Robert Downey Jr. plays his character, Tony Stark, to perfection with the comedic timing and seriousness you come to expect from such a fine actor. He doesn't take anything away from the depth of the character by trying to be too "cool." I could mention the great effects that you've undoubtedly heard about 1,000 times before, but it's not about that. Once you get past the effects you are still left with some good twists and turns and you will find yourself enjoying the story more than the action.It won't win Best Picture, but then again, neither did Spiderman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, so this was one of the best marvel movies made to date - along side with the X-Men franchise. And I have a strong suspicion it had something to do with the fact that Marvel now has their own studio.The plot was good, the acting was good, the music was good, the effects were good. What wasn't good in this movie? The character relationships were well developed and well rounded and they progressed nicely through out the movie. The acting was spectacular! Robert Dowery Jr. definitely gave a wonderful performance. His light sarcastic humor and entirely too confident nature is the perfect touch to the character of Tony Stark.The effects were wonderful. As you're watching, you don't automatically know that what you're seeing is an effect. And the music was another pleasant surprise. The rock tied into the score works well. If there was one improvement, than I would say perhaps the plot could have had a bit more to it than what it had, however it wasn't an extreme disappointment in the slightest. I was entertained and never bored. I understood what was going on and everything made sense - there weren't any loopholes.Overall, I'd give it an 8 out of 10. And, just a heads up for those that have yet to see it, make sure to stay for a scene after the credits - it'll leave you wanting more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the hype built and built leading up to this movie I slowly began to buy into it. I was never a big Avengers/Iron Man fan so I did not have any huge expectations for this film. In fact, I didn't even expect that I would watch it until it came out on DVD. Well, I buckled and fell victim to the hype... and I couldn't be happier.Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent job as Tony Starks. Tony Starks was a very captivating character, far more than a Peter Parker, Bruce Banner, or even Bruce Wayne. That brought the movie more to life when there was no action going on. The second part, and maybe the most important part of the movie (that being the action) was done well and in the right dosage. Even the MacGyver style of build up with the gadgets, doo-dads, and inventions helped fill space brilliantly. I must say that I saw significant parallels and similarities between Iron Man and Robocop 2 (another movie I happen to love).All in all this movie was a pleasant surprise, the best comic book movie since X-Men: The Last Stand.</fullReview>

And finally the action although small compared to most superhero movies is good. Most people seem to judge Iron Man by its lack of action as with most people, i agree their is far less action then most comic book films but its great as it keeps you excited and prepared for the second instalment in 2010.I had been hearing a lot from personal friends of mine about this film and the more i heard about it the more i wanted to know, and it was definitely worth the ?6.20 paid to see it. i don't know much of Iron Man from the comics however i did used to watch the Cartoon version. I believe it was a great Idea to finally have Marvel keep a close eye on the film making, this is probably the most true to comic book film i have seen so far (looking through Comic book Story). I believe this is an instant classic in film and i recommend for comic book fans and the general public.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would just like to say that I, for one, am not a huge action movie person. However, Iron Man was absolutely amazing! I loved Robert Downey Jr. and his portrayal of Tony Stark. A friend of mine, who is a huge comic book fan, has said that he couldn't think of anyone else but Robert Downey Jr. to play the character.I loved the smart ass humor of the whole film. And let me just say, Gwenyth Paltrow did a great job with her part as well. The two had great chemistry and she put him in his place.Another reason as to why I liked Iron Man is that it had a little bit of everything for everyone. You have the small hint of a love story for the girls and of course the blowing up and special effects for the guys. So this movie is not classified as a guy film to me.I think the whole film was well written and some of the smart comments remind me of older films when people didn't have to use harsh language to get their points across. It was classy.I say we give Robert Downey Jr. the Oscar for Best Actor. Why not? Unfortunately, the hyped up summer films get overlooked when it comes Oscar time. Now, I'm not saying this will be a Best Picture or anything, there are more movies that haven't been seen yet, but do not overlook some of the aspects of this film.Also, if you have yet to see it, do stay through the credits as I'm sure some have already told you.</fullReview>

Unless, it was a set dressed to look like Bronson Canyon as a homage to all the low budget flicks that used it as a handy dandy ready made cave setting. Pretty good gag if that is the case. Building a set that looks like Bronson Cave. The trivia mentions a special fork lift transportable cave set but I think that refers to the interiors.Great movie.

		<fullReview>When the brain behind a weapons manufacturer has his eyes opened he decides to tip the scale and turn his brain to work for a better cause. A move that is questioned by some and blatantly disliked by others. But, all in all, a move he makes for himself and that makes him a better man, an iron man.Any film based on a comic strip is dangerous. Some work out really well, but the most of them are bland and clearly very short stories smeared out over a long film that are therefore eye candy without anything else. This one is one that falls in the first group though. There's enough time to get to know the main character, to understand his reasoning and come to terms with his changes. There's also more than enough time to watch him fight it out with his new found friends and enemies. And there's enough time for eye candy.I love this film. It's what spring/summer action is all about. Not too rich on the brain power but very decent fast paced action, a fun story, and very nice imagery. Action starts pretty early in the film but not before letting the audience learn to know the main characters. The hero is a superhero, but not one without some frailty. All in all, the good stuff.8 out of 10 successful comic book conversions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me first off by saying that this movie was great! I had a great time watching the movie, and this movie is packed with action and keeping you on the edge of your seat. Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent job playing iron man. He had that smooth, heroic, heart changing character and role that he perfected well.The design, graphics, and special effects were great. This movie really showed the greatness which Iron Man really is because he seems to be overlook as a character. I'm glad this movie was made with great potential. However, there was something that was missing in this movie. My girlfriend and I wondered what made this movie want us having more. It was the final fight with the boss. Tony Sparks was this intelligent scientist who was a one in a million man with potential in weapon development. He created the initial Iron Man suit as an escape, and he then created something more powerful and stronger than his first idea. When Sparks fought the final boss, Sparks barely was able to handle the machine, and yet Sparks was supposed to be more smarter and equally stronger. That didn't happen, and Iron Man didn't stand a chance with the final boss. I was looking for Iron Man to kick to some butt with this final boss like he did with the people in Afghanistan. That didn't happen, and it kind of made my heart sunk.Nevertheless, the story line and ideology was great. I truly enjoyed the movie, and I would pay to see the movie again. I enjoyed the action and character which Robert Downey Jr. displayed. The final boss was a bummer. Iron Man could take a big, strong missile, but he couldn't take a hit from another machine. I'll end this nice. Watch the movie and bring the kids!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie but Disappointing ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was great from beginning through the middle. Robert Downey Jr. is one of the greatest actors of our time and he plays Tony Stark like a champ. Jeff Bridges however owns the show. His character is malicious, fearful and totally original. I've never been a big fan of him, but this movie made me love him. I'm also not a big fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but I enjoyed her character very much in this movie. I've always been a fan of Terrence Howard and this movie is no exception.The storyline is pretty squared with few wholes. Besides for the totally cliché death 'n' speech in the beginning and the ending, this movie is pretty damn solid. From the beginning the movie grips you and doesn't let go. You get to know Tony Stark and the other characters, which was my favorite part of the film. I love great characterization, and this movie doesn't lag in that area. This movie has some humor in it, most of which I would say is kind of dumb and doesn't add anything to the movie, but that can be forgotten. I would have to say though, the ending was dry, too short, and very poor compared to the rest of the film. The last fight scene is very lax on action, good dialog, and suspense to keep you interested.All in all this was a great film, would have been a 9 in my book if the last fight scene was better. But hey, with the first two fight scenes you can't be disappointed, and you can't expect more than that from the last.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film completely exceeded all my expectations and totally delivered as a summer superhero blockbuster and is now my second favourite superhero film behind Batman Begins, and in front of Spider-man. When i first heard that Iron Man was to be made into a film, i was very sceptical. I mean i had never heard of the comic and when told it was about a billionaire who constructs a suit, i was like what!? That sounds ridiculous! However after reading film magazines, watching adverts and build up and then seeing the film, i cannot believe i ever thought such thoughts.First off is the cast of Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark. Perfect! RD is Tony Stark and uses his history with inner demons and his sarcastic sense of humour on screen. Casting Robert Downey as Stark is better than Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and rivals the choice of Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne. He manages to successfully convey Stark's selfishness and lack of respect for anyone to (not completely transforming) the moral and aware Iron Man that he becomes but fails to lose his brilliant satire.Next is Jon Favreu's direction which is great as he successfully shows that he is worthy of taking on such a huge task as this. The pace is kept at a constant "fast jog" never sprinting and stopping to catch our breath. His choice of music of rock and roll is spot on to the theme of industrialisation and a glamour lifestyle and is in keeping with the character of Tony Stark but also to the technology that surrounds Stark which helped him to design and build the suit.The special effects are terrific. ILM does a great job as usual and is not like Transformers with tons of CGI in every frame but still produces the same kind of quality as Transformers.As with most first parts of a sequence the film focuses on characterisation and is not as action packed as the certain sequels will most probably be. Howver this does not dull down the film as RD Jr is consistently funny and has good chemistry with the gorgeous Gywneth Paltrow as Stark's assistant Pepper Potts who may be his first true love. Jeff Bridges is good as the jealous traitor but i have to admit the final fight sequence does not exactly take your breath away for reasons seen in the film but will obviously be upgraded in the sequel.Overall Iron Man is a great start off to the summer blockbusters who now have a task trying to surpass this terrific comic adaption. Its's fast, funny, exciting and easy on the eye. A film not just males will enjoy, but females too! (And not just because of the scene of RD Jr showing off his muscles whilst banging a hammer and sweating looking very masculine)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel Adaptation yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awesome movie.I was a fan of Iron Man after reading the "Armor Wars". I kept up with it until about the mid 1990's. I was kind of worried Marvel may mess up another series I loved. Namely like The Fantastic Four. But the movie was well done, incredible effects and great story.I like the fact the story was able to be modernized using our current conflict in place of the Vietnam storyline that started the original.It is a touch violent and slight suggested sexual references, so I would be wary of taking kids under 13. Though, I definitely hope that their will be sequels. Also, stay through the credits...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great way to start the summer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend asked me to go see a movie with her, and it came down to Iron Man and Made of Honor. I wasn't really getting the whole Robert Downey Jr. casting, and didn't particularly want to see it, but Made of Honor got awful reviews. So we decided to go see Iron Man, and boy am I glad we did! If you are looking for a deep, emotional, thought-provoking film, this is not it. But if you just want to go see a comic movie done the way a comic movie is supposed to be done, then please, go see Iron Man. There is plenty of ridiculously cool technology, humor, and action to carry through the entire film. And after seeing it, I can't see anyone other than Robert Downey Jr. as the lead role. He is brilliant right from the get go, and hysterically funny. He has a very dry sense of humor, and unlike other superheroes *cough*Spiderman*cough*, we don't see a huge outpouring of emotion. He maintains his sense of humor and outlandish behavior throughout the movie, yet at the same time, we see subtle changes, done very well. He goes from an obnoxious playboy multi-billionaire genius to a slightly less obnoxious multi-billionaire genius who learns to put his incredible talents to use for the benefit of the world. Their is really only two slightly emotional scenes as far as I can recall, and they are both done brilliantly.I'm thrilled Marvel took this project into their own hands, Bravo! They didn't get pulled into the love vortex, either - no messing around with a poorly done romantic side story. A must see movie to kick start the summer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man may seem to the uninitiated as an unlikely choice to be a superhero of blockbuster status but for fans of Marvel comics in general it makes sense. But that being said it still has to attract a public who is not completely familiar with him and yet ride that fine line where it appeases those who know everything about him and this film does just that. A great screenplay supported by an excellent cast is what carried this film into the realm of believability. A good amount of time was spent fleshing out Tony Stark, who for the most part, was not made to be a sympathetic character. He's arrogant, he doesn't take life seriously and he's got more money than he knows what to do with and yet in the end he has a change of heart and you'll wish you were him donning the suit. Now that's good writing. The writers and Jon Favreau try not to stick with minor details, technicalities and such from the comics, instead they paint in broad strokes using universal themes that are familiar throughout adventure stories. Keep in mind this is an intro and not just for those unfamiliar but for fans as well because this will ultimately become a movie franchise and at this rate hopefully a consistently good one.There was always a disconnect between the reality of characters in the comic book format and how Hollywood studio's figured they should be translated on screen. The recent trend to present comic book characters in a mature light is a trend I hope doesn't end. Enough of the campy crap of directors like Joel Schumacher who never took the characters seriously and never thought that the fans did either. Having comic fans direct these films (ex. Jon Favreau, Chris Nolan) is a blessing and their success is probably an eye opener for studio executives who rather not take those risks. If they put this much energy into Captain America and the revamp of The Punisher then it's safe to look forward to a great collection of superhero films coming soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At long last the classic Marvel comic superhero knows as Iron Man comes to the big screen. I first thought Robert Downey Jr would be all wrong for the role of Billonaire inventor Tony Stark. Because Tony Stark was supposed to be a suave James Bond type of character, and Robert Downey Jr doesn't seem to fit in that category. But man I'm glad I was proved wrong. Because he brought a lot of comedy to the role, such humorous lines the great way Robert Downey Jr can deliver them so well. It also has incredible effects, and amazing flying scenes that almost come close to be has good as Superman(1978). The rest of the cast do well also. I hope we will see more of Iron Man on the big screen, in the years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally defies expectations: Great Characterization, bad action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You'd assume in a movie of this sort that it would be the action or the spectacle that makes the film and the characterization that feels tacked on. But oddly enough, it is quite the reverse. Robert Downey Jr.'s Stark explodes off the screen as a likable, well-rounded scoundrel who isn't merely a slime ball with an eventual (quite literal)change of heart: he is a sympathetic idealist throughout, even when he's at his hard-drinking, womanizing worst. Downey is extremely comfortable both with the drama and the comedy and I found myself believing in his character more than I've believed in any comic hero outside of Christian Bale's more stoic Bruce Wayne. Surprisingly good work comes out of Gwyneth Paltrow, who's Pepper Potts is the perfect combination of empowered and vulnerable. Terrence Howard is likable as the straight and narrow boy scout best friend and Jeff Bridges is fantastic as the sleaziest character in recent film history. Some say he's less believable as Tony's friend, but I found him just as enjoyable as a good guy as he ultimately became as an out and out villain. Outside of these performances, there is an effort to make a fully realized comic book world around Tony which succeeds quite admirably. The many references to Iron Man lore never feel tacked on or excessive. Now for the main gripe: the action sequences. Not only are they too few and far between, but those that we get seem extremely forced. They are all over before they can truly get the pulse pounding and there's a sense that what little appears is merely to keep the kids from stampeding out. Action scenes are in fact an art form and a necessary part of a film like this, so the lack of satisfying escapism can simply not be overlooked. Here's hoping Favreau develops a Spielbergian or Jacksonian action acumen by the time he brings out the big guns with the Mandarin and War Machine in the second film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is about Tony Stark, a billionaire industrialist who is captured by terrorists in Afghanistan. Ordered to build a missile for them, Stark uses his resources instead to build a powered exoskeleton to make his escape. Returning to the United States, Stark improves his armor and becomes the technologically advanced superhero Iron Man."Iron Man" officially kicks off the summer blockbuster event and it should, because the movie is really good and it really sets up the bar high, as if challenging the upcoming summer movies to be as good or better than this. It's better than some superhero movies that came out before and certainly better than most movies coming out these days. What makes "Iron Man" different than most superhero films is that it doesn't start the action right away. In fact, Iron Man doesn't appear until the last half hour of the film and that's a good thing.Maybe some may be disappointed by the fact it doesn't have as much action as some action films but many will appreciate the characters more. Going into this movie, many people, including myself, are iffy about Robert Downey Jr. playing a superhero character, but once you see this movie, you'll know why he fits the character well. In fact, as far as I am concern, he's perfect for the role. His charisma just brings the movie out a bit more. Gwyneth Paltrow is also really good. Downey Jr. and Paltrow both have fun in their roles and even in scenes with them together are funner to watch.The action scenes, when they appear, they are so much fun to see. The visuals are fantastic and the CGI clean and crisp. However, I do think that the reveal for the "villain" is pretty obvious and there are some plot holes in here, which I think are forgettable. Director Jon Favreau does a great job in the storytelling. It's no doubt that he is a great filmmaker. If you're not a fan of Iron Man, don't worry. This film is great for the whole family, fans, and non-fans. And stay through the credits. You'll get an extra scene in the end. This is the movie to see this summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly to state that i am not an Iron Man comic fan and haven't read any of the comics. But be sure that the film does it complete justice. People have been asking if this film really does contain a wonderful cast, and i admirably say yes. Yet this is only one of the bold excitements contained in this fun filled film. Looking back at some of the other Marvel adaptations from previous years, like Spiderman, The Fantastic Four, Batman and others. Iron Man is by a mile one of the best.Other ingredients apart from a solid gold Marvel adaption is, the cast, screenplay, drama, comedy, action and adventure. But the most significant and standing out aspect of Iron Man is undoubtedly the cast. Which is, in my view Robert Downey Jr's remember-able alongside Zodiac. But lets not also forget the other supporting cast, who also give the film admiration and emotion- Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrance Howard.Yet apart from the dream-filled casting, people are still bundled with a mass amount of real excitement, action and drama. Which is consistent all throughout the film, and doesn't let up anywhere. Honestly, this is how movies should be made, with audiences feeling excitement at every turn.Pure cinematic pleasure!</fullReview>

I actually applauded after the movie and I do not due that very often. It was entertaining,funny, action filled (it is an super hero action movie after all),dramatic and a little romance thrown in also for those that must have it. I bought a small popcorn and only made it 1/2 through before the end of the movie. It really sucked me in. Not for small kids. I know it is a maturity level but I would take my 8 yr old grandson to see it in a heartbeat. It is worth full price but if you are still unsure, go see it at matinée price.

The CGI were incredible, beats Transformers any day and the story was pretty good. I was kind of vary whether Robert Downey, Jr. was the guy to play Tony Stark as with other Super Hero Movies..they usually get a new guy and make him all rich and famous as in the case of Spider Man, Super Man. Rob Downey does deliver, and maybe he's the perfect guy to play him. Anyways, watching Iron Man cartoons while growing, the movie does live up to hype especially the villain played by Jeff Bridges ( he was scary of sorts).

		<fullReview>Marvel has certainly put out more movies than DC, but the movies have been up and down. For the first time, Marvel has fully funded the movie, giving them more control of the script, plot, casting choices, and the overall feel. Depending on the current people at Marvel, that might not have been a good thing.Yet, Marvel has shown that no one knows their business like them. They present a blend of the right amount of character development, character growth, and action. The story doesn't sacrifice action, but doesn't leave you feeling woozy from scene after scene.This is a great story. The script captures the glibness of the comic while not dipping into campiness. The climactic ending, too, could have been in one of the better Marvel books. Gone is the stilted deus ex machina ending of Fantastic Four and Ghostrider.The casting is awesome and all the actors do a fantastic job. I never doubted that Robert Downy Jr. would live up to the part. Such a waste that he blew so many years on the drugs. I had worried about John Lefavreu as a director, but there's nothing bad that can be said about the film.Except that it leaves you wanting more. The film doesn't glut you on overkill action and powers, but rightly develops a character. It follows suit with Batman Returns and the first Spiderman. It also reminds you that it will be too darn long before there is a sequel.Somewhere, Stan Lee is smiling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just to set the record straight, Samuel L. Jackson is in the movie, but u have to have a little patience if u know what i mean!!If i had to compare this to another comic book movie, i'm at a loss, as this is by far the most thought out of it's genre. Great cast, great special effects, and the CGI is that of transformers, if not better, storyline isn't cheesy or predictable, etc. Hopefully this movie will steer comic book movies in the right direction, while the X-men movies were good, and Transformers was brilliant as well, i just found this the most believable of all the marvel book stories. Reason being, here's a guy with no special powers, (ok Batman doesn't either, but he's DC, so bare with me) and decides after a great ordeal, that his life is gonna change for the better and is willing to sacrifice his entire social existence and his fathers past to accomplish this goal.Obviously we can relate to this human character,(unlike previous movie comic book characters, eg. all mutants). The message is pretty clear as well, with all the pro peace innuendos and anti war jibes. All in all, this movie was and is a good movie and i recommend u see it, even if u aren't a comic book fan, just sit back and enjoy!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Marvel movie to date, beyond a shadow of doubt!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The past Marvel movies haven't generally been very well accepted. Most of the time, I feel this is because the protagonist in them is without any real flair. They have barely any personality. Their backgrounds are usually rushed through. The villain is vanquished relatively quickly. And there is usually some silly romance thrown in, which is, more often than not, rushed through and ultimately serves little to no purpose.However, Iron Man, so to speak, puts on a shiny new suit. It stands proudly among the year's most entertaining movies which appeals to people of all ages. I went with my parents and numerous siblings, ages ranging from 3 to 11. If anyone hates loud kids during movies, don't worry about it here. My twin 3 year old siblings were rooted in their seats, only whispering to me about exciting parts, and remaining completely silent during the slower ones.Robert Downey Jr. lights up the screen with excellent light hearted jokes about everything. But, he also manages to convincingly portray the more serious aspects of the Tony Stark character.Never a dull moment in the movie, even in the downtime. Every second is pregnant with possibilities, so much so that you can barely wait to see what happens next. The CG shots don't take away from the movie. In other superhero flicks, CG usually totally compromises the film with how unreal and brightly colored they are. But you can almost believe what you're seeing.If you see anything this year and want to have a great experience, see Iron Man. Worth every penny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the movie Iron Man this morning. I must admit that until a couple of months ago, I had not even heard of the name Iron Man. Since I had not watched a movie on the silver screen for ages, I thought I would risk it and watch the movie armed with the knowledge that the character Iron Man is created by the geniuses from Marvel Comics.The thing about going 'blind' to a movie is that one does not have any expectations. There I was, seated, staring at the screen as the opening credits started rolling, hoping that I would be reasonably entertained.What an entertainment I got! The movie is absolutely fantastic and the two hours simply flew without my realising it. When the movie producers paid mega bucks to get top-notch actors, they really got their millions' worth. Robert Downey Jr who plays Tony Stark / Iron Man, the billionaire industrialist, fits the role to a T. He is good-looking, drives expensive cars, lives in this ultra-chic home overlooking the ocean, flirts with women shamelessly and comes up with funny quips. The scene at the beginning where he is being driven from a test site accompanied by three army personnel is quite fun to watch. The three are obviously in awe of Stark, the hot-shot genius, and he breaks the ice ever so effortlessly.Gwyneth Paltrow who plays Stark's loyal personal assistant Pepper Potts also does her role justice. Her duties as PA include showing the door to the many women that her boss takes home the night before. When one such woman asks her the morning after what her duties are, Potts smilingly looks at her and says "....... and occasionally take out the trash". I just had to smile when she said that.Do not expect non-stop action in this movie. It is not like Transformers, a movie which I absolutely loved, which started with guns blazing and ended pretty much the same way. This outing serves as an introduction as to how Iron Man came about. Having said that, however, the few action scenes here are still worth watching. The bad guy will surely remind you of Robocop, albeit a bigger version.There is definitely going to be a second and third Iron Man movie. Let's hope there will be more kick-a** actions in the sequels. Iron Man is one of the best movies in 2008. I give it a B+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is arguably the biggest blockbuster movie this summer (aside from the highly anticipated Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull). With a marketing campaign of $50 million dollars, Paramount was banking on this movie pleasing the core fan base and the general audience. What happens when you risk it all? Generally, you're going to play it safe.This is exactly what Iron Man does. Now, Iron Man is by no means a bad film. It's actually rather good. But come on Marvel, we have seen it all before. This is the mandatory 'origins' story (which means this is turning into a film franchise of course) which builds up protagonist Tony Stark from multi-billion dollar CEO, socialite, and Albert Einstein-like genius to the vigilante that must uncreate everything that he has created.RDJ (Robert Downey Jr. for you ignorant fools) plays the part very well, though if you've followed his career for quite sometime, it's nothing that exercises his acting ability. Gwenyth Paltrow does well for Stark's PA and love interest, though unfortunately her character doesn't accumulate into anything substantial. Jeff Bridges played well as the antagonist, and though it was a great concept, it was handled poorly by the filmmakers. The best thing about Terrance Howard's character was when he looked at the spare suit Stark built and said "Maybe next time", hinting at the possibility of War Machine in the sequel.The biggest gripe I have with this movie is that it does not try to break out of conventions; it does not have an edge to stand out as a defining film, let alone a defining Marvel adaptation. It does not help that Favreau and his team kept the look rather generic. When we see Spider- man, we can see Sam Raimi's touch. Nolan can be seen throughout Batman Begins. This film could have been directed by Tim Story (director of Fantastic Four "fame") and you would not even be able to tell the difference.What I did like in the film was all the references to other Marvel properties, which are all conveniently coming together (the Avengers movie is coming soon). S.H.I.E.L.D and War Machine are the two I remember the clearly, and releasing the movie about one of Marvel's lesser known characters before his alleged cameo in The Incredible Hulkmovie will be a treat to all movie-goers alike.I guess what it comes down to is the gut feeling I have inside. When I came out of Spider- man 2 &amp; 3, I wanted to be Spider-man. With Batman 1 &amp; 2 and Batman Begins, I wanted to be Batman. With X-Men, I wanted to be Wolverine, only because Cyclops was treated as a pansy. With Iron Man... Iron Man is just damn bloody cool. He almost makes me want to be him, but it's just not quite. Maybe his character is too overwhelming for me to want to be in his shoes (pun not intended), but rather fight along side him like all the other Marvel heroes that have had that honour.Final Rating: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better comic book movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally I am quite a big fan of comic book movies, sure I've never read a comic book in my life and in truth I am not the best judge on the translation from page to screen. But I can tell a good movie, and I can safely say there are both brilliant comic book movies, X-Men 2, Spiderman 2, Batman Begins, and some downright awful comic book movies, Batman and Robin, Ghost Rider, Elektra. Iron Man isn't as well known to me, I knew of Batman, Spiderman, the X-Men mainly through the TV series, I never saw the cartoon of Iron Man and so knew very little of the origin story. I went in today expecting something decent, pretty much another Daredevil or Fantastic Four, good but strictly mediocre. Thankfully Iron Man was so much more, and the reason because of this was it actually focused on storyline and had a heart. Superhero movies nowadays have a tendency to rely on cool characters and nothing else, yes Ghost Rider I am looking firmly at you. Iron Man is different, while the character is great, the action sequences stunning and the special effects immaculate, the storyline and heart are there. Robert Downey Jr does miracles in the role of Tony Stark, being one of the most well rounded superhero characters I have ever seen. But the script does the performance justice. Iron Man is by far one of the better comic book movies I have seen and has left me desperate for an Iron Man 2.As I said Robert Downey Jr is superb in the lead role, and to be honest he is the very best thing in this movie. Tony Stark is always likable even when he is at his nastiest. Stark is a man living under the shadow of his father, desperate to impress, even if that means by selling dangerous weapons. He's so caught up in his glamorous lifestyle that he forgets the consequences of what he is doing. Stark is a different superhero, and Downey Jr is a different actor for a superhero. But it pays off, its this different take on superheroes that makes the film such a huge success. Gwyneth Paltrow puts all those other pitiful superhero heroines to shame. Paltrow has brilliant dialogue and spits them out with ease, she's funny, original but also realistic. Her relationship with Stark works perfectly. Terence Howard in my eyes is the weakest of the cast members, I just never felt he did that good a job. There's a hilarious moment with him on a plane, but apart from that the role just seems a tad pointless. Jeff Bridges on the other hand is truly brilliant. I won't spoil his character, although it's blatantly obvious from when you first see him. It's a different role for Bridges but he is more than capable.So what of the action sequences for Iron Man? Well they are spectacular, but if I'm honest they aren't the best things in the movie. While I love a good action sequence, and a superhero movie must have at least one memorable action moment (something the first Fantastic Four movie lacked). However, Iron Man seems to lose pace at times in the action, hence why this doesn't get a 10/10. The big final brawl is amazing, and definitely one of the highlights, the fight in Afghanistan is brilliant as well, but the disappointing jet fight just didn't do it for me. Thankfully the humour of the movie comes thick and fast, and the origin story is thankfully refreshing and not a case of seen it all before. There are at least three moments where I burst out loud laughing, one involving a fire extinguisher, had me laughing for about five minutes afterwards. The storyline also works particularly well, what it lacks in surprises it makes up for with sheer intensity. Its a great little storyline with a nice ending, and not underwhelming as many critics claim it is.So overall Iron Man is a killer kick off to the Summer blockbuster season. Not underwhelming as Spiderman 3 was and not disappointing and lacklustre like Mission Impossible was last year. This is one of best superhero movies to date, and had The Dark Knight not been coming out this year, and almost guaranteed to jump all over Iron Man, then I would state this will be the best superhero movie of 2008.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wondering about human nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't know why so many people are so susceptible to marketing and hype. I guess it's one of the bitter human weaknesses (which in fact is very useful for some). I can't say I hate this film (ok-ok, 2/10 is the indication of some amount of hatred towards it but it's not all the way down). It's yet another identical and boring superhero film with all the tiresome clichés that one can expect from it. It's flashy, alright, but it contains no heart whatsoever and leaves no feeling behind it. You've seen those a lot you will see them a lot it's the production line of mindlessly stupid blockbusters. There's nothing impressive in it -- not even CGI so why everyone is so excited about it? Are you also a victim to a clever marketing? I can even prove that this film contains no plot (at least no original plot that is). Our hero is disappointed by the evil of this world and decides to take matters in his own hands, so he becomes a superhero finds himself a villain and kicks his sorry neck amidst the fire and explosions. Is it for the 100th time that you've seen such a tired nonsense? Is this Batman? Spiderman? Superman? Wolverine? Ah, right! It's someone new to the scene.So why have I bothered to write this review? Am I a hater of a superhero American dream? I have no point I just keep wondering why is it that films like Dark Knight and Iron Man are in the same room with the ones line Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction. I don't mind it really it doesn't touch me, I just wonder...</fullReview>

I hope it brings in lots of money for the studio and I'm sure it will do well on that front.I was pleasantly surprised by Robert Downey's performance. He looks great and manages to convey the right mix of arrogance and boyish (self) absorption.

This film seems like a rehash of Batman and Spiderman except it is much worse than any film in those two series. The director's obsession with tedious special effects adds to the woes of an awful script. The climactic battle between Good Medium-Sized Iron Man and Bad Over-Sized Iron Man is utterly ridiculous. Downey gives a pretty good performance, keeping this from becoming a total failure. The best thing about the film is the relationship between him and Paltrow. The worst is that stupid device in Iron Man's chest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining... But I want more than that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay I'm not going to bash iron man too much but I have to be honest about how this movie is nothing more than just another modern day action movie and nothing really great. I have to start out by saying that I'm not a hardcore Iron Man fan so there might have been things in the movie that only the big fans understood and if that's the case then I suppose this would be a pretty good movie for you, but I'm coming from the average audience point of view. I love movies. I've watched movies all the way from Metropolis, to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, to The Godfather, to Taxi Driver, to Reservoir Dogs and so on. I feel like Iron Man could have been so different. Like it could have been so much more grittier. Like right from the beginning of the film I saw what they were going for when they introduced Tony Stark in the movie. They were going for the "Good but at the same time an anti-hero" type character. I just don't feel like they pulled it off realistically. Like there were parts in the movie where I really didn't understand what he was suppose to be. I mean there were parts where he was acting like such a wuss. Why? Watch The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Pay attention to how Clint Eastwood never breaks character and always has the gritty yet good personality throughout the whole movie. That's what I expected. I expected him to have that complete bad ass personality the whole way through. Now don't get me wrong. There were parts in the movie that were really cool. Like the part where he crashes into the ground after being shot down, then gets back up in the coolest way, then shoots the little rocket at the tank and walks away like such a bad ass as the tank explodes. In fact that was my favorite part of the whole movie. Now, this is all I'm saying right here... WHY? Why could't the whole movie have looked like that one part and give you the feel that that one part gave you. That feeling that made you think "Now this is Iron Man! This is past what I expected. This is as cool as it gets." I mean did you notice that the rest of the movie didn't look anything like that one specific part of the movie? I did. I was waiting for another scene that had the smooth cool action and camera shots that that one part had but it just didn't happen. Some parts where pretty humorous, I'll give it that, it's always nice to have comic relief in an action movie, but there where times in the movie where the jokes just seemed so forced on you. Like you would laugh but it really wasn't that funny. It almost seemed like they were just filling in runtime for the movie with corny jokes and some subtle humor as if they were trying to avoid having a better and smoother storyline. Now overall the movie was actually not that bad but here is the one thing that killed it for me. Even if the movie was next to perfect but it still had this one thing it would have killed it for me. This movie had the worst use of Terrence Howard! Why was he so gay? I remember specifically seeing him being introduced in the movie and right away I thought "Oh cool! He is an awesome actor! He was good in Crash, he was good in Hustle and Flow and he is probably going to be pretty cool in this movie..." No... he comes into the movie and he sounds like he just got off of the set of Leave it to Beaver. I thought he was Tony Stark's love interest. And who the hell whouldn't have guessed right off the back that Jeff Bridges was going to be the bad guy? The movie makes it so obvious. I mean I'm actually wondering if I should really be putting a spoilers warning on here. Like when you see all those terrorist and he gets out of the limo and that was suppose to be the crazy part where you find out he is the bad guy I was seriously thinking "What? That was the twist? Nobody knew? Was this really a twist?" I mean I guess it was, but nobody seemed to be fooled. The movie was predictable. At just about every part in the movie I could predict what was going to happen in the next few minutes. What I'm saying is this. The movie isn't dark and gritty. It's full of American Cheese. It has that pg 13 feel to it. There are some funny parts. Like you get to see Robert Downey Jr get thrown at a wall insanely hard at various times where he is testing out his suit and every once and a while there will be a good line here and there that will make you laugh. It's worth going to see. But it will probably be one of those movies that you say "Yeah. I saw it. It was cool. But I probably won't jump at the chance to see it again."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The way 'Transformers' has been turned into a teen comedy, something similar happened to 'Iron Man'. The movie keeps up only thanks to Robert Downey Jr. The whole young-genius-billionaire-scapegrace thing was pretty lame though. Right after Jeff Bridges appears on the screen it's absolutely clear what's his character gonna be. Some of the characters were absolutely unnecessary, useless and undeveloped. E.g. James Rhodes or agent Coulson. The final showdown is also pretty lame and predictable. 6 out of 10 might be not as low as it's described above, but I expected so much more from this movie. And it certainly doesn't correspond with all the hype. The comic book fans will probably find something amusing but I'm not one though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're not reviewing the right stuff...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into the movie with low expectations for the record. Comic book movies this day and age are alright, and there are definitely titles I enjoyed and proudly adorn among my DVD collection - but there's a lot of hit and miss in the field and not a lot of movies in general seem comfortable with themselves these days. So the movie starts... And it's loud, flashy, the action scene editing is too quick to take it all in, the main character is a prick, the film has a lot of cheap jokes and gags, some of the dialog is corny, the plot is so predictable you can see the ending coming from a mile away, the actors and typecast, John Favreau is not an insane action director, there's too many characters and there's more vfx shots than in Spiderman. - wow, it sounds like this movie stinks... but if you pay attention to the subject heading you'll see what I'm getting at. The things we'd normally find flaws in these kinds of movies make this one fun and excel and, as one of my friends said, "I haven't been this excited about a movie in a long time." I can cop out and try and solve why all this works by hailing Favreau's superb direction, the all-star cast for their strong performances, ILM for the great work they brought to the table... but all these just enhance it and take it from being a good movie to an excellent movie. I have to credit the writers first and foremost for the fact they made a solid and tight script with just enough humor, just enough action and just enough drama that you don't notice anything else but that you are having a good time. The true villain is very predictable, which normally irritates me - but it's not building up to an "aha" moment in any sense of the term, so they aren't wasting time trying to keep it mysterious and failing. Iron Man also is subject to some very cheap humor, but it pushes it further and actually causes you to burst out in laughter (something most good comedies fail). The story is tight, the characters are fun, the action feels good and rough, and for all the reasons we rip other films to pieces, Iron Man makes you want to see it again... and again... and again. Which brings me to question... then what exactly is wrong with the movies that we find so terrible. I submit it's the script, the backbone of any film story - and Iron Man has a great script, everything else just becomes icing on the cake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IRON MAN (Jon Favreau, 2008) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I was growing up, one of my main sources of entertainment (not to mention education) was Italian TV which is where I caught several of the now-classic animated TV series based on Marvel comics superheroes like Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Spiderman, Submariner, Thor, X-Men, etc. It goes without saying that, with time, these were turned into movies and, in some cases, highly successful franchises. This year was Iron Man's turn to hit the big screen and, happily, it turned out to be one of the best such adaptations.The primary reason for the superior end result is one: Robert Downey Jr. is an inspired choice for leading man and he meets the blockbusting challenge head-on with a terrific, nuanced central performance that makes Tony Stark a believably three-dimensional character. It is reported that Downey was a fan of the original comic books themselves and that his contribution to the film was a far more creative one than is usual for actors and it shows. His extensive commitment may also have been triggered by the fact that, for all intents and purposes, the life story of Tony Stark uncannily parallels that of Downey himself: a talented person living in the shadow of his famous father who wastes his time away in hedonistic abandon until a traumatic experience set his priorities right and well onto his way to full rehabilitation.A hero is only as good as his nemesis and, in this case, Jeff Bridges' duplicitous business partner comes up trumps. Perhaps wisely, his bald-headed, goateed villain is not the overacted, larger-than-life type but a sleek, ruthless profiteer whose line of work happens to be the proliferation of warfare around the world. Equally important for superheroes are their girlfriends and here Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts is the sweet, sensitive secretary rather than the usual on/off damsel-in-distress. Also on hand is the sidekick in the shape of Terence Howard's army official and the eccentric lab assistant who ? as a sign of the times ? is an Afghan family man who has been taken prisoner by an ambitious war lord! Leslie Bibb's blonde bimbo reporter is worth mentioning as well not only for her looks but even for the way in which her character unconsciously spurs Stark onwards to first adopt a conscience and, atypically for a superhero, reveal Iron Man's true identity at the very end.For a modern Hollywood blockbuster which has its eyes firmly on becoming a lucrative franchise, IRON MAN is a literate movie with only a handful of action set-pieces which, needless to say, deliver the goods when they do come. In fact, the film's middle section is taken up by Stark's various experiments with perfecting his equipment, refining the look of Iron Man and, amusingly, his love/hate relationship with his clumsy robotic assistant. If there is one major flaw in the film, it's the climactic assumption that businessman Jeff Bridges is as much technologically-minded as his junior partner in creating and working iron giants ? especially when just moments earlier his employees seemed at a loss at coming up with anything resembling the capacities of Iron Man let alone tower over them as his Iron Monger eventually does. Anyway, it's small fry, I guess, when their climactic rooftop confrontation was, as they say, destined to happen from the outset.A frustrating modern trend in movies is that of continuing it after the credits have already started rolling and, apparently, IRON MAN is guilty of this fallacy as well ? although, personally, I wouldn't know as I walked out of the theater right after the cast list was over! Anyhow, the film-makers have to be complemented for not taking the obvious route by making excessive use of Black Sabbath's classic titular song except for maximum effect i.e. Downey's (and the film's) closing lines being, "I am Iron Man" and an instrumental passage as soon as the end credits kick in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wealthy billionaire inventor playboy Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) lives a life of luxury &amp; lusty excess - he goes about his existence blithely building weapons for the military with little regard for what will happen in the long run, stays out gambling instead of fulfilling press junkets leaving his military pal Col. James Rhodes (Terence Howard) and longtime business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) holding the fort and engages beautiful women in passionate one night stands, including a night of unprotected sexual intercourse with reporter Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb), whom he leaves naked in his Malibu home, whom his right hand gal Pepper Potts (Gwyenth Paltrow) must deal with while he trots off overseas to check on some new weaponry. While there, he is captured &amp; injured by Afghan terrorists who expect him to build them weapons in his last days as shrapnel eats away at his heart (from a missile he built no less). Instead, with the help of fellow inventor Ysen, he builds an iron combat suit and uses it to escape. Upon returning home, Stark experiences something of a morale awakening and decides to undo his career of military backing. This also includes building a better iron suit so that he can combat the forces of evil with it. Stane, who was plotting against him all along, is not pleased with this, leading to an inevitable clash between the two.Infamous for his own real life substance abuse, Downey Jr. turns in an excellent performance as Ton Stark/Iron Man, bringing warmth, humor and humanity to a character whom some may not relate to easily. The film as a whole is excellently cast, with Bridges a stand out as the evil Stane and Paltrow as Stark's "girl Friday". After enduring the bland, lifelessly uncharismatic and far too youthful Brandon Routh &amp; Kate Bosworth in the equally bland &amp; boring "Superman Returns", the chemistry of seasoned pros Downey &amp; Paltrow is a welcome breath of fresh air in an industry that is growing far too youth obsessed.An overall fun film with an excellent balance of humor and drama. I look forward to the future adventures of this Iron Man.Stay after the credits to see an amusing cameo from Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent adaptation of the comic book hero!!! Thumbs up!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. Wow. Wow. Talk about a great film forget about the people who say this movie fails. Iron Man the movie is not only a great adaptation of the comic hero but is a great movie in general. It has it all: Special effects, great acting, interesting, realistic characters and a very modern story. Of course this is also attributed to the fact that comic book itself has all these qualities as well. For anyone who wants more of Iron Man after watching the movie, I would highly suggest getting in the comic you won't be disappointed!!! (Spoilers) The comic of course was created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Larry Lieber, and Don Heck.The film follows the comic book very well (with a couple of alterations such as it taking place in the West Coast instead of the East Coast for example).Backstory: Iron Man or should I say Tony Stark (who in my opinion is one of the most underrated comic book heroes who doesn't quite the same publicity as Bob Kane's Batman) is a wealthy socialite who makes his life building and selling weapons. In a way just like Bruce Wayne, Tony Stark is a business superhero. Also, unlike Spider-Man, The Hulk and other comic book heroes there isn't a mutant or radioactive, gamma force that gives the hero his power, the power lies in the man's own ability to use his intellect, wits, bravery and judgment to combat the villains and problems he encounters.Tony Stark, Iron Man fights against a corporation/terrorist group known as Ten Rings in Afghanistan. In the comic book, Iron Man has many adventures fighting groups that have profited and used his own weapon systems from Stark Industries.Stark is forced to create a replica of one of his Jericho missiles for the group or face death. Worse yet, Stark having felt a blast that has left shrapnel near his heart MUST wear a chest plate to protect his heart. Yinsen (another prisoner) is the man who has kept Stark alive and helps create the prototype of Iron Man with him. Yinsen helps Tony get the necessary time to get Iron Man up and running. This leads to an impressive special effects action sequence that led to a lot of clapping and cheering with the audience I saw it with.After this recovery from death and from the words of Yinsen who tells him not to waste his life, Stark has a major epiphany. He no longer wants to make weapons of destruction, he wants to save lives. His business partner Obadiah Stone does not share Stark's new vision and this leads to several dramatic scenes and more superb special effects with Iron Man. I will not spoil what else happens except that it's excellent.Before watching the movie, I saw an interview with Jon Favreau who said he was going to make a movie that would make lovers of the comic book happy but also make a movie simple enough that you didn't have to be an expert in it. What a smart guy he is. Jon is a good director but this was by far his biggest project. I mean Marvel wants to make a franchise of Iron Man just like they did with Spider-Man so a lot was riding on the line and Favreau delivered a home run!!! Speaking of home runs, Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was unbelievable I cannot think now in retrospect a better pick for the role. Jeff Bridges was great and Gwyneth Paltrow were also very good. I'am glad they went with this cast and didn't go for the younger cast which would not have achieved the same results of this very adult oriented comic book hero's life.Again going back to why this movie is so successful: It's not dumb down, we got a moral dilemma with a guy coming to grips over the destruction that comes from his business but is starting to correct it, we got several shots at the corporate culture putting profit ahead of lives, we get a nice romantic storyline here, we have multidimensional characters, and lastly we got great special effects. On top of all this we have a good attempt to follow the comic book hero.I don't know what else to say if what I say hasn't convinced you that Iron Man is not just a great comic book movie but a great movie in general then there's nothing I can do. However, you will be missing out on one heck of a great movie. Thumbs way up!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Favreau made the perfect Iron Man film. Who'd have thought the guy who brought you "You're so money!" could get the first great film of the summer season so right? I knew when I first heard about Robert Downey Jr's role as Tony Stark, that it was a match, but damn. After watching the film and noticing his deadpan, snarky humor and flippant one-liners, I am very relieved that Tom Cruise didn't get the role. Downey embodied on screen all that Stan Lee's Stark was on paper.Adding to it, great performances by Paltrow, Howard, even "The Dude" Jeff Bridges was a great choice as Obidiah Stane.ILM did much of the sfx, and the hundreds of other sfx people made Iron Man a seamlessly beautiful delight. George Lucas' other company, Skywalker Sound made breaking the sound barrier and munitions fire seem perfectly real.Many mini-intros into other characters, spin-offs and sequels are in the film, including an after-credits appearance by a Bad Mutha-F..... as the head of a (WILL REMAIN NAMELESS) organization.All-in-all, a great movie. I loved it, the rest of the audience seemed to like it too. Comic geeks push up your glasses and rejoice, Iron Man brings the metal!</fullReview>

Actually that's about it for pros ... sad.Cons: Horrendous acting. Why did they pick this arrogant p**** who can't act for s*** to be iron man. It's no less than blasphemy. In fact, it's not just him, everyone in the movie is a terrible actor. Where did they get these guys ? Reminds me of spiderman ... how did they pick him ?Plot is lame. It doesn't even make sense.Not much action. I was hoping for at least some action if the acting sucked so bad, but not, not very much at all.Considering all this, I guess I should rate it a 3, but because so many people rated it 10/10 ... ridiculous spammers, I must rate 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barely made it to the ending (my wife didn't)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must be out of touch with modern pop culture because I have no idea how people can spend 2 hours watching movies like this, and the flood of top ratings and positive reviews on this site make this all the more mysterious. I was even more surprised that several friends and neighbors highly recommended the movie. So, my curiosity piqued, I watched it. Perhaps this negative bias overly influenced my reaction.Maybe it would have helped if I had been an avid fan of the comic book -- that seems to be necessary to accept the absurd back story. But I found the plot, story, characters, and cinematography to be unbearably predictable and far-fetched. I realize the movie is supposed to provide some indulgent escapism. But setting it in Afghanistan ruined this for me, which forced me to think about the terrible realities there. Setting it in a fictitious city like Gotham would have helped.Iron Man has a lot in common with Spiderman (not to mention the long list of formula superhero adaptations before it), but I enjoyed that movie much more, as it had a much more plausible human side, and a humble super hero main character is much more palatable to me than the smarmy Robert Downey Jr. who acted like he needed a good paddling.Despite a lot of dozing off and eye-rolling, the highlight in the movie for me was Gwyneth Paltrow, who is not only cute but did a marvelous job of acting the conflicted role of Stark's better half, and somehow didn't look ridiculous walking over piles of broken glass in 4 inch heels.Perhaps it is a comment on our culture that enormous sums of money are spent making and watching movies like this? Do we truly have nothing better to do with our collective time?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a bad rip-off of Robocop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Liked some parts of this movie, but liked it better when I saw it in 'Robocop', 1987. This is how Iron Man and Robocop are similar:In both movies, the major conflict is between two execs in the same company. In both, the 'bad' exec is clearly insane. In both, the 'bad' exec hires some thugs to do a 'hit' on another exec. In both, the two execs have different aims for the same technology...But for the nitty-gritty stuff: In both, the hero is captured by thugs. In both, the hero loses his helmet/mask. In Robocop the hero loses his hand; in Iron Man, his protective glove. In both, there's a fight between a big cyborg (if Iron Man is a cyborg)and a little one (go on to Robocop 2 for that one). In both, the small cyborg jumps up on the big one's back to pull out some wiring.But, the DIFFERENCES are what make Robocop the better film: Alex Murphy (who becomes Robocop) is a family man; Tony Stark's a playboy. Robocop is beloved by children; Tony could never be called an example - in his lifestyle - by children. Alex is beloved by his family and others; Stark is aloof. Alex is captured when he bravely walks into known danger; Stark is surprised. Who, then, is the better hero?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It looked amazing but it was a total disappointment. I was expecting something like the new Spider-man or Batman movies (which i really enjoyed). The special effects were amazing but there was no real action that wasn't supposed to be funny in some way except for the fight scene with the main bad guy (Don't want to give anything away). Also Robert Downey Jr. played his role well but they entire script was very corny and unrealistic. For the most of the movie it seemed like it was all leading to something big but nothing really ever happened. In my opinion it was a complete let down but I don't know how it was from a Iron Man comics fan's point of view.4 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IRON MAN is the latest superhero-movie in cinemas, and it's another round of man-turned-into-amazing-powerhouse with CGI, love interests, a full on CV-cover-up and mayhem. And this is the first Marvel-child that's fully financed by Marvel Studios, and being a blockbuster it's surprising how they've chosen such a bold casting and choice of director; surely, casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man is interesting even before you've seen the teaser, Gwyneth Paltrow as the smart and sexy assistant Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges villain Obadiah - and director Jon Favreau seemingly came out of nowhere.The film opens up with twinkling ice-cubes in whiskey, and soon the high-flying main character Tony Stark gets blown up by his own weapons as he gets locked-up for three months by Afghanan guerrillas to build a missile, instead he and his temporary sidekick makes Stark RoboCop 2: the Rusty &amp; Deserted Sequel, as Stark shoots his way out of danger and returns to his glossy everyday - but now, as a changed man. The near-death experience kick-starts his goal for becoming Iron Man - but as soon as Stark adds the hot-red colors to his suit, the movie loses momentum; this is where Iron Man actually starts, so we're expecting something spectacular, but instead we get messy. Director Favreau is funky, and he knows how to squeeze every little drop of cool and swagger from Downey Jr., but as the action-bits starts coming, they're too brief and feels like a lackluster. IRON MAN's surely got potential, and the soul of the movie is surely in here, but a sequel that's right-on explosive is surely the right way to go from here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am the Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man was a pretty good movie. It is obvious that Robert Downey Jr has found his true calling. He is a very convincing super hero. I am not a comic book fanatic and don't really know much about the history of Iron Man. However, you don't need to know this to really enjoy the movie. A barely recognizable Jeff Bridges plays a big part in this movie. His head is shaved yet his voice sounds pretty much like ol' Jeff Bridges. There are a few corny scenes in this movie that include Terrence Howard. Yes, there is a scene where he looks at a very shiny Iron Man outfit and says "another time". In other words this movie is being set up for a SEQUEL! Movie purists will scoff at the scene when Iron Man FLEW from the United States into Afghanistan beat up a few people and then came back. Purists will question how HE DID THIS? How did he go to the bathroom while flying that distance? Or how about when he was testing out his flight suit and was body slammed against the wall at about 70 MPH? He didn't even get INJURED? Also, that funky looking FAKE HEART that was installed in his chest was not fully explained. All in all, a great movie. Not enough special effects. This isn't like Batman when there is a lot of crime fighting. There were a few scenes when it would have been appropriate for Jack Bauer to show up, especially when that bald terrorist was going to make that one guy CHEW on a RED HOT ROCK. Sheesh, talk about a horrible method of torture!! Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like comic book movies, go see Iron Man. It's not my favorite, but it's pretty good. For people who didn't enjoy Batman or Spider-man, seeing this movie would be pointless. Note to parents: This movie is not as psychologically dark as Batman Begins nor does it have the random gross-out violence of Tim Burton's Batman films. If your child can handle the violence of the first Spider-man film, Iron Man is no worse. Reading the rest of my review is only necessary for the few people who really can't make up their minds... Many great comic book movies have outstanding villains, but the baddie in this movie was nothing special. Although certainly evil and menacing, the villain was not very colorful. Nor did he have the entertaining backstory or motivations possessed by many great villains. His history and motivations were quite cut-and-dry. Robert Downey Jr. was the best thing about this film. It's difficult to play a character who is selfish but still likable; Downey Jr. makes it look easy. His Tony Stark is a wealthy, impulsive, boozing, womanizing, fun-loving bachelor who happens to also be an engineering genius. Kudos to the writers for the excellent development of this character. The supporting cast is good, although Gwyneth Paltrow (as Pepper Potts) is merely adequate. I'm not saying there was anything wrong with her performance, but I believe other actresses could have probably played the Pepper Potts character just as well. I felt that she had weak chemistry with Downey Jr., which is probably the result of their relationship being poorly written. I think the writers couldn't agree on whether Pepper's relationship with Tony should be like Miss Moneypenny with James Bond or more like the early stages of a serious romance. Either way, the scenes shared by Pepper and Tony were disappointing and boring. Director Jon Favreau has an excellent sense of timing. He sucks in the viewer by throwing in danger or humor at precisely the right moments (and often without warning). The humor in this movie was perhaps the best of any comic book movie I've seen. Almost every joke was funny. More importantly, the jokes never made the characters look cheesy, nor did the jokes feel forced. This movie is really fun when Iron Man is kicking butt, but that only happens during a brief portion of the film.Like some other comic book films (e.g. Spider-Man), this movie does a great job of showing the process through which our hero awkwardly tests his new powers, slowly sharpening his skills. Unfortunately, like those other films, we are supposed to believe that the bad guy immediately masters his powers without going through any sort of trial-and-error process.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The advanced screening just took place in Las Vegas, and for those that have seen the movie will know that I'm thrilled to see our city played a small part in the film. (Let alone having Terence Howard spend time with some players at Nellis Air force base - just outside Las Vegas). Every Marvel adaptation to the big screen offers some in-trepidation. My point... I am one of the few that liked Daredevil, loved Spiderman 1 &amp; 2, Spiderman 3 feel short of any expectations, liked Ang Lees Hulk except for the ending, slept through Ghostrider, thought Fantastic Four - Rise of the Silver Surfer delivered some eye candy but not enough to keep my attention. The Punisher delivered the second time, but finally I can sleep, finally I can rest well tonight. the bar of adaptable comic lore has raised the bar....Kudos to Jon Favreau, awe-inspiring, this movie delivered more homage and visual nutrition to keep all skeptics at bay. Speaking of Bay, IronMan will crush Transfomers Box Office Mojo, MARK my words - IronMan delivers! Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Macum and Matt Holloway have done their due diligence, we have distinct character, continual story tonality, humanistic humor, pure adrenalin action, love and compassion - The remark by Robert Downey Jr's performance as Tony Stark at his first press conference from his captivity was priceless!! Each actor/actress delivers - so what Sam Jackson was cut - more power to the people to purchase the scene on DVD - this cast is off the charts - chemistry! Great chemistry and well-defined story and effect engineering. Speaking of industrial engineering the special effects kick it up a notch from the typical Minority Report, Matrix Zion control room sequencing - someone at ILM is paying attention - while having some fun - note the virtual trash can and you will understand. - Stan Winston Studios - Heavy stuff and wow!One last thing Robert Downey Jr. played two incredible roles, in my mind, he was destined to play Charlie Chaplin - and now he was destined to play Tony - Thank you RDjr. for making it real for the fans - Stark Reality -</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that I paid $5 on pay per view to watch this turkey. It was wholly predictable, Hollywood fantasy clap trap. There was the evil defense industry (of course), the heartless military with Vietnam-era incompetence (stike that and make it Olvier Stone's version of Vietnam-era incompetence), and the humanitarian playboy who turns over a new leaf. You can't even call it science fiction because that assumes some passing nod to science. The writers obviously never took a biology course, or physics course, or even metal shop (judging by the thin sheets of metal that couldn't even stop a 0.22 let alone a 0.5 cal). There were lots of special effects, but very little storyline. I left for 15 minutes during the middle and didn't miss anything! As a parting note, I would normally give a movie like this a 4 or 5 as a tribute to the special effects, but I felt the need to offset the ridiculous 8.0 that was the current average. Wake up people!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Special Effects Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another special effects film which means if you want good dialog, character development and chemistry walk away now. I thought this one was going to be good and was greatly disappointed. The special effects are fine and predictable and like so many superhero films of late the characters are one-dimensional. The fact that Favreau left the dialog up to the leads instead of investing in a good writer is apparent.Surprisingly Robert Downey Jr. is just okay. His Tony Stark is mildly appealing and his scenes in the lab are probably the best in the film, maybe it's because he is talking to inanimate objects and his computer. He has better chemistry with JARVIS (Paul Bettany) than anyone else in the picture.Gwyneth Paltrow brings nothing to her part. She is again the wooden girl, but there isn't much to the part. Anyone could play it and someone else might have been convincing in her scenes with Robert Downey Jr.Terence Howard seems miscast. For a military man his character is soft and has no military bearing. It's too bad because he's a much better actor than he is allowed to be in this film.Jeff Bridges seems to have a lot of fun with his role. He plays it for fun and it shows. He is the only one who seems to be playing his part for what it is. Everyone else is either taking it too seriously or just can't seem to get past their own parts.If you haven't seen this movie save yourself some cash and rent it. You won't feel like you've wasted any money that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is one of the world's most renowned arms manufacturers/sellers, who is able to live a funky, eccentric lifestyle on the back of the success of his Stark Industries company. But this all changes when he goes to Afghanistan to show off his latest weapon and is taken hostage by terrorists and forced to build a weapon for them. Instead, he builds a super-hero suit and uses it to break free and go back to America, where he reveals a change of heart in relation to his profession and tries to aim his talents more at peace than war. But this doesn't go down well with his boss Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who's only worried about the profits they will lose now Tony no longer wants to make weapons. And when Tony learns that his company has been making under-handed deals with the men who held him captive, he uses the super-hero suit he made once again and becomes Iron Man. But his corrupt boss has ideas of his own in regards making his own super-hero suit...You can always count on a good super-hero film to fill in the obligatory summer blockbuster slot in the filmic year, and this year we have this adaptation of one of Marvel Comic's truly lesser known creations, which just shows how far towards the bottom of the barrel we're scraping. An ambitious piece that seems to have caught onto the trend of making extra long summer blockbusters, this tries to invest a lot of unnecessary depth and characterization into a story that's ultimately not worth the effort.It just feels overlong instead of something really special. Okay, Iron Man isn't your typical action hero. He doesn't just magically get his super powers like Superman or Spider-Man, we see him struggle to get his super-suit to work, failing to guide it properly and make the special gadgets work, but the whole piece just feels overly labourious, with an uninvolving, predictable script that fails to rise out the ground.Cast wise, in the lead role, Downey Jr. is an odd but admittently effective choice, a snazzy, cynical anti hero who slowly sees through his own BS but he's just not enough to keep the whole boat afloat. Bridges is also a decent choice as the villain, but the weak script fails to make the most out of him, while in support rising star Terrence Howard goes through the motions as a comic relief Air Force colonel and Gwyneth Paltrow is noticeable as a personal assistant with a ridiculous name.All these type of films just seem so manufactured nowadays, with so much back story stretching them out so long and enough publicity to guarantee a great opening weekend and an obligatory equally inferior sequel a year or so later. For all it's quantity instead of quality, Iron Man truly has an Iron Soul. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable Film. Oscar Level Performances and FX.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I have to mention that Robert Downey Jr. was born to play the part of Tony Stark. He portrays the perfect combination of suave and selfishness, energy and ungoverned gluttony, troubled spirit and a soul seeking redemption. It's clear that Downey has brought everything to the part.Sure, this is science fiction but the believability and realism are off the charts. Tony Stark isn't a mutant or a ninja or nothing silly has happened to him. Stark isn't a cheesy, tights wearing superhero. It's great that he can't jump into a phone booth and be on his cheesy way. He's a flawed man but he's anything but ordinary. From origin through design to testing and then gaining expert usage, every step of the way is believable and incredibly interesting. All of the amazing effects are grounded in realism. I know they built the armor in real life and that worked remarkably well. It wasn't all a CG mishmash. You could tell that they sent up real fighter planes and filmed them. They looked like the aerial cinematography for Top Gun or a well choreographed air show and all of it plays out in a stunning fashion. There was a realism to the bumpiness of the camera and the results of actually shooting at those tremendous heights shined through. Using practical effects and a practical suit of armor paid off big-time. Even if, for some strange reason, you watch the film trying to nitpick, I seriously doubt anyone will be able to tell the difference between a CG shot and a practical shot. The suit of armor develops a personality of its own. It grows from a crude infant in to something awesome. It adjusts flaps during flight (again making it appear to be more then a feasible concept); it communicates and allows us to see Tony's POV. There are so many great details that I truly believe this movie is made for repeat viewing.</fullReview>

ACT I - the setup, was promising, if a little bit preachy. Jeff Bridges was a pretty cool surprise. Overall excellent casting. There was one effect in the Afghan sequence that I found offensive, but that may have been intentional. The middle of the story, ACT II was completely muddled. Iron Man's goal was not clear. What was his goal? What did he want? I got it that his "life" goals changed, but after seeing the light: "what did he want?" The antagonist's role swapped from character to character. Who was his enemy? Who or what was keeping him from getting whatever his goal was?If the acting hadn't been so good, the whole film would have been an even bigger disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome - Fun from 6 - 106!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was there for the first screening of this movie here in South Australia. I have to say that from the ads I expected a lot, but then again I always do when it comes to superhero type movies, and I am generally disappointed. But not this time. I sat there and within a couple of minutes it had me engrossed. It was full of action, excitement and kept me happy through the whole movie and brought me to applause a couple of times! When I heard that Robert Downie Jnr was playing the role I was somewhat perturbed as I couldn't see him playing any sort of believable superhero. I was totally blown away at the way he fell into the role. He played it with a great deal of wit and I had no problems accepting him as Iron Man, The rest of the cast were enjoyable as well, but my favorite, apart from Robert Downie Jnr, was Jeff Bridges in the type of role that I haven't seen him play before.I guess that those who are Marvel Comic aficionado's will have their problems with this movie, but, as someone who had no previous knowledge of Iron Man and his creation, I think that it works really well. After seeing the movie I have no intention of rushing out to buy the Iron Man comics, but I will be there to see the next installment in the Iron Man movies... and yes, according to the director, Jon Favreau, there is the potential for at least 2 more movies and I can't wait. They left a few little hints for us to pick up on that the potential is there for sequels, if, as Jon says, the movies make enough money.I have no problem taking my grandkids to see this... there is no bad language. Yes Tony Stark does seem a bit of a sleaze at first and is definitely a ladies man, and yes, there are a whole lot of explosions and guns blasting, but, it is so over the top that it can't be in anyway seen as believable. And even with things blowing up all the time there is very little in the way of blood or gore.A SuperHero movie for kids of all ages. I gave this a 10 out of 10 because for full length of the movie I never once looked at my watch, I was totally engrossed, and came out thinking it was a good $16 spent. That doesn't happen very often. Just remember to suspend your belief... this is a movie based on a comic, not a historical drama, not an Oscar contender. Just a fun filled, action packed, Good guys vs Bad Guys movie. How can it fail!!! Iron Man Rocks!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IRON MAN (2008) **** Robert Downey, Jr. , Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Leslie Bibb, Shaun Toub, Faran Tahir, Clark Gregg. Rip-roaring big screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics' cult-classic superhero AKA billionaire extraordinaire Tony Stark (Downey having a field day), an industrialist/arms manufacturer who has his eyes opened to the horrors of his financial gains when he is kidnapped by terrorists and manages his escape by creating an armored suit as his ticket to freedom and regrouping by protecting those he has put in harms way. But his sudden moment of clarity has a price to pay in the form of his second-in-command Obadiah Stane (Bridges having a devilish time here) who poses as a formidable foe in the long run. Screenwriters Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway hammer out a competent, sharp and clever storyline that incorporates origin story cum legend with strong support by director Jon Favreau (who has a bit part as Stark's valet) incorporating stunning ILM CGI, and wisely allowing his actors to shine, particularly Downey's sexy/brainy/snarky Stark with sterling clear-eyed focus and dollops of humor that take off the edge of 'serious'ness, resulting in a humdinger popcorn crowd pleaser and sooth-sayer to the fan boys. Paltrow, in one of her finest turns, is also a breath of fresh air as Stark's personal assistant/love interest Pepper Potts and Howard's unconventional performance as his best bud Jim Rhodes, a military liaison, proves a primer of how a second banana should be played. High-octane thrills and a lot of fun (including the inevitable- and arguably the funniest ? Stan Lee cameo) an instant classic and one of the very best comic book adaptations committed to the silver screen; cannot wait for the sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A minority opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people have been said during the opening weekend of Iron Man that it ranks among the best comic book films of all time. I have to respectfully disagree and state that I am clearly in the minority of people who thought this movie was derivative, predictable, and didn't even involve me on an emotional level, except for in a couple of the flying scenes. I thought the best scene was when Iron Man was being shot by the two fighter planes. The whole Jeff Bridges subplot was the weakest part and by the time he put on his own metal suit and fought Iron Man in public, the movie lost me completely. There was nothing wrong with it on a technical level. It is thrilling and awesome enough and all of that, but I think I've seen too many monsters/robots/superheroes fighting each other in public that it had better be shot differently or have different developments than the old "now we're in the lab -- now we're on the freeway -- now we're in the sky -- and back down on a roof" etc etc outline. Yawn. Nothing's at stake. That scene could have been as long or as short as the writers wanted it because its just a series of obstacles. What's the difference if the robots are fighting in 1 locations or 3 or 5 or 10 as long since each location has nothing to do with the previous or next one and eventually lead to the same conclusion anyway?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like lots of running around, lots of CGI and lots of explosions then this is for you. This movie is just following a well worn formulae and is nothing more than every other super hero movie rolled into one.A man is captured and kept in a cave for three months during which time he is ordered to construct a "Super destructive" weapon out of bits of other captured weapons. Instead he constructs a super metal skin with built in flame throwers that is so strong that it resists 1000s of bullets rained down on it. Then he is walking around a desert when - of all the luck - a series of helicopters just happen to find him. Next he gets back to his own lab and manages to construct a metal suit that can fly and do battle. Yawn.The predictable - bad guy in the camp - ending is really obvious and tedious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another "run-off-the mill" marvel/superhero movie without ANY new twists or any originality.The plot could have been written by a 6 year old.Take known elements off robocop, terminator, spiderman and mix it together to make a "new" movie where everything is ultra-predictable, except that those other known" superheros like robocop or terminator are certainly better in their class while the iron man just excels in mediocrity.The main character has not enough charisma to be like-able by the audience, unlike a hero, say "spiderman" with its weaknesses and odd characteristics. The story line is simple and, excuse me, not logical or credible.The only good part of the movie was the special effects, mainly the scenes with the iron man flying...but there are other comparable movies where such things have been done better already.Of course...since we're dealing with a "run-off-the-mill" superhero movie...add the obligatory villain end fight...add some non-logical solution so our "hero" at the ends prevails ("just push the bypass button")...villain dies....and everyone can go home happy after wasting two hours with this Luke-warm re-wash of things we've seen 100 times already. What about such a movie should be worth giving it 8 points? Nothing. This is a movie you should go to if you are 10 years old, your grandparents just gave you a movie ticket for your birthday and you really don't have anything else to do for an afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I paid 10$ to watch a guy build a suit and use it for 5 minutes. Then watched him build another suit and use that one for 10 minutes. Where was the action? Definitely not worth watching in my opinion.So dumb to. When he builds the first one, the people watching, nobody in this world can be that stupid. Your not at all wondering why he is testing a leg piece when he should be building a bomb? Whatever.It was a heavy disappointment. There needed to be more action. The action in the movie was great, there just wasn't enough it.100% of the potential this movie had to be a great one, was never realised in the making of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why I am supposed to like this movie. What facet of my personality, dreams or desires is this film supposed to appeal to? American war mongering blood lust? Chauvinistic bravado? The need to dehumanize foreign cultures? I don't have much of that it in me , so the Afghan location was beyond offensive. It's no small wonder my sad, pathetic country engages in these brutal, illegal actions with so little questioning from its citizens when I see the high rating this movie gets here. Usually I trust this site, but this is just bizarre. Even if I was the biggest flag waving Type A male chauvinist pig, I'm sorry, this movie would still suck. The plot is unbelievable from the get go. A military supply company founder/inventor is a celebrity that everybody knows and wants an autograph from? Ridiculous. Under the watchful eyes of surveillance cameras a supposed missile instead takes on the shape of the prototype body super-suit that it actually is without anybody noticing? A man who made killing machines all his life suddenly decides to make a machine that's "not a weapon?" How is it not a weapon, and when did Stark have this epiphany that changed his entire outlook on life? Maybe I was rolling my eyes during that scene and missed it. A hard-hitting reporter suddenly decides to jump in the sack with Stark? Don't ask me, I'm just a girl! hee hee hee. Totally ludicrous and disrespectful to women. And why did Gwyneth's character need to be in this movie? Why did his friend and partner suddenly become a bad guy? And if he wanted to kill Stark, maybe it would have been easier if he had utilized one of those many occasions when his suit was off. Conveniently for the flag wavers, Iron Man flies off to spread freedom in a sad little country that needs a big American hero to help them. More appropriately, perhaps he could have disrupted an illegal American interrogation or U.S. shooting/bombing of innocent civilians. That surely has caused the death and suffering of many thousands more than this ridiculous caricature of an Afghan war lord ever could/did.I'm still not sure if I watched a movie, or a U.S. Marines enlistment commercial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Superman, I believed that a man could fly. Now I believe that a man can redeem himself, no matter how badly he's fraked up in the past.And I could not be happier that they choose Robert Downey Jr. to carry this message. It works because it's his story, and it shows that he knows this. His heart is in every frame of this movie, his heart is in every word he utters, and your heart will be in the movie, too.It's a cool movie, with lots of things blowing up and stuff like that. But, it's a well-told human story first and foremost. If the X-Men movies strike a chord, it's because each one of us have known the pains of isolation and exclusion. If the Spider-Man movies strike a chord, it's because we all know the little fears and frustrations that drive our daily lives. And Iron Man? Iron Man is aimed at those of us who have made mistakes in the past and want to redeem ourselves.And, it strikes a chord. Believe me, it strikes a chord.

		<fullReview>It had to happen some day... We all knew the comics where to small for the likes of spider-man, wolverine and batman... they would go to the big screen... some day... DC did it first with their superman and batman movies...marvel was falling behind in the race before they even stepped on the throttle... But then something happened...I wasn't very old when the first x-men movie hit theaters but I remember seeing it and thinking: "Yes! they're back!" A lot happened since then. For my part, the x-men trilogy (yes, the third included) carried marvels ambitions for the big screen. I know many people loved the spider-man movies. I absolutely hated them. The hulk was a BIG disappointment, I almost vomited out of sheer anger when I saw the fantastic four and I won't even mention the daredevil movie. I am one of the traitors who thinks batman begins is the best superhero movie ever made...at least until now...Iron man blew me away! it's as simple as that. Everything, and I mean everything, in this movie runs as smooth as a well-greased machine. The cast is nothing short of perfect and Robert Downey Jr. shines as the eccentric playboy turned superhero Tony Stark, Jeff Bridges is a brilliant villain and Gwyneth Paltrow gives just the right amount of female touch to the movie and the chemistry between her and Downey Jr. is amazing.The movie is perfectly balanced between fast-paced, explosive action and well-timed humor. The CG is amazing as it was the first time I was able to see a movie with sports cars of that caliber and think: "F*ck the cars, give me the suit!" The movie also functions well for the person who isn't as big a comic geek as yours truly. All comic book adaptations requires a bit of faith and suspension of disbelief as, let's face it, people with anger management issues don't turn big, green and very strong in the real world nor does people who are bitten by spiders get their abilities. But this looks like it could actually happen in a not so far away future.It isn't just a movie about a comic-book superhero beating the crap out of the bad boys. It is also about taking responsibility and having the courage and will to make changes even though it isn't always the easiest way to go. Do yourself a favor and see this movie, It will give you a good laugh and get your pulse pumping.This movie takes Marvel back in the race and with the new Hulk movie coming soon and the likes of Thor and Captain America following not far behind it looks like they're closing the distance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is anyone over the age of five NOT sick of sub-par superhero movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like an obsession with Hollywood to take something intentionally childish and make it "mature". You know what I'm talking about. The new Bond movies, the new Batman movies, Transformers, etc., etc. What Hollywood fails to realize is that only one out of every ten movies that follows this style actually ends up being a worthwhile movie.Iron Man is simply one of the nine failures.Outside of the first forty-five minutes, the entire plot line is corny and a wholesale cliché. Elaborating, Iron Man tries to be mature by mixing in the war in the middle-east. It works. That is, it works until the plot turns into the exact same plot as every other sub-par superhero movie out there. It becomes obvious by the first thirty minutes that no good person can die, and all the bad people all cackle oh-so-evilly and have no more intelligence than an average paperweight. By this point you forget the maturity of the movie's opening, and all there is to do is laugh at the impossibly cliché story. It's like watching one of the old cartoons where the good guys always win and the bad guys always have evil-looking beard stubble and talk intelligently only to be slight-handed by the more intelligent good guy. This is the "mature" superhero movie everyone told me about? But there is a good chance you didn't watch Iron Man for the plot. You watched it for the action. The only problem with that is there is only two action scenes?yes, I counted. One in the opening and one in the ending, with a few spurts of action between that last a whole thirty seconds of screen time. The first one is well-done and actually made me think this could be a decent movie. The last, however, is possibly one of the most unintentionally hilarious climactic scenes of all time. Even if I ignore the fact it's almost copy/pasted in entirety from a Mystery Science 3000 episode, some of the worst CGI used since I Am Legend ruins anything cool about it.The space between the two action scenes is filled with some of the most cliché plotting I've seen in years, as I stated above. Put simply, there is nothing entertaining here. While Robert Downey Jr. plays his role perfectly as usual and puts on a pretty nice comedic bit every few scenes, he can't let me forget the sinking feeling in my gut that this is one of the most boring superhero movies ever made.What more is there for me to say? My pretentious critic conclusion: Iron Man is a severely clichéd, technically poor film with little entertainment value.Half-drunk, adverage joe conclusion: Iron Man is boring and lame. No way is this better than The Dark Knight or Spider-Man 2! Both are correct. Iron Man has made me personally give up all hope on the superhero genre.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the matter with all those good reviews?! &gt;read this&lt;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really, I don't understand how EVERYONE gave a good note and excellent reviews of this film. It is REALLY FAR from being a good movie, and even more from being in the top 250 of the all-time best movies. This is my first comment on this site, and it is also the first time that IMDb deceived me on a movie... I was sure that it would be awesome but it was just stupid and pointless. Maybe it is because I am not a fan of the Iron Man comics? but I couldn't get in it, from the beginning to the absurd end. I loved the other superhero's movies? but the context of this one was just too ridiculous that it was not interesting at all... I almost fell asleep in some parts.It is also extremely unrealistic when you consider the actual state of things in the world: Japan is way in advance on us on things like robotics and technology... just to give an example, in Japan they can create gas and electricity with their garbage... and we are far away from that. So how on earth can a little dude from the middle of the states come out from nowhere and can create those super weapons and that robot... something is not right.The music of this movie is also the worst I heard in years. It is dumb and it's really not helping the empty context of the story. Maybe if the music would have been better, I would have appreciated it a little bit more. I had shivers in Spiderman with the awesome music and the beautiful scenes of ''flying'' in the city. Not even one song was well-placed or enjoyable in Iron Man. Only heavy-metal style shouting music, not really heroic music in my opinion...Finally, the 4/10 note is well-deserved considering the fact that the music was horrible, the story was stupid, boring and too much cliché, but also because the only two good points of the movie were that the special effects were extremely good and the acting decent (Robert Downey Jr. is a revelation), unless it would have been a 2 or a 1. I strongly disagree with the 8.2 of IMDb and as I said, it's really the first time in the hundreds reviews of movies I watched here. I didn't enjoyed Iron Man at all, and a good advice to anyone would be to keep those 10 bucks to buy something useful or to go see something better.Thank you,Jeff</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tried and tested conversion from comic to silver screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Series -whether they're TV, comic, books - have a problem when they get made for the big screen. You have a hero, you have a villain, you have the love interest, and in a series the hero wins, but never destroys the villain (and like wise, somewhere in the story, the villain usually has the hero in a life or death situation, that they can get out of). When moved to the silver screen, the rich back stories and free flowing nature of the characters that makes them so long running ends up truncated for mass appeal, usually involving some family member or work colleague (Tomb Raider, Mission Impossible, Charlies Angels, S.W.A.T.), rather than expanding on a story line from the original series. Ironman is no different. You have the man in the flying metal suit, you have the love interest, you have a bad guy to stop, all tied up with plenty of amazing CGI and a thumping soundtrack. It's definitely the Robert Downey Jr. show, and he plays the flamboyant Stark with flair. The fact they cast a great actor like Paul Bettany in a none acting role (simply voice work) shows how much the team behind this film have invested in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Tony Stark" (Robert Downing Jr.) is a wealthy industrialist who specializes in the making of military hardware. While in Afghanistan demonstrating a new missile system he is seriously injured while being kidnapped by militants. Fortunately a doctor who was also kidnapped named "Yinsen" (Shaun Tomb) manages to keep Tony alive with a new device that is hooked up to his heart and powered by a car battery. Effective but crude. Naturally, it isn't long before Tony manages to make some improvements upon it in order to allow him greater mobility and a better power source. Once that is accomplished he then sets about creating an armored suit for himself while his captors think he is building his new missile system for them. Anyway, rather than disclosing all of the details let me just say that at first I wasn't expecting too much from this movie figuring that it was nothing but action and CGI. And while it definitely has both of these elements it also has some great humor and pretty good acting as well. Along with that, Gwyneth Paltrow (as "Pepper Potts") and Leslie Bibb ("Christine Everhart") also add some rather nice scenery. In short, this turned out to be an extremely pleasant surprise for me and I heartedly recommend this movie for all audiences. Above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the opening scenes with Iron Man being like the very original Iron Man. It's almost an homage to the first comic books written in 1963. I really liked this portion of the movie the most.The characters are believable and are consistent through the movie. I am not entirely supportive of the script and I find at times it is boring and slow.There is no central villain in the movie which is different and refreshing. I like this because it isn't Tony Stark fighting a nemesis. It's more of Tony finding himself and the new path he is following. Such as the battle at the end against Jeff Bridge's character, Obadiah Stane.Stane wants to take over the company for purposes of greed. He is a long time friend of the family. Should Stark rip is brains out? Subdue him? Join him? Directing - 1 Acting - 1 Casting - 1 Script - .5 Believability - 1 Continuity - 1 Special Effects - 16.5 of 7</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was entertaining all the way through. I grew up reading comics, but I don't usually enjoy superhero movies. What I liked about this one is that nothing looked bad from a design/art direction standpoint. Sometimes even movies with good stories will have costumes or equipment that just look terrible, but the Iron Man armor looked great. Of course, Robert Downey Jr. makes the Tony Stark character almost as iconic as what Johnny Depp did with Jack Sparrow. I didn't watch this movie with my kids, but I thought it was more geared towards teens than elementary age. There were a lot of adult themes that I think would be hard for younger kids to sit through, and lots of stretches without action. There are scenes of womanizing, some graphic war violence, and corporate politics, which I thought would either bore or be a little graphic for preschoolers. I mention this because there is obviously lots of marketing directed at that age group. When the fight scenes are shown, they are exhilarating. At this point, Iron Man 3 is already out, and there is talk of RDJ leaving the franchise. It wouldn't be the same if he left.</fullReview>

I thought it's childish and won't be of much actions as he's always in the suit.After watching the film, I think I was totally wrong. It has some good acting, fighting and story(maybe). It's just much better than I expected. Though he's always fighting in the suit, I always long for him to get in the suit and fight.I guess you should really watch this film.

		<shortDescription>Iron Man was good, but not good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would think Iron Man by Black Sabbath would have been in Iron Man the movie with Robert Downey Jr. Thank god it was not. Now, this movie is about a millionaire, Tony Stark, who runs a weapon manufacturing company. He is in Afghanistan testing out his weapons and he gets captured by terrorists to make a missile for them. Stark barely survived being captured and he is alive because of a mechanism planted in his chest. Instead of designing a missile for the terrorists, he builds a suit and uses the energy from the device in his chest to escape, thus the idea of Iron Man.When Stark returns to the real world he designs and perfects the Iron Man suit. He seeks revenge on the terrorists and his business partner and good friend turns on him and tries to kill him, making him the main villain. So here we have our story. Was it a great movie? No, but it was a good movie that I did enjoy.The character of Tony Stark was great. He was funny, clever, cocky, and all around good for the movie. His lines and sarcastic attitude brought comic relief and made him a relatable and likable character. His character develops well and we get the Tony Stark story. Iron Man isn't really that important, the story is more about Tony and what he will do with the character of Iron Man. A lot of the movie was him testing out the suit but he did very little fighting. Some scenes were boring and the story dragged, but it was still interesting. The final fight scene was a little disappointing but not terrible. It was just and it fit well.The last scene really annoyed me. Tony calls a press conference to revel the truth. He had a cover up story and instead he confessed that he was the Iron Man. His secret identity is gone and everyone knows who he is. As a super hero I think your identity should never be public, it's too dangerous, but Tony Stark could be different. I'm interested to see how it will work in Iron Man 2. The Avengers has already been made but I still have not seen it as this is being written. In all Marvel superhero movies there are hints towards the Avengers with Nick Fury and SHIELD. I think it's great for the movie and it makes it more interesting. It draws the audiences' interest and makes them wonder what the Avengers are and it also draws them to other superhero movies, which brings in more money. Overall the story was OK, the character of Tony Stark was great, and the movie itself was nothing special. There was little action scenes but a lot of character development. It would have been nice to see a little more of a mixture and for that Iron Man does not get the WillyT seal of approval. It is still a good time, see it with your friends because you will be more entertained, and I would buy it in DVD and see it again and again,</fullReview>

Bridges plays Tony's long-time business friend, Obadiah Stane whom Tony learns is trying to take over his company and Paltrow plays Tony's secretary, Pepper Potts whom Tony gets romantically involved with. Robert and Jeff are great in this as usual and I recommend this good comic book/superhero film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been terribly fond of Iron Man. As a comic reader for twenty years, I knew him and have come across him from time to time, but never really found his story that intriguing. He is, basically, Marvel's answer to Batman. That being said, this movie was excellent.I think they fit in all the necessary story parts, and they were executed wonderfully. Robert Downey Jr has finally made the comeback he deserves, and is bigger than ever. I am unclear about the Pepper Potts situation, but think it is being handled well in this film -- she is obviously conflicted, both in love with her boss but also wary of his womanizing. That makes sense. And the way they made his transformation from jerk to somewhat respected is a nice move.Purists might be upset that his origins were moved from Vietnam to Afghanistan, but that would just be protesting nonsense. In order for Stark to fit the timeline of the Avengers story (in the films), he needs to be modern, and I think this was handled excellently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now for the past three years, I have been saying how much this film is over-rated. I saw it either late 2008, or early 2009, and eventually completely forgot about it. I couldn't remember much from the film other than a few small details. However I had only seen it once, so I decided to give it another chance to get ready for "The Avengers." Was Iron Man better than I remember. Yeah, but I still don't think it's perfect.My biggest problem with the film is that there's too much talking, and not enough action. This is why I'm not a big fan of superhero orgin stories, they always spend too much time setting up the story, and then the sequels cover the action. I wouldn't mind if the talking was interesting, but I really didn't care too much about the stuff they were talking about. Tony Stark is an OK character, but he does come off sort of like a douche, and sometimes was kind of annoying. He doesn't have as many funny moments as I would want him to have, which is a real shame because Robert Downey Jr. does a great job. Pepper Pots is...OK, she is a strong female lead, but at times even she is annoying. But like I said, my main problem was that there wasn't that much action.For the good stuff, the acting is great. Robert Downey Jr. owns this role. And when action does happen, it is pretty entertaining. The first fight in the cave was kind of hard to see at times, but the rest were shot really well, and kept me interested. The special effects are great, but this movie cost like $140,000,000 so that should be expected. I loved the villain, I liked his motivation, and Jeff Bridges plays it so well, adding enough comedic elements to be interesting. But my favorite character was Rhodey, just because he reminds me of myself. If I was in his situation, that is how I would react.Iron Man is a good movie. I still didn't love it like so many other people did. For me, there was too much talking and not enough action, Tony Stark came off as a little unlikable, and it's forgettable in a few places. But the action, acting, and special effects are all good, and I really liked two of the characters. So for me, it still isn't perfect, but if you think it is, that's cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would definitely recommend this movie to all those who enjoy movies like superman and to those who just wanna see some action with a nice story.But for those who'd like a bit more depth it's rather disappointing. What I found most disappointing was lousy character development. I couldn't really familiarize with any characters at all. The main hero seems to lack human part behind the mask and a decent explanation of what made him choose to become the Iron Man. I mean it's too predictable.. There could have been deeper characters with more build-up behind them like in Batman the beginning.Overall, I'd say it's a good movie to have fun watching, but I found nothing in it that would inspires me and I wouldn't call it a very rewarding experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man, based on the MArvel comics character, is a fun ride from start to finish. Robert Downey Jr. does a good job and Gwyneth Paltrow is surprisingly appealing as his assistant, ahem-Pepper Potts. The effects are really good and the score, which features AC/DC and Black Sabbath, is first rate.That's not to say it doesn't run out of gas about halfway in, that the middle section of the film is really boring. Hey if I wanted to watch someone work with a computer all day, I got to the Microsoft office!! The giant robot climax is pretty silly too. Still kudos to Jon Favreau for a good sense of humor here. You can't possibly take a comic book film too seriously and he doesn't. Downey has lots of fun with that, I did feel though that he never really takes Tony Stark beyond that playboy we meet in the first five minutes. Also I love Jeff Bridges, but what was he doing in this, Obie is such a moron! Any thinking bad guy would've iced Pepper when he found her in his office. I mean c'mon!! At least he rebounded with "Crazy Heart", but sheesh.Iron Man is pretty good action, despite it's flaws and it's miles above pretentious nonsense like "Unbreakable". So if you like this sort of thing, you're likely to be pleased.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I could care less whether or not I ever see another super hero movie again. To me, they all follow similar plot lines and are therefor rather predictable. Furthermore, I could really care less what happens to the main character. As for the action scenes, there are enough movies out there with huge explosions and whatnot that it just doesn't interest me anymore. The fact that I've never had much of an interest in super heroes and comics is probably the main reason why this film didn't interest me at all.If your like me and your sick with all these super movies that have come out over the last year, then you could skip this movies.But, if you liked Spiderman and Batman and found them entertaining, by all means go see Iron Man because you'll enjoy it. The only serious flaw with this movie that I had was that it didn't use the song of the same name by Black Sabbeth until the end credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes Rusty But Bright Spots &amp; Sparks of Fire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The action is a long time coming...longer than other Marvel-ous movies when you're thrown into the thick of things from the get-go. It's a little heavy handed on the politics, too...But once the action does come it's powerful. And there are strong emotional plot lines, too...sometimes to the detriment of the action. I must admit I spent the first 30 minutes shouting for Tony to get into the stinkin' suit already. But once things picked up it delivered a punch emotionally &amp; pure flaming fun. The theme skirts on Captain America plots of the 40's with the enemy for most of the movie being thinly disguised Al Qaeda. I now found myself shouting for Tony to hunt down &amp; fry Osama til he smells like the piece of pig poop he is. Toward the end things get muddled as the Mid-East theme is suddenly dropped &amp; the familiar rival-enemy emerges. A lot of violence, emotionally &amp; graphic so not recommended for younger kids. So yes, it is fun but not a winner like some other Marvel hits. Not as bad as The Hulk though. Special effects are much better. Tony Stark may be Ironman. But he's no Spiderman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen it in a cinema, on DVD and finally bought BLU-RAY disc. Absolutely AWESOME! Acting was good - RDJ was simply made to be IRONMAN! All that stuff he pulled in the movie - classic. Great job - highly recommended. Few words about special effects - really, really great job. They put so much effort in making the movie, therefore I'm really proud I had a chance to get this title on BD - must have for all fans. Most definitely - it's one of my favourite movies, not only because I like Sci-Fi movies - I like movies where acting, special effects, and plot are put together well, and - most importantly - don't exclude each other.That's what IRONMAN is all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film on its release in the UK. The special effects were pretty good..lets face it, it has to be up to the mark these days to compete with the competition.Other than this I can't actually recall much of the detail. Which leads me to my point: Was this a groundbreaking film in any way whatsoever? No; Is there anything about it which will be regarded in the future as iconic? No. Yet it had been given an IMDb rating which put it easily into the top 250 films of all time. This was the clincher which pursuaded me to go to see it. Conclusion: my first experience of vote rigging on IMDb..shame!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Action-pact thriller provides a field day for Robert Downey, Jr. He plays a wealthy guy, who after being imprisoned by terrorists in Afghanistan, swears off the making of military hardware, but at the same time creates Iron Man, a robot-like specimen that will destroy all evil in its path.As his assistant and lover, Gwyneth Paltrow has found a role that is totally beneath that of a former Oscar winner.Jeff Bridges is excellent as his adviser. It doesn't take much to realize that Bridges has his own agenda in this film and that he is up to absolutely no good whatsoever.The kids will love the special affects here, especially the fight between the two robots (Downey and Bridges) on that bridge near the film's end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?of US Army technology (remember "The Hulk"?). In some parts quite funny, but that's it, except for very good acting by Downey jr. and Bridges. If you consider the roots of the figure of Iron Man and look at the mess they created with this movie you could really cry because the figure itself has a lot of potential. In this movie it was only used as vehicle for something else. You just have to look at the "symbols" used: Afghanistan, terrorists, USA as the usual stand for freedom, and so on and so on. Please, Hollywood-Military-complex, give us a break. If really wanted, one could also do this with another story, take something like "Black Hawk down" and go for it, but don't convert a comic figure into a messenger of ever repeated US values and such. So: Four stars just because of Downey, without him only three or maybe even two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wisecracking Downey Jr., a shamelessly lens-seducing Gwyneth Paltrow and yet another first-class characterisation from Jeff Bridges. Jon Favreau meets this high-calibre casting head on with an unfussy, well-told tale of goodies, baddies, big bangs and a McGyverish/loose cannon geek who can have almost any woman he wants. Chuck in some super CGI/flying sequences and an Audi or three (with some correspondingly stylish set designs) and you've got a popcorn seller.It isn't quite the sophisticated thriller that comments attributed to Favreau would have you believe. In fact it's not highbrow in the slightest, simply doing the things that all summer blockbusters do. But that's why I went to see it. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Na na na na na, na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na, na na na na na na na na naaaaaaaaaaa.I am Iron Man! Not really, but I'm excited. It's the start of summer, which means beaches, swimming pools, girls in bikini tops and short shorts, and above all, sequels and comic book movies. One of the biggest is "Iron Man", a movie that's been generating buzz it seems since last summer. This has been called a comic-book movie to rival "Spider-Man" by people who haven't even seen it yet, and with talent like Jon Favreau directing and Robert Downey Jr. starring, you can understand the lofty expectations. And looking at the final product, they delivered above and beyond. Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark, a weapons designer unveiling his newest machine of destruction, "The Jericho", to the United States Air Force stationed in Afghanistan. While traveling with the unit, he is attacked and captured by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings. The attack leaves a piece of shrapnel embedded near his heart and he is ordered by his captors to assemble a weapon in their workshop, but he instead turns the tables on them. Working with the aid of a fellow captive, Dr. Yinsen (Shaun Toub), he puts his creativity to use, putting together a bulletproof suit of armor, complete with flame-throwers and other gadgets in order to free himself. After seeing the destruction and death that his weapons cause, Stark leaves Afghanistan a changed man, even willing to cancel his company's weapon manufacturing for a more "accountable" method of warfare. This is not good news for his business partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). Stark's newest project is the iron-man suit, updating it with flight, weaponry, sleekness, and even a nice color coating. Only while this is going on, Obadiah is secretly trying to overthrow Tony and take over the company, even getting his hands on the first "suit" prototype. Less evil are Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Tony's assistant and Jim Rhodes (Terrance Howard), the military liaison to Stark Industries, who help Tony along the way. "Iron Man" is big, flashy summer fun but its greatness comes from director Jon Favreau and writers Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby never forgetting that this is the story about a weapon with a heart. They take that appealing premise and make it spectacular. The action is first rate, offering up explosions and an exciting chase scene between Iron Man and fighter jets. This is balanced perfectly with humor (Stark's time in the lab updating and working with the suit offers up some of the best visual gags of the year) and a warm feeling that comes from a seeing a weapons maker that cares. The suit is also one of the most amazing and beautiful looking things ever put on screen. This is also a cast that if you told me would be headlining a comic book movie, I probably wouldn't believe you. With the exception of Terrance Howard, who might as well be playing a hood ornament with the minimal role he's given, the cast brings so much to what is going on here. If Tobey Maguire made playing a super-hero a brilliant acting accomplishment, then Robert Downey Jr. elevates it to being Oscar-worthy. On the surface Tony revels in wisecracking cynicism and self-indulgence, basking in womanizing, booze, and money. But before you label him an anti-hero, Downey also brings a surprising amount of heart and redeemability as well. That Downey wears the flaws and somehow also manages to find the character's inner soul is a testament to his greatness as an actor. He also has great playful chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow, who's fantastic at working around the little flirty moments between Pepper and Stark and the more serious ones where she is called upon to be the Robin to his Batman. And Jeff Bridges, sporting a nice beard and a shaved head, oozes a menacing love of power that makes Obadiah a devilishly entertaining villain. "Iron Man" is so good at capturing the human element that it's a shame the ending comes down to a battle between two machines. It's fun and contains some really spectacular visuals but it's also kind of a letdown that the movie favored special effects over characters and a plot that were doing so well up to that point. This movie is summer on a grand scale though. I have no doubt it will be a huge hit and, if the scene with Samuel L. Jackson after the closing credits is any indication, sequels are coming. If they're anything like this, i'll be the first on line. "Iron Man" starts the summer off right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since Batman Begins released three years ago, most new superhero movies have been particular about their casting ? especially about the non-lead characters ? and also great care is taken to please the geeks with trivia scattered all about the movie. Iron Man is the first such "production line" movie for Marvel since they have started producing their own movies. And with all our luck, they succeed. Iron Man balances a big budget/big explosions popcorn movie with a host of intelligent actors to make it a worthy opener for Hollywood's Summer Season this year.Iron Man is an origin story that focuses on how genius billionaire industrialist playboy inventor Tony Stark goes from creator of WMDs to an iron-clad superhero standing up against selfish war-mongering. Robert Downey Jr. plays Stark as a fast-talking faster-thinking man-boy, yet instills likability to his shallowness. Get this: his secretary reminds him it's her birthday; he asks her to get herself a present from him; she says she already has; he then actually asks her if she likes it! The secretary (&amp; babysitter) is played by Gwyneth Paltrow in a very cute turn - she harbors a secret crush on her boss yet is conscious of their social difference. Terrence Howard plays Stark's best buddy and the Army's liaison to Stark Industries (fanboys: hint, hint!). The supporting character that does stand out though is Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane in a menacing bald &amp; beard look accentuates his jaunty performance. It just shows how important it is to have a strong actor in villain roles (think Brian Cox from X2).John Favreau does not really carry a legacy to set any valid expectations for his latest movie. Considering he did a passable turn with Zathura, most of the anticipation for Iron Man comes from recognition of the superhero himself and the wonderful cast. Each of the four actors brings a conviction to their characters that lend the required believability to the world they inhabit. And yet, the movie recognizes itself to be an entertainer and sticks to its purpose. It finds a niche spot between the successes of Batman Begins and the Transformers movie. Much like the Cheese Burger that Tony Stark craves ? it is fun, fulfilling and easy. Nothing more, nothing less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the CEO of Stark Industries which produces advance weapon systems for the U.S. military. Tony's father started the company after WWII, and after his death Tony inherited the company, worth billions. Tony lives the life as a hard drinking, rich playboy ladies man, but he is also a genius who has invented many high-tech items for the company. Tony flies to Afghanistan to demonstrate a new weapons test to the United States Air Force. On his way back to his plane, his convoy is attacked by terrorists, and Tony is wounded by a Stark Industries missile. Tony is captured and held hostage in a cave with Yinsen (Shaun Toub), a doctor who saves his life. The terrorists force Tony and Yinsen to reproduce the new destructive Jericho missile Tony was demonstrating from parts of other weapons. Instead, Tony decides to build a suit of armor with Yinsen's help. The suit gives Tony the strength and protection to be able to escape the terrorists. Back in America, Tony builds a better suit of armor which gives him superhuman strength with the ability to fly. With the help of his personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Air Force Lieut. Colonel Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), Tony vows to protect the world as Iron Man.Well-made superhero movie has some skill of a good script and some great points. However, it is too much to offer.Rated PG-13.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I eagerly anticipated this movie for weeks before its debut. It lived up to every expectation I had, despite the fact that I watched every single trailer and preview for the movie. During the movie, I kind of wish I hadn't seen all the previews, but there are so many GREAT scenes in the movie that you realize the trailers are a small part of it.The only complaint I have about the movie (and it's a minor criticism -- and pretty typical of Stan Lee movies) is that the dialog gets a little cheesy at times. The dialog is especially cheesy (and for some reason this holds true to many movies -- Top Gun, Hunt for Red October and other "chase" movies) when the people back in the control room, who are tracking the "bogie" are interacting with each other. Easily the cheesiest dialog in the movie. Most other times, the movie is extremely well written, VERY well acted (especially by Paltrow and Downey, Jr.) and the special effects are amazing.The fight sequences are a little overwrought, but at least they're smart enough to keep those parts short and very fast-moving.In any case, RUN to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty damn good adaptation of one of my favorite Marvel titles. The first half is better than the second, with a strong revenge thread getting lost in the bigger picture of the whole story. As a straight adaptation of a classic Marvel story, this gets utmost props, as a movie on its own, its starts out excellently then is somewhat crushed under its own high-tech power. Look out for cameos by Ghostface Killer and Tom Morello. Overall, as good as an Iron Man movie could be, and I'm happy for that. I just wish Marvel would pay less attention to the Emo-Critic crowd and deliver the goods more. The first half of the film delivers a bigger emotional punch than the second half, which suffers from a little bit of the old emotional over-indulgence. All in all, it was an enjoyable, cool flick that didn't hurt an old shellhead fan's intelligence, but flirted with a little bit of the Emo over-indulgence that ruined "Spiderman 2" and "Hulk" for me.</fullReview>

The acting was good but compare it to real movie acting like godfather, shawshank and most De niro movies.....come on. 10 out of 10 most epic's should not get a 10...and no one can call this a epic....star wars, lord of rings....and iron man...does not really fit does it???? If it was just setting up a sequel then i expect that to be better maybe a 7 or 8 but it will never contain the acting skills, camera work or emotion a 9 or 10 will ever be worthy of. It had a bright start and middle and went downhill from there. Iam not saying it was the worst film or comic book movie ever....superman anyone???? But it didn't have the quality of any of the x men films..... PLOT SPOILER..... For example i Loved seeing Jeff Bridges as a evil twisted baddie....even though it was obvious he was going to be one from the start.Gwyneth was her pretty lovely self but her acting was hardly sliding doors or Shakespeare in love.

		<fullReview>Everyone LOVES this movie.I just like it. I don't really see what all the hype is about and why everyone thinks its so much better than all the other big summer blockbuster hits that shamelessly parades PG-13 violence and charming entertainment but lacks clear narrative, dialogue, or character development. Out of all these comic book adaptations, Spider-man has been the only one that has touched a human nerve and it was still rather corny. This movie is absolutely unbelievable (not just unbelievable in the "comic book" sense), but rather because the plot is completely undeveloped! Robert Downey Jr. makes his big comeback as charming bad boy Tony Stark but fails to save the entire movie with only his blindingly white smile. Paltrow is horrible and needs to go back to acting school (which is sad because I rather liked her in Shakespeare in Love which proves that she does have the chops but is just dusty from being out of the game for so long). Stark's "helper" machines provide some comic relief in a scene that is memorable only in its absurdity and the bad guy is so cliché he reminds me of the kingpin from the summer flop: "Daredevil".Overall, its good entertainment but it doesn't deserve a high rating. It is mindless fun, it doesn't make you think but may make you laugh, it doesn't call for intense emotional investment but it makes you feel good and happy at the end. All in all, its rather conventional fare and so it deserves a rather average rating.On the other hand, I rather enjoyed The Incredible Hulk with E. Norton. So if you have to pick between the two then pick Norton, who brings vulnerability to his role and who actually has chemistry with his leading lady (Liv Tyler).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron D**k Head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should have been called Iron D**k Head because this character whose supposed to be a "genius" who designed weapons of mass destruction just thinks with his penis. This movie thrives on the theme of masculinity and machismo instincts. Furthermore the style at which it was made with all the cheesy dialog makes for some of the shallowest media productions since the NBC show LAS VEGAS. Honestly why do we feel the need to make hero's out of people like this. This Stark character is nothing more then a shallow 2 dimensional fool, who only wishes to buy the most expensive cars, f**k the ditsiest whores, get drunk on liquor daily, and making that dollar. And that's where the magic of the film lies it's because most of the people in the audience are just as shallow as he is. They too reminisce about these narcissistic fantasy's which is why they fail to see just how much associated with vice and self indulgent this character is. And most people are probably thinking "so what's wrong with that" well I'll tell you what's wrong wrong with. Even though this character supposedly undergoes "personal changes" in the movie people in real life who engage in the same life style will just likely continue in this decadence until eventually their cockiness over so many years of never taking time to reflect will leave their souls inert, and unreachable through all the sarcasm and ignorance. Another problem I have with this movie is the the stereotypes. I'm not talking about the portrayal of Muslims I'm talking about the person they chose to be the villain. Just like a Disney movie the main villain is always the ugliest evil looking guy. In the case of this movie it's the dudes with bald heads and menacing looks plastered on their faces. They might as well walk around with a sign saying "I'm an evil mastermind." One character even gets uglier as his more sinister motives are revealed. And why does it have to be so unrealistic. No modern day weapons designer has that advanced home technology; holographic grid screens (those things are really getting overused), artificial intelligence systems so advance they could addition for parts in the next terminator movie. And if that finale epic battle had really taken place in real life where Iron Man gets bashed around in the middle half by his bald headed evil rival in the other suit the other man would not be saying clique' lines to taunt him like "You've made your father proud,... for a man would wanted to rid the would of weapons you've given it it's best one,... come on you can't beat me I'm stronger than you...", in real life it would have been something more like, "What, foo?,... you want some mo?,... come here mutha****er,... whatcha gonna do?,... yeah you better run,... p***y", OK it doesn't have to be that crude but it doesn't have to be that lame either. I can't believe this movie is receiving such high ratings, and The Hulk isn't. The Hulk is a masterpiece of powerful imagery, Iron Man is juvenile eye candy, an all American popcorn movie with lots of things blowing up just to keep you amused for 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comic Book Popcorn Tripe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay. I confess I am not a fan of comic book movies. Comic books were great but they were just that - comic books. But I guess fans of the genre want to see them brought to life on the big screen. And with today's technology too many of the movie today are just that. Comic books brought to life.Maybe it is because I am older and grew up in an age when there was something to really lose yourself in on the big screen. There is very little subtlety to these films as they are often just a lot of noise signifying nothing. There is no social commentary like we saw with many of the films of the late 60's and early 70's and there is even in my opinion little of the unknown of blockbusters of the early days like Star Wars and Jaws.Okay they are reasonably well done. I am a fan of Robert Downey Jr. and have enjoyed before in films Gweneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges. But Gweneth is largely eye candy and pleasant while Terrance seems to wasted in a vacuous role. I can only hope that he doesn't end up like Cuba Gooding Jr. who started out good and these days seems to wind up in films that are trite comedy films that are usually not even funny. Jeff Bridges was appropriately over the top and evil. I barely recognized him behind the beard and the shaved head.In a $200 million film I would fully expect some great special effects and there it didn't disappoint. I say this even though for example the final battle (now wasn't that predictable) between Iron Man and Iron Monger was pretty good. But that is just the problem - the entire film was almost completely predictable. No subtlety's, no nuance nothing to keep me guessing. Just vacuous entertainment. But then as a producer friend of mine said "just entertain them".Oh is that to say ones like last year's No Country for Old Men or There will be Blood were not entertaining? Of course they were. But then maybe the fans of Iron Man might not enjoy them. And Jaws was thoroughly entertaining but it also kept you guessing.But what really put me off is the unabashed America raw raw that pervaded the movie. I might as well have been watching a Rambo or Chuck Norris flick. Or even an old John Wayne movie. Okay John Wayne made far better pictures then either Rambo or Chuck Norris could even dream of.The Afghan war lords were just a cartoon joke. Why did they have to be Afghans? Are all war lords in Afghanistan animals like these people were? Well they may not be exactly good guys but these guys were a bad joke. On the other side the Americans while not perfect they were portrayed as the good guys fighting the evil war lords. What was presented was that this was supposed to be the reality of Afghanistan today.What crap. As bad as the war lords are the big problem with the war lords is that they are actually in the Karzai government and hold important positions as Governor's of provinces and cabinet minister's in the Karzai government.These war lords were not Taliban fighters as they don't dress like that and are completely different then the ones portrayed.Indeed the war lords are the US allies. And the terrorists are often the Americans themselves bombing villages from the air killing primarily civilians. Oh don't get me wrong not all the Americans are evil in Afghanistan but then they are not earnest nice guys as portrayed by Terrence Howard either.Okay maybe you are going to tell "hey its just a comic book. Lighten up". But that is not the point. Thousands of people watch this stuff and come out believing that evil war lords of Afghanistan are what the Americans (and Canadians - yes I am Canadian) are fighting over there. There are not. What they saw was pure utter unadulterated propaganda spouted by Hollywood whore masters.And for that the film is a complete failure for me even though I was kind and gave it a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing it at the cinema 4 times i want to say it is truly the best marvel adaptation I've seen since batman. Robert Downey Junior is truly a Gem on screen with his tough life he has had I'm glad Hollywood has given him another chance to shine in a role that he truly is made for. The storyline is really well paced and the characters are easy to follow. Jeff bridges never ceases to amaze me which makes him one of my favorite actors. The CGI is really really good except for the tank scene which looks like a computer game. At one point tom cruise was meant to play Iron man as much as i respect the guy i don't think he could have pulled it off as well as Robert Downey Junior. I hope they make a sequel to this Amazing Film.J.J Sirman</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow... just wow what a movie, Robert Downey Jr was beyond awesome both in his comical timing and charm.The film may of had some incredible special FX but they were totally overshadowed by the quality story that is told and that my friends IS a good thing.After Marvels recent disappointments this has restored my faith in a good old fashion superhero movie.The last scene before the credits was so well done and pretty much broke every cliché that is done in your typical superhero film.. it was blunt, funny and very cool.I can't say enough about Ironman... it truly is one of the best superhero films of all time.Go see it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its finally delivered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, I think its the first Marvel adaptation that displays not only great directing, but great acting and story telling. I may sound like a broken record, but this movie really is worth watching. I compare this movie to Batman Begins. It may not be as dark and deep like the new Batman but Iron man lives up to the hype. The picture is great, the dialogue is clever, and the CGI is not overly done which makes everything look proportional. The special effects really were amazing, its something fresh. The cast I think is also superb; no one else could have done it better than Robert Downey Jr. because he is able to deliver the wit and humor of the character. Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow, and the rest of the cast also give great performances in a superhero movie; you can see that the entire party was having a great time while filming. I recommend this movie for everyone, whether you're a fan or not, its a whole lot better than the X men and Spiderman movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, Downey is a treat to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As other people have already said, when I first discovered that Downey was in the role of Stark, I thought to myself, "What the hell are they thinking?" Now I'll admit that I was very wrong. He is a treat to watch in this movie. He did a great job making the character his own and I'm looking forward to the next two sequels. Paltrow was believable and had great dialogue with Downey. The banter between them was fun to listen to. I also enjoyed the playful dialogue between Downey and his workshop robot as he was building the next gen armor. Action scenes were good. I wish they had done another scene with him getting used to the next gen armor. The final battle with Obadiah was OK. But I think it could have been better. All in all it was entertaining to watch and better than expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Begins.... Iron Man continues;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alerts: You Have been warned! I didn't expect much from this film, and Boy, was i surprised!!! A TV. spot (namely the Tank vs. Iron Man scene) seemed too fake to my taste, but it was obviously enhanced later on, because on the theaters that scene looks awesome..The cast was great, the effects beyond my expectation, the pace was perfect and the ending was a rule-breaker.I am not very familiar with the comic, but I noticed that this film laid out TONS of roots for future Marvel films, we know that in the upcoming Hulk movie Tony Stark/Downey will make a cameo, trying to start a link between Marvel films, something that has been on Marvel's minds for some years now, let's hope it works... DC, is trying to do it with Bale and Routh reprising their roles as Batman and Superman for a Justice League feature.There's a lot of Marvel references: S.H.I.E.L.D.,War Machine, and the ending I think would a base for the "Civil War" Marvel's storyline... just to name a few...A few years back "Batman Begins" reset the rules for a great superhero movie and gave us a great guideline, as previously did the first X-men movie, unfortunately later films failed on some degree to match the formula (Fantastic Four)now Iron man retakes the challenge and actually puts the game on a higher level, let's hope "Dark Knight" and "The Incredible Hulk" can keep up...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McCheesy's take on "Iron Man"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got to see this the other day. It was actually pretty good and I strongly believe it lived up to its hype. It had a solid plot, Robert Downey Jr's charisma is all over the film and every scene with him is above genius. He was indeed the perfect choice to play the title role. Gwyneth Paltrow, Terence Howard and Jeff Bridges also delivers in their respective roles. The CGI effects was fantastic. That's all I can say: Fantastic.The armor designs (Mark I, II and III) were beautifully crafted. From the metal junk that Tony Stark created inside the cave to the Hot Rod Mark III design, its all a geek's (even normal people) fantasy dream put into celluloid. A couple of visual effects-laden scenes will assuringly take your breath away. The most notable is the part where Iron Man is high up in the air evading two Jet fighters. Pure eye candy delight. Also, there's this one scene where Iron Man intervenes in a terrorist activity somewhere in Afghanistan blasting the baddies into little smithereens. He looked really awesome in that scene. I assure you, watching this film will satisfy your hunger for CGI.But of course, in every CGI summer blockbuster film there is some weak points that might or might not bring down the whole film. Obadiah Stane's last minute transformation to Iron Monger was really uncalled for. Seems to me it was probably just an excuse so that Iron Man will have a sparring partner near the end of the film. They could've just pulled off a story where Obadiah creates like a thousand unmanned Iron Mongers and program them to eliminate Iron Man. That should keep our metallic hero busy. Probably a better scenario for an ending battle scene but what the heck, its just probably me. The action scenes were scarce too. But since the film is mostly focused on Tony Stark's transformation into Iron Man and his origins, it is probably forgivable.By the way, they managed to put in some SHIELD references which is probably a make-way for a sequel or maybe even an Avengers movie down the line. Also, they gave us hints of superheroes (and a villain) who will likely appear in the sequel and share screen time with our hero Iron Man. Like Nick Fury and his 'Avengers Initiative' who makes a surprising cameo after the end credits. There's also Jim Rhodes and his War Machine alter ego whose line "Maybe next time baby" is a foreshadowing of his imminent turn into a superhero. The Ten Rings terrorist organization is obviously a direct nod to a possible sequel villain: The Mandarin.Overall, I'd say a pretty decent superhero movie although there were some weak points but you can't avoid that in films these large and epic. Director Jon Favreau did his homework, he started the Iron Man franchise with an origin story. Robert Downey's charisma and machismo suits the character Tony Stark and his alter ego Iron Man very well and here's hoping for a bigger and much epic (with more fight scenes) sequel. Huzzah.</fullReview>

This is one you don't have to worry about taking the kiddies to. It is family safe and even if you weren't a big fan of the comic, you will still love this movie! If you're wondering whether to go see this movie, go, run, leave now. Get to the nearest theater and grab a seat. Don't get up to pee or for any other reason cause you might just miss something!

		<fullReview>I thought this show was very good actually. Sure, the acting isn't that great, it is really predictable, and very stereotypical, however it's based on a comic!! If they were playing the part, they did it spot on. Since it IS based on a comic, don't expect any real great twists in the plot or surprises; the movie is very predictable and lets you know what is going on very early. However the comic relief is really good and CGI is also. Of course they had to use a lot of CGI, but they did a good job. Downey plays his part well, however stereotypical it may be.Overall, you can find laughs every few minutes and have an enjoyable time at this movie. It is never boring and well worth $10 bucks. Of course, this assumes you simply want to go have fun at the movies and just enjoy yourself. I saw another movie last week (ryhmes with "honey bun") and this one was much better IMO.I highly recommend this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A highly entertaining and fun superhero movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! That one word sums up how I felt after leaving the theater upon seeing Iron Man. I was completely shocked, this movie was actually really good. I am not going to lie, before seeing this film I really thought it was going to be bad, I wasn't even planning on seeing it, but then reviews started coming out, and all of them were generally positive; as well, a trusted friend of mine, whose opinion on movies I hold in high regard, saw it and enjoyed it, so I thought I might give Iron Man a shot. I did, and I must say it was entirely worth it.Iron Man follows the story of billionaire playboy Tony Stark. Stark is the CEO of his company Stark Industries, which manufactures weapons for the U.S. Government. The story begins in Afghanistan, where Stark is showing a test of his new missile to U.S. troops. Soon after the test, the troops Stark is with are attacked by a terrorist group. The terrorists kidnap Stark and take him captive in a cave, here he sees that these terrorists have access to the weapons his company makes. The terrorists want to use Stark to build a missile for them, but instead he builds a gigantic iron battle suit, which he uses to escape the terrorists. Once Stark is back in the states he dismantles the weapons division of his corporation, at the same time he learns that people within his company has sold terrorists his weapons without his permission. Stark begins to perfect his iron battle suit and decides to use it to destroy all of the terrorists who use his weapons. Soon Stark learns who gave these terrorists access to his weapons, which culminates in a gigantic robotic battle in L.A. at the end of the film.Overall this was a really great movie, it was highly entertaining, and no scene ever felt rushed or too long, the pacing was perfect. The true highlight of the film though was Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, his turn as the cynical Stark was funny and picture perfect for the role. The rest of the cast was great as well, especially Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Pots, Tony's assistant and love interest; and Jeff Bridges as Obadiah, the villain of the story. Another highlight of the film was the superb screenplay, the dialogue was extremely tight, witty, and flowed very well; as well it perfectly balanced the comedy alongside the drama and action, which is something that many films nowadays don't seem to do well. Other good things included the usual terrific special effects job from ILM, and the pretty good directing from Jon Favreau (Elf), this film being his first go at doing an action movie. That brings to point the amazing action sequences in the film, there maybe weren't as many as I thought there'd be initially going into it, but there was just enough to quench your thirst, which I felt was perfect.It was really hard for me to find any fault with this film. The only minor complaint I could come up with was the characters. The problem came in the fact that the character of Tony Stark was the only three-dimensional character in this film, which wasn't bad, except when there was an occasional scene without Stark in it, the scene didn't feel as tight, because he was the only character in the film that they really spent time to examine his character and who he is. As I said this is just a minor complaint, and overall didn't affect this film really since Stark was in about 95% of the scenes in the movie.All in all Iron Man is a highly fun and entertaining superhero movie, and kicks off this summer on a high note. I was genuinely entertained throughout the film and had a lot of fun, and I think it stands tall amongst some of the best superhero movies of all-time, it is definitely one of Marvels better movies since probably Spider-man 2. Another great thing, that is worth a mention, is the great scene at the end of credits, which is almost worth the price of admission itself; just stay after the credits are over, you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend Iron Man to any movie fan, even if you are skeptical about it just give it a chance, I did and I came out loving it.I give Iron Man an amazing 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man is just golden!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Might, Iron Will, Iron Strength. These sounds like the qualities of Tony Stark(Robert Downey, Jr.) aka the Invincible Iron Man. Tony Stark is a playboy billionaire who just escaped death from a piece of shrapnel that almost cost him his life. After he succeeds from his father, Tony has no idea that there's a turncoat in his industries. Making that suit of armor is hi-tech and top notch for this man. He's got some good friends to rely on. One of them is Col. James "Rhodey" Rhodes(Terrence Howard) and Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow). This movie was totally off the hook. Plenty of action and plenty of comedy. That really put "Spiderman" to shame. All the cast were great. It's good for Robert Downey, Jr. to redeem himself from all the troubles he had in the past. Jeff Bridges did very well playing the traitorous Obediah Stone. Knowing this movie would do well, a sequel is just right around the corner. So just jet-pack yourself to the theater, and watch this movie! It's a Marvel gemstone! 5 Stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie. I went in expecting possibly a passable movie and found that there was not a moment in this very well structured movie that didn't keep me absolutely glued to my seat. This movie is well worth seeing in the cinemas. The acting was great particularly from Robert Downey Jr. I couldn't imagine the role of Tony Stark ever going to anyone else. The comedy in it was hilarious . What we need to keep in mind when rating this movie that it is a comic action flick, and as such i will rate it so.. there was no great meaning or artsy fartsy metaphors. For me this was the perfect comic book action movie. It was far better than any of the other marvels movies i have seen so far and made Transformers look like a joke. I will be going to the movies again soon for this one. 10/10 from me, i hope there is a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The animated series wasn't that good also</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up watching all kinds of cartoons. One of them was the Iron Man animated series. I must say that even if I didn't love it, I used to watch it a lot. Well since we now are living in the "cartoon/other movie to a new film era" it was more than expected to see this in a live action flick.The plot was as expected as the transition from animated series to live action movie at least. I thought it was really mediocre and cliché filled. Well that is what sells the most. But I particularly don't like that in a movie. So when people tell me that this movie is really great, I can't believe them. The main character was the typical winner, know it all, who always do the right things and never is wrong superhero (That happens when Dr. House wants to be a superhero, or in every Steven Seagal film). This was the stereotyped main character that some movies tried to eradicate (The Dark Knight or the Matrix for example). So how can we see them again? I don't know the reason but I think that many people are just tired of them like me.The acting was average. But I particularly don't like Downey. He barely even acts. In the past few years he only played as an alcoholic, troubled man. In this movie he's a winner also. It seems like an attempt of using only his looks to attract movie goers, because the talent is almost non-existence.Another point that I would like to mention is the incredible amount of sexism in this film. Women are objects for the main character, even his secretary was part of this (At first I thought she had a little bit of dignity). Is that the kind of hero we want? I certainly do notThe character from the comic book itself wasn't that good, I think that Iron Man is the worst "serious" superhero out there. Some people will disagree with me but to me this movie is just more of what we have seen a million times before, just with better effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just like the others, so why even bother?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike that of a riveting masterpiece such as Harry Potter or Pirates of the Caribbean, the title of this bland sci-fi action flick says it all. Indeed Iron Man is an offspring of SuperMAN, BatMAN Begins, SpiderMAN, CatwoMAN and various other members of the "Man" family.But however run of the mill a film might be there will always be theatres that choose to show it. Though in this case it wasn't selected only because of the spiced up posters but because of its small but nevertheless existent DNA that slightly separates it from its relatives: the secret identity of the armour-clad flying and shooting rescuer (Robert Downey Jr.) is in no way heroic like all the other superheroes, but more an immature inventor largely annoyed at the publicity coming from his success who is nothing without the suit. But luckily for him his rivals that include foreign terrorists and his own sneaky bodyguard (Jeff Bridges) are equally as ordinary and - from an audience's perspective - are nothing to fear.But aside from those few aspects it consists of nothing but the usual cinematic performances, satirical humour and a dull story of spies, fiery deaths and high-tech gadgets that mindlessly dances around in a pathetic struggle to fill in time until the curtain falls. But I suppose without near failures like these we would not be able to fully appreciate breathtaking rebels like The Incredibles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The basic concept is fun, the visuals good ... and that's about it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must be missing something or just expect way too much from films like this one, or perhaps one needs to be an fan of the comic character 'a priori' to enjoy the film fully because I found this well received movie to be fairly week in most areas ...First the good - CGI is fantastic (nothing special these days though lets face it). The acting, especially given the rather week script, is solid though overdone and thus 'unbelievable' at times. The basic story is imaginatively well conceived and the 'iron suit(s)' that (eventually) feature are a blast to watch in action.Now the bad - Like many movies these days, it assumes the audience is as thick as hardware shop. For example, the opening few scenes over state the 'playboy' image of the main protagonist in Tony Stark - the scene in the Humvee is just fine as it is and does the job. Do they leave it at this? No they jump to various scenes where we see his debaucherous life in all its excessiveness. After 30 seconds of it I was begging the movie to move on with the actual story, but it just kept going and going.I suppose theses scenes were there to have us build a sense of contempt for Stark setting up the redemptive hero that is to be born out by the movie's end. Well it achieves half the task, I certainly found his character ridiculously annoying, to the point of frustration actually. His 'debonair' billionaire obnoxiousness was so over the top and put a foul taste that struggled to go away for the duration (I mean poll dancing stewardess ... have we time warped to the '60s or something). Moreover, how could somebody who actually does nothing productive actually run a all conquering company like 'Stark Industries' ... anyway, the unfortunate thing is that, besides wanting the company to 'do good' instead of make weapons, he as a character fundamentally doesn't change and this is what bugs me about the plot ... he remains a narcissistic self obsessed overachiever to the end.These things appear in many films and certainly do not necessarily totally destroy a movie experience, after all given the 'comic book' genre one can't expect too much in character development and complex philosophical thought, but, this aside, the story line itself is full of holes. I mean how how stupid are the 'terrorist' fighters (who conveniently follow US propaganda running sheet in being overtly described as as 'foreign' fighters not Afghani locals). They capture Stark then don't notice as he builds a big hi-tech metal suit instead of something that at least vaguely looks like a missile which he is instructed to do?? It makes for a nice action sequence when all is said and done, but writers please please make some effort to create a believable universe.In end, fundamentally, the script reads like a very average comic with little thought put behind it - its a story for the sake of a story so that a talented graphic artist can put some nice visuals around it. Some might say that is what all of the DC Comic movies and their ilk are about - and maybe they're right - but some are clearly a cut above Iron Man, the recent Batman movies are a case in point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing erroneous about this Ironious film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, did I feel popcorn entertainment at the pinnacle point of 2008 when my adrenaline was running sky high as I was watching the superhero film extraordinaire "Iron Man". Robert Downey Jr. stars as Tony Stark, a billionaire weapons-manufacturer who gets captured by Middle Easterns who hold him captive in an Afghanistan prison cave. Stark uses his weaponry intellect, charismatic persona, and creative ingenuity in creating and becoming Iron Man to plan the Great Escape; eventually Stark sparks up Iron Man with precision robotics after his escapade. Sparks' assistant Pepper Potts is about the only female species who could probably tame the womanizing Tony. Let's just say that Iron Man had been pumping iron with the ladies even before Pepper sneezed in his life. Obadiah Stone is Sparks' shady business partner who might just turn out to be "obadass" villain of Iron Man. Jim Rhodes is the colonel pal of Tony who also moonlights as Sparks' public relations military "rhodie", sort-of-speak. I will not reveal more of Iron Man because I think you are going to have to iron out the facts and rough spots (if any) yourself by viewing "Iron Man". Director Jon Favreau, who starred in the indie classic "Swingers" and directed the hilarious "Elf", swings into blockbuster heaven big-time with his astonishing architecture of "Iron Man". Could be one of the premier directorial efforts of the year! Way to go Favs! Downey Jr. was the most ironic actor to play Sparks because Robert was used to living a fast "shoot them up" lifestyle (as Iron Man) in his real life when he fought a profound drug addiction problem back in the 90's; But just like Iron Man, Downey Jr. was able to get down from his high in the nick of time before facing the valley of death. Robert Downey Jr.'s heavy thespian work as Tony Sparks/Iron Man might just land him a Gold Man Best Actor nomination. Gwyneth Paltrow pushed her "acting real good" as the Pepper to her Sparks or otherwise known as Sparks &amp; Pepper. In seriousness, it was Paltrow's best work in a decade. Jeff Bridges was "metally" tough as villainous steel as the greedy Obadiah Stone/Iron Monger. Terrence Howard, a great actor of our present generation, was adequate here as Colonel Rhodes but did not fire the same acting super missiles as Downey Jr., Paltrow, and Bridges. "Iron Man" was also a special effects spectacle and an art direction delight. So strike the iron while its hot (made $105 million on its opening weekend) and program yourself to the "Iron Man". It was simply Marvelous! ***** Excellent</fullReview>

Instead of creating weapon that can fall in the hand of bad guy.He decide to devote his *second life* to protect good.Nothing new here.I have lost the count of movie,book or video game with good guy fighting evil.But this is what people love.Everyone want to be identified has a Hero.Be it a fire-worker or a POLICEMAN or superhero that can fly with superpower .If your girlfriend lose something important to her ! You will be happy to be her HERO and find it! :)Before you go watch HERO movie you know 2 crucial thing . 1:The Hero will defeat the bad guy 2:There's always a superwoman with long leg falling in love with the Hero.The Chick does fall in love with the Hero.But at least it's does not turn into a cheap Harlequin romance.Something that i appreciated. I'm quite tired of the *I always loved you* *blablabla* *kiss kiss* * sex sex* Leave the cheap romance and work on the HERO aspect of the movie.They did it correctly.The CGI are overused today and everyone will agree with me.It's easier to accept when you watch a HERO movie.When the CGI is used in IRON MAN.It's used correctly.The big *robot* don't look real.But does that make so much difference?I'm not here to believe what i'm seeing.I'm here to have fun.It's just when they cross that barrier and simply overuse it.Than , the movie turn into an anime movie.Thanks god it's was not the case with Iron man.I have never read IRON man . But i know there's difference between the two.It's was in Vietnam and not in Afghanistan that Clark was kidnapped.But when Iron man was created.It's was during the Vietnam War.So you understand why they choose Afghanistan.The base of the plot is still intact.So the fan i'm pretty sure will be pleased.The Movie is predictable but every super-hero movie is predictable.The HERO win the first big fight and at the end decide he will continue.I don't even know if it's a spoiler or not.If you're angry because i spoiled something.You really have to watch more movie.If you think the movie was predictable.YOU HAVE WATCHED A SUPERHERO MOVIE.What did you expect?</fullReview>

I already anticipated that it will be boring, childish crap, and just nonsense stuffed movie most specially since it has been based on a best selling literature (we have a saying "Don't judge a book by its movie"). But there I was, awestricken, dumbfounded, and fully amazed without an accurate emotion to express the feeling overwhelming my entire being.ever since i was a kid, i already developed curiosity and great interest to movies. That is why, as I grew older, i started to develop great criticism on the movies i get to watch so as not to be attached to them. Like i remember rationalizing over some fictitious things getting into animated characters. A newly developed habit that most of the time kill the enjoyment over seeing movies i once had when i was kid. But then, as the movie progressed, every second has just passed without my logic convincing me that THIS IS STUPID! A METAL CANNOT FLY NOR BE INVULNERABLE TO BULLETS! Mind you, I really did experience full time enjoyment as if everything in the world can explode without me being panicky. I didn't even remember that I was alone cause my friends turned me down on this one.so for that, all i can say is that this movie is something all stressful people should watch. every cent you paid on this one is a well spent money, i believe. It isn't just another movie made to showcase gorgeous body &amp; perfect faces. It is more than that. It is a movie packed with a great sets of talents ( I literally mean GENUINE talents ), great mind, and futuristic technologies. So for those who really like to give themselves a break, try this one! Cause for some weird reason, you'll find yourself with your brain relaxed, satisfied and amazed! A feeling i thought i lost long time ago!P.S. the only con i have for this movie is that it's as if it has been made so as for US to inflict intimidation, fear, and dread to the world. It's as if they're showing us how they can be that modern and advanced when it comes to warfare. And how they can make a war by giving out enemies the means to level with them. Well, I just hope that what the movie portrayed isn't really and won't be happening to real life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's no ELF, but it's a lot of fun...and way better than ZATHURA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited when I first learned that John Favreau would be directing IRON MAN. He brings a new and nostalgic energy to the his movies especially ELF. IRON MAN continues that winning formula, though ZATHURA is far from a classic, but my kids dig it,IRON MAN is well made, but follows the typical path of your first in a series of super hero movies. Everything has to be established the first time around...and after having seen several super hero movies it's a little bit boring. 55% of the film is spent watching our hero construct the 2 versions of his super suit, which is kinda fun but kinda not. I did love IRON MAN's first outing in his souped up super suit, that's the only time I was completely eating it up. Don't get me wrong, this is a good film, but it is a bit limited by establishing itself. Without Robert Downey Jr and the rest of the great cast this movie would just be fine...but they lift it to nearly excellent.I definitely do recommend an outing at the cinema for this, but I'm sure the second one will totally rock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie with low expectations, which were fulfilled as I viewed this movie. Robert Downey Jr. does a relatively good job of portraying Tony Stark. The CGI was very well done. Aside from that, the movie didn't have much else to offer. They chose to use Jeff Bridges as the primary antagonist, which didn't work out too well for me. I mean come on, he was "The Dude" in the Big Lebowski. It was a bit hard to take him seriously after I heard him speak. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that it had to be about weapons in Afghanistcan. Personally, I am tired of all that business going on overseas and I don't want to see anymore of that dribble. The plot of the movie was poorly done and loosely thrown together. The movie lacked action and the final fight scene is "meh," to say the least. If you are a fan of thrown together super hero movies, then I recommend this film. If not, then you might want to save your money for the new Indiana Jones or The Dark Knight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for Iron Man i was really impressed. Not only by the quality of both - trailer and his content - but by the fact, that there is really going to be an Iron Man movie. When i went to the cinema to saw the movie, my expectations were beyond normal. It wasn't the same feeling like when Transformers or Batman Begins came out - there I barely could wait for the first scene and I was swallowing every detail.Iron Man was a really good film. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Spark was a great choice and he maintained his role perfectly. The approach to life, work and his level of sarcasm and irony were holding his character above the line. Obviously that behavior changed through the film. What I really liked about Iron Man was the structure of the script and the atmosphere of how a hero was born. That was very similar with Batman Begins - in both films the director concentrates on the origins and reasons why everything happened. Right in the middle of the film I realized that it's more than just another comics remake, it is again a symbol that will impress millions of people and when I walked out the cinema i was very pleased by the film.Summarising - Great plot, excellent actors, great effects (sticks by the rule "little is sometimes more than too much", great point)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is an excellent movie. Jon Favreau did a good job on the direction. Everybody will enjoy the movie. The director is also in his movie. He has the role of a bodyguard for Robert Downey, jr. Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow play very well their role. This movie has an interesting score. The suit of Tony Stark is awesome. I wish i could have a suit like this and fly with the speed of sound. Seeing Jeff Bridges bald was a shock for me but he looks good with it. He is the right actor to play the Iron Monger. I wish i could have the computer system that they use in the movie: cool graphics. In the movie they use the new Audi R8. It is a very nice car.To see all that go see the movie this weekend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The racist marvel action hero.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the first 20 minutes of the film, I was already beginning to wonder why I had purchased tickets. The main character was a terrible human being. A Womanizing, spoilt playboy who manufactures weapons of mass destruction. What a hero? There are no real likable characters in the entire film. The storyline is dragged out and uneventful. The action barely worth the film roll it's printed on. There is a naively racist vibe running throughout. With the 'hero' only realizing making weapons may be a bad idea, once he witnesses Americians dying by his creations. As if the countless innocents of less fortunate countries being murdered beforehand weren't worth his thought.It was like watching old cartoons that are so racist, they don't even know it. The film was mildly entertaining, however the characters all being terrible people took away from the fun of Iron Man. There weren't enough scenes of Iron Man doing great deeds, to classify him as a hero. His actions seemed selfishly motivated, and egotistical.The only stand out in the film was the suit.</fullReview>

I like him but please we cannot forget. So I find that amusing, along with the peppered script of good goody, gee gollies dialog. every one in the movie is a parody of the character, even Jeff Bridges whom I'm sure only did this one to play a bad guy. half way threw the plot.Remember Fire engine red is the go sign for profit, when it only turns your minds on fire.So now..."damn...

Robert Downey Jr. did quite well in being a humorous playboy,but failed to be smart.i think it's not him to blame but the screenplay.what's more,can't arise a little sense of worship in me.he just doesn't look like a super hero.Gwyneth Paltrow did quite well in being a beautiful,thoughtful,helpful assistant.their relationship is quite interesting in the film. you may notice i didn't give a very low rated.that's because,though not great in any aspect,it's not terrible any where except for the rotten screenplay,which may not be very important in this kind of movies.it's lighthearted,humorous,interesting to watch,and above average level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why? Because the story is boring. I am sick; it is enough...The film is too political and it shouldn't be...especially with a super hero.I am a very sensitive guy and extremely peaceful. If you don't like the US external politic in the past few years it is better not to see the movie. Iron Man becomes a tool of the powerful administration. Pretty bad! To recap, the special effects are interesting and well build, the acting is good (Jeff Bridges and Robert Downey Jr are fantastic in general, but here I consider that they are on average; sometimes Robert seems not to be Robert), and, again I have to say, the story is straightforward. I didn't feel any emotion seeing this movie, and the same political US messages (I think the whole world had enough in the past few years) are everywhere (especially in the beginning of the movie; that turned me off).Of course, the movie is for a mature category because the teenagers will not go deeper into the details. Overall, a boring and bad movie.</fullReview>

If you didn't enjoy this movie, you are not paying enough attention. It defeats the X-men, Ghost Rider, Fantastic four, Bat-man, and all other Super hero based movies with ease.I recommend this film to the highest degree and its a must see.

Acting is great and I am so happy to see Gwyneth Paltrow back in the movie business after a while. Robert Downey junior was also really good as the sleazy millionaire turned superhero.

		<fullReview>This film is about a wealthy weapon developer making a superhero suit, and uses it to fight against evil forces.After watching "Iron Man" I felt so disappointed. I think it is not as good as the ratings suggest. The pacing is incredibly slow for a fantasy action hero movie. It's well over 30 minutes and Stark is still developing the suit! The plot is not very engaging either, it is not exciting enough. The characters are poorly developed too. I do not find myself care for any of the characters, except maybe Stark. Poor Gwyneth Paltrow, she is such a supporting character in here, and her role could be played by anyone. Action scenes are sparse and short, and not exciting at all. The subplot about battles in Afghanistan feels more like an oppositional political propaganda, rather than the story actually needs. "Iron Man" needs a script rewrite and a much tighter editing to make it more thrilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Am (Almost) Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At just over two hours, Iron Man packs in a lot of story, a lot of gadgetry, a lot of special effects and a lot of everything every other superhero movie throws at you to get your $12. But was it worth every penny? Yes and no.As I mentioned in my last Iron Man post, IM was one of my two favorite comic books when I was a kid. I actually own IM #2, although its probably worthless since its nearly in tatters. What I liked about IM was it was somewhat grounded in reality. In other words, Tony Stark was a real guy elevated to being a badass only because he was capable of building a badass suit. The other thing I liked about Stark were his flaws...and he had a lot of them.I went into the theater today with very high expectations. The trailers gave me glimpses of everything I liked about the comic book and perhaps even a lot more. But having ridiculously high expectations, it is pretty hard to ever be blown away. The truth is, I never felt blown away by IM and the reason I wasn't was simply because it was too much like every other comic book hero movie I've ever seen and I wanted it to be more.There is no question the gadgetry and techo porn in this movie was on hyperdrive and every time Stark was engineering his wares, I was there with him, wanting to be him, wanting to play with his toys (please don't read into that). Everything about Stark exudes cool: the gadgets, the clothes, the women, the cars, the house and yes, the attitude. This movie will do very well at the box office simply because it is wish fulfillment for every single guy with a hard drive and a hard on, which is damn near every heterosexual male in America (if not the world).But where this movie let me down is an area that might make me the worst person to have a fair opinion on this movie: I wanted it to do something completely different, I wanted it to redefine the genre. While it definitely ups the ante in terms of gadgetry, tech and special FX, it follows the same story arc that every other super hero movies follows: man undergoes metamorphosis, man reinvents himself, man sets out to right the world's wrongs, man is confronted by other man or entity who represents every thing that is wrong with the world, man battles foe in herculean climax scene, movie ends. Sure IM quite possibly is the mastery of this formula, but it didn't leave me feeling satisfied.As for the performances in the film, Robert Downey Jr is perfect. Knowing his personal past, we can see the parallel he shares with Tony Stark, trading in a life of excess for a rebirth into a stronger, more moral and more important person. Jeff Bridges oozes evil right down to the way he slurps at his scotch. Terrence Howard on the other hand is wall paper, barely noticeable and utterly bland. Gwyneth Paltrow convinced me of one thing: she is not a strong actor. Director Jon Favreau does a great job emulating the IM comic book world, packing this film full of thrills, eye candy and laughs. What I found most effective about this world is that it seems entirely plausible. Who knows, with the continuing advancements in tech, perhaps one day an engineer will build a real world Iron Man suit and when it rears its head in this ugly world, then and only then will there be an IM story worthy of my high expectations.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not intelligent and hardly a superhero movie. Children and stupid people will probably enjoy it a lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't normally write reviews. The fact that this movie at the time of writing has an average vote of 8 compelled me to set the record straight.A bunch of reviewers called this movie intelligent. From that I can only conclude that they are not. There are so many thing stupidly done I will not even try to state all of them, only the stupidest.WARNING - there is some stuff that might be regarded as spoilers, but I don't really think they are. I mean, you know there's gonna be a bad guy and a final battle. And the other stuff is from the first thirty minutes so it's hardly spoiling. Don't worry, I've tried hard not to give away anything important, but if you're paranoid, skip the review. But trust me when I tell you the movie is full of stupidity.First of all - Stark builds some kind of tiny, yet extremely powerful energy source in a remote cave? Stark mentions some ridiculous number as the output power of the device. I can just hear the writer/director/whoever saying "Oh, we'll just mention something the average moviegoer has never heard of, like Palladium, and they'll totally buy it." Well Mr. writer/director/whoever, some of us actually know something about science and can recognize bullshit like this a mile away.And that's not all. You see, in this cave Stark builds a complete flying exoskeleton using only crude tools, all within a week. All the time being monitored by the bad guys with surveillance cameras. Bad guys who are apparently so stupid that they don't realize what Stark is building isn't even close to what they made him build.We're not even close to being done here. In his remote cave, Stark also manages to fashion some kind of super-metal that he builds his suit with. A metal so strong that only a thin sheet of it is able to withstand heavy caliber machine gun fire without so much as deforming, much less being penetrated.Oh, and that little super power generator I told you about? It's apparently indestructible, since Stark doesn't protect it at all - we see it glowing on the chest of his suit.I forgot to mention that Stark has a hole in his chest. You see, he got some shrapnel in his body and a doctor the bad guys had patch Stark up made this hole in the middle of his chest to put an electromagnet in which was supposed to keep the shrapnel from entering Stark's heart.Wait, the guy's got shrapnel in his bloodstream? And he's running around the cave no problem? The hole in his skin and sternum doesn't appear to be contributing to any infections either. Then when he gets home he asks his assistant to take out the old power device so he can put in a new and improved version he made. She then proceeds to put her ENTIRE FIST inside his chest where his heart's supposed to be.This is getting long so I'll wrap it up. Just one stupid cliché for the final battle. Stark in his suit against - you guessed it - a guy in an even bigger suit. Like three times bigger. So big it's not even an exoskeleton, it's a mecha. Honestly, that final battle looked like Transformers. And you know how crappy that movie was.Regarding the classification of Iron Man as a superhero movie - there isn't much superheroing going on. Aside from the final battle, Stark kicks some ass in his suit for maybe ten minutes. If you want to watch an intelligent superhero movie, I sincerely recommend Watchmen.In conclusion, the director and writer could have done a much better job. Either they're stupid or they're catering to a stupid audience. Too bad because the idea has potential. Iron Man definitely does not deserve an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overrated movie that is somewhat of a mess, and fails to entertain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man is a movie that had some good ideas, but failed to realize them. Here's the bad: The pacing of the movie was rather poor. Rather than presenting its events in a fashion in which they build upon each other, therefore building the movie up like a great structure, it rather mixes things around, spending more time on small things than on the big things, making it seem kind of uneven, sort of misformed. Too much time is spent on building the suit. The CGI, for some reason, seeing as how this has the potential to make so much money, is mediocre at the very best. It is really obvious that what your seeing has been made by a computer. The movie is only 126 minutes long, but feels much longer. There isn't enough action. There's three scenes of action, his battle against the terrorists, the skirmish with the jets, and the battle against the Iron Monger at the end. These scenes feel much too short when compared to the non-action scenes, and i know, you have to spend time on the characters, but this movie spends way too much time on its characters, and that time isn't well spent. The action isn't well crafted, isn't designed well to be that thrilling, and there-for isn't. There is also a very clear potential for greatness with Tony Stark and a character named Yessin in the beginning, a very clear potential for some entertaining and well done character development, but what could have been great was muddled by some less than great writing and pacing. The acting was good, but did suffer in some parts, and wasn't some landmark as people have claimed. Bottom line, Iron Man, i don't think, is very good, because it doesn't have any parts that would make me want to watch again. Cloverfield has the same Re-watch inefficieny, but it was actually well done, and much more memorable. I gave Iron Man a 6 because it isn't terrible, but very, very mediocre. I don't understand, at all, all of the praise going towards it,especially all the critical praise. I wouldn't see it again, simply because the entertainment wouldn't be there. You can see it if you want, but you might not have nearly as much fun as you would like.</fullReview>

This is the best superhero movie EVER made. His dialogue delivery and style is fun to watch. His comic timing is excellent. The action sequences are marvelous although my some of the friends still felt the requirement of some more action scenes in the movie. Back ground music is excellent. The subtle message in the movie is quite appreciable. The direction and script writing is excellent. The scence involving high tech lab. Of Tony stark is quite impressive. I highly recommend this movie to everyone..coz "Iron man is borne with the aim..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man Begins........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm just back from the theatre, and have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. There is nothing out-standing about it, and I don't really have the urge to go back and view it for a second time, I would however recommend everyone to go at least once and see it on the big screen.The Positives- Robert Downey Jnr is a rather dashing, and likable Tony Stark. His performance is assured and pretty much spot on.Special Effects are very much up to scratch, Iron Man looks awesome throughout his evolution on screen.Humour and tone. Lots of laugh out loud moments thanks to some sharp writing and some RDJ dead pan deliveries.The Plausibiltity factor, it almost feels (similiarly to Batman Begins) as if something like this is feasible (In the not too distant future). Yes its still fantasy but tangible fantasy.The Negatives- Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrace Howard and Mr Bridges all under-used, some terribly under-used.The action sequences could have been better. Not enough super hero at work scenes (They will be in part 2 I'm sure). The final battle I though was slightly weaker than it could and should have been considering the build up.Overall the positives out-weight the negatives, an enjoyable way to spend two hours. Not a patch on Batman Begins, but no other comic book movie has in my opinion, but its still way above average for a movie of this genre.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Synopsis) Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the CEO of Stark Industries which produces advance weapon systems for the U.S. military. Tony's father started the company after WWII, and after his death Tony inherited the company, worth billions. Tony lives the life as a hard drinking, rich playboy ladies man, but he is also a genius who has invented many high-tech items for the company. Tony flies to Afghanistan to demonstrate a new weapons test to the army. On his way back to his plane, his convoy is attacked by terrorists, and Tony is wounded by a Stark Industries missile. Tony is captured and held hostage in a cave with Raza (Faran Tahir), a doctor who saves his life. The terrorists force Tony and Raza to reproduce the new destructive Jericho missile Tony was demonstrating from parts of other weapons. Instead, Tony decides to build a suit of armor with Raza's help. The suit gives Tony the strength and protection to be able to escape the terrorists. Back in America, Tony builds a better suit of armor which gives him superhuman strength with the ability to fly. With the help of his personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), Tony vows to protect the world as Iron Man.(My Comment) After 40 years, this is the first movie based on Marvel's comic book superhero, Iron Man. The special effects in this move were fantastic, and I wanted more. Robert Downey Jr. is terrific as Tony Stark, as he shows his charm and wit in every situation he encounters. Robert has some of the same traits as Tony, making him a perfect fit for the character. Robert is able to make you believe that he actually changes from an egocentric person into a humanitarian. Jeff Bridges does a convincing job in his part as the power-hungry villain. Gwyneth Paltrow is just charming as Pepper. The movie has action, comedy, and even some drama. The storyline was a little slow for the first hour, but that was because it is showing the birth of a new superhero. Once Iron Man goes into action, it is all good from there on. This movie has sequel written all over it. The next movie can begin with Iron Man saving the world. (Paramount Pictures, Run Time 2:06, Rated PG-13)(7/10)</fullReview>

Whereas recent Marvel movies sucked at best (Blade Trinity, FF: both of em, X-Men: the last stand - Brett Ratner should've never been allowed to direct and Ghost Rider - same goes for Mark Steven Johnson) this one truly delivers the goods even though i have to admit I was unsure about Jon Faverau at first.Whatever you've seen in the trailer - The film is 10 times better unlike the afore mentioned outings where I almost feel robbed of my money. Robert Downey Jr. is a revelation as Iron Man he gives Christian Bales/Batman a serious run for his money.That said I'm looking forward to the Invincible Hulk again after Ang Lee made him look like a chubby something in the mental state of an 3year old.To put it simple Batman ain't got s*** on Iron Man!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man Eats His Spinach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From what I can see of Iron Man, he's different from other superheroes in two respects. First he's quite the vulnerable one and second he's put together with extreme, but very human intelligence. Nobody came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond mortal men. No one got their DNA mixed up with some animal to give them some extra-sapien traits. No Iron Man is put together in a laboratory after a prototype is done while in captivity in a cave.That's probably both the strength and weakness of this film. Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and most of all Jeff Bridges look like they're having a great old time putting flesh and bone on comic strip characters. I'm glad they enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I normally do these kind of films.Iron Man is updated to today's world situation, but with some Thirties flashbacks because it's an arms dealer who is the chief villain here. Downey is like Bruce Wayne, a multimillionaire heir to an armaments fortune who likes to have a good time as well as work while Bridges minds the company day to day. But that MIT education did not go for naught as those Afghan terrorists found out. Downey proves as resourceful as B.A. Baracus of the A-Team in developing the Iron Man first to escape captors and then to defeat bad guys. And these bad guys are quite in league.But while the special effects are nice and the players are having a good time, Iron Man reminded me of a Popeye cartoon. Downey and Bridges looked Popeye and Bluto in the best two out of three falls. All that Downey needed to do was reach for that can of Spinach.I half expected he would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish they could have found a way to make the Iron Man technology fall a little more in the realm of realism, but instead they took the 'transformers' route and made the technology from 200 to 300 years in the future, literally. Some will say, "yeah but its a movie, so who cares?" and to a certain extent I agree, but in this particular case the technology is so far from what is possible now, that the whole movie made no sense because it was presented as if it was happening in the modern day. This lack of realism affected the whole movie to the extent that when I walked out, I felt like I had seen a film about cavemen building F1 race cars and putting on their own Indy 500. It was that insane.At least in 'Batman Begins' the technology was only off by 10-20 years, and it was set in an alternate universe where the exact date was never set, so I was able to suspend disbelief for 2 hours with no problem.The lack of realism is further hindered by the obvious fact that they never built the suit, it was 100% digital from start to finish. This is lame in the same way that not making a single storm trooper suit for the last 3 star wars movies was lame. Lame! I hope Iron Man is the last big movie in the super hero genre because I for one am completely sick to death of getting the two hour origin story of every new hero thats introduced on film. Can you imagine the 2 hour origin of Thor or Namor? Somebody kill me before these movies are made...Robert Downey was Tony Stark, I'll give him that, best part of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do intelligent people like this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it - didn't like it.For starters, it's views on women shocked me. Yeah, maybe I'm a little bit too pro-feminism, but when the private jet's air-hostesses turned into pole dancers - I looked around the cinema as if to say "Is anyone else seeing/believing this?" (and Pepper Potts, please decide whether to be a strong independent woman, or a blathering idiot who needs male permission to do anything). Yeah yeah I know, Tony Stark is a chauvinistic billionaire who can have what he wants - that's like, the point (why I'm meant to identify with such a character is beyond me).....but that can-do-anything point was taken too far for me, when in under a week, in a cave, working from hand drawings, with only 1 helper, using only scrap, Tony Stark not only solves the world's energy problems by miniaturizing a zero-point energy device, but he also builds an invincibility suit. Builds them both. Under a week. Scrap metal. Thin plot much?I like comics when they make the unrealistic, plausible. I hate movies when they do the opposite.Also, they made a classic mistake of bad movie writing: not enough reason was shown for the bad guy to be bad. I mean he tries to kill the son of his life-long friend. Bad guy's are too often unreified victims of poor writing - the result for me is that I come to sympathise with them.All this leaves me with a big question of course - why do so many intelligent people like this movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Does Try But The Blockbuster Agenda Gets In The Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've little interest in Marvel comic books and how they tie in with cinema blockbusters but wasn't unimpressed with this version of IRON MAN . The story starts with Tony Stark a weapons industrialist visiting Afghanistan and being captured by insurgents so right away you've got a topical theme that ties in with the real world . Robert Downey Jnr is very well cast as Stark who starts of as a philistine but the performance by Downey does give a subtle feeling of redemption as he battles against The Ten Rings , an international terrorist organisation who have access to Stark's super-weapons and Stark as Iron Man battles to defeat them As good as the film is since it tries to be topical and has an emphasis on character I feel I can't give it a higher than average mark down to the agenda of making it a loud , noisy , flashy Summer blockbuster featuring explosions and special effects . The climax featuring Iron Man fighting traitor Stane might appeal to some cinema fans but I became instantly bored by the spectacle and much enjoyed the smaller , serious character drive parts of the movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironic Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were definitely things I liked about Iron Man. I liked the Tony Stark character overall and I was pleasantly surprised by Downey Jr's acting. The building and testing of the second generation suit segment was fun and entertaining. I also really appreciated that they folded the original 1960's Iron Man cartoon theme music into the soundtrack. Nerd gem, that.The second half of the movie is predicated on the rather silly construct, if you will, of this jury-rigged bullet deflecting suit of armor that our hero made in the caves in Afghanistan*. You can't really get around that with a movie about a suit of power armor, so I'm willing to forgive that convention.Gwyneth Paltrow seemed completely out of her element. I get the sense that she just didn't get her character or the movie or both. Everything about her and her relationship with Stark was completely awkward and I wanted it to go away. The whole sequence of her being chased by Stane and being a damsel in distress over a cell phone was B.A.D.With regards to Jeff Bridges as Stane - I appreciated the moxie of this casting. I really wanted it to work but by the end of the film, it didn't. They took a good, smart, interesting character (though I would have liked to have had some more background and character development on this Stane fellow) and stripped him down to a one-dimensional idiot in a giant robot suit by the end of the film. They pitch-shifted his voice down to a suitably evil level and he transitioned from a realistic threat to a cartoony super villain. Now I know what you're thinking: "Toren, how can you fault a movie for being cartoony when it's based on what is essentially a cartoon?" Well, dear reader, the fault lies in trying to treat your subject matter with a serious, realistic tone, and then hamstringing that tone with cartooniness. Mixing the two is a delicate dance that few can pull off.I don't even know what to say about the final battle. It wasn't anything to write home about and it was surprisingly short. Except for the part where Iron Man was hanging on to the skylight frame and yelling at Pepper?that was not short at all. And did I miss something that explained how Pepper survived the falling glass AND the huge explosion from the reactor right beside her? Obadiah Stane's remark about how in trying to nullify the world's weapons Stark ironically created the world's most dangerous one pretty much sums up the problem with the movie. It seemed on the verge of addressing some compelling issues and then brushed them aside for a CGI melee. Stane et al said that Stark came back a changed man after his experience in Afghanistan. It was alluded to that he was mad. He certainly came across as a nut asking the press to sit on the floor while he chowed down on Burger King. I liked where that was going and I wanted to see more. Here is a guy that obviously has an inner conflict and a lot of baggage and he deals with them in a way that no one could call sane - by building a suit of power armor for himself - but the movie approaches it as if it's the logical route (rather than, say, using his fiscal power to make policy changes - I know, boring subject for a movie but that's the other extreme here, and something in the middle could have been just as entertaining), and that he's a good man with a heart who is doing the right thing. Down with the crazy Afghan warmongers and up with the crazy American warmongers, rah rah rah. The story would flip flop from serious to frivolous - from helpless villagers being separated from their families and executed to cartoony robot battles - so that I simply became confused about what the movie was about. My best guess is "unaddressed post traumatic stress disorder + unlimited cash = flying killing vengeance machine." The bottom line is that making a realistic, faithful Iron Man adaptation set in today's world is an enormous task. Hats off for trying, I say. I can't think of how I would go about making a better script but just because the task is herculean doesn't make the final product any less lackluster.*Why the weapons demo that preluded the sequence couldn't be done in a safe US military proving ground zone isn't addressed.</fullReview>

And it's an explosive entree indeed - Iron Man is this season's blockbuster film.For genius weapons expert and industrialist ? Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) ? WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) are his forte. However after a terrible accident, in which this playboy billionaire is abducted by enemy forces, things take a dramatic turn.Tony Stark is forced to build an indestructible machine to free himself from his captors. This watershed in his life is not without its perils. Soon the enemy within Stark Industries is intent on revenge, but Iron Man himself is soon coming into his own.The special effects are dazzling and the character development sublime ? this action-packed adventure is loaded with stunning visuals and awesome pyrotechnics. For fans of the genre Iron Man is guaranteed to be a knockout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Comic Book Action Sunk By Flimsy Plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, I am an ardent fan of Marvel Comics and even though my favourite superhero happens to be Spidey, I decided to catch this flick as comic book film adaptations have always been a must-see for me.As expected, this film draws its blood from the Iron Man comics from Marvel and Favreau directs this one beautifully. Downey's performance as the poor little rich boy Tony Stark is average to say the least and his chemistry with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is awkward. However, this does not totally derail the film from its track of satisfying the Iron Man fans in the aisles.The premise and basically the whole plot of the film is stupefyingly simple which in a positive way, does not distract the viewers from the actual action sequences but does pull down the quality of cinematography for this film. Tony Stark builds a suit and fights bad guys climaxing with a furious battle against the main villain. Works for comic books but in this case, you'll probably figure out who's the arch nemesis from the very beginning which really kills the plot head-on. Not that there's anything wrong with it since Spider-man, X-Men and other comic book film adaptations worked around it fine but somehow, Iron Man doesn't quite pull it off.Perhaps it's the stereotypical fact of Stark being an American and having to fight USA's number one enemy (read: Middle-Eastern Caucasian-hating terrorists). Or maybe it's how the arch nemesis goes overboard at displaying how he's the baddest of all badasses. Or it's just the fact that there's only a SINGLE part where Iron-Man actually fights bad guys before the final sequences with the main villain. I for one would have preferred Stark take on more bad guys instead of just having a major part of the movie focused on the drama of Stark's personal and corporate life.The ending is particularly unsurprising so don't expect any shocking revelations. A cliff- hanger it may be but still, anyone watching could've spotted it a mile away.In short, Iron Man is an average quality comic book film adaptation which is worth a watch but I doubt you'll be resisting the urge to watch it again and again like Spider-man or X- Men since there's really nothing much that hasn't been done by earlier films. Granted, if you're a truly fervent Iron Man fan, it's a definite must-see but if you have no interest in comic book superheroes and the like, I suggest you give this one a rain check unless you have a passion for CGI action sequences and get a hard-on watching things blow up.Iron Man succeeds at being a satisfying film but seems hurried and leaky. Do look out for Stan Lee's cameo as a, without spoiling it, playboy. That's a cute scene by itself since Stan Lee cameos in all Marvel Comics films. Get a ticket, munch on popcorn and stretch yourself when it's done because it's just another film based on a comic book superhero, nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not expecting a revolutionary movie when I saw Iron Man and I didn't get one. The concept was interesting enough, albeit completely predictable. What stopped with movie from being a true summer blockbuster was 1) horrible casting and 2) a very slow plot. First casting. Really, almost everyone was miscast in this film. Downey Jr was so out of place as a Superhero, even more so as a child genus. Paltrow was so-so, not bad but I refuse to believe that was best they could do for such a big budget movie. Chemistry between Downey and Paltrow was non-existent. Worse them both combine was the terrorist, lead by Tahir. Not a single of one of these guys fit the role at. As for the plot, it has all the staples of a poorly written comic book adaptation; huge plot holes, poor continually (it would take a lab of scientist years to build a suite like that, but Downey Jr builds not one but two in a few months?) and a very predictable plot. All and all, when something did finally happen, it was pretty entertaining to look at. I wouldn't see it again and I'm glad I only paid six bucks at the midnight show. I was a decent movie for the start of summer but certainly not its pinnacle or anything near it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole movie feels as nonchalant as Downey Jr's acting of Tony Stark ; the script is lazy, none of the premises are really exploited, namely: Interesting story of a repentant weapon seller whose only asset is his ability to design more weapons, his alcohol problem (from the comics as written by Michelinie et Layton), Possibilities of cool action scenes.All of these interesting tracks are blurred way too early within the uninspired and conventional story, with a bad guy as thin as a cigarette paper, despite Jeff Bridges' deserving effort. His characters doesn't make sense in any way and is just a comfortable excuse for a couple of almost spectacular action scenes in a lazy script.Robert Downey Jr is magnetic (no pun intended) but has so little to play with, it's not enough to sustain any kind of tension nor interest.Terrence Bland has a very badly written character and does its best with it, but it fails at having any kind of legitimacy in a story that seems to have included him because it had to.Paltrow isn't even trying to be the part. She was probably mimicking Downey's nonchalance, looking as if she was on vacations and asked at the last minute to say a couple of line here and there.What's left? The cool design of Iron Man's costumes, closed to those imagined by Granov. Nice visual when he's flying. Some funny moments. Not enough to qualify as a good movie.I'm very disappointed. The frustrating thing is it had a much bigger potential than the fantastic four, yet I feel the fantastic four have better succeeded in its own way, as a brainless entertainment. Iron Man feels like a movie that had an ambition, but doesn't want to show it had an ambition and it doesn't even succeed as good brainless entertainment. BUT... My 5 yo kid loved it. So, here's the redemption for it, as far as I'm concerned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night and was a little disappointed.the movie wasn't bad but also wasn't as great as i thought it would be, Robert Downey Jnr played a perfect Tony Stark/Iron Man. The CGI in my eyes looked awesome, the only down fall in this movie were the non-action parts where the talking just dragged on a little to long.I did enjoy watching this movie and it did leave me wanting to see more... This movie reminded me on how i felt when i saw LOTR: Fellowship of the rings.Wasn't enough action but a lot of talking... When i saw the other 2 LOTR movies i was very surprised on how much action was in them. So this could be like that with the other Sequels, I guess Jon Faverau was trying to get the boring stuff out of the way first and bring it all on in the Sequels.No Samuel "The Man" Jackson/Nick Fury in this one was another let down.All in all I enjoyed watching this movie just not as much as i thought I would of. I cant wait for Sequels, hopefully through the sequels ill see more of the suite in action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like watching movies that are scripted and approved by the Pentagon watch this movie. It is a blatant advertisement for the US military and is an insult to any intelligence anywhere. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. Even if you ignore the what is obviously an hour and a half recruitment effort to try and get you children in the US to sign up for invading foreign countries to continue the atrocities of the last two presidential terms - the plot sucks. Not much in special effects and the acting is 3rd rate all around.As super hero movies goes - fantastic four - silver surfer is far better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr. is perfect! Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect! Terrence Howard is Perfect...and Jeff Bridges is brilliant! -There is something deliciously great and different about seeing The Big Lebowski play Tony Stark's second In Command. Bridges is truly one of the best actors of his generation, and I guess the same thing can be said about Downey Jr:I believe it is important, even essential, to get actors with such comedic talents as Michael Keaton and now Robert Downey Jr. to play these superhero types. It proves for far more interesting watching than an actor who puts his chin out and plays it sooooooo serious all the time. This is a role that perhaps Mel Gibson could have played 20 years ago, but other than him I can't really picture anyone else having pulled it of so efortlessly.The movie is entertaining with blasting action scenes and a director that clearly knows what he's doing, but what struck me the most was the chemistry beetween the leads and how well the dialogue scenes were handled. Gwyneth Paltrow is so real and beautiful in her part and you can feel the relationships between the characters is already built in and feels real.....check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well re-mastered legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since Marvel Comics and CGI started their mystical marriage in the late 1990s, we've had superheroes galore. Hulks, Surfers, Spidermen, not to mention constantly renewed Batmans and Supermans. So what does Iron Man have to offer that's different? A flawed character that becomes honourable is the answer, triumphing in the battle of Good over Evil in spite of being a bit of a prat.Add to that some of the best features of Robocop, Batman Begins and Terminator II, and you have one of the more satisfying comic-books-turned-blockbuster that we've seen for a while.Billionaire and genius Tony Stark ? with a personality vaguely based on Howard Hughes ? is a weapons inventor that gets captured by bad guys in Afghanistan. Forced to work for them, he has other plans. Stark, nicely played by Robert Downey Jr, fashions a hi-tech suit of armour - before going on to save the world in usual exemplary fashion.This long build-up ? to explain how he becomes Iron Man ? is arguably the best part of the film. Ingenious special effects give Stark's futuristic Malibu mansion a sci-fi rather than fantasy feel. And the subtle build-up makes us more forgiving as the story slips slowly into comic-book reality.There are, of course, compromises. It has to appeal to kids as well as adults, so there is none of the gutsiness of Terminator I (or similar adult-orientated sci-fi). And in spite of the heavy moral-political issues at stake, Iron Man stays politically bland ? this being the only way to get D.O.D. approval and hence associated goodies like fighter jets and military hardware.One of the most interesting ideas for me in the film was the idea of 'zero accountability'. This takes the form of having all the wealth, brains and playboy attributes that fiction writers can imagine, but could also be a symbol for U.S. military might, for instance. Stark's first premise, of power being the ultimate deterrent (and hence a peace-keeping force) is undermined when the enemy gets hold of the same weapons and starts killing indiscriminately. Theologians might also muse how power itself has no moral authority. Good guys have to grudgingly beseech permission from whoever wields the biggest thunderbolt.Iron Man, essentially a symbol of power, abounds in biblical references, even if these come more from the comic book creators than any learning on the part of filmmakers. Jericho, the name given to Stark's finest military weapon, was the city that had to be destroyed, 'as an outward display of faith.' Which makes for great symbolism. Until you consider that modern-day Jericho is in the West Bank of the Palestinian territories, and then Stark's 'rockets' start to look a lot more loaded.Iron Man's technology has a special feature to avoid targeting civilians. Now this is one military development I would love to see.The second half of the movie is pure action, but with a well-delivered script and sufficient plot-twists to keep you engaged. Out-of-reach love-interest materialises as Gwyneth Paltrow, who I found very agreeable to watch, and the excellent supporting cast also includes Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. This is a film that tries to please everyone and largely succeeds. It's a two-hour thrill-ride that offers a new action-hero for our CGI-sated palates.On a personal note, my big disappointment was the title track ? or rather lack of it. Having heard one of the most famous heavy metal riffs of all time in the trailer, I couldn't wait to see Iron Man flying through the skies to the sound of Black Sabbath's rock anthem. Sadly, the riff is all you get (probably cos the words seem to be based on an altogether different story). But if you sit through the closing credits hoping for more, you do at least get a very important extra scene. So you've been warned: don't leave the cinema beforehand!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironman more like Iron-LAME</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is an attempt at saving your life by persuading you not to see this movie. Single worst effort in film making I've ever seen. Gwyneth Paltrow is gross they should have gotten some hot broad to play that part then I might have gained some semblance of entertainment from this pathetic excuse of a blockbuster. Iron man is the worst super hero ever, hands down. Like I heard the incredible hulk beat him up in a back alley once, and that's how you know your an awful hero. Rumor has it Downy Jr. only got the part because he entered an Iron Lungs contest against Colin Ferrel to see who could smoke more marijuana in a 10 minute time period, and Jr. only won because he secretly laced Ferrel's and he passed out. Iron Man was written by James Favreau's 12 year old son, with the help of that bumbling idiot Toby Mcguire. Mcguire was able to manipulate Favreau's son into creating an even worse flick than spaceman, to prevent spaceman from being the obviously most awful super hero movie ever. Hopefully someone sends out an internet virus and completely wipes out any bootlegged remains of IronLame on the web, and then burns all the remaining copies of the film on the planet so no one else has to subject themselves to that atrocity of a movie.Don't you dare contribute to Downy Jr's drug addictions by buying this film, if you do your sinning. Don't be a fool use your noodle.-Yours Truly Jeronomo Joey</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Distorted facts about the Middle East presented</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dislike the Iron Man movie because of the following reasons: It is a proved scholarly fact that the Persian Empire in 480 B.C was the most magnificent and civilized empire. Established by the Cyrus the great, the writer of the first human right declaration, Persians ruled over significant portions of Greater Iran, the east modern Afghanistan and beyond into central Asia; in the north and west all of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), the upper Balkans peninsula (Thrace), and most of the Black Sea coastal regions; in the west and southwest the territories of modern Iraq, Syria, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt and as far west as portions of Libya. Having twenty nations under control, encompassing approximately 7.5 million square kilometers, unquestionably the Achaemenid Empire was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity Another evidence to the contrary of the brutal portrait of Persians depicted in this movie is the historical conquer of Persians over Babylon by Cyrus. On October 4th, 539 BC, the Persian Army entered the city of Babylon, which was then the capital of the Babylonian state (in central Iraq). This was a bloodless campaign and no prisoners were taken. Later, on November 9th, King Cyrus of Persia visited the city. Babylonian history tells us that Cyrus was greeted by the people, who spread a pathway of green twigs before him as a sign of honor and peace (sulmu). Cyrus greeted all Babylonians in peace and brought peace to their city. On this great event, Cyrus issued a declaration, inscribed on a clay barrel known as Cyrus's inscription cylinder. It was discovered in 1879 by Hormoz Rassam in Babylon and today is kept in the British Museum. Many historians have reviewed it as the first declaration of human rights. On this historical turning point, by order of Cyrus, all the captive nationalities held as slaves for generations in Babylon were freed and the return to their homeland was financed. Among the liberated captives were 50,000 Jews held in Babylon for three generations whose return toward the rebuilding of their temple in Palestine, a policy that was followed by Darius and his successors. Some of the liberated Jews were invited to and did settle in Persia. Because of such a generous act, Cyrus has been anointed in the Bible. He is the only gentile in the Bible, who has been titled Messiah, an is mentioned explicitly as the Lord's shepherd and his anointed (Messiah). Other references to Cyrus are attested in Isaiah 45:4 where Cyrus is called by name and given a title of honor; he is also called to rebuild the God's city and free His people (Is. 45:13) and is chosen, called and brought successful by God (Is. 48:14-15). What took place after the victory in Babylon was contrary to the standard of the time. Based on the inscriptions of the neighboring countries (Assyrians, Babylonians), it was customary to destroy the vanquished cities, level houses and temples, massacre the people or enslave the population, replace them with snakes, wolves and even carry away the soil to make the land barren. But here, peace and liberty replaced the massacre and slavery, and construction substituted for destruction. After Cyrus, his son Cambyses ruled for eight years (530BC to 522 BC) and captured Egypt, and as a sign of respect toward their culture and religion, he prostrated himself before the goddess, Meith and paid homage to Apis, the Egyptian totem (Bull). After Cambyses, Darius took over the throne and ruled form 522BC to 486BC. From 518BC to 515BC he established peace and tranquility in Egypt and also paid homage to their totem, Apis. Darius, in his inscriptions, expresses faith in the commands of Ahuramazda. He declares "Whoever worships Ahuramazda, shall receive happiness in life and after death." He calls Elamites faithless, and because they did not worship Ahuramazda, yet he does not pressure them to change faith. Darius exhorts his successors "thou shalt be king thereafter, protect yourself from the lies and punish the liar and deceitful." He entreats God's grace for the protection of Persia against rancor, enemy, famine and the lie. At times he alludes to other gods that may either indicate the old Aryan gods who still had strong followings or the gods of other nations under his rule, for the display of reverence toward their religions.Furthermore, based on the Zoroastrian doctrine, it was the strong emphasis on honesty and integrity that gave the ancient Persians credibility to rule the world, even in the eyes of the people belonging to the conquered nations (Herodotus, mid 5th century B.C). Truth for the sake of truth, was the universal motto and the very core of the Persian culture that was followed not only by the great kings, but even the ordinary Persians made it a point to adhere to this code of conduct. Therefore, the movie portraits distorted and fraudulent historical facts about the Persians and the nation of Iran. REFERENCES: A. Arfaee, The command of Cyrus the Great (in Persian), quoted the opinion of Sydney Smith. Grayson, Assyrian and Babylonian chronicles, p110, dates the fall of Babylon on Oct. 12th and Cyrus's entry on Oct 29th. J. B. Pritchard, The ancient Near East, Vol. 1, 1958, p203.

		<shortDescription>Iron Man, - Not this summer, not any summer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of Robert Downey Jr. playing the role of billionaire Tony Stark, I was easily going to ignore this movie was ever made and take my money elsewhere. But since I saw the worst movies possible created by man, I thought; "hey why not give it a try". To my surprise the movie followed Iron Man's Origins story pretty close. In fact most of the film is very accurate to the comic books. But alas thats not where my problems begin. My first gripe was with the lines in general. While i enjoy witty banter like any other New Yorker, I felt that Favreau focused more on trying to make Tony Stark look witty, than using any ability in the directing of action.I don't mind a few one liners here and there, but the entire film felt as if Robert Downey Jr, was delivering a punchline. I didn't seem to notice this till around the one hour mark, when I was still observing Downey trying to be funny in every scene, and still no Mark3 armor(red and gold suite). Finally after the hour mark we get a show case of what the armor can do. Unfortunately THIS is where the movie seems to dull down. We don't get to see how much the suit can take but rather how much it can run away. While the action started very good it ended very poorly. This is a movie that has to tangle with the force that Transformers was. It loses very quickly when every action scene turns out to be very uneventful.Mainly my biggest peeve was seeing everyone run circles around Downey's acting. Frankly Jeff Bridges steals the show as expected, but even then not enough of Bridges is given to help many appreciate his acting. Lastly we have the last action scene. this bothered me the most and helped me realize that Jon Favreau is really better at writing and or directing comedy. there's just not enough action to begin with and not enough "epic" moments to keep me satisfied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The season of blockbuster movies in 2008 kicked off with yet another adaptation from Marvel Comics, this time the lesser known Iron Man. This being the first independent film from Marvel Studios, with its all-star cast, it's clear that they're pinning high hopes on this one.Director Jon Favreau does it clean cut, going by the same ol' "rule of thumb" in making comic book movies; hero inherits power, tests them, uses them, then villain gets his too( you know the rest but in case you didn't I won't spoil it for ya). Some of his bad decisions almost proved costly though; for example, his choice of non-linear story-telling in the beginning(he seemed to have taken the "Batman Begins" example too literally) nearly backfired. Unlike Christopher Nolan who utilized the style and enhanced the story-telling process, it gave some minor pacing problems to Iron Man, which continued towards the end. Despite that, Favreau has his share of praises though; his reputation as an "actor's director", letting the Oscar-worthy cast improvise their performances, was what separated this from the mediocrity suffered by the likes of Fantastic Four etc. And the numerous references made to the figures and icons of the gargantuan Marvel Universe would send the pulses of fan boys racing, in what looked like another step towards a "Avengers" movie(an all-star team of Marvel superheroes).Robert Downey Jr. is almost perfect as Tony Stark. From the moment he came into the picture, the entire movie thrived on his abundant flow of charisma, dry wit and deadpan humor, comparable to the likes of Jack Sparrow from the Pirates movies. It really makes you wonder who else could have commanded the role so seemingly effortlessly. The rest of the cast is more than competent; Jeff "Lebowski" Bridges is unrecognizable as the ruthless and manipulative Obadiah Stane, while Gwyneth Paltrow is *gasp* likable as the damsel in distress. Terrence Howard is underused here but matches Downey Jr. with his own brand of humor, and one of his lines which underlined his future role even gave me goosebumps. All in all, a great way to start the summer, as the world braces itself for yet another year of sequels and adaptations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to go see this, because of the many recommendations it was getting from film critics and superhero movie fans. Now I'm no superhero movie fan, but I do love some of them ("Spider-Man 3" and "Ghost Rider" are my favorites). So, I went to go see the film with my dad, uncle, and brother. What did I think of it? Well, I thought it was mediocre and overrated. Why? Because: 1) There was too much backstory! I mean, 3/4 of the film is backstory about how the guy became Iron Man and the other 1/4 of it consists of fighting bad guys. We need some more fighting in here. If the film was half-backstory;half-fighting then perhaps I would have enjoyed it more.2) Another problem with the backstory: Borrrrrrring!!!! I mean, Jesus Christ! I almost fell asleep! I am astonished that you IM fans find a guy in a cave building a suit, ENTERTAINING. Damn. Someone needs to go see a doctor.3) No romance. WTF? I mean, no superhero movie is complete without romance. The only romance I saw in this movie was that brief sex scene and that was it.So, there ya go. Because of these problems, I cannot recommend "Iron Man".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start by saying I know NOTHING about Iron Man the comic or cartoon so I don't expect to get any in-jokes or subtle references.I'm not going to score it on the very over the top special effects. I'm also not going to score it on the cast (with Jeff Bridges looking so much like Kris Kristofferson &amp; Terrance Howard looking so much like Cuba Gooding Jr that they may as well have cast them both or did they turn those roles down?).The beginning of the film is FAR too disjointed. To be honest it got to the point where I thought he'd been blown up &amp; kidnapped twice. I totally didn't trust the guy working with him in the cave &amp; thought he was a plant to gain his trust even if he didn't turn out to be so.The whole "shrapnel in your heart so we've given you this implant" idea? Utterly awful as anyone whose ever seen a single episode of MASH will tell you. It was a very bad idea &amp; an incredibly weak one to try and drive an entire story on.It's a very A-Team/Macgyver based idea that he can build a bullet proof killer robot style suit in such a short time (not even the movie can decide if its a few weeks or 3 months) and most people would say that he'd killed the leader of the Afghan Terrorists &amp; his 2nd in command (the bald guy &amp; the guy with the beard) but both of them turn up alive &amp; well later in the movie.Basically its a tale of betrayal, under the counter arms dealing &amp; more betrayal with a couple of good robotic suits (though 1 looks so much like The Iron Giant its unreal). It has an incredibly weak ending (why he wants to reveal he's Iron Man is utterly pointless &amp; kills any idea of a sequel as his identity is known, most of his factory is destroyed &amp; his evil business rival is dead.Worth a look for the pretty effects but low on story and not very helpful in explaining things to those who know nothing about the comic or cartoon before watching this movie.</fullReview>

The message has become insisting especially having failed in its war on Iraq. America finds no any other alternative way to intimidate the world but by producing such ridiculous fiction movies.

		<fullReview>I did not expect much from this. Marvel just seems to make what seems to me ordinary, boring movies. I was hopeful this time because the three main actors have done some rather elaborate work so far as reflected acting. Downey is something of a prince at this business of simultaneous personalities.But we have none of that here. I just saw "Forbidden Kingdom" and it uses what is now the state of the art regarding cameras in fights: the camera dances. It folds us into the action. Not so with any Marvel-produced project. We might as well be watching C D deMille with color.Nearly all these Marvel stories are predicated on science gone wrong. Contrast that to heroes from other companies, where it is just cosmic reality or even training that happens to make someone special. But these stories all derive from the Japanese pattern of postwar antiscience movies which in turn were based on "Frankenstein." (The Japanese would not have known the earlier gollum films.)So the driving force here is science. As it happens, I would have been disappointed by the blandness of everything, but they ruined the driving force of science for me. Stark was supposed to have gone to MIT with Colonel Rhodes (who wears an MIT ring), but we are told Stark was summa cum laude at MIT. But that school is unique in never engaging in that foolishness. Think about it.But what's a greater offense is how this, the man with the best mind, the most money and the most advanced science, does his work. I'm thinking particularly of the computers. This is the one place where we could have been dazzled. But what we see is ordinary, as if it were envisioned not by a man with great imagination and inventiveness, but by someone who simply doesn't know.Suppose you were shown a car from 50 years in the future and it had a key, steering wheel and dial speedometer. Its the same effect, and sorta takes the gas out of the thing.Oh, they made Gwyneth a redhead.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man was great, the first Hulk wasn't, and the Fantastic Four did okay, and then came this film with Marvel creating their own film studio to complete their piece, from director Jon Favreau (Elf). Basically Tony Stark (National Movie Award nominated Robert Downey Jr.) is the successful and rich head of Stark Industries, who manufacture weapons all over the world, and his life is changed when he is badly wounded in the chest. Tony is saved by a special metal based plate in his chest that keeps the shrapnel from reaching his heart, but he is also forced to create a new weapon by his Middle Eastern captors. In the time he has to build this weapon, he instead creates a metal armoured suit to make his escape and attack all in his way, and he manages it. When Tony returns to the US, he announces that from his experiences, he realises his company is not doing good making weapons, and he starts making modifications to his armour suit design. While Tony changes the design, manufacturing it with gold and titanium, and adding a jet-propulsion system to fly, his second in charge Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is still selling weapons to the Middle East. While in Afganistan, Stane comes face to face with Tony's original metal suit, and decides that it the new unknown "Iron Man" in the city, to go up against him. In the end, after defeating Stane, and against the advice of his crush-driven personal secretary Virginia 'Pepper' Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Tony announces to America and the world that he is Iron Man. Also starring Terrence Howard as Rhodey, Leslie Bibb as Christine Everhart, Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Faran Tahir as Raza, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, Bill Smitrovich as General Gabriel, Paul Bettany as Jarvis and look out for Stan Lee as the man in the smoking jacket. Downey Jr. has been away as a leading star for a while, and this is a fantastic return for him, and he has great support from a reliable Paltrow, and a mean performance from Bridges. There is good action and adventure, there are great special effects coupled with cool gadgets, and a quite engaging story to carry you along, it is a great fantasy superhero movie. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the National Movie Award for Best Superhero.

		<shortDescription>Robocop flies to Afghanistan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is basically 'Robocop' updated to 2008. Except it's nowhere as good as that film. The '87 thriller is set in the future with an equally implausible scenario, but far more intriguing: the body of a murdered police officer is used to create a robot who still retains traces of the dead man's memories. The core of Iron Man is plain silly: set in the present time, the iron man (played by Robert Downey Jr.) must prance around with some kind of magnet implanted in his chest cavity, preventing shrapnel from puncturing his heart. Then, he invents an iron suit which enables him to fly at supersonic speeds and kill terrorists without suffering serious injury. Like Robocop, a computer interface is suggested inside the 'mask' of both superheroes; but in Robocop the hero is haunted by the memories of the dead man whose body was used to create him.There is no such internal tension in Iron Man. It's strictly a good guy-bad guy shoot 'em up. Downey plays Stark, the head of a large corporation which manufactures weapons. Stark is depicted as an arrogant playboy who takes no precautions when he travels around in a Humvee in Afghanistan. He ends up being captured by a local warlord and his crew of motley insurgents and realizes that they have been using his company's weapons to fight US troops. Now he suddenly has a change of heart and uses his skills (he's a genius!) to create an iron man outfit to escape the bad guys (they think he's working on a missile).When he returns to the US, he decides to utilize the prototype of the iron man outfit he created in Afghanistan to become a superhero fighting for good. A good part of the film is taken up with Downey designing the new Iron Man outfit; during the 'testing phase' he gets thrown against the walls of his laboratory numerous times (how exciting!). Finally, he starts flying through the air with this metal suit on and almost crashes when he goes too high up in the atmosphere and his suit gets frozen with ice (funny how he wasn't smart enough to invent some kind of deicing device contained on most commercial aircrafts).Terrence Howard (of 'Hustle &amp; Flow' fame) isn't doing much hustling and flowing here in a do-nothing part as an army liaison officer for the munitions company. Similarly Gwyneth Paltrow, Stark's personal assistant, engages in a great deal of pointless banter leading to a non-romantic moment at the film's denouement. Jeff Bridges probably has the best part as Downey's partner in the multinational corporation who ends up betraying him and working with the warlords and terrorists in Afghanistan. But how did he so easily get past the alarm system or other security devices in Downey's home? You would think that breaking into a home like that wouldn't be so easy.In the end, there is the obligatory battle between the two machines (done much better in Teriminator 2). Bridges looks ridiculous when he takes off his metal helmet and all you see is his face inside the metal contraption. I fail to see why so many critics gave this film good marks. It's strictly a film for uneducated teenagers who read comic books all day. It also serves to lull people in this country into a false sense of security vis-a-vis the terrorist threat. By creating an invincible 'Iron Man" who can easily mow down terrorists and bad guys, it makes us forget that the bad guys in real life are not so easily defeated. Case in point: 9/11. The only winners here are the actors who collected nice paychecks for participating in such a cheesy and worthless venture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have yet to watch a flick with less substance. Every single cliché Hollywood has ever shown, all compressed into a single movie. I'm disgusted. Its like an even more pompous version of Team America: World Police, with the only difference of being more like a parody but trying to actually pass for a real movie.I saw the trailer just before this hit the cinemas and for almost all of it I was wholly convinced it was meant to be a parody.Seriously, I cannot see how anyone can consider this short of worthless. Hey, the sfx crew did a decent job I guess, but the script is just ridiculous and the acting mediocre.A megalomaniac male chauvinist with a clearly suppressed female assistant fighting corrupted people in the superior Christian US's ranks who aid the main enemy; the muslims of the middle east.PLEASE, Hollywood! Feed us more American BS with little to none actual content! One of the absolute worst flicks I have seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Special effects are the only thing worth seeing in this movie, and that is only if you can get past the garbage plot and acting. Not to mention the fact that every single movie has good special effects now-a-days, so really there is no reason to see this film. At the beginning of the movie the plot was "okay" at best, and 30 minutes in it was obvious that they were struggling to make a 2 hour movie. Thus, the plot went from bad to van helsing bad in a hurry. If you don't know what van helsing bad is, then you are probably a very happy person having not seen that movie. If you have seen van helsing but don't understand the term "van helsing bad" then you are probably one of the people who gave this sorry film 10 stars.I almost laughed during the "emotional" scene in the movie with downey jr whimpering. I got the feeling that he didn't care for the movie and acted accordingly. The robots in the movie were Oscar winners compared to Downey Jr's performance. Not a single person in the theater even cracked a smile for one of his jokes. The credits should have rolled after he was smashed against a wall. Seriously, I would have stood up and applauded.IMDb top 250 are you kidding me? This movie is more over-hyped than Spiderman, but Spiderman was actually half-decent. Since this movie is not for kids, I cannot comprehend how this movie got such high reviews and ratings. Wake up people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been Better Average Superhero Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well looks like it's not even summer yet but already there are superhero movies flying to a theater near you. And after what looks like a string of well made blockbusters that started with Bryan Singer's X-Men, it seems Marvel Comics has begun to run on empty with the recent spate of lousy films like Elektra, Ghostrider and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer among others.Now comes Iron Man, the heavily-hyped Jon Favreau directed movie starring the newly reformed Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, the billionaire arms dealer who creates a suit of powered armor to escape his captors and predictably becomes a high powered superhero. Downey has been featured on many magazine covers lately as a former drug-addicted Hollywood bad boy who has now turned his life around and was lauded for landing a role as close to his character- in the ULTIMATES comic book version of Iron Man, Tony Stark is an alcoholic with a brain tumor who primarily becomes a superhero for corporate publicity and kicks.So your question would obviously be: is it as good as the hype? Well, not really.This looks to be the first Marvel superhero movie to ditch the opening credit sequence as we get thrust right into the action. In the original comic book, Tony Stark was a POW in Vietnam (hey, the comic was created by Stan Lee in the 60's after all) who created an armored suit to escape from his captors- the movie updates this to Afghanistan as we get rocked in the opening scenes with an IED attack on a military convoy. As Stark struggles with his terrorist captors (who seemingly are equipped with weapons built by his own company) to free himself, he unwittingly uncovers a conspiracy at the highest levels of Stark Industries and his seemingly loyal partner, Obadiah Stane (played with a bald palate and beard by industry veteran Jeff Bridges). With the aid of his trusty military sidekick James Rhodes (Terence Howard of CRASH) and voluptuous secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow- what a name her character has!), Stark goes from right-wing military playboy to a humanitarian liberal after spending a few weeks in a cave.I would think that a good formula for superhero movies would be that you need to have an interesting villain that people can empathize with- Spiderman I and II did this very well with both the Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus (the X-Men's Magneto was also a well-rounded bad guy- he had a noble cause even though he wanted to wipe out non-mutants to fulfill it). The problem with IRON MAN is that Obadiah Stane is just an average, greedy and corrupt run of the mill villain- you get no understanding as to why he does what he does other than just simple greed. Jeff Bridges tries (as Nick Nolte did in Ang Lee's HULK) but there isn't a lot in the writing to work with. Downey comes off as the occasional charmer in Tony Stark but the lack of any real emotion in the script reduces him to stock hero status. Paltrow is wasted as Pepper while Howard seems out of place playing a Colonel in the military. The action sequences are okay for the most part but they are few and far between and get cut short just as they are about to go into overdrive.All in all, this is just an average superhero movie- better than FF: Rise of the Surfer, better than Ghostrider and Elektra, slightly less than the X-Men trilogy but well below the level of Spiderman and Batman Begins.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I never read the Iron Man comics so I had no idea what the movie was about. I watched the trailer though and it was tantalizing so I decided to spend a little extra to watch the digital version of this movie. I was quite disappointed after walking out of the theater last night. I was expecting Iron Man could offer me as much entertainment as the Transformers did, but the good stuff was already in the trailer and nothing more exciting was in the feature presentation. Visual effects were stunning, but did not give me as much awe as Superman Returns or Transformers. Storyline was straightforward, but too much time was spent on Tony Stark's R&amp;D of making the suit rather than his adventure or fighting the villain. Too many dull moments slowed down the tempo. Honestly, I think the trailer was edited better than the movie itself. Five stars of of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Featuring the very latest in computer generated effects and a plot that would insult a retarded six year old, Ironman is the latest in a long line of Hollywood product culled from the dizzying literary heights of superhero comic books.Product this disposable doesn't happen by accident. Teams of industry product makers work around the clock for years to make something this tasteless, tedious and utterly bland. Don't even try to characterize this product as a "movie." It simply isn't.If Ironman was edible, it would be a jar of baby food. Library paste flavored baby food. If it were music, it would be chopsticks. If it were a vehicle, it would be a tricycle. A tricycle with training wheels. If it were...What? Oh yeah, the product. It's something about the usual gazillionaire playboy who flies around in a sooper-dooper extra-gadgety metal suit and frees Afghanistan from the Evil Brown People, making the country safe for, I dunno, oil companies I guess. The plot is such a pile of moronic sub-juvenile drivel it's impossible to focus on for more than a few minutes before being distracted by something more interesting like, say, the butter-flavored grease stains on the bottom of your popcorn bag.Contempt for it's audience drips from every frame of this product. No doubt the droolcase fanboy target audience will be thrilled to down to their Batman Under-Roos by Downey's lackluster performance as he sleepwalks through the product's repulsive hero role. The product is certainly simple enough for people who regard Cheetos as food group and think repetitively boring video games are the apex of computer technology.But aside from it's pimply focus group, the only other audiences to which this product could possibly appeal would be coma patients and Scientologists. And you'd probably have to tie down the coma patients.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a movie that is two hours long and has one hour and fifty minutes of useless, boring dialogue and about ten minutes of the 'hero', aka 'Iron Man' in this case, then you've picked the right movie. I don't think that I could have possibly been more bored watching this movie. I don't give a damn how he became Iron Man, I don't care how he became enemies with his company's co-owner, I watched this movie to see Iron Man, and to see him kick ass. And these things didn't happen. As a drama, (or a soap opera), I rank this a 7/10, but as an action/superhero movie, I rank it a 1/10, because there's barely any action or superhero in it. Don't believe all the hype about this abomination, don't think it's great just because everyone else wants you to think it's great. It blows. A lot. And if Gwenyth Paltro didn't look so good in it, I wouldn't even have been able to make it through the whole movie.</fullReview>

SPOILER: Terribly developed fight scene between Iron Monger and Iron Man, which just made me sick. The Incredible Hulk was better than this film and much more entertaining. I am still shocked as to how this movie got better reviews than the Hulk, and how it is on the top 250 movie list. If your looking for thrills and chills then I'm not sure you want to see this movie.

		<shortDescription>The worst &amp; most overrated superhero movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no idea what the film is about but still I seen it because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews although I was put off by the rubbish trailers. After I seen the movie I felt like taking my shoe off and throwing it to the screen, Iron Man has more than enough of what an awful film should have. The movie was even worse than the trailers.There are two kinds of good superhero movies: 1. The one with a really good story but not much action like Batman Begins &amp; Superman Returns. 2. The one with plenty of action to keep you entertained like Ghost Rider. But Iron Man neither was both, there wasn't a good story or any action then why was this movie made? The worst superhero movie I ever seen before this crap was Spiderman 3 but Iron Man broke the record. It was extremely boring that I had a sore head &amp; I felt like ripping my arm out and constantly bash my head with it. The running length was about 2 hours and it felt like 4 hours. Anyone who has rated the movie a 1 out of 10 rating are very sensible and I personally would like to salute them. I'm surprised that it's already on the IMDb top 250 &amp; I hope it comes off sometime. Overall Iron Man is outrageously boring throughout and as soon as the boredom ends, the film ends. Which makes it a must avoid of the year. I was more interested in the film's ending not because the twist or anything would be revealed in the last reel but because it would mean the end of discomfiture of the so-called superhero movie.The director must have pulled the script from his bum and was running around his house with it and his wife hit him on the head with a rolling pin and said "You promised me no more rubbish films!" It was a complete load of garbage, junk and crap right from start to end of this 2 hours torture device. Recommend this movie to someone you really hate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has it all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer seemed to me quite stupid but I thought that it had to be some sort of a joke and that maybe there was some interesting message underneath the machismo and war mongering talk. How wrong I was...I am sure that other have pointed out how pathetic this movie was. I know its a waste of time, but let me re-iterate...You rarely see such a sexist, racist, and war glorifying movie. Only something like Transformers can compete with this. This movie is yet another enrolment advertisement for the military! Sure, don't we all know that the American military would never sacrifice innocent lives (if used as human shields) or develop weapons that violate human rights? Not even Disney is that dumb!Why does it glorify war? Again, because it makes it so easy to hate the enemy. Everything is black and white. With me or against me. The dichotomy of the simpleton. As if things were so simple. The audience cheered in the cinema as Iron man smashed people to a pulp. Killing was fun! Do I need to mention that Iron man conforms to what has become a stereotype of American movies? The typical Bronson, Rambo, Eastwood, Willis... (could go on forever!) paranoia and vigilante attitude are an integral part of this movie. Beside being racist (I will not go into this), the movie is sexist. Sure, its not the worst case I have seen, pretty tame and mainstream, I would say. Isn't this just a reflection of the world today? Makes one wonder. Is it what the male mentality dreams of? I am sure that all men want to believe that pretty girls underneath the pretence of being journalists, stewardess', secretaries, and so on, really are nothing but prostitutes that want to jump in bed with a cool guy at the first opportunity. Shouldn't the movie be commended for exposing this problem in society? Yes, if it wasn't for the fact that again it is glorifying the idea of women as sexual objects. It's cool to behave like Tony Stark (and of course, the journalist that behaves like him, is actually "trash" to be taken out). We don't even notice or question this kind of portrayal anymore. We have been desensitised by constant bombardment. Should we then be surprised that a multinational company like Tesco was selling pole-dancing kits on the toys and games section of its website? Just a thought. I would have no problem if the richest woman in the world, say JK Rowling, behaved like a nymphomaniac. At least I would be sure she had a choice in the matter. But of course this does not happen in the movie. It's absolute power versus menial workers (BTW even his secretary Pepper Potts, which appears to retain some dignity, takes out the trash for him). Surely it has a deep important message to tell that only a few enlightened viewers might have noticed. Doesn't it feel good, in this era of nonosecond attention span, to be able to pick this deeply encoded message? (Not always so subtle. For example, the label "Stark Industries" appeared in gigantic letters clearly visible from satellites in orbit on all weapons terrorists were using). The veiled message of criticism of technology is actually overwhelmed by its glorification. It's through technology that Stark triumphs in the end. And he is so cool with those jet booths, isn't he? Not to mention the way in which he blasts away enemies. It's again what you have and not what you are that matters. Weak people require a lot of gadgets, we know that. That is why kids want mobiles, ipods, computer games, and so on. They are the weakest, they need to conform. They crumble under peer pressure. Unfortunately many grown-ups still behave like that. They cannot ask the simple question what do I need this junk for? To impress people? Sorry got carried away...To summarise, this movie has all the simple minded really needs to be happy. The cool people, the killing, the sex, and the toys. The plot is never in the way and everything is clear and simple (military good, industrialist bad, women...). No need to think, just enjoy the ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does not meet expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man did not live up to my expectations. Most people in the theater seemed to feel the same. This is a solid 2-star movie, maybe two-1/2 stars (out of 4).Perhaps my expectations were too high. The movie starts off an the wrong foot with a demonstration of a new weapon system in Afghanistan. Tony Stark is wearing a business suit, like he's at a board meeting. Companies do not demonstrate new weapons systems like this.It's also difficult to believe that the terrorists expect Stark to build the missile system in a workshop in a cave.In a better movie, I wouldn't ask myself how Iron Man flew from Malibu to Afghanistan. Were does he store the fuel? Would it be a 36-hour round-trip? Are there relief tubes in that suit? And the thing with the electromagnet keeping shrapnel out of his heart made no sense. Magnets attract metal, not repulse. Plus, the hole in Stark's chest where the device is inserted was way, way too big and too deep.Like I said, in a better movie I would not have noticed these things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memo To Hollywood: The Situation In Afghanistan Is NO JOKE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I fell for all the hype that this was going to be a enjoyable film. The reason I pay close to$10.00 to watch a film on the big screen is to be entertained, to get some emotional pleasure! One of the problems with Iron Man is that it's geared towards the mind of a child/young teen without any charm. It's so incredibly predictable, a sort of comic-book-story-formula-film. A very clever way for Hollywood to make a quick buck at the expense of an interesting (on some level) story. - I'm tired of the meanie terrorist villains. I'm tired of the totally clueless good guy(s). I'm tired of the evil mentor! This story has absolutely zero imagination. It's at the intelligence level of a second-rate, Saturday morning cartoon! It's also about the crudest form of exploitation for financial profit imaginable! The really bad guys have alway got to be Arabs, or look like Arabs. They kill innocent civilians for no reason. They hide in caves, like the hated Japanese soldiers did in World War 2. But only a rich and powerful U.S. weapons inventor &amp; dealer can come to the rescue! Wow! What a message that sends to weapon makers of the world! Who would ever of guessed that deep, down, inside, some of the Merchants of Death literally have a heart of gold (or palladium, in this case)! Afghanistan is currently an extremely troubled country even though it has a very rich cultural tradition. It's a shame it was dumbed down in Iron Man to helpless civilians, brutal warlords, an impotent and clueless U.S. military and one white man who had a very unconvincing conversion experience. If Hollywood is going to bring politics and current events into a comic book story then they need act more like mature adults, instead of soulless moneygrubers trying to make a quick buck off of the horrific suffering of people in some distant land. Afghanistan is not some make believe place! It's a place where real people, including brave Americans, and many others from around the world, are risking their lives everyday! I hope Hollywood stops treating the moviegoers of the world like a bunch of idiots. And, while I'm at it, it would be nice if some of the many millions of dollars Hollywood is going to make from Iron Man is donated to various third-party, non-profit organizations working on reconstructing Afghanistan's civilian infrastructure! They certainly could use the money!</fullReview>

"Iron Man" contains less than 5 complete minutes of action. In fact, 5 minutes of action (with Iron man involved) is a generous statement. What a waste of two hours. "Iron Man" could have been great! All it needed was about 20 minutes more of actual Iron Man fighting! Iron Man only threw one punch. Yes that's right. This move is 2 hours long and the main character, (in an action movie) threw one total punch. The best part? The punch missed!

		<shortDescription>Where's the action?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I need to explain who Tony Stark is, or what the plot is about (that's a very simple - a little too much for my taste - and straightforward "good vs evil" story) but I'll still sum it up for those unfamiliar with the Marvel characters. The others can skip to the third paragraph!This is the story of billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Downey), kidnapped in the middle East and forced to build WMDs for a mysterious terrorist group. Instead, and with the help of his fellow captive (Shaun Toub) he builds an armor and escapes. From now on, he vows to protect the people he put in harm's way under his new alias: Iron Man.First, the good points: this is a light-hearted (sometimes a little too much, leaning on silliness at times) blend of comedy and action that doesn't take itself seriously. It's definitely more "Fantastic Four" than "Daredevil" or "X-Men". The jokes aren't always hilarious, or delivered with efficiency, but it holds up pretty well. The abundant CGI is overall as good as last year's Transformers and the use of music is very well done.Now, for the problems: WHERE'S THE DAMN ACTION??? Every bit of action is present in the trailers, there are no surprises at all, no big scene kept under wraps till the movie opens. There are only three action scenes with the armor on, and all of them are frustrating for being way too short, barely having the time to gain momentum before stopping. Then, the story: like I said earlier it's a little simplistic and lacks depth. They try to convey more emotional weight with the comedians but the director Jon Favreau is so ham fisted and demonstrative, and the actors' performances lack so much nuance - especially Downey and Bridges, which saddens me a little as they are two of my favorite actors - than it just gets in the way of the action sequences and adds even more frustration. It's like those scenes stretch for twice their real time before the action finally unveils... More worrying: the striking similarities with "Batman Begins" (the detention, the use - with much less mastery - of the flashback device, the realistic approach and (too) long scenes of the hero testing his abilities) and the new "Hulk" movie (the bad guy is just a bigger, meaner version of the hero) give the movie a seriously clichéd tone. Nothing truly original.All in all, it's a decent comedy adventure with some campy undertones and a serious lack of action and fresh ideas. A good appetizer for those who wait patiently every year for the summer movies to open. The others can wait for the DVD that'll allow them to skip the boring parts.2 1/2 stars - out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a scam.The director Jon Favreau committed what is the most insulting (both to the authors, and the audience's intelligence) fault a filmmaker can do when adapting an existing property: instead of finding a character or universe more suited to his tastes and capabilities (I've heard "Deadpool" is up for grabs...) he chose to do the opposite: switch a mature character for a childish ersatz and shoehorn his trademark campy humor and unfunny one-liners. The bait being the star-studded cast which gives the project some face value. But eventually this is a mindless, shallow exercise of selling-out we're given.The basic story (billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is kidnapped in Derka Derkastan then builds a suit of armor and fights back his evil foreign captors and later a larger version of his outfit) is just a toy commercial stretched to fit the big screen, but neither the feeble story nor the puny direction have large enough shoulders to carry it.I can't totally blame the director, because the writers at first did a very poor job with loose plot and lousy character development. Even by comic book movies standards this is terrible.The actors are decent, but since there is no real threat the old saying "the meaner's the bad guy, the better's the movie" isn't developed and leaves a bitter taste in the mouth eventually. Robert Downey Jr obviously gets the lion's share, but his character is so loosely written that his change of heart (from cocky, cynical prick to unexpected hero) lacks depth and meaningful situations to blossom. He mellows too much to be relevant when the movie ends - on a slight twist that mostly falls on its face.But the real turn-off comes when you realize that most of the screen time is wasted in silly gags: whether it's failed slapstick to show the hero's "weaknesses", or the wannabe sharp humor and chemistry between Downey and Paltrow (worthy of the cheesiest McConaughey/Hudson romantic comedy)... the movie as a whole is reaching. An half-baked script that tries too hard to be funny, with 40 year old actors dumbing down their act for the kids audience.You may not be as disappointed as I was when you'll see it, but you'll probably wonder why you wasted ten bucks and risked a date fight for that. That's not worth it. Clearly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr in total cruise control) is a weapon manufacturer. While field testing his state-of-the-art armament in Afghanistan he's kidnapped by terrorists and creates a suit of armor to escape. Back in the US, he's suddenly dropping the weapon business, which leads to an escalating feud with his business partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges, hamming it up to compensate his lack of screen time).You know your movie is in trouble when the guy in charge of selecting the songs for the soundtrack makes more bold and original choices than the writers. You can bet there's a big problem with your script when Marvel's own Bond-like character hardly drinks or hooks up with femmes fatale. But director Jon Favreau ("Made", "Elf, "Zathura") really doesn't give a damn. He's too busy sticking to his comfort zone, watching his actors chew the scenery and improvise campy jokes to realize that what he envisions as an action movie doesn't contain enough action scenes to be considered anything else than a cheesy comedy. What was supposed to be the movie event of this summer is just a 2Hrs shallow running gag. Sad.There are only two worthy action scenes involving the titular character, and they are either way too short (the climactic fight) or just lazy, CGI-heavy excuses to fill the empty spaces in the script. The fight sequence between Iron Man and the tank, then the Raptor jets is so laughably and obviously meaningless that it makes one wonder what could've been the movie if offered to a director more competent and above all FOCUSED. The whole movie is a mess wandering back and forth between silly gags involving the armor malfunctions, unimaginative action bits or boring and totally unbelievable dramatic moments. Ramin Djawadi score is laughably bad and sounds like a bad video game music, with cheap keyboards and guitars. The design is derivative and lazy (there are only two real original designs, the other being slight variations) and when the end credits rolled my first thought was to the almost $200 million spent for this train-wreck, and how such a god-awfully expensive project can be so underwhelming eventually. Hopefully this is the only deceptive blockbuster of the holiday season. Too bad it came out first.</fullReview>
