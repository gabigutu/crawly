		<shortDescription>Chandler supplies grapes ? pinot noir? ? for film experiment of doubtful vintage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a suspense writer whose observations of mid-20th-century Los Angeles proved so gimlet-eyed that he has been enshrined as the city's unofficial bard, Raymond Chandler had a bumpy fling with Hollywood. The first of his five major novels to be filmed during the classic period of film noir, Farewell, My Lovely was first turned into an installment in the Falcon series of programmers, then into Edward Dmytryk's 1944 Murder, My Sweet (a success, but too short; to do justice to Chandler's atmospherics and milieu demands longer time spans than the movies allot them).From 1946, probably the most adroit blending of style and content taken from his works was Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep. But its popularity, then and now, owes as much to the chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall ? and to the frisky, irreverent tone Hawks brought to the movie ? as to Chandler, whose outlook was one of dispassionate observation tinged with disgust. The following year, The Brasher Doubloon, from the book The High Window, can be deemed a failure. That leaves the odd case of The Lady in the Lake, also from ?47, which Robert Montgomery, starring as Philip Marlowe, ill-advisedly decided to direct himself. The movie labors under two huge handicaps: one of technique, the other of tone. Cited often (and often by those who may not have actually seen the movie) for its subjective use of the-camera-as-character, The Lady in The Lake flounders on an idea that may have sounded good when initially floated but had to have looked bad once the first rushes came in. Except for an explanatory prologue (the necessity for which should have raised red flags) or in scenes where he's caught in a window or mirror, Montgomery's Marlowe remains unseen. We, through the camera lens, are the detective. Conceivably, this gimmick might have worked at a later date, when swift, lithe Steadicams were part of Hollywood's technical arsenal. But in1947, the camera lumbers along as though it were being shoved through wet sand. As a result the pace slows to deadening, as though a senescent Marlowe were tracking down clues from the rail of an aluminum walker.In consequence, time that might profitably been expended on filling in missing pieces of the puzzle gets wasted on Marlowe's getting from point A to point B. Vital and evocative parts of Chandler's novel take place in the summer resort areas of Puma Point and Little Fawn Lake; that snail of a camera, however, was not up to a hike in the great outdoors, so the movie preserves none of them. And in tossing away chunks of the novels to accommodate budgets and shooting schedules, movie versions (like this one) mistake Chandler's strengths, which did not lay in plot. (The scriptwriters on The Big Sleep, including William Faulkner, couldn't figure out who killed one of the characters, so they asked Chandler, who didn't know either.) His strengths were in weaving intricate webs of duplicity and deceit shot through with corruption and dread. That was heavy fare for Hollywood ? even during the noir cycle. So stories tended to be simplified and atmosphere lightened: the freighted response gave way to the wisecrack, suggestive tension between two characters turned into a meet-cute, the brooding loner became a red-blooded American joe. So, in The Lady in The Lake, the icy and questionable Adrienne Fromsett of the book (Audrey Totter) is now a sassy minx to Marlowe's snappy man-about-town, and so on. The plot deals with Marlowe's attempts to find a missing woman (an off-screen character whom the Christmas-card credits, in a droll fit of Francophone humor, call Ellay Mort). Is a verdict possible? Some viewers find the movie's conceits and distortions amateurish and self-congratulating, while others overlook them to find a vintage mystery from postwar vaults. The Lady in The Lake remains a flawed experiment that over the years has developed its own distinctive ? if not quite distinguished ? period bouquet. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film noir with a unique twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of the many Marlowe novel adaptations, this must be one of the closest to the spirit of the original. Unfortunately Chandler himself does not seem to have had the opportunity to contribute to the screenplay - although there are plenty of Chandleresque wisecracks. The film, unlike most of the other adaptions reflects the original author's full dislike of the cops (although the tough police chief having to answer a telephone call from his daughter during an interrogation is an unusual appeal for the viewer's understanding), and mistrust bordering on pathological hatred of women (I suspect that the ending is an uncharacteristic 'cop out' to assuage the producer's or popular taste). Director/star Robert Montgomery shows great self-restraint by appearing only briefly in the action. When he does show himself, mainly in mirror-reflections, the star appears (as in that other great latter day film noir, China Town) battered and bruised and not at all flattering. The plot is suitably twisted and confusing - just like the novels. And the concept of timing the whole dark affair against the backdrop of the Christmas holidays only emphasises the bleakness of the subject matter. Incidentally the idea of continuing the opening titles' jolly Christmas carol chorus in darker, more disturbing tones throughout the soundtrack is fascinating and I think unique. Audrey Totter (whatever happened to her?) makes a very sexy femme fatale. And as she plays most of her lines to camera we are seduced just as protagonist Marlowe. On top of that, her gowns are absolutely magnificent examples of forties chic. Lloyd Nolan deserves special mention as a superb heavy. What a wonderful example of Hollywood film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>YOU Share The Viewpoint of the Crankiest Marlowe in Cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drawing on his life of crimefighting to write a short story, Raymond Chandler's tough but noble P.I. Philip Marlowe (Robert Montgomery, pulling double duty as actor and director) submits his work to Kingsby Publications, home of such pulp fiction mags as LURID DETECTIVE and MURDER MASTERPIECES. Before he can say "byline," editor Adrienne Fromsett (Audrey Totter) has Marlowe up to his neck in murder, missing dames, and crooked cops -- and you can see things Marlowe's way, literally! Before all those slasher movies came along during the last couple of decades, LADY IN THE LAKE used the subjective camera treatment -- hell, the camera was practically a character in the flick! Throughout most of LADY..., we see everything exactly as Marlowe sees it; the only times we see Marlowe/Montgomery's face is when he looks in a mirror, as well as in a brief prologue, an entr?-acte segment, and an epilogue. In the trailer (featured on the spiffy new DVD version of LADY..., along with an enjoyable and informative commentary track by film historians Alain Silver and James Ursini), MGM's publicity department did its best to push the film as the first interactive movie experience: "MGM presents a Revolutionary motion picture; the most amazing since Talkies began! YOU and ROBERT MONTGOMERY solve a murder mystery together! YOU accept an invitation to a blonde's apartment! YOU get socked in the jaw by a murder suspect!" YOU occasionally start snickering in spite of yourself when the subjective camera gimmick teeters dangerously close to parodying itself, like when Totter moves in for a smooch with Our Hero The Camera. Some of Totter's facial expressions in the first half of the film as she spars verbally with Montgomery are pretty funny, too, though I'm not sure all of them were meant to be (she uses the arched eyebrow technique done so much more effectively later by Eunice Gayson of DR. NO and FROM Russia WITH LOVE, Leonard Nimoy, CQ's Angela Lindvall, The Rock, et al... :-). Having said that, the subjective camera technique works more often than not; in particular, I thought the fight scenes and a harrowing sequence where an injured Marlowe crawls out of his wrecked car worked beautifully. It helps that Steve Fisher provided a good solid screenplay for Raymond Chandler's novel, though Chandler purists were annoyed that the novel's pivotal Little Fawn Lake sequence was relegated to a speech in the recap scene in the middle (apparently they tried to film that scene on location, but the subjective camera treatment proved harder to do in the great outdoors, so they gave up). The performances are quite good overall, including Lloyd Nolan as a dirty cop and an intense dramatic turn by young Jayne Meadows. Montgomery's sardonic snap mostly works well for cynical Marlowe, though he sometimes forgets to tone it down during tender dialogue, making him sound simply cranky. Totter eventually tones down her mugging and becomes genuinely affecting as her Adrienne lets down her guard and begins falling for Marlowe. You may love or hate this LADY..., but if you enjoy mysteries and you're intrigued by offbeat movie-making techniques, give her a try!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are Marlowes Then there is Marlowe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The POV of Lady the In The Lake experiment hides the fact that Robert Montgomery wasn't up to the task of being Philip Marlowe. Oh he had the tough talk down pat, but as someone said earlier he was better in Ride The Pink Horse. In this movie he doesn't feel like Marlowe, a Marlowe who can take and give a hard punch. The first confrontation he takes a punch that results in a black eye but it leaves him unconscious! Dick Powell- the surprise Philip Marlowe of all time-and Humphery Bogart-one of the best Marlowes of all time-would've required a shot from Moose Malloy or a sap to the head by some strong arm thugs to go down from one blow like that. Perhaps it was her reaction to a camera instead of an actor that made Audrey Totter seem chilled in their "scenes" together rather than Claire Trevor's cold hearted user and Lauren Bacall's cool cynic in the earlier Marlowe incantations. And MGM was never at that time at least a studio known for hardboiled,gritty crime dramas. The Christmas carols though were a nice touch and Lloyd Nolan who should have played the lead was good as usual in his role as the crooked cop. Nolan had played a PI in some Michael Shayne Bs before the noir cycle began so he knew the mannerisms and Philip Marlowe a tarnished knight with principles would've been a perfect fit. All in all Lady In The Lake is noteworthy for it's groundbreaking experiment, the appeasement of a fading leading man's ego (not the last time either)and some vision into the world of Chandler's alter ego. George Montgomery as Philip Marlowe? Blasphemy! James Garner- a 60s laidback version suitable but also a precursor to Jim Rockford who had his Chandler moments. Roert Mitchum was Philip Marlowe both in looks and world weariness a perfect match only Bogart equals him. Mr. Montgomery would ride a pink carousel horse to better success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Wonder Chandler Was Outraged</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Montgomery substitutes a gimmick for quality film-making. He and Fisher and have absolutely no ear for Chandler-esquire writing. Actors hit marks and then don't move from them through the rest of scenes, and lines are delivered as if read from cue cards. The film is essentially confined to interior scenes shot in sets that look like sets -- the pivotal scene of the book, in which the lady is found in the lake, is replaced with mere narrative. In the one scene in which he appears -- at a mirror -- Montgomery doesn't capture the demeanor of Marlowe, "who himself is not mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid" but is nonetheless wearied beyond his years by going down "mean streets". And that scene at the mirror proves that Montgomery hadn't even the competence to master his gimmick, as it is plainly shot at an angle to hide the camera, so that the camera does not see Marlowe's reflection as he would have seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want a great, serious Philip Marlowe mystery, go check out "The Big Sleep." If you're in a lighter mood, however, this one is well worth watching. The POV is cute and leads to some decent effects, but it's also tremendously goofy sometimes. The dialogue really sells it though. The lessons I learned from this movie were 1) Only men can handle guns. 2) Having four thumbs is bad. 3) Never, ever tell anyone the time. 4) If you try hard enough, you can drink whiskey through your eyes. I'm sure there are hundreds more gnomic sayings, easily applicable to daily life, scattered through it!Seriously, though, it was a lot of fun to watch, mostly because of the problems with it, and I'd highly recommend it.</fullReview>

Montgomery directs himself and is primarily only seen in a scene looking in a mirror. Novelty of the camera work is clever and makes YOU part of the movie. Its pretty cool finding the clues.

		<fullReview>The first-person perspective could be viewed as a brave experiment or a case-study of why nobody EVER makes movies this way. Three points:1) In a movie, we like to see the main character reacting.2) Actors look self-conscious when endlessly talking to a camera.3) The lack of edits makes many scenes tedious.Still, you can admire how hard all this was to stage and shoot, in a age when cameras weighed a ton, made too much noise and nobody owned a Steadicam. Reminds me of the kind of crazy gimmicks Hitchcock sometimes tried but Hitch would have never let the train go this far off the tracks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At Least They Tried Something Different, But It Didn't Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first became very enthused about film noir, and began collecting about every tape I could find that was labeled such, this was included. Unfortunately, just because it had the words "film noir" printed on the VHS box didn't guarantee it was a good film. This is a prime example.Lady Of The Lake, as you all know, was filmed differently, the camera being the "eyes" of Philip Marlow. We see exactly what he sees, meaning we never see him unless he's looking into a mirror. That may sound kind of cool, but it isn't. It wears think after a fairly short and then gets downright annoying.Robert Montgomery and Audrey Tottter, the two stars of the movie, wear thin pretty quickly, too. There isn't much to recommend. I give them '4 stars out of 10' for trying something radically different.....but none for the results.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>experimental failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could only interest a film historian. The camera shows the point of view of the lead character, Marlowe. This is a technical failure: deadened pans and zooms, no physical contact with other characters, no outdoor scenes.With clever self-reference, writer Raymond Chandler has Marlowe try his hand at pulp detective fiction -- based on his own experience, of course. The publisher's executive assistant, A. Fromsett (overplayed by Audrey Totter), expresses interest in the manuscript, to draw Marlowe into looking for the publisher's missing wife. Soon we are up to our camera lens in blonde bombshells, drawling thugs, crooked cops, and dead bodies.This could be an intriguing story. Unfortunately, Robert Montgomery, playing the lead (appearing in mirrors and editorial commentary), also directs. He has a tin ear for dialogue, a glass eye for scenery, and a peg leg for pacing.Those looking for an entertaining Marlowe crime drama should try "Farewell my Lovely", "The Big Sleep", or "The Long Goodbye".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHAT were they THINKING of...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shatteringly clumsy and agonizingly inept treatment of a Chandler story, totally lacking in style, variety and excitement. First impressions, for once, can be trusted: the disastrous opening scene in which Marlowe sits at his desk and *addresses the camera* gives you an utterly correct impression of the kind of cinematic screw-up you are in for. Next disaster: Robert Montgomery is a wholly uninteresting and un-charismatic actor whose attempts to portray the fast-talking, back-chatting Marlowe frequently come across as merely nasty. Failure Number Three is the ludicrous decision to film the entire story as a series of 'point-of-view' shots, giving us a 'Marlowe's-eye-view' of what little there is to see (Don't miss the bit where Marlowe crawls on his hands and knees - and we see the backs of his hands - before going on to use a telephone - when, gosh, we find ourselves looking at a telephone...). The two-fold pointlessness of the continual P.O.V. beggars belief: first, because it throws the weight on supporting players whose third-rate skills cannot carry it; second, because the fact that we have to watch a series of long, unbroken, unvaried, UNINTERESTING takes - in which whoever Marlowe is talking to simply faces the camera 'square-on' and talks 'back' to it - make vast stretches of the film UNBEARABLY TEDIOUS to watch and the details incredibly difficult to take in. Directors don't cut, employ 'reverse angles', reaction shots, profiles and so on for no reason. Fourth problem: removing Marlowe almost entirely from the visible action removes a lot of useful possibilities and adds PRECISELY NONE. Fifth problem: when Marlowe *is* actually visible, all we see is some lug talking to the camera - whereas a 'voice-over' would at least let us see something *different* happening. And why angle the story as a 'solve-it-yourself' mystery when *everyone* tries hard to work out a Chandler plot anyway? All in all, the results are so abysmal that one asks oneself how it could possibly have come to be done that way. Well, here are my suggestions. First, Bogart is a tough act to follow: by putting Marlowe out of view here, someone must have thought they were avoiding unfortunate comparisons. Second, look who the director is: yes, it's wooden leading man Robert Montgomery, who plainly can't see how bad his direction is when he's acting, and won't see (or hear) how bad his acting is when he's directing. Someone has bitten off more than they can chew - and this is the result: an unwatchable, saggy mess that manages to be significantly less interesting than 90 minutes spent putting your books in alphabetical order.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly gimmickry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I remember the original reviews of this movie, and they were universally bad. But sometimes one might enjoy a bad movie when it is seen as a historical context--but this is not such a movie. It is unfaithful to the wonderful writing of Raymond Chandler. As an adaptation to the silver screen it does not even come close to "The Big Sleep," "Double Indemnity" or any other of Raymond Chandler's stories. Montgomery's attempt at tough guy speech is ludicrous; it's as though he is trying to emulate Humphrey Bogart while at the same time avoiding a comparison. Furthermore, it is derivative of Hitchcock and Orson Wells but falls ridiculously short of these standards to be thought of as something revolutionary in film. Probably the only value of this movie is to see Jayne Meadows at a very young age. She comes across as the perfect ingenue but is too sweet to have been a primary villain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... but certainly not all bad. The actor I had a real problem with in this film was Audrey Totter, who seemed to be ludicrous in her over-acting, reactions, etc. I'm not convinced that Robert Montgomery was the right person to play Marlowe (a bit too stiff in comparison to Powell and Bogart, other 40s Marlowes), but in directing this in first person viewpoint so that we see through the eyes of our central hero, he was certainly taking a gamble. It didn't pay off, really, and certainly slowed the pace. However, now and again it did give a quirky bit of life to what is essentially a tired plot. Another minus is the accent of the guy playing Chris Lavery, too OTT. Jayne Meadows is fine in her two scenes, and Leon Ames is endearingly vague as ever as the husband of the missing lady. There's the usual crooked cop as well to muddy the waters. However, 'Lady in the Lake' has to be viewed as a failure, but one worth taking a look at just to see why it could never had worked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Montgomery starred in and directed this film, based on a Raymond Chandler story. I wish I could say better things about this, but it was stagy, unintentionally funny, and played over-the-top by most of the actors involved, especially Jayne Meadows. The experiment of the camera being Robert's eyes and allowing us to see only from his point of view only limits the viewer's involvement of the film and makes the viewer feel as if they're watching a film from 1910, with dated devices being used for the filming. Lastly, I admit that I never cared that much for Mr. Montgomery as an actor (he always seemed to come across as arrogant and like he thinks he's funny,) despite the fact he was in the rather enjoyable Hitchcock film, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and despite the fact I loved his daughter Elizabeth in Bewitched. So, take all this as you will. But, see for yourself if this lady floats or sinks!</fullReview>

The Lady In The Lake takes this one step further. Here the camera itself is Marlowe. The majority of the movie is Marlowe's P.O.V. -- the camera shakes when he gets slapped around, and "our" eyes close when he kisses the girl. No Stedicam, of course, so the camerawork is pretty stiff, but not nearly as stiff as the acting.The Raymond Chandler plot is as good as you might expect, and I allowed myself to accept the gimmick; however, the acting is worse than I have ever seen in any A-movie of the studio system.

		<fullReview>Early in his movie-making career Orson Welles, playing around with the camera, did a little experiment in which the camera took the point of view of the audience. It was pretty funny. First, Welles has the camera inside a cage and tells the audience, "You are a canary. I'm trying to feed you an olive." The canary doesn't want the olive. What canary does? This evidently annoys Welles because he next puts the audience in the place of a golfer who blows his drive. Welles chides them for it. But that's nothing. Next, Welles puts the audience in the death house and takes him through his own electrocution.It was macabre but it was also amusing because we knew the director didn't want us to take it seriously, there was no plot or story to speak of, and mainly it was short."Lady In The Lake," using the same first-person technique, has Robert Montgomery as Raymond Chandler's sleuth, Phillip Marlowe, and involves him in a long, labyrinthine murder story in which we are supposed to seriously identify with a character whom we cannot see -- because, after all, the character's eyes are the camera and the camera is what we're looking through.I found it excruciating. There is the usual hard-boiled dialog but it's not up to the best of Chandler. And, throughout, that subjective camera is distracting and wrenches the head off the notion of "suspension of disbelief." In case you've forgotten you're watching a technologically difficult movie on a TV screen, there is always an occasional fist in your eye to remind you. Or a tarty blond who presses her forehead against the lens when she smooches you. Or a few solid moments of real time when a dazed Marlowe is crawling across a night-time street and we see his hands, one at a time, being placed one before the other, and that street and that quadruped crawl seems endless. Epochs could come and go. Dynasties could rise and fall. And Marlowe's hands continue their unsteady pace.The plot? Oh, the plot. I don't know. Somebody's wife is reported missing and Marlowe is invited to investigate. Stuff happens before he winds up with Audrey Totter. Chandler wrote a lot of stories for pulp magazines in the 30s. (They paid by the word at that time.) Then he went back and cannibalized them, adopting several already-used plot, and jamming them together -- insert Flap A into Slot B -- until they bore some resemblance to a novel.Chandler's appeal was never in his plots anyway. They were full of trickery and deception and ambiguity. The style was the thing. His prose was full of man-in-the-street word play and metaphors. "Her hair was the color of gold in old paintings." That prose is usually conveyed by a narration in the other movies that have been adapted from Chandler's work. But there's no narration here. How could there be? If we heard Robert Montgomery's voice carrying on about the color of somebody's hair, we wouldn't know whether it was what Montgomery was saying to someone else, saying to himself, or just thinking. We can't see Marlowe's face so we can only hear what he says, not read his mind.I thought it was a noble attempt at innovation but a disaster as a feature film. Welles' little joke, I could handle. But, in all seriousness, if a director wants to give us a character's point of view, he's best off doing what Hitchcock did with the technique. Use it sparingly and only when it's important to the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this at the 2008 Palm Springs Film Noir Festival. Popular actor Robert Montgomery branches out into directing in this Film Noir from 1947 with mixed results. Using a subjective camera technique, Montgemery stars as detective Phillip Marlowe in a film shot from Marlowes point of view and is rarely on screen himself except for occasional mirror reflections and in a few scenes where he relates the story directly to the camera. This POV technique for an entire film can be demanding on the actors who talk to a disembodied camera instead of an actor and can wear thin on an audience after a while but although I did like the film, I can see why others may not. Based on the the Raymond Chandler novel with a screenplay by Steve Fisher who enjoyed success in the Film Noir genre with several film screenplays it has some good witty lines. The film begins with Christmas carols and the opening credits on Chrismas cards and it does take place on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day but that's the only thing Christmasy about it. It wasn't even released for Christmas and make it's debut in theaters in late January of 1947. Marlowe is set to give up his private eye career and become a writer instead and submits his first manuscript to an agency specializing in pulp fiction and horror stories. Adrienne Fromsett (Audrey Totter) isn't interested in Marlowe's literary talents and instead want to hire him to find out what happened to the missing estranged wife of her boss Derace Kingsby (Leon Ames). Totter's expressions, emotions, wit and beauty make a strong camera presence carry the film. Tom Tully as Cpt. Kane and Lloyd Nolan as Lt. DeGarmot make an excellent good cop-bad cop combination. Dick Simmons as Chris Lavery is excellent in a small role and Jayne Meadows as the mysterious Mildred Haveland is superb in her rapid-fire delivery. Meadows herself was on hand for the film's screening at the festival and did a Q&amp;A for the audience after the screening in which she said she had never seen the film before even when it was first released. Beautiful blonde bit part actress Lila Leeds was only 18 years old when this was filmed in May of 1946 and was probably being groomed by MGM as the next Marilyn Monroe but in 1948 she was arrested along with Robert Mitchum for marijuana possession and as a community service part of her sentence she was given a staring role in the 1949 anti-drug film "Wild Weed." It would be her only starring role and at age 21 her film career was over. Look for great costumes on the actresses in this film by noted designer Irene. There are no location shots in this film and we never make to the lake and only learn of events that happen up there. It's an all-around strange film but a great cast and I would give it a 7.5 out of 10 and recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Audrey Totter's quirky, virtuoso performance makes this one of the weirdest movies I ever saw. The camera POV through Marlowe's eyes is interesting at first but becomes rather irritating. Same thing with the Christmas music, which drones creepily throughout the entire film and infuses it with a slightly insane quality.The acting and direction are generally mediocre. Robert Montgomery is unconvincing as Marlowe. He delivers his lines with no sense of style as if reading the script aloud for the first time. In contrast, Audrey Totter delivers an amazing range of facial expressions but overacts. Like Montgomery, her character is unconvincing although she tries very hard to make it work -- too hard.The rest of cast is okay with the exception of Jayne Meadows, the femme fatale, whose overacting is worse than Totter's. Mercifully, she only appears in a couple of scenes before being shot and dragged away.BTW, the stunning Lila Leeds (who was busted with Robert Mitchum in his famous marijuana arrest) makes a couple of scene-stealing cameos as Totter's slutty secretary -- but her character is never developed and just fades into the background. Pity. I was hoping for more.This movie will be of interest as a courageous experiment whose main virtue is Totter, who is truly fascinating to watch as she overplays her part. If you like weird movies, you will really love this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film, and Mr. Jordan, define Montgomery's legacy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Montgomery was already an A-List star with many films to his credit. Nonetheless, if, in his entire career, he had only done this film, and HERE COMES MR JORDAN, he would have carved a legacy as good as or better than actors with many more productions under their belts. This reviewer has already reviewed Mr. Jordan. This film superficially seems yet another Philip Marlowe filme noire, yet with a few twists. First is the subjective camera angles. You don't see that very often, and it works surprisingly well. Second is the casting. Montgomery as (like a prior reviewer here has said) a very cranky Marlowe with a sharp tongue and even sharper delivery. And an astonishing performance from Audrey Totter as Adrienne Fromsett. OMG, just the name tells you this is going to be a fascinating character. It seems that Montgomery's character puts more effort into trying to tease and torment Totter than in capturing in the bad guys, and that little sub-plot makes the film even better (as does the way Montgomery can never resist insulting the cops at every opportunity.) If this is not one of the best films you have ever seen, you need to re-consider whether talking pictures is really your preferred form of entertainment after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rather laughable and ridiculous detective story might have rated as an interesting attempt were it not for Steve Fisher's pallid script, based on Raymond Chandler's book. Robert Montgomery directed and stars as cynical, hard-bitten gumshoe Phillip Marlowe, hired by a female publisher to locate the missing wife of her boss; naturally he smells a rat. Shot from Marlowe's point of view (with a few reflection glimpses of Montgomery), the picture certainly has a memorable gimmick--but what else does it have? Actually, David Snell's superlative score is the movie's finest asset, the visual trick growing stale after about 45 minutes. Fisher is overly fond of B-movie clichés, and his plot is patchy to say the least. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll get the obvious out of the way first. Robert Montgomery's 'Lady in the Lake (1947)' is most renowned for being one of the only mainstream films to unfold almost entirely from the first-person perspective of the main character, in this case Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe. The technique had been used before, albeit on a lesser scale, in the opening five minutes of Rouben Mamoulian's 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931).' In 1947, shortly after the release of Montgomery's film, Delmer Daves would take an enormous risk by filming the first hour of 'Dark Passage (1947)' without showing the face of Humphrey Bogart, though the star's status was such that he was eventually forced to emerge from the shadows (after which point, it must be said, the film becomes more conventional and marginally less interesting). Montgomery, in his last film at MGM, was also given the opportunity to direct, and he doesn't flinch from his chosen gimmick. Marlowe's face is seen only during several brief explanatory interludes, and whenever he happens to catch his reflection in the mirror.Setting aside the gimmick ? which MGM optimistically hailed as the greatest cinematic innovation since synchronised sound ? 'Lady in the Lake' doesn't quite measure up to other popular Chandler adaptations of the time. Robert Montgomery may have been a great actor ? I honestly can't say, this being my first film with him ? but his Philip Marlowe doesn't possess the toughness of Bogart in 'The Big Sleep (1946),' nor the cocky swagger of Dick Powell in 'Murder, My Sweet (1944).' The awkwardness of the role is only accentuated by Marlowe's constantly being behind the camera, though even the occasional direct-to-camera interruptions seem to miss the mark. I don't expect that the supporting actors had much experience in speaking directly to a piece of equipment, and so their performances are capable without being particularly memorable. The chemistry between Montgomery and Audrey Totter, the potentially-villainous femme fatale, was mostly stale for this reason, as we're really only seeing one side of their conversation.Perhaps the film's greatest weakness ? and, once again, this all comes back to Montgomery's chosen gimmick ? is that everything moves so slowly. One would expect those 1940s movie cameras to have been incredibly clunky, and so, in these pre-Steadicam days, Marlowe ambles from A to B with devastating sluggishness. The first-person technique, however, did work wonderfully in the sequence where Marlowe is being pursued in his car, and also when he must drag himself across the gravel to a public telephone. There are lots of prolonged silences where nothing happens, and, despite striving for realism, the film should have conceded more of a musical soundtrack to fill these voids. The one piece of music put into use, however, was an eerily effective choir song that reminded me of György Ligeti's "Requiem" from '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).' Overall, 'Lady in the Lake' is a fascinating film noir experiment that doesn't quite manage to pull it off. Even so, it's worth a look for its unique take on Philip Marlowe and several scenes of inarguable excellence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In New York, the cynical private detective Phillip Marlowe (Robert Montgomery) is summoned by the editor of the Kingsby Publications Adrienne Fromsett (Audrey Totter) that seems to be interested in a book he has written. Fromsett convinces her boss Derace Kingsby (Leon Ames) to pay a little fortune for Marlowe's book since she wants to hire Marlowe to find the missing wife of her boss named Chrystal. Fromsett is a gold-digger and expects the divorce of Kingsley to catch him. Marlowe follows the only lead he has and visits the crook Chris Lavery (Dick Simmons) at home in Bay City. However Lavery hits him and simulates that Marlowe was DUI. He is arrested by the brutal Lieutenat DeGarmot (Lloyd Nolan), but on the next morning he is released from the jail by Captain Kane (Tom Tully). On the Christmas Eve, Marlowe goes to Kingsley's house by the lake to seek out his wife but he finds that she is still missing and a woman named Mildred Havelend (Jayne Meadows) has died in the lake. Marlowe visits Lavery again and meets his landlord, Mrs. Falbrook; then he finds Lavery murdered in the bathtub. Now Marlowe suspects of Chrystal, Fromsett and Kingsby. Who might be the killer? "Lady in the Lake" is an original and unique film-noir. The camera is actually the eyes of the lead character, Phillip Marlowe, in an experimental and revolutionary style. The viewer occasionally sees Marlowe, usually when he looks at a mirror. Therefore, the camera work is magnificent, and sometimes it is difficult to guess where it is located. For example, when Marlowe is driving, where might be the camera positioned? In addition, "Lady in the Lake" is a movie without soundtrack. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "A Dama do Lago" ("The Lady of the Lake")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gimmick Film Where the Gimmick Really Works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lady in the Lake" is the rare gimmick movie where the gimmick works with little to no qualification.The gimmick is that the whole film (mostly) is told in the first-person point of view of Robert Montgomery's detective character. You only see Montgomery's face when he's reflected in a mirror, or in a few moments where the action pauses and he addresses the audience directly. The approach allows the viewer to focus on the faces of the other characters with whom Montgomery comes in contact, and what a wonderful treat for us since that means many scenes of nearly unbroken takes of Audrey Totter, who is absolutely sensational as Montgomery's arch nemesis turned his girl Friday. Totter can do more with an arched eyebrow than many other actresses can do with their entire face, and her performance is one of the best to be found in the genre: sexy, quirky, and, most surprisingly, funny. Indeed, the whole movie is a hoot. Montgomery too is terrific with a one-liner, and the fact that you can only hear him deliver them without seeing his face makes them even funnier. I just saw "Lady in the Lake" for the first time recently on TCM, but it instantly vaulted to the top of my favorite film noir list.Jayne Meadows is also superb in the smaller but crucial role of the movie's femme fatale.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If someone had told me how this was done, I wouldn't have checked it out, but watched without knowing because of an interest in detective stories. At first, I found the approach kind of irritating, but came along. Most actors were fairly natural with it, a few seemed to be talking to a camera instead of the detec. Robert Montgomery gets points for novelty and the film for overall interest. Audrey Totter grew on me as it went along. I kept waiting for her to miss a beat in that stylized attitude in the office especially, but she didn't. It was interesting and probably not easy to do. Leon Ames is a strong character actor, who holds up his end throughout, maybe the most natural with the technique. Montgomery seemed to be talking at people instead of to them. Whatever they intended with that, it didn't seem to come off - the deadpan kind of thing. It needed some more practice, but they probably didn't try again with bad reviews nipping at their heels. This seems too unique to compare with other noirs, Marlowes, etc. It would probably help to watch several more times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most notable thing about this movie is the odd camera work, as everything is seen literally through the main actor's eye (Robert Montgomery). It does help to set the mood for the movie though. I loved the use of mirrors to show his face occasionally and how I felt like I was walking through each scene. I especially liked the scene where Robert Montgomery's character is crawling through the dust.Great classic 40s "overdramatized" acting all around. No one in real life, of course, acts like that, but that is why it has such appeal.It was full of great one-liners worth repeating. I caught a new (to me) old phrase "go on a toot" and had to look it up. Dialogue was fast, but that seemed to keep the pace of the movie.On the lighter side, It is a fun movie to watch and a great way while away a couple hours!

		<shortDescription>A Decent Try</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Montgomery was a pretty savvy guy. As I recall, President Eisenhower tapped him to be the first presidential adviser on TV appearances at a time when the tube was still a new- fangled technology. No doubt, his being a well known Republican also helped.Too bad this experiment in the subjective camera fails as clearly as it does. I'm sure it took guts for Montgomery to pitch the idea to the notoriously conservative MGM. But he did get the opportunity. My feeling is that he took on too much for this, his first feature as a director.First, he's not only directing but starring as well. That might be okay if he weren't also refashioning his image from lounge-lizard playboy to tough-talking private eye. After all, Dick Powell had managed a similar transition the year before in the highly effective Murder, My Sweet (1944). The trouble here is that we seldom see Marlowe (Montgomery), thanks to the subjective camera. Instead we hear him all the time in a pinched unnatural voice more annoying than compelling. Nor, for that matter, does the tough-guy tone match Marlowe's or narrator Montgomery's dapper appearance. Despite some clever cracks from scripter Fisher, the transition just doesn't work.Just as troublesome is the complex Chandler novel that Fisher adapts without simplifying. The resulting narrative is almost impossible to unravel, which compounds a slow-moving camera whose subjective pov has to avoid the kind of quick-moving pans that might disorient or upset the viewer. Together, they produce a labored result, both visually and narratively. A simpler story-line would have demanded less from sometimes over-burdened viewers.This is not to say the experiment doesn't occasionally produce interesting effects, especially the hazy, claustrophobic climb out of the wrecked car. Then there's the blonde receptionist's come-hither look while exiting the room that almost had me leaving my chair to follow. Note, however, how the the subjective eye of the camera alters traditional assumptions about movie acting . When Marlowe grills Adrienne Fromsett (Totter), the camera doesn't cut back and forth in routine conversational style. Rather the camera stays on Totter the entire time Marlowe eyeballs her. Thus, Totter has to perform uninterrupted for an extended period in which any false note or exaggeration gets magnified; at the same time, flaws cannot be finessed in the editing process. Rather, the whole scene has to be re-shot. Though the players do well enough, I suspect the novel technique was not popular.If the movie fails, it's at least an honorable failure. Then again, the talented Montgomery bounced back in his next dual effort Ride the Pink Horse (1948), a gripping noir expertly acted and directed. Apparently, appropriate lessons were learned from this disappointing initial effort.</fullReview>

Parts of the movie are funny to me, like when he changes places with the drunk that singing a Christmas song and he knocks him out.Or at the beginning when Miss Fromsett asks Marlow what his story is full of and he says "short sentences". My complaints is the Montgomery is a bit to stuffy to be a detective but besides this I like it. I guess I like odd goofball movies. I also like the Amazing Doctor Clitterhouse for the same reason.

		<fullReview>Adaptation of a Raymond Chandler novel. Private investigator Philip Marlowe (Robert Montgomery) is hired by Adrianne Fromsett (Audrey Totter) to find the wife of her boss. This quickly leads to killings, dead bodies, double crosses and some very dangerous women.This picture has a potentially interesting gimmick--you see almost the whole movie through Montgomery's eyes. The only times you see him is when he's reflected in mirrors or narrating the movie. It sounds like it might work...but it doesn't. It quickly gets tiresome and Montgomery's tough guy voice gets annoying. Add to that a VERY convoluted story (I'm still a little lost at what was happening), a totally unbelievable happy ending (although that was probably imposed by the Hays Office), some way over the top acting by Jayne Meadows and non-stop tough guy talk and macho posturing by virtually all the male characters. On the good side--it does move quickly, I was truthfully never bored, Dick Simmons has fun with his very small role as Chris Lavery and Totter does try in her role. This was (understandably) not a big hit and thankfully stopped any studio from trying this again. Still, there are worse movies and it IS interesting in a strange sort of way. The biggest problem is that Raymond Chandler's novels are almost impossible to adapt into movies. They're good but so much happens in them that trying to cram it all into a two hour movie is next to impossible. This one deserves credit for trying. I give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a Chandler novel turned into a film with a novelistic approach, sorta</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lady in the Lake is maybe not the best of the Phillip Marloe murder mysteries put to film, but it is quite successful in its own right as an 'experiment'. But this experiment by star/director Robert Montgomery, works in ways that had me grinning and interested as an avid detective/crime/film-noir type movie fan. His subjective camera, a kind where like in the more recent Being John Malkovich 'portal' scenes, only in brief shots at a mirror do we see Montgomery on camera, as his eyes are "ours" as the audience. This technique could just be another gimmick, yet Montgomery is smart with the material he's using and the cast he's working with. None of them are stars, so their appeal as types for what they are in Raymond Chandler's story works to a great advantage. And it is in the end a Marlowe story via Chandler, and it is this that will really keep audiences interested or bored. Also, unlike the Big Sleep, this time you can pretty much follow everything to the T in the story.It's not just that the actors range from being decent to very good (bordering on excellent), with Audrey Totter, Ellay Mort and Dick Simmons being among the better of the bunch, but what Montgomery does with the camera sometimes to pipe up the interest. This is perhaps the most novelistic approach to the Marlowe movies- the more prominent, available on video anyway- from the 40s, as all of the long shots of the faces of the actors, Montgomery's own voice (which is much more satisfying, kind of on a radio-sounding level, than his actual facial expressions which are bland), and little details all build up like in Chandler's fiction. Detective stories are built on the details, the ones that are right on the faces or in the mannerisms of the dialog, and in the emotional impact taken on our lead Shamus. Montgomery's camera tricks could grow stale, but they really don't, as some shots and instances stand out, not just because of the content that is more attributable to the source. My favorite likely goes to when Marlowe is dragging himself to the phone booth, as it almost nears a Hitchcockian level of intrigue.It is, on the other hand, maybe not as satisfying on a classical Hollywood kind of level because of the experimentation, and Montgomery's halfway good Marlowe performance (again, good in the voice, not so good on camera in those little bits of on-screen exposition). And a couple of scenes almost go too faithful, if it might be possible, to Chandler's original text, though un-read by me sounds about as close as any of his book-to-film adaptations I've seen. But the style of Lady in the Lake is only part of the entertainment, as the story provides a couple of good twists here and there, and Montgomery's got a good handle on his character actors. Might put off some who are expecting the usual tough and cynical private eye totally on screen doing his stuff, but it's also takes a risk and does it honestly.</fullReview>

The only time we see Marlowe is when he looks in a mirror or fills us in on aspects of the story, which he does at the beginning, middle, and end.The plot actually has a neat twist to it, though I found the camera thing to be somewhat distracting. As far as characterizations, I also found them strange. Marlowe is a hardboiled detective. Apparently that's all he is, as Montgomery's voice is hardboiled for 99% of the movie. His love interest is Audrey Totter, playing Adrienne Fromsett, a career woman. This of course means she's uptight, wears her hair up, and is in love with the big cheese of the firm - well, this was the '40s. Montgomery is nasty as all get-out to her, so it must be love, and sure enough, it is. Guess those insults were supposed to be flirtation. Jayne Meadows and Lloyd Nolan are both very good in supporting roles.</fullReview>

"Lady in the Lake" was released the year before another taut thriller, "Rope", was shot by Alfred Hitchcock. He used long takes, with the cuts needed to cover reel-changes concealed by going into and out of black areas on screen. The ponderous, nosy trundling of the camera which represents Marlowe's POV could have inspired Hitch, although historians always say he got the idea of ten-minute takes from the continuous shooting in then-new live TV drama production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stiff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides the fact that the seriously non-tough guy, Montgomery, is entirely wrong as Marlowe, the major issue with this noble attempt at first person filming, is that it comes off as incredibly stiff and stagnant. Nearly every shot of Marlowe's point of view is a perfectly frozen stare at whatever action is occurring. Who in the world ever maintains an eye-lock on anything for longer than a few seconds? Yet Marlowe never shifts his frozen stare away from the perfectly posed and lit talking heads, not even while walking across the street! I guess technology, being what it was at the time, just wouldn't allow for the ideal hand-held camera, which most likely didn't exist. Nice try, but a total failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film noir, worth watching just for the first person POV experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Movie should fit anyone's film noir definition: crooked cops, dames you cant trust, dark all interior or night scenes, protagonist as hardboiled as the bad guys, a twisted whodunit you almost forget about, who cares who did it although it still surprises in the end. The plot happens right over Christmas which often creeps into the story but Christmas is just a nuisance / inconvenience in this film noir. The first-person POV does have its hokey, awkward moments but other scenes such as the car accident and the very end make up for it. There are many films including modern films like being John Malkovich that might have first-person scenes, this is one of very few entirely shot this way, worth watching for this alone. But this film is more than a novelty, it stands on its own, the movie is two hours long, it almost feels like two movies, it reaches a certain point right at the one hour mark that feels like its going to wrap up but then goes sideways, the plot certainly did work, the time flies, you don't notice the length, always a good sign. Robert Montgomery was a believable Marlowe and the snappy wise cracking dialogue between Marlowe and Audrey Totter (Adrienne Fromsett) added up to a fun chemistry although I was having a hard time buying the usual transition to love interest. The first person technique helped Montgomery, he pulled of the dialogue but is not the greatest actor, hearing but not seeing him worked to Montgomery's advantage. Totter for the most part worked, perhaps a little melodramatic at times but undoubtedly her staring directly at the camera accentuated perhaps even created this feeling. The supporting actors were outstanding: Audrey Meadows had only two scenes, the first was captivating because we cant see her face, the second she stole to create an electric end. Lloyd Nolan as the corrupt cop totally carried his part in the plot, he was friendly enough at first but hit the just right notes as a corrupt cop. His turn at the car accident and then at the end combined with the first person technique created the two most unforgettable scenes in the movie. Even Lila Leeds had a small barely more than a walk-on role but she caught your attention, it looked like one of those "get you noticed" roles that leads to bigger and better things but alas it appears not, she went on to a series of uncredited and grind house movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philip Marlowe, P.I.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Montgomery's take on the Raymond Chandler must have appeared as revolutionary at the time it was released. For his second directorial job Mr. Montgomery decided to bring the Raymond Chandler's novel to the screen with and adaptation by Steve Fisher. Since he was directing, as well as playing the lead, Robert Montgomery saw a way to do both jobs in a way that left him time for more important things by being both the narrator and creating his own gimmick by having the viewer see the action as Philip Marlowe saw it. The result is a film in which actors deliver their lines to the camera, as though they were talking to the P.I.The case which Philip Marlowe is engaged to solve, like all Raymond Chandler's fiction had a lot of twists and false expectations. The mere idea of having actors speaking their lines directly to the viewer is not exactly an exciting way to stage the action. Part of the problem is that, at times, the effect is a bit disorienting.With this film, Mr. Montgomery got better results, than in his previous effort. Audrey Totter dominates the action, as her Adrienne Fromsett has a lot at stake in the case that brings Marlowe into solving a mystery. Mr. Montgomery is fine, as usual, whenever he decides to show his face. LLoyd Nolan, Tom Tully, Leon Amers, and especially a surprising Jayne Meadows give life to Mr. Chandler's characters.The fine copy that showed on cable recently is a tribute to Robert Montgomery's fine career in the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Yuletide Murder For Philip Marlowe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lady in the Lake was Robert Montgomery's farewell film at MGM and I guess for a going away present, Louis B. Mayer decided to let him direct himself in a unique film production.Philip Marlowe is seen from the first person and the whole film is narrated by Montgomery, we see it all through his eyes. To remind us of who is playing Marlowe, Montgomery is seen in several shots looking at a mirror when dealing with various personages he comes across.Personally I find the whole concept way too gimmicky. It's a good story from the pen of Raymond Chandler and why it couldn't have been told in a straight forward manner is beyond me.Director Montgomery gets good performances out of a very professional cast of players. I particularly liked Audrey Totter as a Barbara Stanwyck like career woman who hires Marlowe to find her boss's missing wife. For those movie trivia buffs the receptionist that Marlowe is checking out when he first meets Totter is Lila Leeds who gained a certain amount of notoriety by getting arrested with Robert Mitchum a couple of years later in the marijuana bust. She's quite the eyeful, I could definitely see what Mitchum found so attractive.Though there's a lot of similarity to Farewll My Lovely/Murder My Sweet in that the whole thing starts with a missing woman, both screen versions of that story stand up better than Lady in the Lake. Montgomery should have done it straightforward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating use of visual details.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie and object to it being called an utter utter failure.An interesting use of the camera in place of the private detective lead character was only part of what I liked about it. It seemed to me that the director purposefully gave us a never-ending array of visual treats. The leading lady's clothing, her facial expressions, camera movement and thousands of details in the room furnishings kept me enthralled. (I started this theory right near the beginning of the film when the secretary archly mugged her torso for the camera wearing a kind of caricature-of-underwire brassiere.) For me keeping up with plot twists and trying to sleuth along with the sleuth was not worth the effort. But I loved the movie and for a long time wouldn't even get up long enough to recharge my coffee cup.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an exceptional Noir film--too bad Robert Montgomery didn't make more like this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is unusual in that Robert Montgomery not only stars as the private detective "Philip Marlowe" but he also directs the film. In a way, this actually makes sense, as so much of the film is filmed from Marlowe's point of view. So it's easy to imagine the director/actor speaking his lines along side the camera--a VERY novel experiment that worked very well. I think that is because he WAS visible now and again when necessary so the film didn't seem too unconventional.In addition to this interesting trick, the film features some of the most wonderfully "Noir" dialog of any detective film ever made. Marlowe isn't just fast-talking, but also exceptionally rude and abrasive--so much so that I actually laughed out loud several times--something you usually DON'T do with this sort of film! While I loved Bogart as Marlowe in THE BIG SLEEP, I actually preferred Montgomery'--both his style and much snappier dialog. This is saying a lot, as Bogart's version of Marlowe was great and had so many great lines.The story itself, not surprisingly, is a tad confusing--something definitely true in several other Raymond Chandler movies. But, provided you pay close attention, it shouldn't be a problem. But I honestly think the exact details of the story are far less important to the dialog and relationship that grows between Marlowe and his one-time employer, Adrienne Fromsett (played by Audrey Trotter). While many Noir love interests seem at best secondary to the film, this one really improved the film--giving it added dimension and leading to an exceptional, though a tad up-beat, ending.The bottom line is for Noir fans, this is a must-see film. I just can't understand why it's only got an overall score of 6.6--it's MUCH better than that and is a great example of an overlooked Noir classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"By the way, if we're going to keep your wife out of it, who ARE we going to pin this murder on?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following an uncredited directing role filling in for John Ford on a small portion of "They Were Expendable", Robert Montgomery requested a project he could direct start to finish for MGM. The studio allowed him to select a script and he decided to do this one, utilizing an interesting point of view technique that has the viewer see the action from the principal character's vantage point. That principal character would also be Montgomery, starring in the role of Philip Marlowe, Private Detective.The picture works for me for the most part, though some of the scene transitions occur in a clunky manner, almost always when director Montgomery decides to reveal actor Montgomery via a mirror shot or reflection of some sort. There's also Montgomery's insistence on sounding very much like Bogart's Marlowe in "The Big Sleep". Whether that was intentional or not I don't know, but it provided a bit of a distraction, as whenever Marlowe spoke, I was picturing Bogey in the role.All that aside, if you don't keep a little scorecard for yourself with the names and relationship of the players, it would be kind of easy to get lost with the story line. The plot involves a character who appears using an alias, and a telegram that might or might not have been real. There's even a character who never shows up, Chrystal Kingsby, wife of publisher Derace Kingsby (Leon Ames), whose disappearance was the reason for this curious story getting under way in the first place. It turns out she was the title character, but since this was a murder mystery and she was one of the victims, I guess it didn't matter too much.So if we take Philip Marlowe's word for it, and what else is there to go by, the former 'missing' Mildred Havelend (Jayne Meadows) actually killed three people in the story - Florence Almore, wife of a Bay City doctor, playboy Chris Lavery (future Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, Dick Simmons), and the ever present but never seen Chrystal Kingsby. Mildred winds up being yet another corpse before it's all over, but maybe you should see the movie to find out how, why and who did it. Otherwise, to use a term coined just for this flick, you'll wind up embrangled in a situation you can't figure out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Novel idea, reasonably well executed.A private investigator, Phillip Marlowe (yes, THE Phillip Marlowe, of Raymond Chandler fame), is hired by the female editor of a magazine to find the missing wife of the owner of the magazine. His subsequent investigations unearth some intriguing findings, and make him some unlikely enemies... The whole movie is seen from the perspective of Phillip Marlowe.Quite novel, due to the First Person Point-of-View aspect throughout. It feels gimmicky from time-to-time but generally does not weaken the movie or become tedious. At times it is great for heightening the tension, as you feel as if you are in Marlowe's shoes.Intriguing, tense story with some good twists along the way.Robert Montgomery is miscast as Marlowe. His lines feel forced and he doesn't have the look of a wisecracking private investigator. Was Humphrey Bogart not available? He gives a great Marlowe, wise- cracking and cool without sounding misogynistic or overly macho. The fact that Montgomery is also the director might have something to do with him being in the lead role...Supporting cast are okay. Audrey Trotter puts in a good performance as Adrienne Fromsett. Pick of the bunch is Lloyd Nolan as Lt. DeGarmot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Unique Marlowe Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a unique Philip Marlowe movie as it's filmed in a way that enables its audience to see the action through Marlowe's eyes. This approach was intended to enhance the viewers' experience by enabling them to see what the detective sees, follow the various clues and maybe even solve the murder mystery before Marlowe does.It's a fascinating experiment and as all the Marlowe stories are inherently subjective anyway, it's perfectly understandable why trying this technique out in "Lady In The Lake" would seem perfectly logical and maybe even a natural extension of the private eye's usual narration. In reality, however, it had the unfortunate effect of making the interaction between the characters unnatural and also slowing down the pace of the action (an example of this is a scene in which Marlowe climbs the stairs of a house where he finds a dead body).Fortunately, after acclimatising to such an unorthodox way of seeing a movie, the story which is based on Raymond Chandler's novel "The Lady In The Lake", proves to be very enjoyable. It's typically convoluted and involves a missing person, a series of murders and numerous memorable characters (including one who has three different identities).Philip Marlowe (Robert Montgomery) attends a meeting at "Kingsby Publications" with Adrienne Fromsett (Audrey Totter) who's the company's editor-in-chief. Although they're ostensibly there to discuss the possible publication of a story that Marlowe had recently submitted, it soon becomes clear that Fromsett is much more interested in hiring him to find her boss' missing wife, Chrystal Kingsby. The deeply cynical detective also quickly recognises that Fromsett is a gold-digger who wants to do everything possible to speed up her millionaire boss' divorce so that she can marry him without any undue delay.Marlowe's investigation takes him to the home of one of Mrs Kingsby's boyfriends, a gigolo called Chris Lavery (Dick Simmons) who takes exception to some of the questions he's asked and knocks Marlowe out. When the private eye regains consciousness, he's in a police cell and has a black eye. Marlowe is uncooperative when he gets questioned by Bay City police officers, Captain Kane (Tom Tully) and Lieutenant DeGarmot (Lloyd Nolan) but after getting warned by them not to cause any further trouble in their district, he's released from custody.After he learns that the dead body of a woman has been found in a lake near a vacation cabin owned by Derace Kingsby (Leon Ames), Marlowe hears that the reported victim is Muriel Chess, who's the wife of Kingsby's caretaker. She's a woman with a shady past and a further piece of evidence that Marlowe finds reveals that her real name was Mildred Haveland and that she like Chrystal had previously been linked with Chris Lavery. Marlowe's continued investigations then lead to the discovery of another dead body and numerous further complications before he eventually manages to untangle the mysteries surrounding the disappearance of Chrystal Kingsby.The dialogue in this movie is consistently sharp and witty and the various exchanges between Marlowe and Fromsett are especially entertaining. Audrey Totter is hilariously over-the-top as she looks haughty, indignant and amused at various points and also tries to use her charm to conceal what her real motives are. The rest of the cast also do well in what must've been a challenging undertaking for everyone concerned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The teeth I've got, I'd like to keep."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant filming of the Raymond Chandler novel about private eye Phillip Marlowe (Robert Montgomery) hired to find a publisher's missing wife. I love this movie so much. The whole thing is filmed through first-person point-of-view, which was very original for the time. You hear Montgomery's voice and get a few glimpses of him throughout, such as when he looks in a mirror, but most of the time you just have the other characters talking to the camera. It's lots of fun I think but I realize it's one of those "out there" ideas so it will undoubtedly alienate a portion of the audience that likes to keep things simple. The film is more than just a gimmick, though. It's fast-paced with colorful characters played by a terrific cast and lots of snappy, sarcastic dialogue. Montgomery is great, as is the beautiful Audrey Totter. First-rate support from reliable character actors Leon Ames, Lloyd Nolan, and Tom Tully. Jayne Meadows is the film's weakest link, as her acting is a tad on the theatrically melodramatic side. In addition to starring, Robert Montgomery directed this and does an amazing job. This is a classic detective story filmed in an unconventional way that I'm sure most fans of the genre will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Novel noir allows you to watch the detective from another angle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Employing a subjective camera angle from beginning to end Lady in the Lake not only allows you to observe but be Philip Marlowe as you look over his shoulder sizing up femme fatales and shady characters.Marlowe (Robert Montgomery)sells a story to a magazine publisher and in the process is hired to find the publisher's errant wife who may have run off to Mexico. He abhors deception and when he detects it responds in a highly sarcastic tone that sometimes results in getting slugged by a dirty cop or smarmy gigolo. His deductive powers however are having a hard time trying to figure what eye candy Adrian Fromsette's (Audrey Totter)angle is.Jarring at first Lady in the Lake's novel approach is effectively buoyed by Montgomery's Marlowe wisecracking style and sardonic approach to the case. Being the recipient of facial and verbal responses puts the audience in the room with the suspects who all look like they have something to hide. Totter's raised eyebrows and exception to Marlowe's insults are comic but within the spirit of the film's pulp nature. Jayne Meadow's woman in black with a gun gives the film an added shot of adrenalin along the way while Leon Ames, Lloyd Nolan and Dick Simmons lie to our faces with hints of anxiety on theirs.Lady in the Lake may not be classic noir but its unique take from a different angle along with Montgomery's impressive Marlowe allows it to rise above its "gimmick".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky crime Noir overcomes distracting gimmick and scores</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be the poor man's "The Big Sleep", with its confusing plot details and numerous barely-discernible motives. Having the camera take the first-person perspective might have been a novel idea on paper, but it only serves as distraction, and seems to slow down the action in some scenes to a crawl, literally! But the film is definitely a worthy novelty in the Noir tradition, and femme fatale Audrey Totter is excellent right through to the end. While Robert Montgomery is workable in the role of Phillip Marlowe, perhaps in retrospect he should have stayed behind the camera and let another actor have the part.The final revelation is well handled, with a multi-layered surprise ending; because, what's a good Noir wrap-up without at least one false identity revealed and sinister motive acted upon. It's a long twisted path, but it's fun once the viewer gets beyond the film's limitations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An odd look, but a great voice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Montgomery starred in and directed this quirky mystery based on Raymond Chandler's novel "The Lady in the Lake." The whole movie is seen through the eyes of private detective Philip Marlowe, and his face (Montgomery's face) is shown only occasionally, mostly as a reflection. This is a clever approach but not very audience-friendly, or at least it wasn't with the limited technology of the 1940s. As a viewer, you're supposed to be part of the action, seeing things exactly as Marlowe would see them. But you're always aware that what's supposed to be a pair of curious eyes is just a swiveling camera. Everything seems slow and unreal.Fortunately, Montgomery sounds exactly the way Marlowe should sound, with an insolent edge to his voice even at those rare times when he's not making a wisecrack. He essentially narrates this film, just as the character of Marlowe narrated the novels, and that's a big plus. There's plenty of crackling dialogue, too.Screenwriters were always taking liberties with Raymond Chandler's convoluted plots. They had to. But it initially puzzled me that a novel set in midsummer should be turned into a movie set at Christmastime. I think I've figured out the answer. One of the many plot points in the novel concerned a supposed drowning at a lakeside resort in the California mountains (the lady in the lake). Marlowe spent a good part of the book nosing around the resort, and Chandler's putting him in that bucolic setting was a refreshing change of pace from the previous novels. But shooting scenes from Marlowe's point of view in the great outdoors would have been a chore. So while the screenplay retains the drowning incident, everything about it happens off-screen. The mountains are snowy and mostly deserted, so Marlowe barely even pays them a visit. The urban scenes from the book are emphasized instead. That's a pity.I wish Montgomery had made another, more conventional Marlowe film. But this is all we've got. It's a sometimes enjoyable oddity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PRINCIPAL ACTOR AND DIRECTOR, Mr. Robert Montgomery, displayed an aptitude for expanding his acting characterizations and general theatrical talents. The duties if being the film's Director would surely prove to be troublesome enough; yet the great actor took on a role in Phillip Marlowe. Many had felt was most decidedly a case of being cast against type.* THAT THE GRUFF, CYNICAL and world weary private eye had been and would be portrayed by so many different actors for so many various studios would seem to force a sort of competition as to whose portrayal is the best, the most valid and the truest to author Raymond Chandler's own concept.** THAT THE PRODUCTION employs the use of 'the subjective lens', where we see things just as the main character, Marlowe (Monygomery) would, could easily degenerate into a cinematic fiasco was apparently obvious at the start. Wisely and in a measure preempting boredom and monotony, this sort of experimental use of the camera's point of view is interspersed with the on-screen narration scenes by the Star/Director and by his appearance in several reflections.AS BAD COP and real bad guy, Lloyd Nolan is at the top of his game. Although he had most usually portrayed good guys, detectives and even neighborhood beat patrolman (A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, 1945), he performed well on the other side of the law. It was the sort of a part that actors relish and are able to 'let it all hang out' and act.THE ENTIRE SPIRIT of the film may well be capsulized with one line from what is not an important scene to the plot or the scenario. While Marlowe is presenting a crime story for submission to a detective magazine, he is asked by editor (Audrey Totter) and publisher (Leon Ames) of what is the story mostly made up? "Short sentences", he replies.NOTE * We do not concur. Mr. Montgomery previously did characters who could only be described as less than intellectual in THE EARL OF CHICAGO (MGM, 1940) and the fantasy/comedy, HERE COMES MR. JORDAN (Columbia, 1941).NOTE: ** We could have a 'contest' involving Dick Powell (MURDER MY SWEET, RKO, 1944), Humphrey Bogart(THE BIG SLEEP, Warner Brothers, 1946), George Montgomery (THE BRASHER DOUBLOON, 20TH Century-Fox, 1947), James Garner (MARLOWE,Cherokee Prod./Katzka-Berne Prod./MGM,1969) Elliot Gould (THE LONG GOODBYE, EK/Lion's Gate/United Artists,1973) and Robert Mitchum FAREWELL MY LOVELY, EK/ITC/Avco-Embassy,1977 and THE BIG SLEEP, ITC/Winkrest/United Artists,1978), James Caan POODLE SPRINGS (Avnet Kerner/HBO/Mirage Ent./Universal TV, 1998). Add to all these, Robert Montgomery and whoever else had the part on Radio and Teleision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Person Singular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the three major adaptations of Raymond Chamdler's Philip Marlowe detective novels from the 40s, I rate Lady In the Lake third; good at times, off kilter (deliberately) at others. It was directed by actor Robert Montgomery and appears to have few admirers. I do admire the film, warts and all. We see the story, convoluted to begin with, through the eyes of the main character, a private detective, but we don't see the detective. We see people talking to him and we hear him talking to them. It was a daring technique, and for me it half-succeeds. On the other hand I'm not sure I'd want to watch another detective movie made in the same style.Montgomery, an upper class sort of actor prior to the war, was trying to toughen up his screen image. Perhaps inspired by Dick Powell, who had changed his song and dance man image two years earlier, Montgomery, like Powell, chose Chandler's Philip Marlowe as the character to help him mature into tougher roles. Powell succeeded, and his career got a second wind thanks to Chandler. Montgomery didn't do quite so well, though the film apparently turned a tidy profit. As to the story itself, I can barely remember it. Due to the peculiar way the movie was made Chandler's story was in large measure sacrificed to accommodate Montgomery's at the time avant garde directorial technique.The cast is good but no one gets a chance to really shine in this one, least of all star Montgomery. As generally was the case with Chandler's novels, his stories tend to dart off in several different directions, and Lady In the Lake is no exception. If one can accept this, and the movie's offbeat qualities, it's an interesting experiment. To this it's worth adding that Montgomery was a gifted man, and in his direction of this film he shows considerable flair for,--of all things!--the surreal. Some of the best moments in the film are "throwaways". They make no sense but they're there and they resonate powerfully even as they have little connection to the plot itself. The movie is watchable if at times difficult to follow. Had its director indulged his flair for creating offbeat moments more frequently it would probably be better regarded today. As it stands, it's a bit too oddball for the average viewer. For the more open minded among us, it's a kind of rogue movie, an eccentric one off, and as such well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lady in the Lake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did I ever tell you I like films with a gimmick that isn't necessarily needed to tell the story? Well, I do. 'Lady in the Lake' is such a movie. The whole film is shot from Phillip Marlowe's POV. Instead of a voice-over it has a narration in which we actually see the actor, but instead of adding some diversity those segments also have the actor speaking directly to the camera, just like in the rest of the movie in which the other characters speak to Phillip Marlowe and look at him...and usThis Phillip Marlowe is cynic beyond description. No matter how well-meaning the people are, no matter what is said to him, he smashes it down and makes fun of what is said and of who is saying it. All of this in a mean and cold-hearted tone. This gets a bit monotonous and I thought "lighten up already", but I enjoyed his snarky comebacks (some of them even cracked me up) as well as his grumpy attitude in general. It's funny how the other characters kept coming back to him although the guy surely was no fun to be around. Especially the movie's femme fatale, if we can call her that. They simultaneously loved and hated each other. Marlowe for one mainly hated her because he didn't know if he could trust her or not. I for one enjoyed the numerous minutes in which the blonde looked at me, not only for her being pretty but she had nice exaggerated mimic.The plot is very straight forward and probably would have made an unremarkable film if told conventionally. Naturally the structure of the plot also is straight forward and it's only in the piling up of events, clues and facts that it offers something challenging to the viewer. And although it's a bit clumsy at times I enjoyed how the plot unfolded. I felt it ended with a bang when a reoccurring line of dialogue finds its final purpose and the love/hate relationship between Marlowe comes to a satisfying conclusion.Generally the shots go on for several minutes and quite often you can see where scenes were stitched together but I didn't mind that at all. In all its staying true to the gimmick it visually doesn't look or feel much like a film noir, despite its hard-boiled-ness.Overall the gimmick works pretty seamlessly. The often-used effect of Marlowe looking at himself in the mirror (the camera had to always stay out of the frame) is quite convincing. Only when he is interacting with things, when we see Marlowe's hand, or smoke shoots out from under the camera as he's having a cigarette it requires a certain suspension of disbelief as the positions usually don't really work out all too greatly. And if you think about it it is a bit odd how static the camera usually is. Obviously nowadays this would be shot hand-held and in the light of this we should probably be thankful the camera is this static.Maybe having everybody look right at you becomes a bit redundant at times, but that comes with the gimmick. It surely can't be said that the movie offers much diversity nor is it even overly inventive and adventurous in the use of its gimmick, but in spite of this it always had my attention and I had fun watching it. A big reason for this IS the gimmick, which is the source of many of the movie's pluses as well as minuses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked some of this-Montgomery as Marlowe was a stretch(dig the Grecian on the hair!), and I wasn't too impressed by his direction. Others have brought up the problem areas-pacing, lack of edits, bad performances-to which I will say I do agree by and large. Good try but no cigar.The best parts? Lloyd Nolan as Always-very capable-he should have been Marlowe here, and Audrey Trotter, who I've never heard of before-very striking and who acts quite well in this. The bad? Leon Ames seemed unsure, Jayne Meadows(!) over-acts badly, Montgomery does okay but is miscast.You also have a couple too many names and people tossed into the mix-Almore/Murial/Chrystal etc w/out having their identities clearly established, so you begin to not care who did what to who. I did like the car wreck and the fights from the camera's point of view, that did take some daring 60 years ago.Overall, a **1/2 effort, Lloyd done it and Jayne Meadows done it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoying or disturbing situations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lady in the lake" (1947) directed by Robert Montgomery as actor himself in a trend for developing the narrative like a subjective plot. Whose voice-over was directly concerning with the action, but he is as an insider without screening the body, except his reflex on mirror - one of the best shots when seeing a lady with the mirror in her hand aside as a cubic shape on which is the figure of the detective as noble man - and only his own hands sometimes and the same for the feet in others situations.Too much duration for this kind of trend, but this fiction about a detective investigation - made as it was the writer himself - is obviously a factual reference and Montgomery also made this movie for helping the industry for a much more fast renovation of models, it seems now. It's difficult knowing else about what means since then the relative silence at the time from the writer himself concerning this trend, but this one was not very happy with as deduction from a brief commentary at the time as exception in Hollywood discoveries for the business. The look of the camera is two times as perturbing the movie goers when the objects focused are somewhat distorted as plastic or plasticine, like enlarged or compressed in a new space dimension by the effect of the lens and as if it was alcoholism the main problem in this troubled fictive universe that changes continually as in a psychological mind without many other solutions than himself, alone as an outsider character to bring us some quietude about his discoveries on the solution of the subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky noir, worth a look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "Lady in the Lake" when I was a teenager, and really loathed it. I thought the film's famous gimmick - that it's shot in "first-person" style, with the camera acting as Philip Marlowe's eyes - was lame and cutesy. I was also thoroughly annoyed by the fact that the lake referenced in the film's title never actually appears on screen!When I saw the film again recently, I enjoyed it more. Maybe that's because I've gotten a little more crusty and cynical in the past few years, like Marlowe himself, so I can now fully appreciate his world-weary attitude and wisecracks.Unlike some other reviewers, I don't really think that the camera point-of-view trick undermines the film. It's actually pretty clever, and on my second viewing, it never really irritated me. The only significant limitation I noticed was that the camera's movements were rather too slow to effectively mimic a human's movements - but I guess that was inevitable in those days, huh? Anyway, I think the film's actual weaknesses lie more in the realm of tone and plot. The central romance is the part that's a little too cute for me, not the camera-work. And of course, the story is convoluted in the way of most Chandler stories, which can get irritating sometimes.If "Lady in the Lake" was somehow a little darker, a littler sexier, and perhaps a little easier to follow, it might have been one of the great noirs. As it is, the film is basically a fun time-killer, but it falls well short of the classic Bogie (and non-Bogie) detective thrillers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lady in the Lake is a lot more fun than a gimmick movie should be. Perhaps that's because the script is good enough not to need the gimmick, which is just as well because Robert Montgomery and Audrey Totter are far too arch for their roles to really convince. The gimmick, of course, is that aside from the bookends and sporadic interruptions to fill in details, the film is shot almost entirely from Phillip Marlowe's point of view: we see what he sees, and the lens gets punched when he gets punched. Doubling as director, Montgomery has fun with the technique, allowing the camera's 'attention' to get sidetracked by a passing secretary or getting knocked out by a suspect, although he is completely stumped as to how to show a phone call, leading to the film's worst shot (a dull shot of a door with a receiver in the foreground). You tend to forget you're watching the gimmick, and in some scenes, such as Marlowe crawling away from a car wreck to a phone booth, it works incredibly well. There are some problems with the plotting, though: there's a huge clue to the central mystery in the cast list (two, in fact), and it's a shame that the entire lake section of the story is simply relayed in straight-to-camera dialogue (by far the most awkward part of Montgomery's performance). Jayne Meadows' performance also veers the film to the purely comic, but Lloyd Nolan is a convincingly unpleasant flatfoot and there's one great one-sided phone conversation in the police chief's office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Am a Camera!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lady In the Lake" is an unusual film in that the story is told from the perspective of the hero, Philip Marlowe (Robert Montgomery). The camera becomes Marlowe's eyes and we see what he sees. As a result Montgomery the star of the film is only seen when Marlowe looks into a mirror or in the narrations that are inserted briefly at different points of the story. It gave Montgomery I suppose, more time to spend behind the camera as the film's director.Marlowe on the pretext that a book he has written will be published, meets with publisher Adrienne Fromsett (Audrey Totter). He finds out the real reason for this meeting is to hire his services to find the missing wife of Fromsett's boss Kingsby (Leon Ames). Along the way he encounters a couple of murders and cops DeGormot (Lloyd Nolan) and Capt. Kane (Tom Tully). He also meets an apparent land lady (Jayne Meadows) who will unexpectedly turn up later in the story.While undergoing beatings and jailings, Marlowe still manages to have heroine Totter fall in love with him. The real "femme fatale" of the film turns out to be Meadows in a marvellous performance.Although it's technically a "film noire" it lacks many of the characteristics of these films such as the shadows, wet streets, high ceilings et al.Montgomery plays Marlowe as a gruff thoroughly unlikeable character. We really don't get to know him because we hardly see him. Totter is good as the heroine having to play most of her lengthy scenes directly into the camera.Although this "I am the camera" technique had been used before, it was never used, as far as I know, for an entire film. And, I don't think that this was ever done again.Not a bad film, but it could have been better,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Made as a first person account from PI Phillip Marlows point of view "Lady in the Lake" has the audience having to stumble through the entire film like it's watching a home-movie with Marlow getting belted slapped hit by a car and shot at without them once seeing him.Made like the "Blair Witch Project" , with light and easy to handle camcorders, over 50 years later "Lady in the Lake" is so slow in it's action due to the heavy and bulky movie cameras of that time that it gives you the impression that those in it are either on downers or are having trouble with their eye to muscle coordination.Marlow now into writing detective stories is called to the offices of Kingsby's Publications and offered $200.00 for a short story he submitted there called "If I should die before I live". Talking to editor Adrienne Fromsett Marlow later get's an offer from her to find her boss', Derrance Kingsby, estranged wife Crystal who is expected to serve him with divorce papers. Tracking a lead down to Bay City Marlow get's to see a friend of Crystal's Chris Lavery who after offering Marlow his brand of southern hospitably clod-cocks him when he gets a little personal in Chris' relationship with the missing Crystal Kingsby. Knocked out and drenched with booze Marlow lands in the Bay Ciy police station and told to get out of town if he knows what's good for him. Marlow later gets the news of a mysterious woman found floating in Little Fawn Lake outside of Bay City near the Kingsby's summer home; was the woman, badly decomposed after a month in the lake, the missing Crystal Kingsby?Phillip Marlow gets sidetracked a number of times, as well as almost killed in a staged traffic accident, to prevent him from finding out just who the dead woman in Little fawn Lake really is. Suspecting everyone it becomes clear that the dead woman may well have been Derrance Kingsby's maid a Mrs. Muriel Chess who may have been having an affair with him and was murdered by an outraged Mrs. Kingsby. Marlow also finds out that local Bay City cop Let. DeGarmot was seen around Little Fawn Lake some time before both Mrs. Kingsby and Muiel Chess disappeared. Let.DeGarmot was involved with one of the local women there a Miss. Mildred Havelend who turns out to be the key to both Muriel Chess and Crystal Kingsby's disappearance. We earlier found out that the obnoxious and sneaky Chris Lavery was murdered just after Marlow was sent to dreamland by him. Leaving the battered and beaten private, now black, eye as the prime suspect in Lavery's murder!With a number of clues falling into Marlow's lap he deducts that both Crystal Kingsby and Muriel Chess are one and the same person so who is the lady in the lake? Crystal Kingsby/Muriel Chess? And who is the woman who later got in touch with Derrance claiming to be his wife Crystal and who Derrance? Who's willing to give $500.00 in order for her to leave Bay City, with Phillip Marlow being the go between, to keep from being arrested by the police if she's really not his wife? And most of all what does Let. DeGarmot and the mysterious Mildred Havelend have to do with the lady in the lake since both of them were known to be at Little Fawn Lake just days before her, or Crystal Kingsby/ Muriel Chess, body was dumped there?A one trick movie that gets you more caught up with what's happening behind the camera then what's in front of it and by doing that it takes away the mystery of what really happened, and who's responsible,for the lady in the lake who you lost interest in long before you find out who she is and who murdered her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just you, the detective, and some unfortunate characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assessing this film, I cannot help but address the subjective camera work that is an essential part of the Lady in the Lake viewing experience. The first person point of view makes the characters seem more vulnerable than in films shot in the typical style. One of the technique's unique rewards is that I am allowed to watch the cast continuously (while they are reacting to the main character) which is demanding of the actors. I think this makes the film more entertaining, as if a show is being put on just for me. I feel like I am being catered and spoken to from the first moment Montgomery addresses the camera. It is as if I am the only one who has ever heard these characters' stories. I think the approach works during most of the film. Publishing magnate Ames's disinterested moments, as described by another here, to me are fitting of a wealthy man prone to hiring others to work and worry for him. There are only a few times when I estimate Totter as overreacting, but I assume that is partially the director's responsibility.Nevertheless, the film has made me an admirer of Totter, an effect I would never have predicted based on other characters she has portrayed who seem to have little vulnerability. I find the growth of her relationship with Montgomery to be natural because, as time progresses, she exposes details of herself, becoming more interesting as an independent woman, yet forming a bond with him through their gritty backgrounds or views of life. The non-stop witty dialogue is beyond entertaining, although I think Meadows's speech could be more believable. I have read that Chandler did not like this adaptation perhaps because it was a struggle to reformat his words to the screen. I guess in his quest for perfection he did not realize the fine job he did matching vitriolic comments to his fascinating characters' underworld-type lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better Marlowe films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Mr. Marlowe in all of his (Hollywood) guises. My favorites are Bogart and Robert Montgomery, with a leaning to Montgomery. Why? He seems to embody the Marlowe character of the books better, especially in his attitude. He reminds me of Spenser and Rockford combined. In Lady, he is a bit more weary, a smidge more intolerant of the deceptive people he encounters. Almost everyone he meets has something to hide from him. What makes this film a bit different from any other is the technique of showing the film from Marlowe's point of view. With the camera as Marlowe's eyes, we are limited to what he really sees, whether it is his constant girl watching or looking out of a broken car door window. We see Marlowe only six times, and only when he looks into a mirror. The only awkward times are a few times when Marlowe walks, which is more of a creep. Overall, I found this film very good. Its mystery is complex, pieced together from a bunch of obtuse liars. We never get the entire story, just enough to know who did what and why. My rating: 7 out of 10. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

The Director and Star let his ego interfere with a pure, perfect work and almost completely destroying the charm in the "process".To be fair, point-of-view camera just does not work and does nothing but draw attention to itself and breaks, no shatters, the fourth wall. As a result the acting seems over baked and the dialog seems over delivered, and the creaky experiment becomes an expectorant, a Mickey-Finn.It's all handled with extreme competence and professionalism and it is curious to see them pull it off. Maybe it needed to be done once to prove it can't be done. Just wish they hadn't used Chandler, Marlow, and film-noir to exploit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gimmick Doesn't Pay Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lady in the Lake (1947) ** (out of 4) Private detective Phillip Marlowe (Robert Montgomery) is hired by a woman (Audrey Totter) to track down her bosses wife who has ran off with another man. Marlowe isn't sure why this woman is so interested in her bosses life but after a few punches to the head and a couple murders, the detective finds himself trying to sort it all out. This film turned out to be Montgomery's final at MGM so I guess it was some sort of gift that they'd also allow him to direct it. This is a pretty legendary noir, not because it's great but because it's filmed in a first-person style where we rarely see the Marlowe character and instead we just see everything from his point of view. I'm normally not a fan of gimmick movies and there's no doubt that the gimmick here is the real star. I think this is good and bad. The good thing is that the movie certainly has an original look and feel. The point of view shots give the film a sort of weird dimension that it wouldn't have had otherwise. I thought the film did benefit from some unique camera shots including a wonderful one early one when the camera pans around to where we finally see Marlowe in a mirror. Montgomery, the director, handles this gimmick quite well and it certainly keeps you interesting as this is really the only original aspect in the film. What makes the gimmick not work are the performances. It's really strange but everyone overacts something terrible here as if they were trying to "force" themselves on the camera. Each actor seems to be posing for the camera, noticing that the camera is there and just going way over the top in their deliveries as well as their actions. At first I thought I just needed to get use to the way the film was being shot but the performances stayed this way until the end. Another problem is that the story itself is pretty weak and at times never really makes any sense as it just wonders off in various directions and we're left with an unsatisfying ending that really doesn't work. To top it off we get some incredibly bad edits that are way too obvious and fake. On a whole, this film really doesn't work in the end but it's still worth viewing at least once due to the point of view stuff and some of the nice camera shots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say the idea of showing everything through the eyes of the protagonist is pretty inventive, but this movie's script isn't really clever enough to do anything with this element. The creative way in which the story is told is intriguing, but nobody really bothered to figure out how to use this perspective as an advantage. They just seem to use it for the hell of it, which isn't really a good reason. Also there appear to be some technical boundaries that come into play, which make the main character move really slow and unnatural from time to time. It seems as if the camera wasn't as mobile as they thought it would be. When the hero can't be seen that adds a lot of mystery to the story, then again he stands in front of mirrors all the time so never mind. As for the plot, it's rather interesting, but the climax isn't really that fulfilling. It wraps up the plot, but I expected more from it. There are some twists, but not ones that will make you jump out of your seat with excitement. What I did like however was the acting and the overall style of the film, it has a dark style I quite enjoyed. The general tone of the movie is spot-on, unfortunately the writing is less convincing. Still, it's a decent film noir.</fullReview>

Its Christmas time, he has no friends, he has no wife, he has no family, and he deals with the scum of the earth each and every day. If I was him I would be pretty upset too. Montgomery portrays Marlowe as an everyday regular guy you would meet on the streets. I like that aspect. As for Bogart's and Powell's adaptation of this great detective I would have to say that Powell's ranks at the top and depending on your personal preference Bogie or Montgomery could both come in at the # 2 spot. Robert Mitchum also plays a pretty good Marlowe.As for the film itself. The great unique first person camera work really makes this film stand out. They tried something new and I think it worked out pretty well.

		<fullReview>As confusing a plot as any Chandler novel might be, The Lady in the Lake screenplay is full of some interesting twists, film noir staples, and a unique point of view. The viewer sees only what the protagonist Phillip Marlowe sees - and just the way he sees it! Yes, at first I thought this novelty was interesting, but eventually it lost its allure and started hurting the actual story - of course this may have been purposely done. The story starts with Marlowe sitting in an armchair telling us about this crazy case of his that creeps up in suspense. A book editor hires Marlowe to find her boss's wife. After that, who knows? Joking aside, I have a vague idea about what the eventual outcome of the film was - but have no complete account to be sure. Bob Montgomery plays the detective and I think his performance hurts the film the most. He isn't bad, but he isn't real good either. After seeing Bogie in Murder My Sweet, my expectations were too high I suppose. Montgomery does a workmanlike job if nothing else, but he plays one crabby private dick! He is all sour and no sweet. Bogart at least always had a high level of humour indirectly laced throughout his performance. He was a layered character - something film noir heroes strive to be. Montgomery's Marlowe is just cantankerous and crabby. We see only one side. The rest of the cast is okay - Lloyd Nolan gives a pretty good performance. The main "doll," Audrey Totter is a pretty accessory who overacts quite a bit. Nothing real special here, but certainly I recommend it for its film novelty if nothing else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is clearly the best of the films based on a Chandler novel. You don't have to take my word for it, Robert B. Parker (novelist and chosen to finish "Poodle Springs" and wrote a sequel to "The Big Sleep" (which wasn't as good, but had its moments)) felt that it was the best.Chandler did very little of the script, perhaps a loose first version or just a treatment, it was Steve Fisher who crafted this from the novel and definitely got what was important dead on. I lived in LA for ten years - in the 70s and 80s, not the 40s - and the film really gets the nature of the weather (for example) at Christmas in a way that other films (even ones like Die Hard or Lethal Weapon) don't quite pull off. The scene in the bedroom where Marlowe is searching for clues says a lot just by having the window open and the curtain riffling slightly from a breeze with bright sunlight refracted ny the translucent curtains. But it was taking the Fromsett character from a small bit in the novel to a major role in the film that makes this work.As others have mentioned, Marlowe was not particularly smitten with women in general, and this film gets that in full. Robert Montgomery, and this script nail that aspect of Marlowe perfectly... the tension between Fromsett and Marlowe is amazing, the dialog is merciless (Fromsett blunt about living HER life for money, marrying it, and does NOT want Marlowe either in the mix or interfering.) The dialog and the way that these two amazing actors turn the lines is like watching two spinning disks on a table bump into each other and send off sparks. Despite the attraction, neither one wants the complications of the other, or really any other person.My experience with LA is that the mind warping combination of freedom and opportunity tends to make it one of the friendliest places on the planet... and yet there is a suspicion that strong relationships interfere with freedom.Steve Fisher's dialog was spot on with the relationship. The plotting was much better than the book, more robust (the Big Sleep was a brilliant synthesis of short stories by Chandler and the movie was great at presenting those - although one of the murders got lost, with the Bogart Bacall chemistry, who could care?) and visually very very impressive.Also, I've noted that few of the reviewers here have mentioned how difficult it must have been for the actors to memorize so many minutes of dialog in all the scenes. That, and playing to a camera lens rather than directly against another actor, would have been difficult. And, of course, those sets aren't just standing still, they are breaking away to let the cameras cover the action from POV.This may not be considered a great film, but in most ways it was a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great directing and writing hampered by the camera trickery...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lady in the Lake (1947)This classic film noir is shot almost entirely from the point of view of the protagonist, and it is this subjective camera technique (or trick) that has made the film famous. (Hollywood regular Paul Vogel is behind the camera here.) But it is not its best point. The star is Robert Montgomery, who is not its best point, either, because he makes a sluggish and steady kind of Philip Marlowe, the famous Raymond Chandler detective played better by Bogart in The Big Sleep and Dick Powell in Murder, My Sweet (and much later by Robert Mitchum in two films).But Montgomery turns out to be a marvelous director. If you remove the affectation of the camera, which is both intriguing and distracting, you have a really smart and increasingly dense telling of a great plot. And with growing admiration you have to appreciation the really sharp writing behind it all. Chandler isn't just some pulp fiction hack, and his books and their movie adaptations have stood the test of seventy years very well.But the camera-work does demand a lot from a viewer. At times it's brilliant, playing with black out or with glancing around a room in a real time way. At other times, it makes the movie stiff. One curious decision was to have the other characters look Marlowe (the camera) in the eye, often without looking away, and so the characters are staring right at you when they speak. This isn't just the painfully stiff opening where Montgomery introduces the whole yarn, but in the midst of tense encounters. For a movie that has half an hour of this kind of camera, used with far more ingenuity and energy, check out Dark Passage from the same year (released eight months after this one).And there is the problem of Montgomery the actor, a rather nice fellow with a solidity and calmness bordering on dull that is just not quite what we want from our detective. He delivers famously terrific lines, but there is some edge, some sarcasm, so necessary loneliness missing. This is the guy who when asked by the leading lady, "Where do you spend your Christmases," says, "In bars."</fullReview>

Shots where you can see Montgomery in mirrors feel gimicky and take you out of the movie. The story is pretty good, though, and it's worth seeing at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the only film I can remember shot entirely in the first person POV. It's an attempt to capture the first person POV nature of the Chandler novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a video game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was done like a video game before there were video games. In the movie, you the viewer are Marlowe, in much the same way as you can be the main character in a video game. Way cool. This is a must see.In some scenes you can see the actor who plays Marlowe, but only when he is looking in a mirror, which means that it is you looking in the mirror. I really like the technique used in this film, and wonder why it hasn't been used more.The only downside of this movie is that it will be compared to the Bogart movie where he played Marlowe. And this will be compared to the book. Which will make some people dislike this film. However if you view it as a unique piece of Hollywood film making, it makes it a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disorienting camera work and amateur acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film made in the late 1940's, it was ingenious for them to tell the story with mostly point of view shots. Some parts are done well, especially with shots in which characters were supposed to be looking in a mirror at their reflection. This obviously cannot be since the camera is not seen in the 'reflection'. However, the point of view shots overall was not properly utilized and did not work for me. For one thing, the film like most film noirs, have first person narration and this starts off with Marlowe talking to the camera. This is startling because scenes of him talking to us, the audience, is juxtaposed with shots from his perspective. Thus the film continuously engages us to see from his perspective but then breaks that by showing him narrating. On top of that, point of view shots move slowly and deliberately. That is how a camera moves, not human vision. Pans are painfully slow and make the impression as if Marlowe's head rotates 180 degrees. Furthermore, the acting is quite cringe-worthy as it is often cheesy an abrupt. The way Totter changes the emotions of her character so suddenly is almost comical. Montgomery's delivery is also monotonous (though this is more the style of film noirs in general), and his lines are dry which at times make it funny. The relationship between Totter and Montgomery is presented ambiguously and the chemistry is just not there. However, Nolan and Meadows added a bit of spice to the film and made it a little more engaging.Settings and costumes are presented well with the great use of props. Lighting is representative of film noir films and creates the desired effect. Overall, an OK film that passes the time well enough but with disorienting camera work and dry acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phillip Marlowe Tale With Unique Point of View</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"YOU and ROBERT MONTGOMERY solve a murder mystery together!" That was the tagline for this innovative film that was released in 1947. Montgomery directed this film in which he starred as Phillip Marlowe, private eye. And the entire film is shot from Marlowe's POV. It's gimmicky, it's brave, and it's original. It feels just like playing a modern first-person video game. You do feel like you are reviewing the evidence with Marlowe. And it forces the camera to move very deliberately, contributing to an almost hypnotic tone.This film has all the hallmarks of a detective noir--B&amp;W film, dramatic music, overly dramatic acting, and a protagonist that talks tough, usually in a clipped manner.You might have some difficulty buying Montgomery as a tough dick, but he acquits himself well enough. His use of the camera more than makes up for it. There are a couple of shots where he asks the audience to ignore the fact that images in mirrors, and such, are not properly aligned, but it's a minor distraction.It doesn't hurt that Montgomery cast some beautiful, also-tough broads. I'm guessing he asked them to present themselves to the camera in a very stylized way, and it helps draw the viewer into the film.Overall, the film is a joy to watch. You might lose sight of the twisting plot (ala "The Maltese Falcon") because of the visuals, but you can concentrate on the plot during your second viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Are Marlowe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Montgomery both directed and stars in this adaptation of the Raymond Chandler novel about private detective Philip Marlowe(previously played by both Dick Powell &amp; Humphrey Bogart in unrelated films) who is hired by magazine editor Adrienne Fromsett(played by Audrey Totter) to find the missing wife of her boss Derace Kingsby(played by Leon Ames) Of course, the case proves to be more complicated and dangerous than either of them realized. Unusual but failed experiment at putting the viewer in Marlowe's point of view, as Montgomery is seldom seen but in reflections. Totter is good, but Montgomery is weak as Marlowe, and film becomes tedious before it reaches its clichéd resolution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Xmas Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third adaption of Raymond Chandler's most famous character in the Noir era has Robert Montgomery (succeeding Dick Powell and Boagie) assume the role of Philip Marlowe as well as the director's chair.Marlowe is called to the office of a crime magazine publisher by the editor to secretly locate the boss's wife but uncovers a bigger conspiracy in the process. It's a little long-winded, but the presence of Audrey Totter and her large, staring, watching eyes alleviates some of that. But what is most interesting about the movie is the subjective camera gimmick.With the exception of three narration scenes in which Marlowe talks directly to the camera, we see the entire movie through his eyes. The scenes are all acted out in long, single, continuous takes. We sometimes see Marlowe when he looks in a mirror, or when he reaches his hand out to pick something up though he's mostly off-screen, his voice coming from behind the camera. Some how criticized this as being eventually tiresome, but I never once got bored of it and I found it to be a very interesting way to immerse the audience in the story. I've never seen it done in any other movie.It does have a problem, which might be related to this point of view, in that the titular lady and lake are never actually seen but only referenced. I guess this was to keep location scenes absent as they would be too hard to shoot in long, continuous takes but they could have built a fake location on a set. We never get to see the streets of the fictional Bay City or the snowy mountains Marlowe refers to. It would have greatly increased the Xmas atmosphere, which is merely a cursory backdrop at best.Still very much worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunningly bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know there are already many reviews here, and this one will probably never be read, but this movie was in a class by itself, and I just had to have my say. I'm in my 50s, and this is one of the worst stinkers I have ever seen. I got about five minutes into it, and had to turn it off and go take a shower. How did the studio ever release this turd? The only way it would work is on television with the sound muted and a funny commentary pasted over it.The cinematography is of the 1950s 3D movie quality, but without the redeeming factor of humor to save it. I love this genre of film, but this was beyond embarrassment. Everyone involved should have been suspended from Hollywood for a year as punishment. This thing should be shown to death row prisoners every day to make them suffer even more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Fiasco</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one 'aint worth the trouble!! It is all wrong, really all wrong. Robert Montgomery as Phillip Marlow????? Give me a break......he is about as tough as Richard Simmons and this part calls for one tough cookie. That grating voice of his will put you off......besides, his acting here is way below his usual standard. This film looks like the bottom half of a double bill at a grind house and is supposed to be an "A" list movie. The point of view camera was an experiment that fell flat on its face. It is extremely distracting and when you do see Montgomery (besides in the mirror scenes), he is talking full face into the camera.....it reminds me of those health lecture films they used to show in high school. The acting in this film is absolutely atrocious....Leon Ames is laughable, Audrey Totter, usually a good actress, is ludicrous and I've already given my opinion about Montgomery. And then there is Jayne Meadows......no wonder she never made it as an actress anyone could take seriously. Guess what?...I hate this film....and it is not because Bogart pulled it off so masterfully in The Big Sleep.....it is just a rotten movie. What were they thinking?</fullReview>
