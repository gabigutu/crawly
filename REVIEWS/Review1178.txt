		<fullReview>Yes, Michael Moore has an agenda. However, every documentary does. Believe it or not folks, but a documentary does not just show reality, it also interprets it. Remember the experts that Ken Burns shows in all of his documentaries? He used them to interpret the facts of the Civil War, Jazz, and Baseball, among others. The Ken Burn's agenda just wasn't as controversial as Michael Moore's.The point of a documentary is for those who see it to start making their own judgments. If you don't agree with Michael Moore's interpretation of the why's of the Iraq war, what is the right interpretation? Can you use the facts or find more facts to come up with a different interpretation? I would call that highly unlikely, but I would like to see the interpretation.This documentary set out to answer the question "Why is the US in Iraq?" I can tell you I have asked that question a lot and I found no good reason. Michael Moore has done the same thing, just to a larger audience. While you might disagree with his assessment that it was strictly for money, it is hard to support a different view after seeing this movie. You would be hard pressed to find any evidence linking Iraq and Al-Qaeda. Why? Because it doesn't exist. No matter how much Bush railed for a link, even he had to admit it wasn't there. I guess I would like to see a Republican version of events. I just can't imagine what it would use as evidence. How can you refute the 7 minutes of inactivity of Mr. Bush in the Florida classroom on 9/11? How can you refute the fact that planes were loaded up with Bin Laden relatives on 9/13? How can you call the "coalition of the willing" a coalition if it includes countries that send no troops? These are the facts folks. Michael Moore interpreted them to slam the Bush administration. I was saying the same thing before this movie. However, I reach a small audience since I don't make movies. Thanks to Michael Moore for making this film. Maybe some of the clueless, like Britney Spears, will wake up and start questioning what is going on out there. Because, Ms. Spears, in America, we are allowed to question the president. He isn't God, he is a human being. So, pro-Iraq war people, give me your interpretation. Why? Why are we there? Why don't we have Osama Bin Laden? Why?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A whirlwind tour of corruption and diplomatic deceit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fahrenheit 9/11" is an important film, dealing in detail with the great issues of current American society, with a degree of skepticism that our newsmedia has proven entirely incapable of exhibiting in the last decade. Lone gadfly Michael Moore cannot singlehandedly reverse the effects of a servile corporate media, but he can -- and does -- fling it right back in their faces. Is it any wonder televised interviews with Moore have been less-than-cordial of late? It doesn't matter. For a film like this, any publicity is beneficial, and Michael Moore has gone out of his way to thank his conservative detractors for their support. As a movie, it's a whirlwind tour of corruption and diplomatic deceit at the highest levels of the industrial-political machine, mixed with direct examination of the lives of the "ordinary" people affected by the decisions of the aristocratic few. Much like a roller-coaster ride, it pulls you up the first steep incline with images of the 2000 presidential election followed by the major players in the bush administration getting ready for their performances, and then comes the first plunge: a stomach-wrenching drop into the black screen, with only the sounds of that awful day in September when "everything changed". Fade back in on the people of New York, confused, hurting, seeking their loved ones in the rubble.  From here on, there is no stopping for breath. We observe the flight of Saudi aristocrats who, but for their political connections, might have been held as material witnesses. Moore depicts vividly the links between the Bush family and their Saudi friends, one of whom (Prince Bandar) "earns" the Bush surname. On it goes, fact after fact after irrefutable and disgusting fact. Many of us entered the theatre thinking we knew the score, but seldom has an overview of each tree led to such a complete vision of the forest. Along the way, we'll see behavior from members of the bush administration that cannot be described as flattering -- but once again, this isn't up for debate. It's the facts, it's what they themselves said. You can argue context, but the footage speaks for itself. And more than anything else, this is where Michael Moore proves he's grown as a director. No longer are his films chock-full of his narrative, he lets the evildoers hoist themselves on their own petards without as much overdubbed commentary. His statement rests in the overall structure of the film, rather than his usual assortment of shame-defying pecadillos and exposes. Which is not to say that fans of his spirited antics won't have something to watch, as he drives around the capital building in an ice cream truck reading the Patriot act to the representatives who never bothered to read the legislation they passed, or chases after congressmen trying to get them interested in enlisting their children for a tour of duty in Iraq. Aaah, Iraq. The second half of the film deals with the buildup to and execution of our current adventure in nation building. Iraq is shown with a brief clip from before and a whole lot of after -- with its people confused, hurting, seeking their loved ones in the rubble. Our soldiers are also given plenty of time on-screen, time to describe what it's like, time to proclaim the thrills, dangers, and ennui of life as an occupying army. Far from being unsupportive as claimed by its detractors, this film makes every effort to give the front-liners their say. Wounded soldiers are treated with no less compassion than the other victims in this film. And unlike the corporate newsmedia, Moore's cameras dare to follow the injured to the Walter Reed medical center and into their underfunded rehabilitation. And it follows the heart of a patriotic woman from Moore's hometown of Flint whose soldier son makes the ultimate sacrifice for Bush's folly.This is, above all, a sympathetic, patriotic and humanistic movie. Even its main star, George W. Bush, is given a measure of understanding. We understand that he is out of his league, unable to push for the appropriate diplomatic solutions with Saudi Arabia, forever beholden to the corporate interests that purchased his throne, barely capable of coherent thought, and not at all comfortable with the responsibilities of the presidency. He would far rather be golfing, or "lookin' for bugs", or hanging at fundraisers with "the haves and the have-mores"; the presidency is a burden he clearly cannot bear. He almost begs to be removed from office.This movie has a lot more to say than any reviewer's encapsulation can convey. Ignore the naysayers who, in all likelihood, haven't even seen the film. Understand that the facts are the facts, the presentation is Mr. Moore's, and your opinion is your own. My opinion: 10/10 -- If there's a documentary/editorial piece that could touch this one, I haven't seen it yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The silence before the ovation is what stays with me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to what so many of us were lead to believe, this movie does not portray a negative message. George W. Bush and his administration aren't painted as fascist tyrants at all. They appear to be fools, power-hungry but fallible. As such, their stranglehold over the American people isn't concrete. There is hope that things can change, and that seems to be the overall message in this film.For every American soldier Moore shows talking about the adrenaline rush they get when they kill, every soldier that appears on screen as a trigger-happy madman, he shows an American soldier dead on the streets of Iraq. The film progresses as a two-hour reenactment of the thoughts that must go through so many soldiers minds, starting out as a soldier going to war, fighting for the safety of their country against enemies that surely want all Americans dead, but all certainty of their righteousness gives way to hesitation, to men and women questioning why they are there fighting a war that has no clear justification. Moore also uses his various clips and interviews to show how similar the American civilian population are to the Iraqis. His portrayal of the Saddam-era Iraq was certainly biased, but so many people are happy, looking for joy and prosperity, something that isn't as alien as some of us would like to think of the Iraqis as being. One thing that stays in my mind now, the day after watching this film, is one Iraqi woman crying for her lost family members outside her burned and ruined home, screaming to Allah for help. Comparing that woman to Ms. Lipscombe from Flint, Michigan, who lost her son in the war, crying in her interview with Moore and asking for support from Jesus just shows how this war affects all the people caught up in it equally.That is to say, all of the people, except those running it. Throughout the horrifying clips of war, we see Bush, who appears to be completely out of touch with how his war is affecting those who are fighting it for him. Bush's bumbling makes up the lighter moments in the film, but in retrospect, they are just as frightening as the War itself. Moore's overall message was that hope exists, but without action on the part of the silent and downtrodden, that hope will vanish. This is a film designed to have people take action, whether it is in the form of taking to the streets in protest, or simply voting Bush out of office in November. It was a powerful message for a powerful film, and as many have said before me, it received standing ovation at the end. But it was that short moment of silence before the applause that really stays with me. That quiet collective gasp where people are trying to digest the weight of Moore's message.Yes this movie is biased. It is the war and the world through Moore's eyes, but the message is not buried in the bias. I suppose I can sum it up best by saying this film was painfully human. It is human nature to question injustice and hypocrisy, and Moore is there to remind us of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm a War President."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be fair, I should qualify this review by saying that I'm progressive, a political science professor, anti-war, and a Bush opponent. So I was hardly watching this film with an objective eye.That being said (and if you can still trust my review), Michael Moore has done American voters a big service by making this film. It's not without it weaknesses, namely the voice-overs where Moore speculates on Bush's thoughts during those endless blank stares. But for once, Moore has made a film that is woven together with a chronological and thematic logic that ultimately asks one critical question: Is it that the Powers that Be don't understand, or that they simply don't believe in, true democratic principles? While George W. Bush is the primary subject of the film's critiques, the Democrats are not left unscathed. In fact, the first 10 minutes are devoted to a skewering of the Democratically-controlled Senate (including, ironically, former V.P., Senate President, and Presidential contender Al Gore.) Moore's commentary here, as with his past films, revolves around the relationship between money and power, and how that connection degrades democracy and in its most insidious form, leads to the loss of innocent lives. While he holds the Bush family and key administration officials most directly accountable, Moore does not let anyone off the hook. This includes not just the usual suspects (Saudi Arabia), but the Democratic leadership, the Supreme Court, the media, and finally, the American voters. Nothing here is new to anyone who has spent any time perusing the alternative or progressive media in the past four years, but the effect is substantial because Moore has finally shown himself to be a true documentarian, and has woven together a coherent picture of the connections between the players and the events from December 2000 to the present. Setting aside the few moments of Moore's own commentary and some silly interjections of old westerns, the message ultimately relies on the presentation of documents, images, and interviews. The facts are so tight that the worst anyone can say about the veracity of the film is that it is biased, a critique that will carry far less weight when compared to the snippets of Fox news propaganda spliced into the movie.Moore will be called anti-American, unpatriotic, and probably a fascist. This, of course, is the last resort of a regime and its supporters who have no credible challenge to the facts of the film, only to its message. Ultimately, all audiences, regardless of their political proclivities, should be able to see that Moore is anything but anti-American or anti-democratic. The single biggest piece of the film is devoted to following around the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq. She is a patriot and a "true American", by any definition. Her son, and the thousands like him, are honored by Moore. They are portrayed as heroes, but also as victims. They are protectors of American security, but also pawns in a global struggle for power.By finally asking the right questions (4 years too late??), Moore has shown himself to be not just a solid filmmaker, but a patriot and a defender of the most sacred American liberty- free expression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Bias?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's admit it, it's nearly impossible to find someone or something today without a bias towards one thing or another. Fahrenheit 9/11 is clearly not an exception. I saw this film very recently and was stunned. Shocked. Michael Moore's work was thorough, concise, and extraordinary. I was truly impressed. However, there are things that the public needs to consider after seeing this movie. One- this is not the whole story.Unfortunately, I don't know the whole story. Go figure. And two- in order to migrate further from possibly getting tunnel vision, we need to look at and seriously consider the other side. Don't get me wrong, I was enraged by the facts in Fahrenheit 9/11. If all of them are valid, I see no justification for the lies and corruption. But again, this perspective is not the only one and therefor other views should be considered and digested. Am I wrong?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore shines a spotlight on Bush administration distortions with humor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moore's film strips away the pseudo patriotic facade of the Bush administration with humor and tragedy to create a very compelling but flawed message: Bush used false pretenses to go to war while enriching his friends and letting the common people suffer the fallout. The film moves between powerfully tragic scenes( like the sound of planes flying into the Towers as the screen is blacked out to interviewing a dead soldier's mom) to parody( Bush and Cheney dressed like cowboys in a scene with Bonanza music in the background. Moore raises several provocative questions such as why did Bush sit for seven minutes in an elementary classroom without reacting? Moore suggests answers which imply Bush didn't know what to do. Moore raises questions and suggests answers which right wing critics find abhorrent. His film techniques of showing a triumphant, strutting Bush proclaiming major military operations are over and quickly cutting to a roadside bomb in Iraq exploding, showing Bush as either ignorant, stupid, or mendacious were very powerful. Moore's weakness was in trying to give his audience too many messages in a single film but he comes very close to succeeding. His success was apparent to many right wing radio hosts, who immediately declared him both a liar and antiamerican(or America hating).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>skillful, patriotic, truthful, a must to watch even if you don't agree with it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone is entitled to their opinions. The biggest help you can give to your fellow people is to read, watch and know, that's all. can you do that? watch and decide for yourself, you're human, you have a brain, why let me and the opposing critics tell you what to do? You will listen to Americans' testimonies, the soldiers, the everyday people of US and Iraq. You will see Americans' rights destroyed. You will hear it from their lips. The movie is not an attack on a country or its people, only on the person who is benefiting from their loss. It just states facts that you or me as North Americans wouldn't easily find unless we went looking for it, which is what we should do, but most don't have the time. I've watched countless crappy movies and I'm sure you have too. So spending 2 hours and a few dollars to watch something that might change the way you think of today's so called democracy, is a must. You might not agree, but chances are...you will after watching it. If it wasn't telling the truth it wouldn't have the bush supporters after to destroy it. And if you notice most people either really like it or really hate it. and those who really hate it are the ones that don't really love their country. Because this movie is quite sympathetic to the soldiers but not to the one who sent them there for his reasons and not the people's.it's just 2 hours. watch it. other recommended features: The corporation, Manufacturing consent, Bowling for columbine. all get 10/10 for truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 is quite possibly the best work of Michael Moore's career. Moore still has the talent to get people talking while even working in a bit of comedy into the film.The plot revolves around the Bush Administration and what has gone on from the years 2000-2004. It explores many interesting aspects of what has gone on while George W. has been in office. The film raises questions and controversy of course but has the facts to back up their claims. What you see will shock and amaze you. You may also cry when faced with the harsh realities the film reveals.Whether you love it or hate it, Fahrenheit 9/11 will undoubtedly get people talking which was Michael Moore's aim. My personal opinion is it was very well put together and Moore should be admired for his courage to question the way things are being done. Form your own opinion once you have seen it but the movie will impact you no matter your political affiliation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If anyone allows this LIBERAL PROPAGANDA change their opinions on current issues then they will only be giving in to what this movie is supposed to be about.What it really is is extremely biased, meaning that it leaves out anything positive about President Bush and focuses on only the negative plus it creates a negative spin on all of his public comments.It is my opinion that the creator of this film would rather us do absolutely nothing after a terrorist attack. You have to wonder if Bill Clinton would have taken care of this unfinished business during his Presidency after the Embassy bombings and Saddams 98' policy on inspectors; would he still have made this movie?I'd just like to add that its a sad day in America when someone decides to make a profit on anothers tragedy and also helps the enemy. Before anyone lets this film influence them, they should remember the Spain train bombings and how quickly Spain made a decision to leave Iraq. If we show that we will retreat after a cowardly terrorist attack, then we will show the enemy that his strategy is working and that first attack will be followed by many MOORE!One last comment: he might focus on prison conditions in enemy detainee camps, but he should also compare the pictures with those from the enemy when they show us how they treat American prisoners!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Overlong Polemical Diatribe Complete With Massive Self Contradictions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE was subjective and somewhat inaccurate there can be no adjectives used to describe FARENHEIT 9/11 . It is polemical documentary making of the worse sort that will change no ones mind on anything in which case it deserves to be ignored , but since there seems to be a cult that think Michael Moore is the greatest thing that's happened to humanity for two thousand years a few points .Moore asks if the 9/11 hijackers were Saudis why didn't America invade Suai Arabia instead of Afghanistan ? The same reason Britain didn't invade the Republic of Ireland in the 1970s to defeat the IRA because as the Irish Republic didn't train , arm , or fund the provisional IRA neither does the government of Saudi Arabia train , arm or fund Al Qaeda . In fact Al-Qaeda has vowed to over throw the Saudi government ( Same as during the 1970s the IRA vowed to over throw the Republic's government ) and replace it with an Islamic theocracy . For someone who's supposedly educated Moore should have known this and she should also know that Taliban controlled Afghanistan was indeed being used as a massive terrorist training camp for Islamic terrorists from all over the world , same as he should know that the Taliban and Mujahedeen are two different things and that the " Northern Alliance " who fought the Taliban since 1996 were effectively the Mujahedeen . Moore doesn't state that both the Taliban and Mujahedeen are the same entity but by using choice words like " Afghans " and " Islamic fundamentalists fighting the Russians " that's what he is trying to imply to his unquestioning fan baseTalking of Afghanistan leads us to the main problem with FARENHEIT 9/11 - The internal self contradiction . In 2001 Moore publicly criticised the invasion of Afghanistan saying there was no evidence that Bin Laden was involved and as the documentary states earlier the hi-jackers were Suadis not Afghans . In short Moore is against the invasion of Afghanistan but then spends time telling his audience that because Bush didn't into Afghanistan quick enough and without enough men this allowed Bin Laden to escape . What is Moore trying to say ? That if he was in charge he's had invaded Afghanistan quicker and with more men ? What are you saying Mickey ? There's another similar point with similar illogical points that come across as self contradictions: Moore laments that the anti terrorist laws are repressive then points out a few seconds later that there's not enough state funding to police the border areas of Oregon . Moore's against the anti-terror legislation but he wants more border security to police the anti- terror laws ? Is that what he's saying ? He also makes it quite clear in the same segment that Fresno peace groups don't look like terrorists . Indeed they don't and no one has ever came up with any criteria as to what an average terrorist looks like . Go to the Gaza strip or West Bank and you'll see that the average terrorist looks like the average man , woman ( Or in some extreme cases ) child except that they're skin is a slightly different shade from that of the average Fresno peace group member . Is Moore being latently racist I wonder ? In keeping with the same irony/self contradiction the best worst bits from the documentary take place in Iraq , a country we're led to believe that was under Saddam a beautiful utopia where children played on the streets , men and woman sat outside street corner cafes with well prepared inexpensive lunches and everyone smiled only to have everything ruined by a war of aggression by America . We're then shown dead Iraqi babies and American wounded screaming in pain . Shocking scenes but one without any context . We're not shown say , the thousands of Kurds who were murdered by Iraqis during the 1980s , or the Kuwaits who were murdered by Saddams forces in 1990 or the hundreds of thousands of Iranians who were killed by Saddams forces during the Gulf war of the 1980s . War is always a sickening business featuring the very worst of human nature - I mean if Michael Moore had a film camera and gone to the Serb held areas of Bosnia in 1995 after NATO air-strikes he could have filmed similar scenes amongst civilian casualties , same as he might have if he showed the aftermath of NATO air-strikes against Serbia in 1999 . I wonder why he didn't ? Was it because the Democrats were in the White House at the time ? You might like to remember that Moore backed Wesley Clark as the Democratic nomination in the race for the White House , the same Wesley Clark who was in charge of the NATO air-strikes in the Balkans that killed civilians I could say much more on this polemical piece of nonsense like Moore's ridiculous oil pipeline theory but I won't bother since like this fantasy drama from Moore no one will have their minds changed . I will say one thing though , as unlikely as it may seem by reading this review I was against the invasion of Iraq even though I could understand the reasons behind it and Dubya would have stood or fallen via the 2004 American presidential vote on this decision . Moore had nothing to lose by making this documentary and because of his unquestioning fan base everything to gain . If Dubya hadn't invaded Iraq we wouldn't have got FARENHEIT 9/11 so enjoy the money and awards this movie brings you Mickey because people died for it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>validated historical document</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It it truly amazing that after 6 years of evidence of Bush Cheney duplicity and shenanigans piling up - from the media, in Congress, even in the Pentagon and the CIA - that right-wing loonies still waste their time attacking this film, the majority of its charges proved true and the majority of Americans now convinced that they are true. Thus revealing their true color - yellow: they are such whining crybabies! Like Georgie boy, all they really wanted was some excuse to kill innocent women and children of a different skin color. SICK! Fortunately their day is done - George Bush enters history as the most corrupt, weakest, dumbest and most hated president in the history of America. And his sycophants are quickly exposing themselves as unAmerican, unpatriotic, treasonous blow-hards that care little for the good of the nation, eagerly seeking opportunities to rob Americans of their precious tax-dollars for their friends at Halliburton (which is now no longer an American corporation but operates out of Dubai - just as Cheney, after a brief visit to Wyoming, will soon be retiring to to his vacation home in Saudi Arabia). Yes, a lovely bunch of traitors, all! Farewell as they enter the dustbin of history! This now thoroughly validated film by Michael Moore stands as an indictment, not only of the Bush regime's barbaric lust for colonial conquest, but of the culpability of the mainstream media that failed to report the truth of Bushcheney shenanigans until America was too deeply entrenched to withdraw, and its economy bankrupted by this preposterous war. I don't know if its a great film, but it's an absolutely necessary historical document. Hopefully, we will soon be dragging Bush to court for war crimes and treason - to see some of the reason why - and to remember NEVER AGAIN to allow America to swing right for the sheer enjoyment of bloodshed - watch this film - it's unforgettable. AND IT'S ALL TRUE!</fullReview>

I supported his original premise of what I understood to be a "fair and balanced" overview of 9/11 but instead found it to be very short on integrity and nothing more than a person taking my money to vent their own political agenda. If anything it makes me scrutinize the values of our left and its integrity and if my social ideals are twisted as much as Mr. Moores then it makes me question where I am and what I want to be associated with.

		<fullReview>Well, Michael Moore wanted this film to affect the outcome of last Presidential election. I don't think that he had thought that some of his outlandish claims would actually turn people out FOR President Bush!Commenting on this film is like commenting on that other polarizing film event of 2004, THE PASSION OF THE Christ. Let's get this straight ... FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is NOT a documentary. There is not one fact in this film that is not twisted to fit in to some slender political ideology. But, that does not mean that Michael Moore does not make some valid points with his work. Believe it or not, I am a big fan of what Mr. Moore does. Mr. Moore asks people questions, and sometimes he tries to hold them accountable. I like that. I encourage that. I support that. I just disagree with some of his methods (the ends do not always justify the means), and with some of his conclusions.So my suggestion would be this ... see the film. Then, if you don't like Michael Moore, go out with a camera and start asking your own questions. I dare say Michael himself would applaud you, no matter what your political leaning!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Unites The Masses Like a Common Hatred</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very easy to point and criticize. It is far easier to do when there is no-one around to counter your criticism. Fahrenheit 911 is a finger pointing exercise that I simply did not enjoy. It is not bad ? just the opposite. It is skilfully made, funny and very well organized. I strongly encourage everyone to see it and judge for themselves. But it is culpable and hypocritical, and its approach to its own content so questionable, that it must be dismissed as nothing more than entertainment.I did not hate the film. I laughed on a number of occasions. Moore's ability to match a song with a newsreel clip to underline his point (the best being the use of `The Greatest American Hero' theme), his sarcastic, easy to listen to narration is excellent. It is not a quality film . It is primarily archived newsreel footage strung together with voiceover work and vintage Moore interviews. It is very well assembled, but as a documentary, it fails. Mr. Moore grandstanded at the Oscars two years back that he is a film maker that lives in the world of non-fiction. I heartily disagree.The factual content is laughable. Most notably, Moore asks someone what the total wealth held by Saudis in the USA is. The man answers `I have heard it is as high as $840 billion dollars'. That is hardly a statement of fact backed up by anything. Good enough for Moore though. Next scene, he is speaking of the `trillion dollars' held by Saudis in the US (what's $140Billion between friends), then proceeds to say that they own 7% of the United States. One piece of conjecture stretched to the extreme.The movie is racist. Yes, racist. As he decries Bush's ties with the Saudis, he flashes a seemingly endless parade of photos of American shaking hands with Arabs, as if anyone and everyone who has ever met one is of questionable character. And the shots he cuts to when he mentioning the countries in the `Coalition of the Willing' are offensive, showing Vikings when he mentions Iceland and other stereotypical photos of countries like Cost Rico and Morocco, and someone smoking hash when he mentions the Netherlands.The movie is manipulative beyond any measure I have seen. Two examples here. Moore is willing to completely demonize Saudi Arabia, talking of their human rights violations and even showing a public beheading performed by their government. Pre-war Iraq is shown as some kind of Utopia, with people gleefully shopping in markets, children playing and most nauseatingly, a young boy flying a kite up the bank of a river. Even worse than that however is Lila Lipscombe. She is from Moore's hometown of Flint Michigan and is interviewed extensively in the middle part of the movie, telling Moore how proud she is that her children enlisted in the army, how it is a duty and a privilege, on and on and on. Later on, we find out her son was tragically killed in a Black Hawk accident, and Lila now curses Bush, the government, the Whitehouse and the war. The hypocrisy and manipulation of those scenes made me squirm out of my seat. I am a parent and my heart breaks for this woman losing her son. But they way it is presented, simply for effect, is offensive. It also smacks horribly of Moore's famous editing of the facts for effect.Many times in this film, people mention that the terror threat just does not exist. That Saddam was not a threat. That Iraq had never killed an American (Gulf War?). That no weapons exist in Iraq. What world are these people living in? Why is never mentioned that Iraq was run a brutal and murderous regime and routinely killed its own people, that used WMDs against its own people, that killed anyone who opposed the government, that Saddam was a multi-billionaire in an impoverished country? Moore could have balanced his approach like this, and still not lost it. I believe he could have strengthened his film by showing Iraq for what it was, and not creating a fictional account of life there.The greatest point Moore makes is in the interview with a retired FBI agent, who questions the removal of 250 or so Arab citizens from the US post 9/11, by air, when all air traffic in the US had been grounded. They should have been questioned by FBI, especially those who are related to Bin Laden directly. Also, Moore does an excellent job of outlining the Bush insiders and their ties to the oil industry.There may be a great film to be made about the Bush administration. This is not it.The worst thing about this movie for me, though was the pall of hypocrisy that hung over it. As Moore decries the war profiteers, he becomes one. As he accuses the US government of exploiting the poor and marginalized of the US for profit, he does the same. As Fahrenheit 911 approaches $100,000,000 in domestic receipts, I sat in the theatre thinking that Moore himself is as big a war profiteer as any of his targets. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank God for Michael Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin let me say that I am a big Michael Moore fan, ever since the days of The Awful Truth. But not in any nutso, radical activist kind of way. I love my country. I couldn't imagine living anywhere else. But I, like Michael and many others, can't just bow our heads and be good little robots of society. We seek change. Not in a bad, violent revolutionary way, but done democratically through the people. Through all the criticism and backlash this film has recieved, one simple idea was grossly overlooked. What Moore put in his film is exactly the kind of stuff we SHOULD HAVE SEEN on the evening news. All the haters out there are accusing his film of being overly one-sided, well guess what folks, in case you didn't notice those precious television news reports we sit through every night while we munch away at our dinners is INSANELY one-sided and biased in every way, shape and form.With that said, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is the most important film in the history of cinema. There has never been a film, documentary or not, that has directly attacked our active President. Michael Moore is not some cook radical spewing unsubstantiated accusations through a Hitler-esque propaganda film (as its been called). If Moore's agenda had simply been to "dethrone Bush at all costs", then he could have left out a good fifty percent of the film and focused primarily on the man everyone is convinced he loves to hate. He is very simply offering us a "second opinion" if you will, on all the news media that has bombarded us since September 11th. He is simply exercising his freedom of speech to the tenth degree and THAT is what I love about this country. If this film was made in any other country about their leader, they would be jailed, beaten, and maybe even killed.And he has tapped into a very important thing about our society. That MOVIES have power. And guess what, lower and middle-class people go to the movies the most. People who don't normally vote go to the movies. People who have no idea who Michael Moore is will go see this movie. And the YOUTH will go see this movie, and they'll bring lots and lots of friends. You remember the youth of our country right? The apathetic, non-political group of 18 to 20 year-olds that were always ignored by politicians? Not that this film has turned them all into a bunch of Bush-haters, but it HAS gotten them involved. What no person or institution has been able to do for the longest time has been accomplished by one little documentary.As I sat there in the movie theater, with the end credits coming on screen and the house lights shining brightly down. I saw something that I have never seen in my life. I looked around the packed theater (on a Monday night) and witnessed all different kinds of people, old and young, Black and White, applauding and cheering out of their seats. The hair stood up on the back of my head and a tear came to my eye. I was totally blown away by what I was seeing. As I made my way for the exit, I softly whispered to myself, "Now that is what I call CINEMA".Please, you owe it to yourself to see this movie with an open-mind and a thirst for not the truth, but a "second opinion". It is guaranteed to make you laugh and cry, it will shock and anger you, and you will DEFINITELY never forget it.Fahrenheit 451 was a book about a society that burned books in order to censor them from the people. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a film about a society that refuses to show certain newsworthy material in order to censor it from the people and instead substitutes its own, self-promoting news in order to manipulate the people. You be the judge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cautionary Note (Joseph Pintar)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The deliberate refusal to show a movie, such as what Mr. Pintar is accusing theaters nationwide of doing, is simply not happening. It is unfortunate that a space alloted for genuine comments about the quality of a film is instead being used for berating thousands of theater owners for being non-patriotic (and on the main page of the film, yet!). In fact, the movie is NOT in nationwide release yet. As is often the case with documentaries (and, as was the case with Moore's last film, the excellent "Bowling for Columbine") "Fahrenheit" is currently in limited release while it builds up a sufficient buzz. We have been trying to procure a print for our theater, but there are currently none to be had. Please keep comments such as these on the message boards, where they belong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A MUST SEE movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 is a very powerful and emotionally moving film. My partner and I went with four friends on opening weekend, ages 19 to 56, and we all had tearful moments in between the many laughs and guffaws. One of our friends, who has never voted in the 6 years since he turned 18, has now been moved to become more involved in the political process. This film is not just about "Bush is Bad" but really looks at how the tendrils of big business can, and do, shape the direction our government takes, and where the current administration has gone off track. Be prepared for a few grisly war scenes, but remember, it's nothing compared to what our men and women there have to deal with. Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, you should give this film the opportunity to move you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, important, and moving film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 at Phipps Mall in the affluent Buckhead neighborhood of Atlanta, GA, and I will say for the record:1. Fahrenheit 9/11 attracted the most racially integrated audience I've ever seen at an Atlanta movie theater, as well as the most age-diverse audience.2. The audience was completely in tune with what Michael Moore was trying to do. When he wanted you to be mad, people were mad. When he wanted you to be upset, people were upset, and when he wanted you laugh, people laughed. And boy, did they laugh.3. The audience cheered (loudly) upon the film's conclusion.Truly a satisfying moment, to feel part of a community of people, if only for two hours, who recognized that the emperor indeed has no clothes. Is Michael Moore manipulative? Of course- he's an editorial documentarian. Does he sometimes assume too much from too little information? Of course- he's a human being. That's what human beings do. Now, you may say, yes, it may be human nature to infer too much from too little information, but as a responsible artist, Michael Moore should get his ducks firmly in a row before trying to manipulate his audience. That being said, we have libel in slander laws in this country. If Michael Moore is so far off base, where are the lawsuits and defamation of character charges? Why won't Bush or his camp respond to any of the specific allegations of Fahrenheit 9/11? Why is that, in fact, they state an unwillingness even to see the film, and yet feel qualified to have a valid opinion of it? Now who's inferring too much from too little?What is absolutely undeniable is that a) war is horrible, b) the United States of America went to war with Iraq for spurious reasons, c) we have been conspicuously unsuccessful in capturing Osama bin Laden, in part because bin Laden has no relationship whatsoever with Iraq, d) there have been many people who have benefited financially from the war, and those people have a long and in many cases sordid relationship with the Bush family, and e) Bush has used the 9/11 attacks as a way to advance an agenda that is completely unrelated to the attacks themselves, and to infringe on our civil rights. Any attempt to dissect Michael Moore's arguments fall flat when these basic facts are irrefutable.Fahrenheit 9/11 is ultimately a highly entertaining and justifiably scathing review of the Presidency of George W. Bush, embarrassment to himself, our great nation, and, for that matter, to the entire human race. Please help vote this buffoon out of office before he can discredit our country further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, Emotional, NOT a Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even when you pull out tiny truths in the overpublicized gossip that streams through Michael Moore's film, you never get a sense that his complete view on the subject of the War on Terrorism is anything other than anger and resentment. With most of the film's positive criticism actually coming from Moore himself, it disturbs me to think that this flick could become anything more than some left-wing sliver's conspiracy take on the topic. Documentaries tend usually to get a firm grip on what has actually happened, based on facts and found footage on more than one aspect of a situation; in other words an actual 'document' into the events. Moore's offering only supplies the viewer with edited footage and tidbits of comparison videos to get his and only his idea across. Seeing this movie only reminded me of the same sad and pathetic attempts made in "Bowling for Columbine" to blame all of the world's problems on Conservative politics. It also reminds me of propaganda; which, oddly enough, is shunned by Moore and other "Fahrenheit" zealouts whenever it seems to appear as the voice of any average corporation. By all means, if you think the flick is good, call it a good flick. But if it endorses an idea so obviously tainted by the filmmaker, it is NOT a Documentary and shouldn't be honored as such.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not interested in persuading anyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Fahrenheit 9-11' added fuel to the fire of Michael Moore's increasingly toasty reputation as a documentarian, and it's not difficult to see why. The film, while featuring several scenes that are extremely moving, feels hastily put together (a problem also suffered by 'Bowling for Columbine') and occasionally tone-deaf (e.g., the long, long sequence where Moore traces the connections between the Bush family and the Saudis--based in fact, but not inspiring the kind of shocked indignation he clearly expects it to). But worst of all, it's not interested in persuading anyone of anything--if you're not already a card-carrying lefty (which I *am*, for the record) you might as well not apply. Moore's defenders like to point out the fallacy of a truly objective documentarian--any filmmaker, they say, by choosing what to show and what not to show, is projecting his own perspective and judgment into the mix. This is certainly true, but just as in narrative film, there's a difference between telling the viewer what to think and allowing him to figure it out for himself. 'Roger and Me' achieves the latter; 'Fahrenheit 9-11,' with Moore's mocking speculations dubbed over Bush's face, does not. It's a shame, really, because the movie's purer moments are very effective indeed--there isn't a better way to express the horrors of war than to look at the parents of casualties. And yet Moore's smug partisanship, apparent from the very beginning, prevents anyone not predisposed to agree with him from getting close enough to his information to judge for themselves. It's a shame, really--but then again, why should they want to? Moore gives them no incentive to convert. 5.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It didn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler! Spoiler! But it's all in the open now.....Another title for this review might have been "You can't have your cake and eat it too." Michael Moore's bold and brazen movie was one of the highest grossing movies of 2004 and the first campaign commercial movie. The entire goal of it was to unseat President Bush, but it didn't happen. But before I go further let me state something:YES, I HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE.A lot of people demand you can't criticize without watching it, which means paying money to Mr. Moore, but fortunately I caught a free showing at the local university. F9/11 is boring, ponderous, all over the map, and so blinded by it's hatred for Bush that all objectivity is tossed aside. It's own contradictions are so deep it's almost a collage of emotions rather than a monumental case against the government. Consider the following:In this movie Bush is an idiot who spent half his time on vacation, yet also the leader of a sinister conspiracy that printed the Patriot Act in the middle of the night and holds us all in thrall. He can't be both.We are told about the terrorist acts in the world before 9/11 and then told there is no threat and Bush/the Bin Ladens/oil companies/corporate America are pulling all this to make money.We're told the war in Afghanistan was to put in place an oil pipeline, then told we were too slow in getting troops to where Osama Bin Laden was.....in Afghanistan. The military is portrayed as gung-ho killers and then as victims of a class discrimination that preys on young minorities to go fight. My boss went out two months ago with his National Guard unit. He's 54 and white. Saudi Arabia's record on human rights is mentioned, and then the now infamous scenes of Iraq before the war. Nothing about Iraq's own record on human rights, sheltering and supporting terrorists, the Iran-Iraq War, the First Gulf War, the mass graves or Kurdish rebellion, none of it. Moore can claim all he wanted that he meant to show this or that, but the effect, what people see in the theatre, is that Iraq was a peaceful and happy place we bombed for no reason.The "I wonder what they were thinking" bits that places words in people's mouths in this supposed fact filled documentary. According to Moore's mind reading Bush pondered who "screwed" him when the planes hit the towers and later told Prince Bandar by the light of the burning Pentagon that he had a fix in place. That's as close as this movie comes to explaining why 9/11 happened at all.Moore's sarcastic view of the coalition of the willing that doesn't list all the countries, just the smallest and most insignificant ones.And on and on and on..... If Moore had wanted to attack Bush with something substantial he could have made a factual and realistic documentary, there's enough things he could have gone on about, but it would also have been boring and not have made as much money. I at one time worried about how this movie would affect the elections, but then after I saw it I was relieved, the Wizard of Oz was just an old man behind a curtain pulling levers. The conclusions are so far fetched; that there is no terrorist threat, we are all under the dupe of a phony war that continues just to make money, that everything that has happened since 9/11 has been to keep us pacified in an Orwellian conspiracy, only a damn idiot would believe all that. Sadly there a lot of them, and I kept thinking as the credits rolled--Is this what these people really believe?But Moore's movie I think had a strong backlash, and caused more people to vote for Bush than were turned away. I know it motivated me to get out and vote. I wonder what Moore has to say now that his DVD sales are soaring more as souvenirs of the election than people flocking to see the "truth."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore should be lauded for one thing only, his masterful editing job. He is very willing to show his approach to congressman about listing their children in the war against terror, but only their split second facial reactions. These people of course react in shock at the initial question, he doesn't show the responses that don't fit in well with his message, such as the congressman who told him that his nephew would be going the next week to Afghanistan. Did any of us see that in Farenhiet 9/11, i think not. Open your eyes America. Michael Moore is just a self hating American looking out for his own portly self. He managed to twist the facts in Bowling for Columbine, with his wonderful editing job and he does the same thing in his latest movie. He portrays himself as the average lower class American yet just fighting the big corporate bully. Yet anyone who would get up in a tux at the cannes film festival to accept the palm de ore award is clearly not that man. Michael Moore you are a self loathing hypocrite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie to be intelectually challenged by "other" side instead I came away feeling like I had been watching a SNL episode on the subjects Mr. Moore covered, but SNL would have been much better at it. The snippets of news coverage used in the film, which I am sure were meant to inform and shock Americans, would have been great if used on the 6 o'clock CBS, ABC or NBC news, instead they were shown to only a segment of the American public through this movie. The liberal media at those networks would have been more than happy to show them as they made Pres. Bush look quite bad, why did they not? I expected a much more intellectual and smarter movie out of Mr. Moore, instead it was just a badly made docudrama/movie. I also think it is a shame that it won the Best at the Cannes Film Festival, as a film festival is about the art of film making and should not be grounds for individual political statements. There were many movies in 2003 that deserved to win that title, and if Mr. Tarantino was not on the jury, I am sure F911 would not have had a chance.</fullReview>

Isn't it grand?Because if it is, it must be the only thing this documentary is worth a praise for. Make no mistake--Moore's documentary is zero, artistically. I was once at an exhibition of Cuban political posters. This was a real example how art can get along with propaganda. Moore's film is unfocused, incoherent, and overblown. Unfocused, because nothing connects parts of the film but the desire to make a giant mudslinger for Bush. Incoherent, because it constantly switches from being preachy to rather dated, SNL-type humour. Overblow, because ... if you're going to see that film, do you honestly believe it's going to be an eye-opener for you? You never heard of the events the film talks about, right?A bit of advice: if you want to make the poor, war veterans, Oregon state troopers, or the Democratic Party better off, maybe you simply donate this $10 appropriately.</fullReview>

The reason behind this is Moore's way of presenting his arguments. He'll begin by giving some facts that will draw the audience in (and make then believe that they are being force fed truths), and then he'll make suggestions or conclusions about other details based on his personal opinion. If you're not watching carefully, it's possible to be tricked into believing that something that is not a fact, is.This being said, it is definitely something everyone should see.

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the mind-numbing subjectivity, the first half of this pseudo-documentary is interesting, and if Michael Moore had just stuck to his conspiracy theory with the September 11 terrorist attacks, he would have made reasonably good film. But the second part of the film, in which he attacks the war on Iraq, manages to present nothing that a well-versed viewer has not seen before. It is just the same old anti-war messages and sentiments. It shows the horror and suffering caused by war but hardly anything about the war on Iraq in particular. Films such as 'All Quiet on the Western Front' were made over 70 years ago with same anti-war messages. In many ways, Moore's pseudo documentary is best compared to the propaganda used in the Russian and the German autocracies of the 1930s. It tries to engage the viewer, it tries to make its subject matter interesting, but all that it is, is totally manipulative. In any war life will be lost, people will be unhappy and many will protest, so how then does any of this differ from what a C-grade history student at school already knows? A lot of what Moore says is not credible anyway, and since the release of the film over 50 deceptions have been pointed out, where Moore has doctored footage and used his information out of context. For the first half of its duration, the film is amusing and interesting, even if not credible, but the second half of the film is a routine bore ? and that is certainly not what a viewer wants to be left remembering at the end of a film. Moore has admitted himself that the purpose of the film was to stop George W. Bush being re-elected, but it will fail to provoke such a view in a person who is not ignorant and who is not moved by age-old sentiments. As amusing as the film may well be at times, it is an overall failure ? an utter failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some valid points but shoots itself in the foot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film with some reservations, since although I enjoyed Bowling for Columbine I found it far too biased to be taken seriously. Sadly, although some valid points were made in Fahrenheit 9/11, the same thing is true here and in spades.[I'm not sure if it's possible to write spoilers about a documentary, but I'll mention some of the things shown in the film.]Moore begins by making a case that the Bush family has strong links with many wealthy Arabs and as a result George W either covered up or hindered investigations into the 9/11 attacks to protect his links with his Arab friends. If true, it's obviously scandalous, although it wouldn't really surprise me.My main problem with the film is that many of the topics covered are chosen in such a way to try to sway the audience to his way of thinking although they really aren't directly relevant to the point he is trying to make. For example, to argue against the Iraq war, Moore begins by showing pictures of happy children playing in Baghdad before the attacks, and then pictures of grieving parents and dead children's bodies after the attacks. He also has an extended sequence with a grieving American mother whose son was killed in action in Iraq. Besides being biased (no scenes of Saddam gassing the Kurds are shown, for example), scenes such as this are largely irrelevant to a consideration of whether the war was justified. Any mother who loses a son is going to grieve and feel resentment at whatever took her son's life, whether it was a war or a car accident, but it contributes nothing to a reasoned critique of the war in Iraq.In an attempt to show that the US had very little backing in going to war, Moore lists a number of "silly" countries, such as Romania and Morocco, that supported the US with the implication that it was only insignificant countries that supported the Americans. No mention is made anywhere in the film of Britain's involvement in the war, apart from one picture of Tony Blair in a simulated cowboy hat.Don't get me wrong - I have no respect or love for Bush and don't believe the war in Iraq was justified either. I just don't see how films such as this can do much to further the cause. We need a proper documentary that considers all sides of all the arguments and comes to a reasoned conclusion.</fullReview>

He takes TV news segments from the past few years and slants them in his favor via canny editing techniques. His assessment of the George W. Bush administration, and Bush's apparent bungling of affairs in post-9/11 America, wanders into the murkiest of political waters, with only Moore's dryly sarcastic voice-over to punch up what we're seeing. It isn't very entertaining, but should it be? I felt the narrative wandering after the first hour, with too many targets on the agenda and FAR TOO MUCH television news footage to slog through. The political players all end up looking like irresponsible buffoons, which would be amusing if it weren't so terrifying. Moore wants to tread humorously through some of these passages, and his appeals to our collective sense of humor are welcomed, however the overall feel of "Fahrenheit 9/11" is one of pasted-together jabs: some forceful, some sardonic, and some simply meager. ** from ****</fullReview>

Using this creative technique one can make a movie about everything from abortions between male teenagers to Australians winning the Australian Open. All you need for that is a camera man and no conscience.I was grown up in the Soviet Union and the movie painfully resembles the documentary from my childhood scourging the capitalistic system. The only difference is that Mike somehow managed to take advantage of the system he apparently hates so much. Thus, I really do not understand what the fuss is about in some comments and why this movie is "a must see." If those who wrote that think that the movie is a great piece of art, they are probably mistaken. If they think that Moore made a good point, they are mistaken as well as nobody can make a strong statement fabricating the facts.I am neither a Democrat nor a Republican but I feel that the party playing all those dirty propaganda tricks deserves not to be elected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Michael Moore's controversial documentary "Fahrenheit 9/11" was released in the summer of 2004, it hit a readiness reaction with a large segment of the American public, people who found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with the direction the country was taking under the Bush administration and who believed that, in this film, someone for the first time was finally giving voice, in a mass media outlet, to their deepest held fears and concerns. Let's face it; no fiction writer could have concocted a more bizarre and surrealistic series of events than what actually occurred in the United States in the first few years of this millennium: a contested Presidential election followed by a terrorist attack of unprecedented proportions followed by a "retaliatory" war aimed at the wrong country and based almost entirely on faulty intelligence. These three incidents converged to create a near "perfect storm" for Moore's documentary. It also didn't hurt, from a commercial point of view, that the film was released in the heat of a bruising Presidential campaign, one in which the stakes never seemed higher for both ends of the political spectrum in the country. The 2004 Presidential election would be a fight to the death, one whose motto was clearly: may the better ideology win.Well, it has been a year since Moore's film hit the streets and almost as long a time since Bush won reelection for a second term as president. The question to be asked now is, with the passions on both sides cooled down to at least some extent (or are they?), how does "Fahrenheit 9/11" play in a post-election world? The answer is pretty damn well actually, mainly because most of the issues Moore raises are still as valid after the election as they were before (mainly because Bush WAS reelected).Moore is, of course, an unapologetic liberal and a self-appointed gadfly for the powers-that-be in our society. As such, he aims his sights directly at the Bush administration and all those who support it. He starts off brilliantly by recalling the horrors of 9/11 in a unique way: showing us a black screen while the sounds of the planes crashing into the buildings are heard on the soundtrack. With memories of that horror still lingering in our heads, Moore then proceeds to expose the Bush family's long standing connections with the Saudi royal family, a fact that few people seemed aware of before this film was released. Moore then goes on to criticize the way in which the Bush administration has exploited the "War on Terror" for maximum political effectiveness, culminating in the Patriot Act which, he argues, has had a draconian impact on the civil rights of ordinary American citizens.But the greatest part of Moore's wrath is saved for the second half of the film, when he confronts what he sees as the wholly unjustifiable war in Iraq. Moore is to be given credit for being one of the first and only people to have shown us actual on-the-ground pictures of the death and carnage that occurred in that country immediately after the initial bombings. Watching these gruesome images, we are immediately struck by just how antiseptic the media's coverage of the war has been here in the United States - a fact that Moore blames not only on the Bush administration but on a press that has allowed itself to become little more than an extension of the rah-rah, war-rallying propaganda machine set up by the government (a government, for instance, that refused to allow any pictures to be taken of flag-draped coffins coming back from the war zone).The section dealing with the Iraq War is the most emotionally devastating section of the film, mainly because Moore is able to bring it home to us personally through the ordinary individuals who have been most directly affected by it - soldiers on the field, amputees in the hospital and, most heartbreakingly, the mother of a boy killed in a helicopter crash in April, 2003. Her unbearable grief, so nakedly exposed on camera for all to see, becomes an emblem for a war that not only need not have happened, but has, as Moore points out in various ways, been largely bought and paid for with the blood of brave men and women from the lower, underprivileged tier of society. He ends his film by confronting a number of congressmen who voted for the war but who seem reluctant to send their own children over to do the actual fighting. Actually, there is so much going on in this film that it becomes virtually impossible to convey even half of it in a short review such as this one.As with his previous films, Moore once again proves himself the master of facile irony, pointing out, in darkly humorous fashion, the absurd inconsistencies and blatant hypocrisies that abound in the world around us. These moments are what keep Moore's films from becoming dry-as-dust jeremiads against what he sees as a corrupt system. He makes us laugh even when we know we should be crying, but this is the way a polemicist reaches his audience. And no one understands that better than Michael Moore.Is the film "fair," "balanced," "nonpartisan" in its approach? Absolutely not. Does it need to be? Well, I can certainly see where people of the opposite political persuasion might find themselves wanting to yell back at the screen or lob a few well chosen projectiles where they feel it would do the most good. And that's fine too. After all, it's a free country and the Bush supporters have every right to launch their own rebuttal against this film if they so choose. I would truly love to see it. But until that time both liberals and conservatives will have to be content with kicking the set every time "Fahrenheit 9/11" is appearing on the screen. The funny thing is that they'll be doing so for entirely different reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Works better if you have seen "Bowling For Columbine"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this is my first review, and I don't speak English very well, so...Well, I like most of what Moore has done, and I think that this is not the better of him, and it doesn't deserve to won the Palme D'Or at all. But I still think that this one deserves to be watched. Moore is using here most of what he did explain (greatly) on "Bowling for Columbine". There he explain how assimilated is violence in the nowadays unitedstatian (I will not say American since America is a continent and not a country) society. Fahrenheit 9/11 works a lot with this, and how normal is for the unitedstatians to invade a country in the name of the freedom values, democracy values, and so on, which are actually the economic interests of a small private group that has no ethic and just want to take profits, like it happen on Vietnam, Chile, Afghanistan, Iraq, and many many others. I disagree with Moore in this movie, 'cause he's attributing most of this to the ineptitude of Bush, and this is not like that. A man as intelligent as Moore is, should have realized that the 9/11 attacks were done deliberately, or at least allowed, by Bush Government, in order to be able to invade countries and to steal their resources, just like the us always have done. So, Moore is putting first his political disagreement with Bush's party, instead of truth. I don't like that. If Moore were had been right about this, Obama's government would be a lot better, and it's actually worst than Bush's administration. Despite that, i liked this documentary, and there's a very funny scene of the movie, that pictures a retired old man, and how he is denounced by his partners for not being agree with the government, that, my friends, reflects how us citizens are living in a fascist regime, not barely close to a democratic nation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>satirical yet controversial look at the first term of George W Bush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Proceeding the 9 / 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre, George Bush was internationally observed in his actions.. Michael Moore looked into the controversy behind the causes of the terrorist attack and the corruption within the government as well as their quickly declared war on terror.Moore gathers news footage from major American news stations such as CNN, CBS and FOX - This was news: - That showed the WTC attack - news coverage of the bombing of Bagdad - the inauguration of George Bush (because it was suggested that he rigged the election in 2000) - footage of Bush meeting with the Saudi's before the WTC attack + meetings with the Bin Laden family in his early years - Interviews with those affected by the event of the WTC attack and the continuing attack or war on Iraq - Moore is pushy with his interviewing, seen hustling at the Saudi foreign embassy minister but is ejected by a large amount of 'secret police' for a building outside of US jurisdiction.I think that this film tells me that you cannot always trust what the government and the media tell you about the War on Terror.In making the film Michael Moore shows all the events of the Bush administrations term in office from his controversial inauguration to his lack of worry and concern on the attack on the WTC followed by his sudden so called concerned response the next day by declaring war because his top officials' advise him to do so (Donald Rumsfeld).We then hear about his secret and hushed meeting with the family Bin Laden and the governments lack of investigation and the use of a warrant that would have allowed him to interrogate the family about where Osama Bin Laden was hiding or located or living or whether they knew anything about his plan - The family are then allowed to leave on a restricted but otherwise authorised flight (despite the country wide grounding of all aeroplanes) to the tune of 'We gotta get out of this place' (Animals, 1965).Moore then, using old news footage details the rushed and inefficient ground offensive to find and capture Bin Laden which fails, which then leads to America having to quickly find resolve and pin the scapegoat onto some other country - namely Iraq. They do this by making up a supposed weapons threat, which then leads to America forcing the U.N. to carry out investigations that seemed to go on for a long time. Then suddenly a document reveals from nowhere that indicates that there are weapons of mass destruction. During this time the U.S. government declares the 'Patriot Act' which declares that the authorities have the right to investigate its own people on the grounds of being on suspicion or affecting any behaviour or speech that is anti-Bush or anti-American - we have more interviews with people who have been investigated by the U.S. by the Feds' for opposing lose of freedoms.We are then shown interviews with soldiers sent out to fight the war in Iraq - This is from Iraq, which means the Michael Moore (in dedication to his work) had film crews and investigating journalists out 'there' to get the story from the 'other side'.As the film progresses we the audience are being told or inform that mainstream media such as large TV news stations, have latched onto the side of the Bush administration - this ultimately affects the news delivery by being right wing bush supporters as opposed to an expected non-bias approach throughout the whole war. So, Michael Moore's film is a breath of fresh air that is much needed in the year that the film was shown;(2004) This is a satirical yet controversial look at the first term of George W Bush and his relationship with the media. It's not a positive delivery. We are made to look at mistakes and wrong doings - Moore puts the film together to deliver an almost Anti Bush message. This is the president - isn't he a fool? I thought the film was very cleverly montaged to give across to the audience the message he is trying to put over in order get the audience to despise G.W Bush even more.From watching this film I can clearly see that the film is largely factual in nature as it describes and details present events which are also largely shown by the mainstream media. However, although this film is more factual than fictional in nature it may not be 'entirely accurate', as he sometimes twists the facts and footage in order to convince the audience that everything we are told by the Pro-Bush news corporations about the events surrounding 9/11 and G.W. Bush's War on Terror is not correct. This shows that although the film is more factual than fictional it does contain some anti-Bush bias from Michael Moore, yet on the other hand aren't the American right-wing news corporations equal biased in their opposite direction from Michael Moore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To anyone who truly understands what it means to be an American, Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 should be seen as a triumph of patriotic freedom. Rarely has the First Amendment been exercised with such fervor and forthrightness of purpose: After subjecting himself to charges of factual errors in his gun-lobby expos Bowling for Columbine, Moore armed himself with a platoon of reputable fact-checkers, an abundance of indisputable film and video footage, and his own ironically comedic sense of righteous indignation, with the singular intention of toppling the war-ravaged administration of President George W. Bush. It's the Bush presidency that Moore, with his provocative array of facts and figures, blames for corporate corruption, senseless death, unnecessary war, and political favoritism toward Osama Bin Laden's family and Saudi oil partners following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Moore's incendiary film earned Palme d'Or honors at Cannes and a predictable legion of detractors, but do yourself a favor: Ignore those who condemn the film without seeing it, and let the facts speak for themselves. By honoring American soldiers and the victims of 9/11 while condemning Bush's rationale for war in Iraq, Fahrenheit 9/11 may actually succeed in turning the tides of history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Sicko by Michael Moore, i got a DVD of Fahrenheit 9/11 because i became interested in Moore's work. Of course, i've heard of the award winning documentary before but I've never really watched it in full. I guess it is quite ironic that while i am watching the film now, some of Moore's statements on Bush and the US gov't in the documentary 4 years ago are still very much timely. In a way, the experience for me was like having a good retrospective view of my country, seeing how what happened then affected greatly US today. Moore's storytelling i found interesting and engaging but some parts is a little bit dragging in my opinion. Nevertheless it's still a great film for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a effective movie because it sparks discussion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you agree with Michael Moore or not, he's certainly created conversations. Everywhere I go, I hear people talking about Farenheit 9/11, and it's undeniably a good thing that people are discussing these issues. There are elements of Moore's film that I agree with and there are other sections that go a little overboard.At his best, Moore is a brilliant activist. The scene where he reads the Patriot Act to members of Congress from an ice cream truck is hilarious and raises an excellent point about the ignorance of our elected officials. Moore has always had a knack for using humor to get serious points across, and Farenheit is no exception. There the clip of the Bush team as the cast of bonanza, an info-graphic about our coalition of the willing, and those priceless Bush video clips ("I call upon all nations...now watch me hit this drive."). In another clip, Moore uses a single guitar riff from Eric Clapton's song Cocaine behind a graphic of Bush's censored National Guard record. About half the people in the theater I was in caught the reference.At his worst, Moore is a liberal equivalent to Rush Limbuagh, egotistical and obnoxious. Many of his ideas are far-fetched and poorly supported, like the section on the Afghani natural gas pipeline. Fuel is certainly not the only reason that America has gone to war twice in the last three years, though it is more of a factor than the right would have us believe. It's hard to imagine Bush and his cronies caring about Iraq if it wasn't situated above an ocean of black gold. However, I would reject that the failed natural gas pipeline in Afghanistan had anything to do with the decision to go to war. Another poorly executed point is Moore's attempt to discredit Bush's initial reaction to the second plane hitting the trade center. Bush can hardly be blamed for having a blank expression on his face for 7 minutes. I was a little confused that morning, too.Another point that Moore could've explored further is the Saudi connection. Saudi Arabia seems to be the home to most of these Al Qaida operatives, yet we give their government a free pass. What happened to going after "countries that harbor terrorists?" The official US stance on Saudi Arabia is that they are a friendly government that simply cannot control the terrorists within their own borders. Since when is this an excuse? We refuse to recognize Palestine for that exact reason! I was shocked to see that the Saudi embassy is protected by Bush's secret service.American ignorance and blind support of Israel in the Israel-Palestine conflict is largely at the root of Muslim anger toward us, yet Bush has NEVER mentioned this as a motive. The current Israeli government is as frighteningly right wing and war-mongering as our own, but the American right will blindly support Israel no matter how many innocent people they slaughter because the religious right has a psychotic Christian Zionist end-of-the-world fantasy. This is perhaps too complex (and too controversial) a topic for Moore to tackle, but it is definitely an important link that MUST be discussed. Our military bases in Saudi Arabia were also a motive for the hijackers, but Bush has never mentioned those either. Instead, he claims that we were attacked on 9/11 only because the terrorists "hate freedom." Think rationally for a minute. When has any human ever killed another human for "hating freedom?" It just doesn't make sense. Al Qaida is fighting a Jihad against us. Nowhere in the Quran does it direct Jihadists to "attack free people."Another point that Moore never makes is the inherent absurdity of the phrase "War on Terror." We are about as likely to defeat terror as we are to defeat "fear" or "jealousy." The correct move would have been to specifically declare war against Al Qaida back in September of 2001. We were attacked by Al Qaida. They are the enemy, and it's too bad that BOTH presidential candidates insist on fighting a broader, unwinnable battle against "terror." I don't believe that anyone in Washington even knows the correct definition of "terrorist" anymore. The insurgents in Iraq, for instance, are not terrorists; they are guerrillas. Big difference. Unfortunately, Bush insists on painting his war with broad strokes, because that way he can fit just about anyone under the banner of "terrorist." They might as well just call it the "War on Bad Guys."Go see Farenheit 9/11. Laugh. Cry. Get p***ed. Argue about it afterwords. It's healthy for Americans to be engaging in political discussion.I give Moore a 10/10 just for having the guts to make this movie. Despite what other viewers are writing, he definitely doesn't hate America; his hate is reserved for the Bush administration, and criticizing the president is quite different from hating America. Despite what right-wingers say about Moore, he is passionate about bringing change to his country. It is both ignorant and stupid to suggest that anyone who dislikes the president hates his country. On the contrary, we're showing how much we love America by exercising free speech and trying to cure the neoconservative Mad Cowboy Disease that has infected Washington.</fullReview>

If nothing else this film will get you thinking about our country good or bad, loving it or hating it. Isn't that what the arts are designed to do? The goal of every artist is to move the viewer and listener. Greek playwrights did that first and they did it well. See this film, discuss it, then make up your own mind, don't listen to someone else's opinions, beliefs, or ideas.

		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 discusses the events surrounding the worst tragedy in US history since the Kennedy assassination. It's main target, if you haven't already heard, is the Bush administration. It's scathing in it's indictments yet they are often hilarious. Though much is discussed, no real conclusions are met which leaves a lot for the viewer to ponder. I honestly felt bombarded by the information, and it certainly will earn a spot on my shelf when it arrives on DVD. (Let's hope it will hit the shelves before the critical date of November 2, 2004, right?) This is a film that I feel cannot be taken whole-heartedly, though there is an astute element of believability to what it touches base on. This is a film that must be studied, discussed and viewed several times. It certainly is great, and highly recommended for anyone who doesn't take what the media says at face value. Certainly one of the most politically controversial films since Oliver Stone's JFK. 10 out 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting movie, but full of half truths.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to get a view of this movie early. While Moore does come up with some interesting ideas, sadly many of them are pieced together to show only the final outcome that he would like everyone to see. Unfortunately this is going to work, and indeed has worked on many of the people that have posted reviews on this board. If I were to make a documentary on a political figure, it would be quite easy to just take the film footage and news clippings that put them in a poor light and piece them together to make a story. Using this method I could turn and political figure into the next psychological madman. While Moore hasn't gone that far, he has definitely taken advantage of the plethora of material on Bush and Iraq, and pieced it together in an obvious attempt to sway people's minds. The fact is that people's anger at this film comes not from an attempt to stop free speech, but rather it is an attempt to stop speech manipulation. Leading the witness is what it is called in court, and indeed this is what it appears to be from this movie as well. Moore would like nothing more that to sway people's minds with half truths so they will forget about the other half of the truth and instead focus on what he wants them to believe. All that I can ask is that if you do go see this movie, keep an open mind on what is occurring. You already know Moore wants to push the political envelope using his film. Make up your own mind on issues. Don't rely on someone like Moore, who has his own obvious political agenda, to make your mind up for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As one of the few that's had an opportunity to view a screening of the film I'm amazed by the current tally of over 1,600 votes ? there haven't been that many screenings as of June 19th ! That said, I'm very glad that I did have the chance to see this film ? some of the imagery is very strong and disturbing but it is an important film. It's unfortunate that many of the people that have opinions relating to topics discussed in this film will either not see Fahrenheit or will adamantly refuse to let their opinions be swayed by the facts. I've already had several discussions with friends extremely opposed to the film ? regardless of them not seeing it. This is a time where Michael Moore steps back from being the centerpiece of the film and lets the material speak for itself. Most of the material is already in the public record however, it seems to have less impact when we hear bits and pieces of information in the newspapers or TV over the years than when those bits and pieces are put together to tell the story.There are a few times where Mr. Moore may have gone a bit over the top but this is not supposed to be a school textbook - this is a combination of documentary and some comedy. When dealing with this subject matter you really need some comic relief to break the tension and there is tension. I gave this film a 9 out of 10 ? you may not agree with everything but it is a worthwhile way to spend two hours of your life!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is an impressive crowd: the haves, and the have-mores. Some people call you the elite, I call you my base." - George W. Bush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 opens not unlike Moore's earlier films, but deals with something much more macrocosmic in nature. Moore, as narrator, offers banter and irony, and periodically emerges on screen as a purposeful irritant, such as when he brings along a Marine who declined to rotate again to Iraq and together, they call the bluffs of congressmen, advising them to have their children enlist. And he makes effective use of frank clips like Bush rehearsing looks on his face before going live with his broadcast to the nation about 9/11. Why in a time when we have a level-headed president with essentially logical reasons for expanding government power do his vehement opponents forget the PATRIOT Act they supported? Moore discovers that members of Congress don't read most bills they vote on, including said bill which among other things involved government infiltration of pacifist groups. And so---possibly my favorite moment---Moore drives through Washington in an ice cream truck using the speaker to read the bill to them.Fahrenheit 9/11 is less a revelation about Bush than a melodrama of his futile, alarming presidency. Its indictments shouldn't be news to anyone, but either way Moore delineates them with striking footage and an unremitting voice-over narration that basically reasons that Bush is (thankfully was) inept, lying, fraudulent, failing in the war on terrorism, has poor preference of friends. While Moore's voice-over modulates from indignation to cynicism, some incisive visual sections speak for themselves. Moore serves a new jolt with well-acquainted information. It's how he organizes his imagery. We're all acquainted with the 2000 election dispute, which was "resolved" by the Supreme Court. What I hadn't seen before was footage of Bush's election confirmation by Congress. 10 representatives stand to object to it; not one senator. As we watch the dissenters, we can't help observing that they're nine black people, one Asian woman. They're all gaveled into silence by the chairman, Vice President Al Gore. The scene's desperation and hopelessness reignites old agitations for those who know Bush was counterfeit.He is depicted as much indebted to friends who've bailed him out of business risks. Moore chronicles a longstanding affiliation between the Bush family and important Saudi Arabians. A billion-plus in Saudi money has passed into the treasure chests of Bush family endeavors. After 9/11 the White House hand-walked flights out of the country transporting bin Laden family members (which disavow its most widely known member). Moore looks at military records released by Bush to elucidate his desertion of the Texas Air National Guard, and discovers that the name of another pilot's been censored. This pilot, we find, was Bush's friend who became Texas money manager for the billionaire bin Ladens. Another clue to the bond between the Bushes and the Saudis: The law firm of Bush 41's Secretary of State was enlisted by the Saudis to defend a suit by a group of 9/11 survivors, who charged that the Saudis had bankrolled al-Qaeda.To Moore, this is more proof of Bush's demoralizing alliance with the Saudis, that it may've affected his choice to go to war against Iraq to some degree on their account. Moore finds the war groundless. No WMDs, no Hussein-bin Laden connection. He speaks with American soldiers, including amputees, who grieve indignantly about Bush's proposed military cuts simultaneously as he was sending them into a groundless war. Moore also interviews American troops who are evidently relishing the war. He has footage of soldiers who hood an Iraqi prisoner, call him "Ali Baba" and touch his penis.The Bush administration didn't seem to know what every newscaster knows, that a satellite image can be live before they get the cue to speak. That clarifies the disgusting footage of Wolfowitz wetting his comb in his mouth before slicking back his hair. Comb doesn't do the trick, so he spits in his hand, wipes it down. And naturally the immortal "fool me twice" clip. Such scenes catch our targets unawares, which is classic Moore. However his film gets gradually bleaker. He predominantly vanishes, concentrating on people such as an enormously patriotic wife/mother from his hometown of Flint. She reads a letter from her son, written days before he was killed in Iraq, begging his family to strive for Bush's impeachment.This, the highest-grossing documentary of all time, is indeed an imperative, effective film, defiant of the White House aim, which was to exhibit Bush as a determined commander. He's exposed as a superficial, incoherent man, childish in speech, phony in demeanor. Not quite as broad-scale as Bowling for Columbine, Moore moderates his typical profusion. Tackling bigger risks, he's more gingerly here. We get an editorial, not a shtick. The anger and bewilderment in his film are a breathtaking reply to Bush's uninflected reverberation of the same intractable soundbites. Which one's lost more ground over time, and which one's gained more? Also, which made sense at the time?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We were duped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, I don't immediately believe what Moore puts forth as the truth; I realize that he, as anyone who makes documentaries(yes, there are degrees to it, but do you honestly think that any human being can completely turn off their own opinion, even for enough time to assemble a piece of journalism?) does, has an agenda. There are those that would call his work outright propaganda, and to an extent, that's probably true. However, rather than accept anyone's clear-cut definition of what's right and what's wrong, let's each of us, as individuals, for ourselves answer the question: Is that OK, given that he's attempting to get us to take action for what he considers to be right, as opposed to trying to justify, say, the mass murder of an entire people or several? I have watched most of his feature-length productions(save for Sicko as well as Roger &amp; Me, both of which I'm on the lookout for), and only an excerpt of Stupid White Men, and just as in that and Bowling for Columbine, this does try to evoke more of what I imagine is called "white guilt", and "was that what it was really about" remains his favorite phrasing. With that said, he makes numerous compelling points, and as always, that is what I hope people will manage to take from this; the facts and conclusions that, regardless of how you look at them, should not be ignored. I'd say that this is his best film yet. The editing is spot-on, it's dramatic, it's entertaining, it's gripping. There is a bit of disturbing, violent and unsettling footage, as well as brief and infrequent strong language in this. The DVD contains a trailer. I recommend this to anyone who can see themselves being critical viewers, and not take everything at face value. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Moore says isn't as much a problem as what he doesn't say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen lots of debate about the "facts" in Fahrenheit 911. I think the greater issue is that however factual the elements in this film may be, they don't tell the whole story.The motivation behind this film is plainly simple: Get Bush out of office.Therefore, anything that would make Bush look bad is given plenty of attention, while anything that doesn't support this view is simply ignored. But Moore doesn't stop there. Instead, he manipulates images and sound bites through editing and context shifts to further paint his image of Bush as the bad guy.Moore places great emphasis on the relationship between the Saudis and Bush, conveniently forgetting to mention that the relationship is with the United States Government, no matter who may be President at the time. The embassy Moore visits in the film existed during the Clinton years as well, and Clinton also gave it special treatment. By leaving out this information, Moore makes it seem that Bush is working on some inside deal, which is not accurate.Moore further develops his conspiracy theory by implying that one of the goals of dealing with the Saudis was a special pipeline. It is true that the pipeline was completed during the Bush administration, but pipelines aren't built overnight. The planning began long before Bush took office. Again, if you were going to implicate Bush in some sort of scandal here, you would have to include Clinton as well, since that work was ongoing in the 90's.This movie also implies blame on Bush for not being more prepared when the 9/11 attacks occurred, mentioning that the World Trade Center had been attacked before, and these same terrorist groups had also attacked the USS Cole among other targets before 9/11. He leaves out the fact that those attacks all occurred during the Clinton years, and most Americans had already put those events behind them. That omission makes Bush seem more evil. Watching this film almost makes it seem as though the Clinton presidency never existed.The scene in the classroom is also manipulated to show Bush in the most negative light. With clever editing, Moore takes an otherwise innocent event and covers it with sinister overtones. The original wide shots are edited into close-ups, and the frame rate is slowed to accentuate his least flattering expressions. In addition, the events are shown out of sequence and certain parts are repeated to make it appear that this went on much longer than it actually did. Not only that, but Moore's narration of what may have been going through his mind creates a villain through speculation. If you watch the original, unedited footage of Bush in the classroom, your impression will be vastly different. Moore makes comparisons with Pearl Harbor when it suits his purpose, as when he points out the differences in how the investigations where conducted. However, he forgets about Pearl Harbor when he moves to the war in Iraq. The narration talks about us being attacked by BinLaden, then going to war in Iraq, a country that has never attacked the United States. This may be true, but it is also true that after we were attacked by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor, we went to war in Germany, a country that also has never attacked the United States. Does that mean it was the wrong thing to do? Not necessarily, but Moore's selective historical perspective implies that the war is unjustified, when in fact only time will tell.Moore also leaves out important facts when it comes to global support for the war. He makes fun of all the so-called 'little' countries in the 'coalition of the willing,' (probably offending many citizens of those countries in the process). He never mentions the larger armies of Australia, Japan and Great Britain. However, once again when it suits his purpose, he shows some Japanese people being held hostage with demands that Japan pull their troops out. According to the film, Japan isn't even there.Iraq before the invasion is shown to be a happy, beautiful place where everyone is smiling and kids are playing. No mention of the poverty and mass graves nearby, while Saddam basks in one of his many palaces. Meanwhile, Flint Michigan is portrayed as a wasteland with near 50% unemployment, a situation so desperate that young people have no choice but to join the armed forces. This seems a little out of phase with reality. A moment later, some recruiters have to decide which of the malls to visit to try and trick people into joining up. If things are so bad, why aren't there lines at the recruitment office? Instead, it appears that the malls are quite busy, and the Marines have to resort to cheap tactics to get anyone to talk with them. It doesn't seem like these kids are too desperate.Once the film moves to Iraq, there isn't much that we haven't seen before. Moore tries to make it seem that Iraq is another Vietnam. There are plenty of scenes showing the horrors of war, which are true no matter which war you are examining. The facts are accurate enough, but once again, the context is misleading. Many of the images of the war in Fahrenheit 9/11 are similar to those in Saving Private Ryan. War is hell, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's the wrong thing to do.Just as misleading as his omission of relevant factual material, is his inclusion of irrelevant information. Near the beginning of the film, Moore shows what Bush was doing in the days leading up to 9/11, ending with him going to sleep on September 10th in a bed made of fine French linens?. How dare he! How could he be living it up when just the next day thousands of innocent people will be killed! I don't know about you, but I myself was having a fun time on September 10th, and that night I slept in Egyptian cotton. Does that mean that I am somehow implicated in this too?This film does raise some important issues. However, Michael Moore can't get over his rage due to Bush winning the 2000 election. He is so blinded by his hatred of Bush that he misses an opportunity to present a credible dissension based on mistakes made leading to the war in Iraq. Instead, he goes out of his way to provoke people into voting on an emotional reaction to his movie, with the sole purpose of avenging Gore's loss to Bush in 2000.Although he tries to disguise this as a documentary, it is really political propaganda. The truly duped will be those who base their vote on the content of this film. People should watch this movie. But while watching it they should keep in mind that that motion pictures can make things look believable even though they never really exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tell people what they want to hear--and what do you get?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today, this year, this movie and Michael Moore are flying high, but in ten or twenty years, I don't think he may rate even a footnote. Why? How can that be? Can't I open my eyes to truth, blah, blah blah.Probably the best way to put Moore and his films in a nutshell is "two wrongs don't make a right." Do corrupt corporations and scandalous presidents deserve scrutiny? Of course they do. But the method to do that, the innate falsity of it all, is what makes Michael Moore a passing name in history, although I have no doubt he'll be crying all the way to the bank.Falsity? How can I say that? Consider this story: In the sixties we were in a Cold War. We had a big budget space program. I heard our whole space program was to build missiles to bomb Russia. All the facts I just presented are true, and I dare you to prove otherwise. Of course, one of those statements isn't a fact at all. Now I show up at your house and ask you embarrassing questions in front of a camera. You know what you say is going to be on film somewhere so you hem and haw and look awkward and phony.Next I string up some lame jokes and cruel gags on various people, and make a movie. Voila! The Moore film making style laid bare! Give me my award!The truly amazing thing to me is people accepting what he says as the gospel truth, when everything from websites to bloggers to even mainstream media shows his numerous inconsistencies and distortions. Why do they keep listening--because he tells them what they want to hear. I thought the right wing had hated Clinton, but the liberals today *really* hate Bush--an unseething raging, fashionable for the elite passion. Is this hatred because Bush is a corporate republican type who's lied about something, (who *hasn't* lied in the presidency at this point?) or that most unpardonable of things, a man from Texas with southern values? Moore's master stroke was releasing his movie at the right time to tap into that rage, and rake in plenty of money and attention . However, I don't think even that was enough, since I think he was hoping this movie would start Le Revolution, not hit it big then fade. The big question is even if his dearest wish succeeds and Bush gets out of office, will the next one be any better, or just His candidate with His values? Does that mean Moore didn't really have anything to say? No not that. But the truth is a slippery thing that is never really what people want it to be, and time fades away the babble of politics. Don't think so? Who do you prefer, Whigs or Tories?What is left in the end is the meaning of it all. Did you really speak from your heart? Or just rake the muck? Great things, great stories, great documentaries, are remembered because they had something to say. Moore to me is a man who is essentially dishonest, and seemingly has experienced little of life himself, pointing the finger of accusation yet little better than his numerous targets. That's the key thing about Moore of which I disapprove, and indeed of most liberals and leftists. There's a lot of bad in the world, a lot of things that are swept under the rug and hidden, but look to yourself before you claim the right of indignation. How are you so much better aside from pointing out other people's evils? More importantly, are you going to make it any better?</fullReview>

No i don't know how he runs your country. But wouldn't you rather him go out and play a few rounds of golf or go on holidays for a few weeks to clear his head rather than run your country into the ground? I feel that this movie is very much one sided. Isn't it funny that this has come out in an electoral year aswell? Well that is my point on the movie. It was a very good movie but. It has been a controversial movie over here too with some of the reviews done on the movie. Well I'm sorry if i had upset anyone but this is the way that i felt about this movie whilst watching it and thinking back on it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To review this documentary properly one should be objective and in doing so cast aside all political agendas. MICHAEL MOORE GETS A "10" FOR EDITING. To deliver his point he has done an admirable job. Of course one must realize that using available material one could presumably "edit" MICKEY MOUSE into a serial killer. There are some funny moments provided you have a penchant for a rather liberal sense of humor. On the whole we have what looks like a rather cheaply made production. ADDING TO THAT IS THE APPEARANCE OF MR. MOORE NOT ONLY AS WRITER, PRODUCER, DIRECTOR, NARRATOR, BUT ON CAMERA AS AN UNKEMPT SOMEWHAT OBESE FELLOW TRYING TO FULFILL AN AGENDA THAT BECKONS FOR A MORE AESTHETICALLY GROOMED PERSON. ALL IN ALL THIS FILM LACKS "the finishing touch" THAT DISTINGUISHES GREAT FROM GONE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's best, by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If we were to see one movie this year, or suggest that other's not miss one, this is the film. Without a doubt, the movie was directed, created, envisioned, by Moore. His influence is felt throughout the film. But, be a liberal, a political moderate, or an extreme conservative, Moore brings many questionable events to light. He also had the courage to show the misery, the pain, the fear faced by our troops abroad. From the scene when our armies were rushing to Bagdad full of bravado, to the scenes where the many terribly wounded were questioning why, to the scene of draped coffins, all enlightening, sad, and if I may say so as a veteran, disgusting. The young soldier that faces prison instead of returning to the front, the discussion with the soldier, a one-time strong Republican, on his way home (full of morphine), to convince his neighbors to vote Democrat are worth the price of admission alone. The scenes of our President, his reaction when first hearing of the disaster of 9/11 are appalling. More than anything, this movie made us wish that our country, our world, return to the days (Greece, Troy, Rome) when our brave leaders led the charge. I would truly love to see how they match up to the poor soldiers that they've placed in harms way. We left in tears.</fullReview>

(that took two years) Michael Moore lays out situation after situation of incredible footage, commentary, interviews which completely paint a picture of how a poorly run situation sprouts into more and more bad situations for the wrong reasons. The footage speaks for itself. There isn't that much of the guerrila interviewing from his past films. (Although he does that with members of congress for fun to ask them to enlist their kids in the army) The footage...which we've all seen in one form of another on TV and in the paper...is just amazing. To sit through this in well-ordered fashion. Reminds how blatant a horror it was that this country has suffered under incompetence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comment from a non-American</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I have to say up-front, I really don't like Michael Moore at all as a person when he is interviewed - this is not to say I cannot appreciate his body of work though.Anyway, I saw this recently whilst in the US and because I am not American I probably have a far less biased opinion - most of the reviews I read were either totally for this movie, or totally against it.Well, let's see - it was an interesting satirical look at GWB and the whole reaction, etc, to 9/11 - but was it entirely factual? Well, yes, you'd have to say that what was SHOWN was true, and the way in which it was shown, was also true - but only true to the one-sided view of Michael Moore. You won't get a well-rounded piece of movie making from this man on this subject or any other.Is it worth seeing at the movie theatre? Honestly, I would say NO - wait for it to come to your nearest Blockbuster etc, it will be a lot cheaper and this mockumentary/documentary will definitely have limited appeal to the general movie going public.Michael Moore undoubtedly makes a significant contribution to movie making, and he certainly has his own style - but I find what he does to be divisive and very disconcerting. Not because I don't feel GWB has used 9/11 to further his own political agenda, as an outsider from another country I can see clearly he HAS done that. I suppose I just don't like to be a party to this kind of self-serving film-making - is this movie for the good of all of us, or is just another way for Mr Moore to increase his bank balance by making a "film" that derides and attacks and does not offer much of anything else?Where are the solutions? What is actually being done? What is being achieved by the film? Let's not just talk about this thing, let's actually do something constructive - criticism can be constructive, but this, it doesn't tell us anything new about GWB, and it doesn't say anything that many of us have not already been thinking.What next for Mr Moore? Or rather, who's next on his political agenda?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Eggs-actly Accurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has done it again ? assembled a disembodied collection of sound bites, disjointed and almost always out-of-context film footage, Corporation bashing, cynical one-liners, tearful testimony of doubtlessly hurt family members threaded into the narrative, vague coincidence, rambling discourses by carefully chosen downtrodden `common folk' and any clip in which an important figure is seen as a pompous no-nothing. In `Fahrenheit 911' we have the added treat of listening to the testimony of a handful of reluctant non-com warriors and the stern admonition that our soldiers are willing to go in harm's way, but only if we REALLY need them to do so. In a bit of a surprise move the film opens with a shotgun of facts aimed at building the case that President Bush is President only because a small group of vaguely interconnected power brokers (not) somehow colluded to make him so ? a wild stretch right out of the box. Mr. Moore could surely turn this segment into a documentary in its own right. Unfortunately this is a sour grapes kick off for a documentary, and we in the audience sensed this.  Also early on we see protests (after we've been made to feel bad about voting George Bush into office in the first place) along the parade route on Inauguration Day and much is made of the point that in a time of celebration the nation is already sundered. Mention is made that even eggs were thrown. We are stunned (well, maybe not stunned) as a solitary egg is discerned striking a car. Generally Presidential-grade vehicles are up to such punishment. As metaphor, this film could not be more appropriately compared to anything but this lamely impactful footage documenting an egg plopping onto the pavement after striking the auto. There are a plethora of quotes floating on the Internet which indicate threats of terrorism against the U.S. were perceived many years ago. bin Laden's propensity to initiating violent anti-American activities was known and even prominent figures in government long before G.W. Bush became President testified as to the likelihood of weapons of mass destruction being likely found in Iraq. But we are a nation famed for second-guessing nearly any headline; I am sure there is a JFK re-visit being written at this very moment.  The visit to Flint, Michigan to work the angle of the poor being the sole source of our military personnel was noticeably patched in, almost as an aside. If one is building a case that rich power brokers arrange wars, why even worry about the source of troops? That never seems to come up in academic studies of how and why a war begins.  It is very refreshing to see large crowds in attendance at the local plex to view a film the subject of which is normally strictly art-house fare. In this sense the movie is exciting; certainly any documentary that gets Americans talking about politics is a good thing. It will be interesting to see counter-reactions (not News-At-Eleven clips of Hollywood actors smugly winking at us) to the fanfare accorded this movie's release. So you need go only as far as this medium to find as many counter-arguments to any that Moore presents. Ho-hum. Until `Fahrenheit 911' came along `Super Size Me' was a shoe-in as the Best Documentary of the year. Now it may be a horse race to see which wins the Oscar, but the Academy members have surely punched their vote cards already, if not only figuratively. Rating: Three Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 reads much like a kidnapper's extortion note pieced together from snippets clipped from other sources. Such a note can be made to say anything the extortionist wants. This is what Michael Moore has done, kidnapped the truth. His job is made that much easier when the sources are from a news media already heavily arrayed against its target, George Bush. It makes for a good movie, however, but this method is similar to Hitler's propaganda tactics used during World War II: the bigger the lie that is told, the more it is believed. I could say don't go see this movie, but that would be an invitation to do the opposite. PLEASE, go see this movie just to see how lame it looks, pieced together from scrap sources.</fullReview>

Movies have plots, points to make to draw the audience in and keep them in an imaginary little world. How many people saw Shrek and said "My God! If I kiss my true love, I could turn into an Ogre!" or saw Stepford wives and thought, "That could happen!"? If you did, you're to gullible. Go to the movies for entertainment, not for a political base. See the movie and keep in mind, he is showing what he wants you to see. Not "The Truth". Obviously some of his points have some truth to them otherwise it would be a comedic drama and not a documentary. But come on, if you believed everything you saw in the movies, then you probably threw out your TV after watching Poltergiest and went looking for the Little Mermaid. Anybody who seeks truth, read a newspaper, form opinions of your own in that pea brain. Anybody wanting to spend $8 for a few laughs or cries, go to the movies.

		<fullReview>The book, published just this year, is called "House of Bush, House of Saud: The Secret Relationship Between the World's Two Most Powerful Dynasties," by Craig Unger. I haven't read it yet, but I can pretty much guarantee that it is a more detailed, sober, accurate and fair account of the relationship between the Bushmeister and our "friends," the Saudis. It was published last March by Scribner. Unfortunately, the Cliff Notes screen version of the story will get all the glory. I don't care much for Moore. I know conservatives hate him, but he's not exactly beloved among many liberals for his fudging of the facts (he's like Bush in a baseball cap). I was really p***ed that he won the Academy Award for documentary, because I love real documentaries, from muck-raking stuff like Errol Morris' "The Thin Blue Line" to historical films like Ken Burns "Civil War." But I hated "Bowling for Columbine" because of the liberties he took with the facts (I agreed wholeheartedly with the premise, though -- we are way too paranoid in this country). The sad thing is he could have played it straight and still made the point. And it would have been a documentary as I understand the term. But he didn't and it wasn't. Moore needs to decide if he's going to be a comedian or a documentarian -- being both doesn't work and serves only to debase the documentary form.</fullReview>

This film was just made so Moore could show case his political beliefs. Namely liberals good - republicans bad and evil. Moore spends time telling us how the Bush family is involved with Saudis and how Saudis fund terrorists. He comments on how it can be so hard to find Bin Ladin and says how the Bush regime lied to start a war in Iraq in order to gain control of oil rather than find nuclear weapons. It's fine for Moore to vent his political beliefs, but don't expect everyone to believe them. And please take everything shown in this with a grain of salt because it's all biased.FINAL VERDICT: See it if you must since it got so much hype.

		<fullReview>This is another sincere, well researched but ultimately messily constructed attempt by Michael Moore to say... well, I'm still not sure really. And that's the problem with this 'documentary'. As in the more passionate Bowling for Columbine, any number of things get him riding a very tall horse but the point and threads of his argument disintegrate under the pressure of his own subjectivism.There are many interesting facts brought to light in this film. The problem is that often he talks about the facts as if they demonstrate that Bush is immoral to the point of being criminal, without further argument or explanation - and invariably the facts are presented outside of any point just to get a rise from the audience. I laughed, just as many others did in this highly liberal corner of England, but only in the same way that one laughs at the Coyote getting mangled by yet another ACME contraption gone awry.The only truly compelling moments are (i) that towards the end where the camera/sound crew follows a bereaved mother around Washington without comment or edit - i.e. real documentary and (ii) when I can't work out whether an employment agent is being treated with irony or sincerity; is she a baddie or a saint? I squirmed in the cinema wrestling with my own conscience. Then Moore appeared in shot and by cooing his approval of her actions simultaneously annulled the tension he'd inadvertently set up, removing all objectivism from the sequence and the point that he was failing to make. Full marks for effort, very few for execution 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an outsider, I have to say that Fahrenheit 9/11 was a big dissapointment, maybe people in general don't read the papers or try to get a balanced view on world events, but as probably more has been written about 9/11 than anything else, there was nothing in this film that was new, or even more damning and dissapointing, that was answered.I'm afraid that like "The Passion of the Christ" this film will be reviewed, as hard as some may try, based on in this case, one's political leanings, rather than any of it's other merits.It did start off well, the titles rolling up 12 minutes into the film's opening conspiracy theories were amazing, and somehow the fact that it took 4 odd minutes to display a few names was irrelevant as before us the promise of seeing behind the "show" was laid.Ultimately what was the outcome? That the war in Iraq wasn't neccessary? I was hoping maybe for some insight into why THEY duped us (money?), or whether, THEYwere duped themselves, but the film hardly bothered to tell us that WMD haven't been found etc, instead concentrating unfairly in my opinion on the terrible grief of one women after the oh-to-recent loss of her Son in Iraq, and that (horror of horrors) the army is mostly made up of people from the poorer parts of society, which I'm sure you'll find it true of most civil servant jobs all over the world.Where's the controversy in that?And I found it quite ironic that when the army first came into it, they were shown as mindless thugs, listening to music, as they killed innocent people etc, yet in the end the director used their meaningless deaths as the main collateral (closing point) in his argument.In the end I ended up paying to watch one person's biased political message and I'm no particular fan of "Dubya" myself</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Low Road</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a self-admitted propagandist. He's the Leni Riefenstal of the smug liberals. He's got something to say and the vehicle with which to say it. I'm not questioning his right to a political opinion, I'm not doubting his sincerity in getting his message heard. My beef is with Michael Moore the filmmaker, Michael Moore the documentarian. This film (as a film not a political statement or message) is a terrible film. It's a good half hour too long. It's use of funny little nods to the TV generations savvy (Bonanza) is insulting not only to the people who are profiled in the film but also to those watching it. But you know something? I could get over all that if he didn't consistently take the low road and mock the very people he's profiling. (I'm not talking about the Bush administration here--I'm talking about the ordinary people like Lila Lipscomb and the soldiers he interviews). He did it in Roger and Me, I'm sure he did it in Bowling for Columbine (I couldn't bear to watch that one), and he does it again here. He acts like he is much smarter, cooler and "in the know" than the people he's speaking to and he edits the living daylights out of his footage to make them all look like idiots. If he is trying to make the point that the poor, disenfranchised youth of America are fighting the war for the big, bad politicians (and believe you me, that is one of his points), then he would be much better served if he didn't make fun of them by editing their words thematically. Let me explain. He thinks it's amusing to interview soliders and ask them what music they listen to when they're "working". He then uses these clips strung together to paint a very unflattering picture of the very soldiers he asks you to feel sorry for a half an hour later in the film. The soldiers may very well be pawns in the industrial military complex. Does that mean they have to be pawns in a Michael Moore film, too? It is very unfortunate that this film will line the pockets of Michael Moore and even more unfortunate that people will be swayed by its themes into thinking it's a good film. Come awards season, we'll no doubt have to see Mr. Moore's large, disheveled self pontificating from on high. I'm thinking of taking a trip to Saudi Arabia around the end of February just so I don't have to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong i am heart broken over the fact that our country is at WAR! but part of growing up and part of maturing is learning that timing has it purposes and its reasons. If Moore had a little eloquence as an American and an individual he wouldn't bash a President for making the decisions he did, he is not our countries leader and if he would like to be then i suggest he start running. Don't get me wrong i agree whole heartedly with a lot of things about the conspiracies and incongruities of the Bush administration that Moore points out but, am sickened at the treasonous lengths that Moore goes to in this short but jam-packed example of fabrication and deceit. I would be the first conservative to say I am some what disappointed with Bush. He built up such a high platform that even though we all wanted to believe he could accomplish the tasks he set out to do, what single administration can or does. A lot of things got pushed to the back burner in sight of the 9/11 attack on America. To comment on Moore as a director he does get his point across although by the time we reach the point it's so buried under extreme dramatization that reason becomes clouded. The point i guess i am trying to make is that Mr. Moore you are not the President and the shoulda coulda woulda's arnt going to change the fact that another man had to carry the burden that no matter what decision he made 1/2 his nations population was going to be p***ed. Whether you are gung-ho HAWK or a stay at home DOVE, once YOUR nation's leader... ( thats right leader even though you don't like it and may have not voted for it) as declared war either back our boys up, or pack your ass and go.</fullReview>

It violates campaign finace laws and tries to push the viewer toward a warped view of the truth. Michael Moore's truth is a fragment of real reality.

		<fullReview>Based on the immediate success of Michael Moore's movie I am left to postulate that this movie is "The Passion of Christ" to the ultra-secular. In a world that finds itself more polarized every day, Michael Moore has become the champion of those who struggle to give us nothing to believe in.And another thing. Michael Moore is into giving fat people a bad name. It's like, "Look at me! I'm a common fat-slob from Middle America." Well I've seen Middle America, and let me tell you, on their good days they are never fat slobs! Oh sure, some days everybody wants to just relax and not worry about their appearance. But when middle America's going to be featured in a big time movie, they get up and shave and put on a clean shirt. Large does not translate to slob. Michael Moore is a poster child to the secular left, but by choosing to look like a fat-and-smelly he does not represent any kind of traditional American.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is purely a propaganda film. Not that there is anything wrong with that. Leni Riefenstahl never apologized, nor should Mr. Moore. Moore presents the facts in a way that makes Mr. Bush look bad. Like shooting ducks in a pond. The footage of Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, and their ilk are from zoomed-in low res TV video, making them look even more sinister than they are (if that's possible). A parent of a dead war hero makes a trip to Washington and finds release by focusing anger at the White House. I have never heard an ovation in a cineplex before today, and that speaks to something in American society, not the quality of the film. Although Moore did a good job, he did not do a great job, but I am upset even more by the "reviews" on IMDb obviously written by people who have not seen this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a bore Moore - The facts again are off (from a democrat!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a Hard democrat and wanting really to see this movie for a few weeks now, I was so disappointed in the end.Lets see the problems with this film. Well, like his other films, he seems to take some truth and stretch it really far. I left the movie writing down some "40 facts" and looked them up after the film and found that 32 of them were either 100% wrong or the #s he used were very off. He did this in so many of his other films, none of which I really liked.Is he a communist? No, he is just a very over weight, not so good-looking bitter person. It seems he just hates anything but the Democrats - which in the US doesn't fly. This is a country of free will, of choice - we have to live with what and who we have as President. I voted for Clinton term 1 and will admit he too made mistakes and wasn't the best President (prob very far down the list of great Presidents).So lets look at the film. Moore again takes real interviews and images and puts little side notes in between, which is getting real annoying!!! Ok but there are some really good intense parts, that get you to think, but then Moore again comes on screen (as ugly as can be) and basically kills any facts you might believe there. I also wonder if the advertisements for the film will be pulled, I know there is some rule that states you can't donate to a campaign that is within 30 days of a primary election. Moore is donating 30% of his profits to the John Kerry. I think this is a violation and we will probably hear about it soon.Final word - wait to video (or after Kerry losses election). This will not help Kerry, this will only allow Bush to pick apart the movie that has so many mis-facts, or false #s.Have fun God Bless the USA! Jim</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems like only yesterday that legitimate documentaries like "The Thin Blue Line" were denied awards because they featured recreations in a scene or two. Now, everywhere you look, there are self-serving, agenda-laden jeremiads like "Fahrenheit 9-11" being hailed as great documentary film-making. Correct me if I'm wrong, but documentaries are ostensibly non-fiction films, yes? So when a filmmaker takes a few real events, makes up the rest, and ladles on a heavy dose of sarcasm (largely inspired, not coincidentally, by the speculative sections), why is this considered a documentary? If this is a documentary and not mere propaganda, I guess "Triumph of the Will" isn't propaganda either. So maybe the Oscars can honor the two unsung documentarians of our time this year: Leni Riefenstahl and Michael Moore. Yeesh! Who's next, Osama bin Laden? It's a good thing they finally honored Errol Morris last year before going off the deep end.</fullReview>

Moore strings together a lot of interviews and images, but I don't think they come together into a satisfying whole. We already know about most of the things he discusses, so it's not like we are going to learn anything new. This is basically just a documentary that says Moore is against the war--well, so what? Documentaries should try to have some semblance of objectivity, but there isn't much here. He basically set out to make Bush look bad (not like Bush needs any help from anyone to make him look bad, but still...). The documentary is too scattered for us to really know what he is trying to say, other than that war sucks and Bush is a moron--both obvious points (to me at least).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film made to motivate, but not to educate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, its been almost a year since this movie hit theaters and caused nationwide pandemonium. People LOVED it and people HATED it. It's not easy to think objectively about a film that interferes so much with one's political beliefs. Sure, the film is biased and manipulative but so are countless other documentaries. Why does'nt every other documentary film get the same kind of scrutiny? Again, it comes down to politics. People are very opinionated when it comes to politics and especially now after the wake of September 11, the country is more divided then ever. Michael Moore is not ready to persuade Bush supporters to agree with his film. His goal was simple: to make a film, have it released before the election and make sure that it would shock, entertain and motivate people to vote. If Michael Moore tried to make an objective view of the president's involvement in the September 11th attacks, the film would have been about five hours long, it would'nt be as entertaining, not many people would see it, and it would not have been ready to hit theaters by last year's election. So it's obvious that Michael Moore wanted to vote Bush out of office. according to Moore, half of the country, particularly the youth, was still not voting and he wanted to change that. And he did. 2004 proved to be one of the biggest if not, THE biggest voter turn out in the history of the USA but Moore's wish did not entirely come true because George W. Bush won the second term as president of the USA. Did Fahrenheit 911 have anything to do with it? Did this film do more harm to the Democrats then good? My sorry answer is yes and no.We live in a media frenzied culture where Hollywood gets more attention then the news. Michael Moore was asked harder questions about Fahrenheit 9/11 then the president was ever asked about the war in Iraq. So while a big fat left wing clown makes a harsh and ruthless attack on the president, the media on the other hand, is quietly following business as usual by ignoring investigations, ignoring hard questions and feeding us war clips as seen through the eyes of the US military: "Operation Iraqi Freedom". We need people like Michael Moore to wake up those of us who don't look beyond the corporate media of America for their news. The problem is, we also should'nt be lectured about it with such emotional attacking insults and that is the inevitable problem of this film.</fullReview>

Moore is very creative but far from a credible journalist/filmmaker. Funny how "FahrenHYPE 9/11" isn't getting the exposure it deserves. This is a TRUE documentary that doesn't applaud Bush, nor do I feel is it completely PRO Bush. It simply does a scene by scene analysis of Moore's falsehoods and misrepresentations of his own thoughts as fact. Many of the people featured in Moore's film are in "FahrenHYPE 9/11" to say that they were taken out of context or that they never even met Moore or his people. Much of Moore's footage was purchased by Moore and was originally shot by other media outlets doing stories not even closely related to Moore's subject.Consider the soldier with no arms describing "phantom pains". His arms were not lost in the war but while changing a tire on an armored vehicle. This soldier never wanted to be associated with Moore. Yet now he's in his film and appears to be a "forgotten" soldier. There are so many blatant lies that it will be a tragedy if this election is influenced by Moore's falsehoods.There have been many "stunts" and segments produced by Michael Moore that I agreed with because of their cause but now question the validity of any information they are based on. He has his own agenda and he won't let the truth get in the way. To say that this is crafty film making would be true. To say that it's intelligent would be irresponsible. To say that it's a documentary would be an outrage. To say that it's true would be a lie. I like to think of this film as Moore being hypothetic, well, pathetic is "Moore" like it.</fullReview>

One wonders what Mr.Moore expected, Bush to don a red cape and fly to the towers and stop the planes with some special power?? Is the POTUS not a human being, not entitled to some thoughts, and what was Moore doing during this anyway, eating yet another burger no doubt.Still, i'd advise you all to watch this and make up your own minds.I personally found it embarrassing for Mr.Moore (bowling for columbine was a much more honest and moving piece) , and nothing more than the worst kind of left wing propaganda with baseless accusations and student-bar join-the-dots conspiracy theories.2/10</fullReview>

As in Bowling for Columbine, he takes factoids and snippets out of context, re-arranges them, and creates a revisionist history that only Democrats and the uninformed will embrace. Some of his factoids have already been shot down in the 9/11 Report.

To me it's just another form of entertainment. Above all Michael likes to provoke, to highlight issues and people he does not particularly sympathies with. His populist, slightly opportunistic approach may not be to everyone's intellectual and rational liking but underneath all this provocation he is ranting and raving on about many serious and pertinent problems.He throws mud around in the hope that some of it will stick. It's his favoured method of research, after all one cannot expect the full collaboration of the subjects or the issues he is going after. We have tabloid newspapers, tabloid TV and now tabloid documentaries- At least Michael makes tabloid look respectable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore perfectly epitomizes the arrogance and entitlement of the political left and the truths the movement continues to trample on in it's sheep- like pursuit of its utopian ideology. the truths in this case are completely cast aside for blatant lies. yes, the film is thought provoking propaganda, but so was Leni Riefenstahl's "Triumph Des Willens." If a so called "documentary" is grounded in lies, then regardless of its emotional effectiveness, it must be seen as fiction and not perceived as history.3 MAJOR MICHAEL MOORE LIES IN "9/11"1. The Bin Laden Family did not leave the U.S. on 9/13 as Moore states. They left on 9/24 after being interviewed extensively by the FBI. The only flight with any Saudis allowed on 9/13 was that of the Saudi Ambassador allowed to travel back to the middle east so that the Bush Administration could get first had information about the Saudi hijackers.2. The Bush Family did not receive a 1.8 Billion dollar investment from the Bin Laden family. The Bin Ladens invested 1.8 Billion dollars in an oil corporation on which the first President Bush became a board member FIVE YEARS AFTER THE INVESTMENT WAS MADE. By the way, any moron should know that the Bin Laden family is extensively invested in the United States in corporations chaired by both Republicans and Democrats alike. Also, the Bin Ladens have had no connection with Osama since 1984,3. The current Bush Administration did not approve an oil pipe line through Afghanastan and then met with Talaban leaders in 2000. The pipe line in Afghanastan was actually a pet project of the Clinton Administration, approved by Bill Clinton. The Talaban did come to Texas but never met with Bush. They met with the contractors who were constructing the pipe line.4. President Bush sat for seven minutes in a class room after he received information about Tower 2 being hit because he was told by his secret service man that the limousine was being moved to a different part of the building, a new secured area for him to move to, and that in that high red alert situation, he was not to move until his team had secured the new exit area. On a personal level Bush thought it would not be a good idea to run out of the class room screaming orders for the entire nation to see on national television and thus cause a nationwide panic. Duh. Is moore an idiot or what?5. Last, I love the little montage Moore has of innocent Iraqi children having the time of their lives on a play ground just before the war begins. How dare he use these clips in this context. These children were the victims of Sadam's brutal ruthless, terror machine for over twenty years -- resulting in the genocide deaths of probably over 100,000.I highly recommend everyone read "Michael Moore Is A Big Fat Stupid WhiteMan" available on Amazon.com.

		<fullReview>There can be no doubt that Michael Moore is an intelligent man. I thought Bowling for Columbine was brilliant and I agree with a large percentage of his argument against Bush. However by offering such a blatantly one-sided piece of propaganda he cheapens his valid points. You get the feeling on leaving the cinema that the way Michael Moore presented his argument he could have made Churchill look like a fool. Whilst he does not attempt to hide his loathing for Bush he still claims to be making a documentary and not a work of fiction. However, there is so much evidence to the contrary he must be presuming an extremely low level of intellect in the recipient audience.He shows pre-Iraq as a blissful oasis of peace, love and understanding with people eating in nice restaurants and laughing children flying kites. This kind of absurd propaganda hasn't been seen since 1930s Russia when Stalin was trying to convince people that everything was hunky dory. He doesn't mention the mass graves, the gassing of the Kurds, the daily tortures and executions or Saddam's sons having students fed to lions. Moore has some very good points to make but he was too passionate about the subject of his film so has outright lied to get his message across thus invalidating his whole film in the eyes of those with double-digit or higher IQs. Members of the coalition he lists are Romania, Costa Rica, Morocco and the Netherlands. His argument is that the Americans were the only powerful western civilization in the coalition. Once again American films are writing Britain out of wars, along with Japan, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Ukraine, South Korea, Denmark, Bulgaria, Thailand, El Salvador, Hungary, Australia, Georgia, Norway, Azerbaijan, Mongolia, Latvia, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Slovakia, Albania, New Zealand, Estonia, Tonga, Philippines, Singapore, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Moldova, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Honduras.Britain, Japan, Italy and Spain?

		<shortDescription>A pack of lies and a wild thread of theories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen (and I've seen the "Blair Witch sequel!). He has played fast and loose with the facts in all of his "documentaries", but he has elevated this technique to an art form in this effort.He shows footage of Gore and supporters celebrating, implying it was a celebration of his "victory". That was filmed in the morning of election day - Gore then went to Tennessee to await the outcome. Then Moore says that all was well until FoxNews called Florida for Bush and worse yet the person at Fox was a relative of Bush's. The truth is that CBS was the first to call Florida for Bush, not Foxnews.Moore fails to mention that multiple independent investigations of Florida's election all showed that Bush won fair and square.Moore spends several minutes recounting the House's Black Caucus's attempt to contest the election. They failed because no senator would sign it. How this was Bush's fault escaped me. He tells about a Taliban visit that happened during the Clinton administration, questions why the Saudi embassy has secret service protection (all embassies in Washington are protected by the secret service if they ask for it). He says Bush authorized the Saudis to fly out of the country when it was Richard Clark that authorized it, Bush had nothing to do with it. And it was done AFTER all airports opened, not before like Moore claims.The whole movie is like this, wild accusations tied together by unbelievable conspiracy theories. The worst thing that he did in this movie involved the mother of a dead soldier. In the film it looks like she supported Bush before he was killed and changed her outlook after her son's death. Her son actually died months before Moore met her - Moore convinced her that her son died for nothing - thereby ruining her son's memory in her mind.Shame on Michael Moore and shame on movie goers that fall for this pack of lies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is Michael Moore trying to be the next Leni Riefenstahl?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably, there may not have been such a prefabricated propaganda flick since Leni Riefenstahl produced 'Triumph of the Will' (1934) for the Nazi party. Michael Moore's obvious fetish to duplicate Ms. Riefenstahl's work is once again reflected in his "documentary", Fahrenheit 9/11. In both cinematography and objectivity, Michael Moore falls short though, and his efforts appear canned and forced. This is a must-see for Kerry/Edwards campaign workers, but all others should probably wait for the sequel. It's definitely not up to par with Michaels past films, ie., 'Roger &amp; Me' and 'Bowling for Columbine". With a film like this, Michael Moore is purposefully positioning himself not only to be on the fringes of political thinking, but also on the fringes of movie making. The question is, will this reward him with the kind of accolades he desires?Only time will tell. In the meantime, Michael walks the fine line of supporting liberal candidates without being shunned by them. He also risks alienating his youthful followers. Though he is now 50, Michael might do well to note that even living to be 100 didn't allow Leni Riefenstahl to regain the stature that she enjoyed before her fall from grace in the public eye. Given Michael's physical appearance in the film, this option may not be available to him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore is a sell-out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen Michael Moore's profoundly ANTI-war documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, I was greatly surprised and disappointed to hear his comments on talkshows recently repudiating Ralph Nader and his candidacy. This is all the more surprising since Moore was a strong supporter of Nader's in his past two runs for president (although, Moore now says he supported Nader only under certain conditions, namely that he wouldn't have a real chance of actually being elected).Moore now supports the PRO-war John Kerry. Kerry, of course, not only voted yes on the war as a member of the senate, but he also favors the continued occupation of Iraq by US soldiers. Perhaps, Moore is now choosing to go the lesser-of-two-evils route. However, if his anti-war stance was as serious as Fahrenheit 9/11 would seem to indicate, he should be behind Ralph Nader - the only ANTI-war candidate of the three - instead of making the lesser-of-two-evils compromise and supporting the PRO-war John Kerry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analyze This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's films can be entertaining. He likes to use stock footage and silly music to make his points, and he's a funny guy. You can't help but laugh at what he has to say sometimes. But I wouldn't trust any of his "fact based" films any farther than I could throw his orca-sized frame. You can't take a word he says at face value; you have to analyze his films, not watch them, to see where the fiction begins (usually in the first frame) and the fact ends. It's difficult reconciling Moore condescending tone with his claims to be the voice of the common man. Fahrenheit 911 begins with a sardonic diatribe that Moore makes sound as if every American is naive about his government, and he puts in details without, well, details. For instance, a big point in his Bush-has-ties-to-the-Bin-Laden-family rant is that "a half brother" of Osama had some contact with a colleague of Bush's a number of years ago. Half-brother, wow -- pretty close, huh? Well, it might be... only Moore forgets to mention that there are FIFTY FOUR Bin Laden brothers and sisters. (This is a SAUDI family, not the Cleavers.) That's more siblings than the total relatives in MY family, most of whom I barely know. I can hardly imagine that, if one of them committed a murder, MY relationships would instantly become suspect. Most of the connections that Moore portrays as the essence of obvious corruption are, to a well-informed viewer like me (I didn't vote for Bush in 2000 and won't in 2004), completely unpersuasive. Moore then portrays Marine recruiters are somehow evil in their use of (effective) recruiting techniques. ("You wanna be am athlete? David Robinson was in the service before the NBA... Did you know Shaggy got his start playing in the Marine Corps band?") Are we supposed to blame the GOP for the service trying to get people to sign up? Isn't that their job? If this weren't wartime, would Moore have any problem with it? Moore correctly points out that the Bush Administration did not allow flag-draped coffins to be photographed (a horrible decision), then self-aggrandizingly says that the media have completely ignored the stories of the wounded and killed soldiers. (I listen to NPR every day, and they are ALWAYS telling the human-interest profiles of fallen soldiers.) How is it that, somehow, the White House flaks getting their make-up applied before going on-air is portrayed as vain and shallow (is Moore saying that none of his sympathetic interviewees primped a little before going on camera)? I have a feeling that, if a Republican were to use images from 9/11 in a movie which celebrated Bush's leadership skills, Moore would be the first to call it exploitation. How does his bald use of such things equate to "noble" propaganda? The movie is so deeply flawed (not in its politics so much as its structure) that any educated person with access to Google could debunk virtually every claim made, or at least point out Moore's grave omissions and mischaracterizations. As entertainment, maybe this is a B; as a "documentary," probably a D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dubious achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although audience reaction was generally positive during the screening here, I was unimpressed by the general tenor of the film, as well as the so-called facts presented. I suspect that only "true believers" and the simple-minded will be influenced by this mis- named "documentary". It reflects Moore's skewed world view, and runs counter to facts in most of its running time. If anyone who disagrees thinks I am just some reactionary conservative, or a shill for the current administration, may I also recommend that he or she refer to Christopher Hitchen's review in Slate. Hitchens is hardly a right wing idealogue, nor is Slate a house organ for the Republicans, but usually hustles for the left. The time and energy spent by Moore in his unique style could have been better spent concentrating on the real facts, which are more than sufficient to make an anti-war or anti-Bush film, without stooping to lies, innuendo, and propaganda more worthy of Hermann Goering; Sergei Eisenstien could have made this film, but it would have been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanted: For High Treason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore: Wanted for High Treason Michael Moore: Wanted for Not Supporting our American Troops in War. Michael Moore: Wanted for supporting Saddam Hussein &amp; Bin Laden Michael Moore: Wanted for Lies about our great President George W. BushDear Friends, here are a list of the lies, falsehoods, and deception in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11:1. Michael Moore, the man of high treason, links President George W. Bush and Bin Laden in the World Trade Center tragedy. He fabricates the most outrageous and grotesque lie that Bush and Bin Laden were friends. There is absolutely no evidence to support this insidious and disturbing claim.2. Michael Moore, the man of high treason, lies about the 'great' Bush family and the Saudi family being friends and partners. This is a complete lie and there is no evidence to support this falsehood. They never had any relationship whatsoever. 3. The man of high treason lies about our great President George W. Bush reading a book to students for ten minutes after his adviser tells him about the tragedy of 9/11. The facts and evidence from all Cable news outlets prove that he left immediately within seconds to take care of the crisis. 4. The man of high treason lies and says that Saddam Hussein had no Weapons of Mass Destruction when it is a proven fact that he had MANY Weapons of Mass Destruction. It is also a proven fact that Hussein was selling them to terrorists and planning on using them on our country. 5. The man of high treason lies in a statement that Al Quada and Iraq had nothing to do with each other. Another huge falsehood. It is a proven fact that Iraq was training, arming, and hiding leading members of Al Quada including Osama Bin Laden. There is overwhelming evidence to support this claim. 6. Michael Moore, the traitor and man of high treason, lies that the great President George H. W. Bush has and had a business relationship with Saudi Arabia and made $2.4 Billion. The truth is that his family made nothing from the Saudi's. There is no evidence or proof of this bogus claim. Bush made all of his money from oil mines in Texas.7. Michael Moore, the man of high treason, lies and says that the President George W. Bush orchestrated the war to make a profit for himself and his friends. Nothing could be further from the truth. He acted in good faith to liberate Iraq and he succeeded.8. The man of high treason claims and lies that President George W. Bush went on vacation prior to 9/11 for 3 months. The fact is that President George W. Bush never vacationed his first year and a half while in office. He was too busy correcting the mistakes of the Demo-rats.9. The man of high treason has the audacity and gall to compare our great President George W. Bush to Hitler and Stalin and I refuse to comment on this because it's such an insane statement. 10. The man of high treason claims that the only countries that supported us in the Iraq war were 3rd World countries. The truth is that France is the only country in the world that did not support the war and ALL the rest of the countries in the world gave full support to the war!!! The rest of the world was on our side and formed the largest coalition in the history of the world to oust the evil dictator Saddam Hussein. Here is the truth and the facts of our great President George W. Bush:1. President George W. Bush is our Nation's GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER. And there has not been a greater President to compare since George W. Washington. 2. George W. Washington never had to deal with terrorists who are the biggest enemies we have ever encountered in the history of this country. Terrorists are much larger in danger than Communist Russia &amp; Cuba or the Evil Axis of Germany, Japan, and Italy in the 1940's. 3. The Great President George W. Bush has handled terrorism in our country masterfully. There will NEVER be another attack on us by any terrorist group thanks to intense efforts, hard work, and commitment of President George W. Bush. 4. The great President George W. Bush has installed a democracy in Iraq and this is the first time that has ever happened in the Middle East. 5. The great President George W. Bush has raised over 3 million jobs in the past 4 months. 6. The great President George W. Bush restored glory to the White House and U.S. Presidency that Demo-rat Clinton almost destroyed with his impeachment hearings. 7. No other sitting President in the history of our country has every accomplished more greatness than our President George W. Bush. EVER.I hope this will encourage you to stay away from this Anti-American propaganda. The man of high treason, Michael Moore, shows burnt American bodies being dragged down streets and hung from telephone wires for over two minutes. All of this is shown to rally terrorist groups around the world. This is so unpatriotic he should be arrested and put on death row for having the gall to show this obscene trash. He also has the nerve to show terrorists beating dead American Soldiers in the streets. We also see the disgusting images of the beheading of Americans in slow motion. And just so the man of high treason gets his anti-American point across we see the beheading by terrorists of our proud American Soldiers many times?too numerous to count. The man of high treason tries to make an anti-war statement and tells us not to support our troops. Dear Traitor, if not for WAR we would be living in a Japanese Regime. The Nazi's would control all of Europe and we all would not exist.Remember these important facts: War is good, War is important, War is righteous, War is virtuous, and most importantly, War is NECESSARY!!!My father fought the evil empire of Japan in World War II. I served two tours of duty against the evil Communist regime in Viet Nam. Semper Fi?Very Proud Viet Nam Vet who along with President Richard M. Nixon saved our country from Communism. My son served a tour of duty in Iraq (decorated) and he was very proud of it?he became a man. In November, it is your Patriotic Duty to Vote for President George W. Bush and Jeb Bush in 2008. Don't listen to any of those atheist Kerry Demo-rats who don't believe in God or Jesus. God Bless America. Please select YES you agree with this review on the bottom. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor editing (or lack of it) ruins documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit it - I walked out on this film. Not because I'm a raving Bush supporter - I'm not! I walked out because after a very strong start, this film just degenerated into what I guess was supposed to be meaningful footage which I guess was to get us thinking. But it dribbled on endless and was so poorly edited that after about an hour, I didn't know where the documentary was going anymore, didn't know why I was watching it and how it could possibly end. It should have ended with the Corporal saying he would rather go to jail then go back to Iraq - and then he gave his reasons. And the film hung there for a precious second - I thought this is it... Let it go right here and AGH! No, Moore went on. After what felt like 15 minutes or more, I left. This was going no where.I felt (unlike many reviews I've read) that the film was much stronger in its portrayal of Bush and his family's connections and hopefully, opens the eyes of Americans to what many have seen overseas. Our press didn't stay as biased as long as it did in the US and it was soooooooo obvious what Bush and his administration were doing (except to politicians). I'm glad a lot of that came out (although how come the more 'powerful' countries like Australia and the UK weren't mentioned in his list of the "coalition of the willing???" I mean Mr Moore, we already know your film is biased, but you don't leave out vital facts like that!). I just hope Moore's message wasn't lost in the endlessly dribbling over Iraq. Maybe the other reviews were trying to be tacftul and say "if the Iraq bit had been edited as well as the first half, this one have been on scorching documentary that would have hit a home run with voters..." But if I was an American, I don't know if it would change my vote or not. Because I had to leave because Moore missed the right point to end his documentary.</fullReview>

I'm happy that the movie is no longer considered a documentary by the MPAA. In fact,most every part of this movie is filled with un-truths.

		<shortDescription>Infuriating And Provocative--In Short, An American Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without too much doubt, Michael Moore is the pre-eminent cinematic muckraker of our time--from 1989's ROGER AND ME to 2002's BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, the man from Flint, Michigan has put his money where his mouth is. And now, with FAHRENHEIT 9/11, he has outdone himself by leaps and bounds, provoking a firestorm of response, both pro and con, that I have not seen in quite some time.Done with savagely ironic narration by Moore himself, this is a chilling expose about the administration of George W. Bush, from the Florida debacle to the horrors of the 9/11 attacks and the rush to the war in Iraq and beyond. We all may have seen the mountain of footage that Moore has assembled for this film time and time again on our TV screens the last four years, but there's a lot more. We see the connections between the Bush family and Osama Bin-Laden; Dick Cheney's connections with Haliburton; the complicity of the mainstream media to go along with Bush; the passage of the so-called Patriot Act, which not a single member of either body of Congress even bothered to READ, much less object to. And even more, we see Moore and his crew try to get people in Congress to enlist their kids to go fight in a war that they force other kids from lower-income families to fight. Of the 535 members of the House, both the Senate and the Congress, only one has anyone in their immediate family serving over there in Iraq.Undoubtedly, there are those apologists who will slam Moore and his film as being totally unpatriotic and traitorous. But from the first few days after the 9/11 attacks to the release of this film, those same apologists in the news media--Rush Limbaugh; Ann Coulter; Sean Hannity, Chuck Scarborough, etc.--have bombarded us with their own right-wing, indeed borderline fascist, pro-war propaganda and have reduced words like "patriotism", "freedom", and "democracy" to punchlines. Of course, neither of these people has ever served in combat. Even if he is a left-wing propagandist, Moore and his film merely serve to balance the scales; and if it means that the far-right's apple cart turns over, then so be it. Moore is only doing what is his RIGHT to do, what our soldiers are supposedly DYING for--calling it like he sees it under the First Amendment, the same as Limbaugh and friends. And by asking the tough questions, probing without fear, and willing to make us look at ourselves without shame and realize why we are where we are now, Moore defines what it is to be an American and a patriot--someone who is willing to fight for common people.To me, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 joins a select group of politically-oriented films that deserve to be called masterpieces because they provoke discussion, debate, and thought. It was true with DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, and JFK, and it is true here. It is infuriating and provocative, and any film that manages to be those things should be seen at least once.</fullReview>

He's one of the smartest men on the planet. You have to be smart to be the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF America! They make you take IQ tests and stuff.Secondly, it lies about a bunch of stuff going on. Yes, some people were tortured, but Bush didn't do that. In fact, when he found out about it, he personally visited those who were tortured and apologized. He also punished the torturers. To top it all off, he gave the poor souls a bunch of free money.Also, he's really good with kids and loves people. He wouldn't do any of these things. How could someone so loving even think about conducting themselves in such a manner!Also, Moore just has a bunch of personal conflicts with Bush. 12 years ago Moore was mugging some poor guy in an alley and Bush saved the guy and turned Moore in. It really damaged his career, and he's been out to get Bush ever since.It just disgusts me how the media is totally controlled by complete liberals. I have no problem with liberals. What I do have a problem with is lying to push your political beliefs. It's just like the OJ trial.

		<fullReview>While Michael Moore can be very clever in his selections, editing, and juxtapositions, what results in "Fahrenheit 9/11" is not the startling sublimity of "Bowling for Columbine" or even the comedic pathos of "Roger and Me." Instead, F911 is nothing more than a shrill diatribe against the Bush administration. Leave aside the politics (which almost none do), judge the movie not as a Republican or a Democrat, but rather as film. Compare F911 to other such movies--"Triumph des Willens" comes to mind--compare it even to Moore's other films, and it comes up short, way short; so short that one is left with to think a sophomore (or sophomoric) film student had created it. Moore should step down from the Olympic heights his speech at the Oscars exalted him to and become, strange though it sounds, less passionate. He has lost his touch to make the really fine documentary; perhaps he could review a few of Leni Riefenstahl's films for inspiration. 6/10.</fullReview>

Anyone who believes these lies has to be stupid or an incompetent fool. I know our country needs big changes badly, but this movie stretched the truth so far that it was almost fictitious. For example: "Bush knew this one guy in the war where they skipped their medical exam together. When Bush wanted to start an oil business he got money from that one guy who is friends with the Bin Laden family. The Bin Laden family claims to have cut off all ties with Osama, but showed up at his son's wedding."Now come on. That is linking together everything that has nothing to do with anything. Wow, Bush is friends with someone who knows the Bin Ladens.Bottom line is anyone who believes the majority of this false propaganda needs a reality check.2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let the eagles soar, let the vultures circle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface my remarks with a disclaimer. To begin with, I am Canadian, not American; Christian, not Muslim. I am not a fan of George Bush, nor a supporter of the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. But, at the same time, I do not favor Islamic theocracies where the rights and freedoms of women, in particular, are severely restricted. (And, by the way, I am a man.)To be fair, I suppose I should add that I am not necessarily a fan of Michael Moore. I think he showed in "Roger and Me", and in "Bowling for Columbine" that he is less than objective and has an ax to grind.(Gus van Sant's "Elephant" covered the same territory as Moore's "Bowling for Columbine" -- but far more insightfully, and with sublime artistry. The difference between the two is that van Sant makes you think. Moore does your thinking for you.)To be sure, Moore skilfully -- I am tempted to say "craftily" -- marshals the evidence against Bush and his coterie of friends, and their complicity in the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, and the events that have happened since. I learned a lot I didn't know, though Moore also covers a lot of familiar ground as well. To this extent, Moore does an excellent job as a journalist.However, while Moore makes a convincing case that Bush is a liar and a manipulator of the truth and public opinion, as the old saying goes, "it takes one to know one". Moore also pulls the strings and pushes the hot buttons of the filmgoer's minds, hearts and guts. This is, in part, the nature of the beast -- that is, the purpose of film (or art, literature or music, for that matter). Yet such manipulation can also be taken to extremes.But where Moore fails most, in my opinion, is in his lack of restraint and consideration for the feelings of ordinary people caught in the Bush administration's web of deceit. I particularly felt that Moore showed shocking disregard for the grief and pain of Lisa Lipscomb, mother of U.S. soldier Michael Pedersen. I also think Moore did not need to show the desecration of burnt, charred corpses, a beheading (albeit from a distance), and the guts spilling out of an Iraqi child's wounded arm on screen.Finally, Moore shows scenes reminiscent of the torture and humiliation practiced at Abu Ghraib. Yet he seems to view those actions as the excusable doing of poor, working-class Americans dragooned into military service.At one point in the film, we see John Ashcroft giving a fairly credible rendition of the song "Let the Eagles Soar". (He actually looks like Mel Torme.)Moore's handling of the private grief of ordinary American citizens is, in my estimation, ghoulish enough to warrant the title of this review: "Let the vultures circle."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't watch this one-sided hackjob of a documentary. I suggest everyone track down a copy of 9-11: The Road of Tyranny by Alex Jones which is far more factual and better shot than Mike Moore's film. Don't be fooled, Mike is an establishment figure pretending to be an ordinary American. His film is a poor imitation of Road to Tyranny which shows actual on the record quotes from interviews, declassified government documents, and footage of government engaging in dishonest practices. Does Farenheit show any of this? The answer is no. It does get people to think a little bit, I'll give it that much. As for the 2004 election, I will take a quote from the coming Alien versus Predator film. Democrat of Republican..whomever wins we lose. Have a nice day. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a joke....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not only talking about this "documentary", I'm also talking about the people who actually feel that this movie made an impact on their lives. Give me a break. What really cracks me up is how Moore claims that Bush stole the election....Wait, correct me if I'm wrong...maybe if Al Gore (the genius who created the Internet) wasn't such a loser he could have carried his own damn state(TN)giving him the presidency. Now with Florida, it's not Bush's fault that these morons couldn't figure out how to use a ballot. This just shows you the type of people who vote democratic. I got to give Moore credit though; he knows how to make money off of stupid people. The people who take this movie seriously are the same ones who think that Clintons book, "My Lies"...oops I mean "My Life" is a literary masterpiece. The truth is Michael Moore hates America, this guy will never be happy. He hates the fact that we are the world Super power. These terrorists declared war on us, we are fighting back and rightfully so. If you think that Saddam had absolutely no connection at all with Al Queda at one point, you are lying to yourself. Moore, and the other liberals have no other issue to fight Bush on in this upcoming election, so they scare people into thinking that Bush is the second coming of Hitler.The sad thing is if you created a pill that could cure all the problems in the world, Moore would protest it because it would put him out of business. Please don't see this movie; this guy doesn't deserve the money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore is a 21st Century Muckraker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all of you who don't know what a muckraker is; a muckraker was person in the early 20th century that focused only on the negatives of society without looking at any of the positives. In his new film, Moore does just that, but without a focused plot or idea. He randomly ends his ideas on certain topics without giving a proper solution, or even offering an idea of what he was trying to accomplish. It is basically an excuse to try and bash Bush for two hours. I believe that Moore's first film, Bowling for Columbine, was very well put together, and he accomplishes something by getting K-Mart to stop selling bullets in their stores. However, in 9/11 he accomplishes nothing. This film will be loved in Europe for its anti-American attitude, but no self respecting American should appreciate this Euro-trash garbage.</fullReview>

Just like in Bowling for Columbine, careful editing and the addition and omission of key facts has been melded together and label a documentary. All of this wouldn't be so alarming if it wasn't pitched as NONFICTION!!! This is FICTION at its greatest, and I for one could care less if Moore makes this movie and "expresses" himself. But PLEASE PLEASE try to understand that this is movie magic and an artful deceit that is being fed to you!!!!! Know the facts!!!It would be pointless to counter the arguments made one by one, but please do some research and see if half the lies put on screen are true. For starters, as reported by the 9/11 commission it was former terrorism czar, Richard Clarke, who authorized the bin Laden family out of the states. And for peets sake, what was Bush supposed to do while reading to 3rd graders in the that FL school when someone whispers in his ear that a plane had crashed into the world trade center. Come on people use you head. This is FICTION, and there should be a big disclaimer at the bottom of every frame of the movie!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing about this movie is the title and the tagline. I'm a HUGE fan of Moore's work in film and television. However, I was bored watching this movie. Even if you are part of that &nbsp;I new it!&nbsp; crowd, the fact is this movie has too much chatter about stuff you already know about (the war was last year!). I think that might be the main problem with this movie. I learned stuff in Roger and Me and the way better Bowling for Columbine. But I actually feel I know more about the subject of Fahrenheit 911 than Moore does! This might explain why there are already so many posts to this site criticizing the film. Moore was trying to create controversy. On purpose. If he was trying to convince people to vote Democrat, I think he failed miserably. If you're going to make a one sided propaganda movie, make it about something people don't know about. Flint Michigan for example. Iraq? The Florida recount? Come on. Most people know, for example, that the coalition of the willing included the UK, Australia, Japan and Spain. Not just Iceland, Romania and the like as Moore implies. The US didn't go alone into Iraq. Granted, it wasn't &nbsp;the mother of all coalitions&nbsp; that the Secretary of Defence advertised. But Moore didn't need to bend the truth to make him look foolish. We all know painfully well what happened in Florida. I personally didn't need the reminder. This movie would have made a great 60 minute TV opinion piece on the Documentary Channel. Instead, it's stretched out to two hours and will have you looking at your watch. I recommend watching this movie when it comes out on TV. But only if you record it first so you can fast forward the boring parts.</fullReview>

He has even made up interviews with Fred Barnes taht he includes in one of his books.To learn about the lies and half-truths in this film, see the latest issue of newsweek, which debunks three of Moore's key points.I dont hate the man, he has a right to make these movies.

		<shortDescription>Moore Collapses On His Own Hatreds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has concocted a film whose intent is, in Moore's words, "to bring down a President." Moore's film - whose title has earned criticism from writer Ray Bradbury for its tacky parody of his famous story - is a typically labored and scattershot series of attacks on its subject - here President George W. Bush and the US war on Islamo-Arab terrorism. Moore tries to prove that Prewsident Bush was somehow culpable in Islamo-Arab attacks on the US in September 2001 because of the Bid Laden family's relation ship with the Bushes through the Carlyle Group. But this relationship is completely convoluted and once you sort through Moore's attack you find that the relationship was at most tangenital and utterly irrelevant to anything; it's somewhat like blaming Harvard for Pearl Harbor because Isoroku Yamamoto graduated from Harvard. Moore pushes this alleged Bush-Bin Laden connection by citing flights that took members of that family out of the US after September 2001, and only by his convoluted paranoia can Moore believe they are evidence that the US somehow staged attacks on its own soil. Moore (as is his want) leaves out facts that destroy his paranoia, namely that no respectable investigation has found any kind of sinister motive behind these flights.But as writer Christopher Hitchens has put it, a film that is based on a lie can only sustain itself by piling up smaller lies with ever-more contradictory claims. Moore balmes Bush for spending too much time on vacation before the 2001 attacks, but Moore's own footage shows these "vacations" were anything but - in one shot Bush is seen "vacationing" with Tony Blair, prime minister of Great Britain; such summitting is inherently serious work, not goofing off. More again uses his own paranoia as evidence of malicious motive by the Bush Administration.More goes beyond paranoia into outright propagandizing for the enemy with his grotesquely fawning view of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Moore wants us to believe Iraq never backed any terrorist force, let alone the 2001 attackers, never mind Hussein's own boasts about his backing of international terrorists including Al Qaida, never mind the written documentation unearthed in Iraq after his overthrow (consistently ignored in major media) showing Iraqi involvement with Al Qaida and other international terrorist groups. It continues with shots of Iraqi palaces and military bases under attack - Moore wants us to believe that these structures were civilian enclaves when they in fact were military and secret police bases. Iraq's 30-plus year record of slaughter, internal and international, is glosses over completely.Moore tries to have it every way that attacks the US and ultimately collapses on his own contradictions. Either Saudi Arabia runs US policy or it doesn't - here Moore never bothers to wonder why Saudi Areabia would want to overthrow a Taliban regime in Afghanistan to which the Saudi government had close ties; Moore also never wonders about how a democratic Iraq means an economic rival to Saudi Arabia's near-monopoly on Middle Eastern oil exports and yet Saudi Arabia backs, however imperfectly, US efforts toward that goal.It all means that Michael Moore has done it again - vented his spleen for no rational reason beyond anti-American bigotry. One has to wonder when people will grow tired of such, for Moore has taken the documentary and made it nothing but a vehicle woprthy of Leni Riefenstahl.</fullReview>

So engaging in anti-governmental propaganda as such in the time of today's turmoil is treason - treason of America - and anyone who watches or endorses this movie is a traitor of USA.

First of all, where is Michael Moore going with this? Most documentaries of this nature will propose a question and set out to determine answers, that being the filmmakers' purpose. I can't tell what direction Moore is trying to go with this, or what ground he is trying to break. It's like, yeah Bush isn't going to go down in history as the greatest president, everyone know's that. But here, Moore practically begs you to hate Bush. It is such obvious propaganda. And Moore's followers are blind to anything other than what he says. It's like he's some God that taught them how to think or something. This film made me lose respect for him. Like I said, I loved Bowling for Columbine. This on the other hand was sad, bland, and surprisingly boring. I honestly checked my watch like four times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despicable, Unconscionable, Deceptive, Brainwashing Propaganda...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** "Fahrenheit 9/11", a liberal propagandist machine masquerading as a "documentary", was beyond even my worst expectations, as I hadn't anticipated even Michael Moore to stoop so degradingly, intolerably low in his atrocious misrepresentation of President Bush and the American spirit. Take it from someone who regularly (O.K. constantly) watches the news and is perhaps the most politically conscious youth in American today, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is nothing more than a Bush, American, Capitalistic, and even Militaristic hate machine, determined to undermine our commander-in-chief, who has taken pains to serve and protect our country with dignity and strength, our mean and women serving courageously overseas for our freedom and security, and our very state of mind. This is a film whose single purpose is to unseek our president through deception, ridicule, and fallacy (just listen to The O'Reilly Factor or The Scarborough Country for evidence of Michael Moore's lies and manipulations which some of you believe is complete fact). Moore purports that Bush is a feeble, culpable leader who was uncertain and unprepared during the terrible attacks on 9/11 (Moore insists here that Bush was lethargic and void of response in his ridiculous example of Bush simply remaining calm for a mere seven minutes, when immediately thereafter, Bush commanded the scene and responded to the terrorist attacks brilliantly, even reassuring the American spirit that we will prevail and the terrorists will be brought to justice for their perpetrations). Additionally, Michael Moore insists that Bush has been futile, disastrous, and even avaricious in conducting a War on Terrorism. Perhaps the most atrocious part of the film focuses on a "futile, disastrous" Afghanistan campaign, resulting in very little but perhaps a worsened civility there. Absolute nonsense for anybody who has ever even bothered to listen to the news. Then, he ventures into the Iraq campaign, implying that "evil American imperialism" has devastated every Iraqi family and that life was "good and jolly" under the rule of Saddam Hussein and his brutal, murderous regime. Good one, Mike. Torture chambers, mass graves, mobile weapons facilities, restriction of worship, abolition of democracy.. Sounds like a happy place to live, doesn't it, folks? Now how would you believe such a conception would resonate with the men and women overseas who strove and succeeded in toppling the Taliban government, Saddam Hussein's Baath government and Republican Guard, and captured a vast majority of al Quaida operatives and its associates in the process? Michael Moore's reasoning of the War on Terror, transparently a war between good and evil, under absolute, unevidenced assumption: OIL. Both Bush's had intense ties to our alleged allies the Saudis, so proceeding 9/11, Bush's one and only objective was to somehow profit in the Middle Eastern oil industry. Such implications are outrageous, unevidenced, and completely detrimental to the actual agenda in the War on Terror: to defeat terrorists and their sponsors and avert another September 11 from ever occurring again. Furthermore, this liberal propaganda is about as one-sided as it gets. Take Michael Moore's interviewees: several congressmen: all Democrats (ZERO Republicans), and distressed, grieving mothers such as Linda Lipscumb and her upset son in the military (while neglecting to focus on proud, confident soldiers (as there are many) who are optimistic about their endeavors in Iraq and abroad and believe they are serving an ultimately wonderful purpose). Unfortunately in war, of course there will be casualties, and of course there will be opposition; this is nothing new, and it is the assassins who are to blame, not the President of the United States. These are the same terrorists who would stop at nothing to see as many American lives extinguished as possible, for they despise America. Additionally, Michael Moore only focuses on devastated Iraqi citizens proceeding the War in Iraq, while neglecting to concentrate on devastated, oppressed citizens during the reign of Saddam Hussein, or citizens who are eternally grateful for his absence. Moore neglects to even acknowledge the other side, as such would merely compromise his thesis: President Bush is to blame for everything wrong with this country and America is to blame for everything wrong in the world. Moore asserts that Bush has been a failure, from the grounds of the 2000 election to the War in Iraq, has merely tarnished the greatness of America, and has accomplished little or nothing since 9/11. I suppose people like Michael Moore do not see the truth as clearly as I do, and believe me, folks: "Fahrenheit 9/11" is NOT the truth. My conclusion of "Fahrenheit 9/11": sometimes daunting (in its own fallacy), sometimes pathetic (often resorting to ridiculing Bush and his administration when they are mostly unaware)and always atrocious (endeavoring to brainwash whatever ignorant or undecided voter in America into concurring with Michael Moore on subjects which should be examined objectively and factually. Michael Moore has assembled a propagandist machine which distorts and extrapolates the facts through tricky, deceiving editing, bullies Bush and his administration through mocking their reactions when they are unaware (as if Michael Moore would exhibit himself attractively in such a manner), and flat out lies about very critical subjects, such as the War on Terror, the 2000 election, and the spirit of the American people. I can only hope and pray that people are not as ignorant as Michael Moore would like to believes Americans are. Let me exit with some interesting, reverent Michael Moore patriotism, in quoting the man behind "Fahrenheit 9/11": "Americans are possibly the dumbest people on the planet. We don't know anything that's happening outside our country. Our stupidity is embarrassing..." Well, I certainly know what's happening inside and outside of America, and as a first-time voter, I'll make up my own mind this November, Michael Moore.Zero Stars out of Four</fullReview>

The movie is based on assumptions and little fact, he talks about Bush's links to the Bin Laden family, links that are very slight and has no proof that his assumptions are correct. My main problem with this movie is that it sets out to entertain rather than inform like a good documentary should. I pity any American who lets this movie sway their vote in the forthcoming elections, but any person with any sense would not vote democrat just because of this movie.

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore hates America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fahrenheit 9/11" is a propaganda film. It is not a documentary as it is not an impartial documentation of facts. It is a deceitful and vicious attack on the United States of America. Michael Moore has a long and public record of hating America. He frequently travels abroad and makes statements callings the U.S. an `evil empire' and the American people `ignorant' and `stupid'. This hatred is reflected throughout "Fahrenheit 9/11" as it is filled with distorted facts and lies.The film begins with the 2000 U.S. presidential elections and Moore repeats the falsehood that President Bush `stole' the election despite the fact it has been proven again and again that President Bush always won the majority of votes in Florida. The only efforts to stop votes from being counted actually came from Al Gore who tried to exclude votes from overseas U.S. military personnel. Michael Moore of course, ignores this inconvenient fact. Moore takes cheap-shots at people as well. For example, when people appear on television it is common practice that they put on make-up or otherwise get prepared so they can look their best. But Moore shows footage of Bush administration officials doing this as if it was something sinister.With regard to the war in Iraq, More portrays American soldiers as bloodthirsty killers and implies that U.S. troops intentionally kill innocent men, women and children. Moore does not mention that Saddam Hussein murdered as many as one million people during his brutal rule or that the terrorists in Iraq currently blow up car bombs on Iraqi streets filled with people or cut off the heads of their victims. Moore also promotes the lie that President Bush is a pawn of the Saudi Arabian government. Moore shows a former associate of Bush named James Bath who had become the money manager for the bin Laden family, saying, "James Bath himself in turn invested in George W. Bush." The implication is that Bath invested the bin Laden family's money in Bush's failed energy company, Arbusto. He doesn't mention that Bath has said that he had invested his own money, not the bin Ladens', in Bush's company.The bin Laden family was quickly shuttled away after 9/11, back to Saudi Arabia. Moore finds it suspicious, which is fine. But is was Richard Clarke, Bush's former counterterrorism adviser and holdover from the Clinton administration (and the new patron saint of Bush-bashers.)who allowed their departure. What is especially deplorable about "Fahrenheit 9/11" is that it was deliberately made and released while America is waging war against terrorists who are given aid and comfort by the likes of Michael Moore. People like him want President Bush out of the White House so badly they are willing to see America lose the war against terrorism if that's what it takes. During World War II, Hollywood supported America and the cause of freedom. It is truly shame that Hollywood today cannot live up to that honorable history. Moore's books and films have always played fast and loose with the truth, but "Fahrenheit 9/11" is the most reprehensible piece of anti-America propaganda so far from this man. He has not a kind word for the nation that has given him the freedom and opportunity to be rich and famous.Michael Moore hates America and that's what "Fahrenheit 9/11" is really about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore, who is sometimes referred to as, "Flint's favorite son," is actually quite despised in his hometown &amp; throughout Michigan if for nothing else, the fact he still gets extortion money from the Flint unions from his communist newspaper days in the 70s.This "guy for the people," who rides around on the Time Warner plane on his book tour saying he's just like us &amp; is looking out for us, is really nothing more than a fatter &amp; even less attractive Barbara Streisand elitist who to his credit, does inspire wonderful &amp; necessary debates between the wings. He also gets both sides together to agree that he is a total pri*k. Now for his resume...First of all, Roger &amp; Me was a fantastic film! Very well done &amp; very well deserved. Canadian Bacon, while boring for the most part, is fun &amp; John Candy is sorely missed. To disappoint my fellow pro-gun chums, this film is not so much anti-gun as it is anti-media. For that part, this film wasn't bad at all. The bank &amp; the gun fiasco was total nonsense. That bank does not do that for real, &amp; if it did, you'd have to wait a week just like everyone else. Moore made it more anti-NRA than anti-gun, which some would say are interchangeable but you can distinguish. This film, where do I start? First of all, this film is necessary in that it reminds us of what we went thru that terrible day. Most Americans love to sweep all "bad things" under the carpet &amp; get on with our lives. We are a nation of passive/aggressives that are mad as hell &amp; hungry for blood after 9/11 wanting to get all the bad guys (including Saddam) until we talk about actually getting Saddam &amp; then we suddenly want peace. Another example is films that quickly deleted the towers from appearing in them &amp; then a brief movement to delete them from all films so we could pretend they never existed. I applaud Moore for not showing us the towers as they burn &amp; fall &amp; simply gives us a blackened screen with the sound of a plane crash. Thank you for that. I think everyone got tired of seeing them collapse. But the film slowly diverts &amp; then the focus turns to Iraq &amp; then we get yet another anti-war, anti-Bush, anti-Bush's colleagues flick. The big misnomer in this flick is a snippet of Bush &amp; his dad playing golf, supposedly right after 9/11 &amp; Bush making a remark or two on Al Qaeda before carrying on with his golf game. First off, that interview/golf trip was in August 2002, &amp; second, Bush was remarking about a recent terrorist attack on Israel by Palestinians. There are various other pieces of media snippets &amp; such that are mis-dated or misleading in one way or another.The overall gist of the film however is in fact very necessary. Moore himself states that the intent is really more to inspire debate than to convince you that he is all knowing &amp; right. If that IS in fact what he intends then he is successful. However, Moore's demeanor during his booktour says to me that he seems to believe himself to be a leftist version of Bill O' Reilly. Both of these guys are just as megalomaniacal as our President so they can all just kiss my a**. Although, O'Reilly's "Those Who Trespass," is awesome so we can keep him. Can we simply push the rest out of a plane? Can we?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i don't like this movie at all i think its nothing but a way to get at bush its evident that he doesn't like him and does not want bush to win in November and the bad thing about this movie is he only portrays the bad things about 9/11 nothing about the good things that have come of it or that bush has good intentions. they might not always turn out the best but he cant control the turn out he can only control just as any of us are that way. I think the movie is not worth seeing unless you want to see a bunch of lies from someone who is determined to make bush look like the bad guy and make sure he doesn't get reelected. it seems us Americans cant be happy with anything. we were mad at Clinton for all the people he had killed and hushed to protect himself and the sex scandals and then we elect bush and then we get mad at the things he does because mostly the media and movies like this make him look bad they don't look at the good side or anything its like we are living in Germany during wwII or something. here is a good letter that should help you decide who is lying. This is a letter from Ray Reynolds, a medic in the Iowa Army National Guard, serving in Iraq:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I head off to Baghdad for the final weeks of my stay in Iraq, I wanted to say thanks to all of you who did not believe the media. They have done a very poor job of covering everything that has happened. &nbsp;I am sorry that I have not been able to visit all of you during my two week leave back home. &nbsp;And just so you can rest at night knowing something is happening in Iraq that is noteworthy, I thought I would pass this on to you. &nbsp; This is the list of things that has happened in Iraq recently: (Please share it with your friends and compare it to the version that your paper is producing.)* Over 400,000 kids have up-to-date immunizations. * School attendance is up 80% from levels before the war. * Over 1,500 schools have been renovated and rid of the weapons stored there so education can occur. * The port of Uhm Qasar was renovated so grain can be off-loaded from ships faster. * The country had its first 2 billion barrel export of oil in August. * Over 4.5 million people have clean drinking water for the first time ever in Iraq. * The country now receives 2 times the electrical power it did before the war. * 100% of the hospitals are open and fully staffed, compared to 35% before the war. * Elections are taking place in every major city, and city councils are in place. * Sewer and water lines are installed in every major city. * Over 60,000 police are patrolling the streets. * Over 100,000 Iraqi civil defense police are securing the country. * Over 80,000 Iraqi soldiers are patrolling the streets side by side with US soldiers. * Over 400,000 people have telephones for the first time ever. * Students are taught field sanitation and hand washing techniques to prevent the spread of germs. * An interim constitution has been signed. * Girls are allowed to attend school. * Textbooks that don't mention Saddam are in the schools for the first time in 30 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't believe for one second that these people do not want us there. I have met many, many people from Iraq that want us there, and in a bad way. They say they will never see the freedoms we talk about but they hope their children will. &nbsp;We are doing a good job in Iraq and I challenge anyone, anywhere to dispute me on these facts. &nbsp;So If you happen to run into John Kerry, be sure to give him my email address and send him to Denison, Iowa. This soldier will set him straight. If you are like me and very disgusted with how this period of rebuilding has been portrayed, email this to a friend and let them know there are good things happening.Ray Reynolds, SFC Iowa Army National Guard 234th Sign! al Battalion</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That this film awakens such nasty passions among its opponents already bespeaks its success as a piece of film-making. And what its opponents fail to realize is that the reason for this is that, although it makes no attempt to deny the propagandistic goal of the film, it is the images and brief interviews that evoke these passions, not what Moore has to say of them.Although certainly a political film, this film is not a lie, it is not built on lies. Despite the efforts of the now solidly right-wing media to bury it, the evidence against Bush and Cheney is there, much of it (what has not been suppressed) is public record.No matter how you spin it, when Bush first heard of the attack on the Twin Towers, he sat there reading a kid's book; he had no response to make - public record.No matter how you spin it, his first response to 911 was to have the Bin Laden family (to whom he owes several million dollars - public record) safely removed from Florida - public record.And no matter how you spin it, the Iranian government offered to assist the US in putting an end to Al Quaeda, and the Bush response was to declare Iran part of some nebulous "axis of evil" - public record.And no matter how you spin it, Bush warned us of WMD in Iraq that didn't exist (and he knew it - public record) and Iraqi involvement in Al Quaeda which he knew to be false - public record.Do the research yourself. Moore's commentary is satiric, even, sarcastic, but the facts are - public record.Georege Bush needs to be tried for treason and killed - legally, of course, as all; traitors are.He is not legally the president of the US, I'm sorry; he's a criminal. He must be impeached, arrested, tried, convicted, sentenced, and hung.In public, like Saddam Hussein.A few months ago, the Homeland Security Department (aka Gestapo) tried having people arrested for saying that in public; well, they can kiss my behind - I thrust my mighty American sphincter in their direction and let loose - thus is my right as a citizen of the US - AS GUARANTEED IN THE BILL OF RIGHTS OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.Impeach Bush - US out of Iraq NOW!

		<fullReview>I thought from all the hype this movie would be more entertaining. It was slower &amp; duller than an insurance seminar. Beyond that, it was nothing but leftist propaganda released by the usual Hollywood mafia. I thought it would be much more comical, but because of the slow pace it was more dull than anything else. Morally speaking this movie showed many deceitful scenes which were later proved to be so. My personal favorite was the wounded soldier who was made to be a victim but when later interviewed he said Moore didn't show the truth, the fact that he was extremely proud of his service and would do it all again. Thanks Michael Moore for taking an hour &amp; a half of my life i'll never get back</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore: Please stop making movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9-11 is a good movie. Not what you would expect after reading the on line summary. However, I will not pay to see it. Or rent it. Not one dollar of mine will go to Michael Moore. I'm a liberal. Much more than Michael Moore. But what people don't seem to realize is that Michael Moore exploits people's suffering for his own greed, and even worse pretends what he does is heroic.Fahrenheit 9-11 spends much of the movie explaining George W. Bush's links to the Saudis, and the Bin Ladens. The connections are many and exaggerated. But the point is made: Bush has Terrorist ties.It also goes into the Patriot Act, the war on Iraq, and other major points of focus. All things that John Kerry supports but never mind that Moore supports him anyway. It seems that Mr. Moore is unable to keep up with the debates. Now, back to the movie.The humor of this movie was pure genius. And musical. Yes, one can't help but love hearing George W. Bush's name being said to Eric Clapton's Cocaine. Or the Bin Ladens being flown out of the country to the theme "I gotta get out of this place." And how Vacation is all George Bush ever wanted.There is much debate over the credibility of the film. However, how could Michael Moore have made everything up when those who watch the news knew everything anyway? Is Michael Moore in charge of the BBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, and Fox News? Surely your not telling me he writes the Chicago Tribune!This movie flows like one long rant, getting on and off issues like a channel surfer with ADHD. Compare to a young liberal's live journal, or anti bush 'blog.' Right now there are three better anti bush documentaries out: Uncovered, Unconstitutional, and Outfoxed. More professional, too. Watch these befoer you watch Farenheit 9-11. ***/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was excited to see this movie and was curious exactly what all the hub-bub was about. But it was very boring. I actually got up and left the couch a number of times while watching it because there is not much to keep you riveted unless you are filled with hate and anger. I now realize that anything that portrays Bush in a bad light is going to get lots of hub-bub for just that and that only. There is nothing in this movie that makes me believe that Bush is a bad person despite the desperate ploys of goofy Moore. If you hate Bush then this will reinforce your feelings of hatred, but if you are indifferent to Bush you will probably find this movie extremely boring. Bowling for Columbine was more compelling and interesting than this cut and paste movie that is filled with a desperate need for hatred by the have-nots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a movie not a documentary. I would recommend people who are not aware of the issues out there to see this, so that they maybe caught up, but I would ask for whoever sees it to actually use some intelligence while viewing it and see that it is complete propaganda. This movie will show you exactly Michael Moore's opinion on the political topics today with no room for interpretation, or even statistical facts to prove them. In fact some of the "views" were being doctored and that is why people are complaining since Moore doctored their stuff without permission, such as newspapers. I believe that this movie did not really establish anything new or open any eyes to anything that is not in the news. I believe that the only purpose this movie serves is to help fire people up more who are already fired up about the situations they already know about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smells like a political ad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a talented film maker, and his previous works attest to this. Unfortunately, this film is little more than an attack of George W. Bush. It smacks of paid political ad, but of course, you pay to see it. I know there are many who thought it was wonderful, eye-opening, and informative. But I am not one of them. First, and foremost, it isn't entertaining! Politics aside, Mister Moore has always made movies that were fun to watch, not so this outing. Secondly, it's painfully obvious that he hasn't the slightest interest in showing both sides of any issues. And, finally, his "facts" don't seem to jive with observed reality. That last point is why I thought this movie stunk. If you are trying to be informative, rather than entertaining, at least get your facts straight!For those people who despise George W. this movie will be a must see. For everyone else, I'd say save your money, Mike doesn't need it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Moore is a greedy, opportunistic traitor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These are not my words. But they share my feelings on this tripe of a film:'From Here to Eternity." "Tora, Tora, Tora." "In Harm's Way." These are three films made about Pearl Harbor. There have been more than 20 films made about Pearl Harbor, and over 200 films made about World War II.These films inspire patriotism, courage, and nationalism. They tell us about the honor and bravery of the soldiers and the nation that supported them. Two and a half years after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the world watched American forces fight on D-Day. Two and a half years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the world is watching Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11."Moore's film is the first major motion picture about Sept. 11, 2001. This bears repeating. When future generations look back on the Sept. 11 massacre, their first impression, through the medium of film, will be a work in which the president and the government are blamed for the attacks, and the soldiers who are protecting this country are defamed.Instead of a film version of Lisa Beamer's book, "Let's Roll," or Richard Picciotto's "Last Man Down," we are presented with this fallacy. How could this happen?It would be a colossal insult to insinuate that Franklin D. Roosevelt or the U.S. government were in any way responsible for the attacks on Pearl Harbor. Can you imagine the indignation of the men and women who lived during that period? "Fahrenheit 9/11" is indicative of a nation that has become too apathetic, ignorant or deceived to face the enemy at the gate. America, where is your fury?On Sept. 11, 2001, I stood across the Hudson River, watching the Twin Towers burn, knowing that if the plane had struck at 9:46 a.m. instead of 8:46 a.m., I would be dead. As a survivor and witness to the attack on the World Trade Center, I am more than insulted by this film. I am outraged. This film is based on conjecture, hearsay and propaganda. At a time when this country desperately needs to rally in support of our brave soldiers and our strong leaders, Moore is content to spread discord and divisiveness. The base of his argument is that the Bush administration had strong ties with the bin Laden family. However, sound facts are conspicuously absent from this "documentary."The 9/11 commission did not indict President Bush. According to the report, the president's actions before, during and after the attacks are fully justified, including the military action in Iraq. The commission did not find a direct link between Saddam Hussein's Iraq and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. A similar commission in the 1940s would not have found a direct link between Hitler's Germany and the attack on Pearl Harbor.In both instances, the threat was imminent; the president and the military acted decisively. Could we have been more prepared for a terrorist attack on Sept. 10, 2001? Certainly. Could we have been more prepared for an attack on Dec. 6, 1941? Most definitely. In the weeks and months following Pearl Harbor, there were reports and criticisms that the government and military should have been more prepared. The difference is that the people of the nation did not waste a lot of time pointing fingers at each other. Rather, they unified and engaged the enemy head-on. I guess that is why we call them "The Greatest Generation." How will future generations refer to us? So, how do we explain Moore's film to future generations? I wonder. More than that, I wonder how I would explain this film to Nancy D., Jerome N. or Heather H. I am sure you don't know their names, but their faces haunt me day and night. How would I explain to them that a film was made accusing the president and vilifying the soldiers, the same president and soldiers who are attempting to avenge their murders and protect other citizens. Moore has not only insulted the nation, he has insulted the victims of the terrorist attacks.During his acceptance speech at the Oscars, Moore said, "Shame on you, Mr. Bush. "Well I say, "Shame on you, Michael Moore." Shame on everyone who supports his travesty of a film. Shame on a society that allows this sham of a film. You have weakened the nation.</fullReview>

Of course the communist and socialist parties consist of social misfits and o collection of misinformed, illogical, and angry thinking people.The once proud and great democratic party of roosevelt has been used as stomping gound for these socialist thinking people. They have hijacked the party of the poor and working class for fringe elements. Now there is not much of a choice but at least Bush is not socialist.

		<shortDescription>OK, it's liberal, but does anybody realize that's the only reason to like this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start of by stating that I am quite liberal. I am only stating this because people are going to attack my statements by just claiming that I am a conservative idiot. I know there are some good issues raised in this film, but it is serious a very poorly put together film. Michael Moore doesn't ever put out a thesis at the beginning of the documentary by which to follow, and this is the film's downfall. It skips around from point to point, but rarely if ever are the points he raises in the film ever resolved. As a prime example of Moore bringing to light another tangent that has no relevance whatsoever to terrorism, Moore proceeds to show more damn footage about Flint Michigan. I'm sorry but WTF, not everything has to do with Flint and how poor the people are. I'm pretty sure Michael Moore is from Flint Michigan, and I'm also pretty sure that Michael Moore is a fine example of how someone from Flint Michigan can make a large amount of money.At one point Michael makes fun of American soldiers by showing them as bloodthirsty fools, and then he tries to make you feel bad that they are dieing. I suppose all of the Bush footage is humorous, but I've watched the Daily Show before, and thus little of it is actually new. Also, I know Bush is an fool, but with enough editing and being around cameras, almost anyone is going to make themselves look incompetent. I really do question if this film has any lasting relevance. The hardcore liberals, who are going to the movie just because it's liberal, aren't really going to learn anything they don't already know. The hardcore conservatives are going to go to the movie just so they can condemn it. The rest of the middle are either going to dislike it because they hate Michael Moore, or not have their opinion changed because it so extremely to the left. I don't really think that Bowling For Columbine was that good of a movie, but it was definitely better than Fahrenheit 911. At least it stays on track most of the time, and seems to have a conclusion (as shitty as of a conclusion as it may be). If you want to see a good Michael Moore documentary, watch Roger &amp; Me, otherwise you are just wasting your money to say that you more liberal than your friends.</fullReview>

It is clear that Hollywood is so wrapped up in politics they don't even care about good cinema anymore. That is a shame. In the end I think this will end up hurting John Kerry. Mr. Kerry is desperately trying to get his message out, but he is constantly getting upstaged by the Clintons, Al Gore, Hollywood, and now Michael Moore.Is anyone listening to John Kerry?

		<shortDescription>Moore Movie Serves No Useful Purpose, inspires Anarchy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While we all may have our opinions of President Bush and Michael Moore and democrats and republicans etc., one thing that remains constant is that Fahrenheit 9/11 will not change anybody's mind on any of those topics. The movie is so aggressive that any mediocre republican will be offended while the casual democrat will cheer Moore on and clap their hands after a theatre showing. Thus my experience having seen the movie with a group of friends. But what's even more important here is that the intention of this movie is to inform Americans AND (in addition) change the voter turn-out, maybe even launch Bush out of office. It seems to me objectivity would have been the answer, but it is nowhere to be found. The movie isn't about theatre goers (Americans) critically thinking about their views it's about affirming or negating Michael Moore's view - because of this approach, the film serves no useful purpose. (Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn't even offer a single indication of a solution. Getting Bush out of office doesn't fix the proposed problems, does it?) It does not inspire individual reflection in most cases, especially among the younger crowd. However, one of the main points Americans seem to agree upon is the movie's effective portrayal of an entire government full of corruption. While the movie fails, in it's lack of objectivity, to point out all the little faults that are wrong with democrats, or even one democrat, (but really picking at republicans), viewers can still deduce that there is no hope for honest government. We can all be assured that financial interests will be maintained at any cost, in any place around the world. In fact Moore's film assures us of what Machiavelli's structural functionalist views assumed 600 years ago - that men can be evil, people are ruled through fear, and war is inevitable and often necessary. With a corrupt government that thrives on financial interests (often latched onto investors from around the World ... other countries monies), hundreds of soldiers dying for a cause that is less than satisfactory, and a desensitized, apathetic population, anarchy starts to sound very appealing.Thank you Michael Moore for sharing pessimism, sarcasm, and existentialism with us, we are all much happier as we look towards our futures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfectly suited for gullible audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an era of moral equivalences, ad hominems, and relativisms, truth has taken a back seat to name-calling, whining, and false accusations; Michael Moore has mastered has mastered all three techniques. He has mastered them so well, in fact, that he is accumulating a huge profit by espousing half-truths and promoting himself in the process.Moore understands that people are stupid. Those who hate Bush already would be amused by a movie that pokes fun at Bush in any way, regardless of whether or not the content is fair or even true. As he proved in Bowling for Columbine, it doesn't matter whether or not he tells the truth; people will love what he says as long as it agrees with what they already believe. Given the fact that there are actually a few "elements of truth" in Fahrenheit 9/11, it's no wonder that the response by liberal critics has been so ejaculatory.And truth, really, is what it boils down to--not one-sidedness or bias, as some critics would have you believe. One of Moore's favorite tactics: not telling the whole story. It allows him to deceive without actually lying. (For example, Moore says that the Taliban visited Texas to discuss a possible Unocal pipeline deal; what he doesn't tell you is that the deal failed in 1998 and had been supported previously by the Clinton administration.)Let's suppose, for the sake of argument, that Moore is telling us the truth throughout the film. Even in this case, there is a huge, insurmountable problem: Moore offers no solutions. Fahrenheit 9/11 is simply a character assassination--nothing more, nothing less. Even when asked in a recent interview whether or not Americans should vote for Kerry, Moore was hesitant; he isn't happy with anybody or anything, and likely never will be. Without solutions, persuasion is impossible.Moore's apparent thesis--that Bush and his cronies are bent on world domination--is laughably absurd. Fahrenheit 9/11 is essentially a long string of insane conspiracy theories babbled by a lunatic you'd normally expect to see somewhere in a Manhattan subway clinging to a sign with a warning about an impending apocalyptic nightmare. The only people who can truly appreciate a movie like this are those who are most susceptible believe lies, distortions, and inaccuracies--that is, the gullible. Don't become one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>movie based on nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I respect the freedom to express your opinion. That is why I'm writing this. While that freedom is essential in America, your opinion should be based on facts. This movie is based on one man's prejudice. The movie follows rumors that have drifted around the country ever since the war began. No factual evidence has been found to support the rumors about "our horrible president" that are portrayed in this "film." The war was necessary, whether Americans want to admit it or not. Without it, the Saddam regime would have grown in power until the violence was brought to our own country. Had that happened, Moore wouldn't have been able to make his little movie expressing his biased opinions. Freedom isn't free. You can criticize the gov't all you want, but don't you think it should be based on something real and true instead of Hollywood gossip? It's sad that so many will be misled by this film. If you haven't seen it yet, I would suggest knowing your facts before you watch it and then come to your own conclusions. Hate the president if you want, but don't base your hate on something that isn't true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this movie was not built on all out lies and one man's opinion, It might be a decent film. I'm not Democrat or Republican. I'm just a TRUE American and while I'm glad that Mr. Moore has the right to express his thoughts freely, he should do it factually if he is going to present it as fact. Otherwise he should have made it more opinionative, because that is what it is. His view and his opinion are presented as if they are 100 percent factual. "SHAME ON YOU MR. MOORE!" But, As it is, this movie is nothing more than lies and half-truths. Do your homework before seeing this (Like Moore should have before filming it)and you will agree! Don't waste $7.50 on this film. Wait for it to come on HBO or Showtime!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for the naive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so obviously propaganda; it amazes me that so many people are taking it as gospel. How can anyone think that this trash is a factual documentary? I suspect that the rule of unintended consequences will take effect here and the film will actually cause some sympathy for George Bush. It may even help swing some votes his way. Those showering the movie with glowing praise and unmitigated support have either not seen it or are unbelievably na?ve. Along with calling Bush childish names, they accept as facts things like Moore's contention that Bin Laden's relatives were allowed to leave the country when no aircraft were flying and without being checked by the FBI, both false. I guess my biggest problem with the film is that it doesn't really contribute anything meaningful to the discussion the country is having on Iraq, the coming election or the war on terrorism. Mr. Moore, all you've done is waste everyone's time with your diatribe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since Michael Moore cares about the victims of 9/11 and our Armed Forces, I'm sure he will donate all of his profits from this film to the families of 9/11 and our Armed Forces.Yeah Right. It's all about the money for Michael Moore...nothing else.This anti-American tripe ought not to be shown because it's not a documentary. A documentary is journalism. A documentary is a presentation of facts. This is not. This is a propaganda film. It has nothing to do with journalism. It's filled with things that are untruth. Moore has made up an interview that he had with Fred Barnes of The Weekly Standard and the Fox News Channel. Barnes says, "I never talked to him and in this movie he says I did. I never talked to Michael Moore." He makes up a lot of things. In Bowling For Columbine he staged an incident, there's a bank in Traverse City in Michigan where if you went in and make a certain size deposit they'd give you a rifle. It never happened. And he dramatized the scene to make it look like it was for real because Bowling for Columbine is a pro-gun control piece of propaganda, not a documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitler's "Triumph of the Will" was also well made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it a good film? Well, as a piece of work, yeah it is a good film. But so was Hitler's "Triumph of the Will". Like Moore, Hitler's filmmakers utilized editing and completely skewed reality presented as fact to make it's points. A great piece of film, but every much as bit a 'documentary as Moore's.These points sort of make my point...You certainly don't have to be a fan of Bush or his policies to be offended by 'Fahrenheit 9/11' lies, half-lies and distortions, or by Moore's shockingly low expectations of his audience: ? Moore's favorite anti-administration interviewee is former National Security Council aide Richard Clarke. Yet the film never mentions that it was Clarke who gave the order to spirit the bin Laden family out of America immediately after 9/ 11. Moore makes much of this mystery; why didn't he ask Clarke about it ?? At one point of the film, he portrays GIs as moronic savages who work themselves up with music before setting out to kill. Later, he depicts them as proletarian victims of a cynical ruling class, who deserve sympathy and honor for their sacrifice. ? The film's amusing (if bordering on racist) Saudi-bashing sequences rely for their effect on the audience having forgotten that President Bill Clinton was every bit as friendly with Prince Bandar (or 'Bandar Bush,' as Moore calls him) and the Saudi monarchy as his successor. In general, the movie is packed with points that Moore assumes his audience will never check, or are either lies or cleverly hedged half-lies: ? Moore says that the Saudis have paid the Bush family $1.4 billion. But wait - the Bushes aren't billionaires. If you watch the film a second time you'll note Moore saying that they paid $1.4 billion to the Bush family and (added very quietly and quickly) its friends and associates. ? Moore asserts that the Afghan war was fought only to enable the Unocal company to build a pipeline. In fact, Unocal dropped that idea back in August 1998. Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan are looking at the idea now, but nothing has come of it so far, and in any case Unocal has nothing to do with it. ? In a 'congressmen with no kids at war' stunt, Moore claims that no one in Congress has a son or daughter fighting in America's armed services, then approaches several congressmen in the street and asks them to sign up and send their kids to Iraq. His claim would certainly surprise Sgt. Brooks Johnson of the 101st Airborne, the son of Sen. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.). And for that matter the active-duty sons of Sen. Joseph Biden and Attorney General John Ashcroft, among others.</fullReview>

Why don't we just start all sorts of propaganda. We might as well promote smoking, drug usage and murder, since those are not any more extreme than Moore's views about president Bush.

If you ask anyone who was there, (and I speak to returning soldiers and sailors daily) you will find that 90% totally disagree with Mr. Moores movie and dismiss it as left wing propaganda. The truth is Mr. Moore so hates any conservative thought, he edits his film to suit the left wing agenda. He is currently being sued by several of the people that he has in the movie, for editing their footage to suit his ideals. The sad thing is, that the politically ignorant people, those who choose to believe the bias of the liberal press and movies such as this one, will continue to chant the left's catch-phrases and ideas, without any alternative ideas as to the solutions of the problems that face us now. It's too bad that people see this as a documentary, instead of the entertainment, fiction that it actually is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A total failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11....where do I start at? Probably at the need for such a movie. Does the current situation in the government need questioning? Of course it does. With as many fundamental changes in the past four years (Not only 9/11 but the Department of Homeland Security and the Patriot Act) an assessment is needed. Are we winning in the war on terror? Is this the way our country should be going? What really is happening beyond the nightly news? The trouble is an assessment would be just that, and it would also require objectivity, such as seeing President Bush as being something other than Satan, and critiquing the intelligence and diplomatic failures of Clinton, Reagan, and further on back. I have no doubt in fifty or a hundred years the events of this time will be seen in a completely different light than now.And is F9/11 that needed assessment? Not in any way shape or form. An intelligent and thoughtful movie could have been constructed around the Patriot Act alone, which would also have been boring and required the audience to think.F9/11 is little more than a Bush/Right Wing basher's dream movie, and Michael Moore goes beyond trying to make any sort of documentary into the realm of bringing every conspiracy theory of the past thirty years to life. In the world he presents, there is NO terrorist threat, everything is an Orwellian conspiracy to make phony wars for money, and Bush/Halliburton/Cheney are somehow behind it all.Much of the movie has been debunked on web sites and talk shows, yet what really bothered me is many fans of this movie realized it was full of distortions and falsehoods, yet accepted it anyways. Like the debacle with CBS and the National Guard memos, the evidence may be false but the message is true.Three things really stood out in my mind and bothered me about this movie. The first was arguably is the movie's main talking point, about how the Bin Laden family was allegedly moved out of the US before the airspace had opened after 9/11. (Again debunked, but play along.) With his usual snideness Moore says that one of the first people to talk to after someone commits a crime is the family. But he ignores two key points: 1. The Bin Laden family is huge, Mohammed Bin Laden had over twenty children, and many of them have not seen Osama Bin Laden since 1981.2. Nowhere has Michael Moore or any left wing conspiracy theorist come up with proof or evidence that any of the people on those planes did know something, or could provide any sort of intelligence.Indeed, the better people to talk to would have been Osama's associates since he's been playing revolutionary for two decades in places like Afghanistan and Sudan, not hobnobbing with his family. However, for Moore and his audience, simply raising the allegation is good enough.The second thing that bothered me is when Moore goes traipsing around to several congressman trying to get them to sign up their children to join the military. Completely forgotten is that to join the military a person must be 18 and therefore an adult, the parents legally CAN'T sign their own children up. Did this somehow escape Moore's vaunted three-tier fact-checking system? The last thing is the now infamous scenes of a Iraq before the war started. Moore can say whatever he wants, but the impression put on people in the theater, and on me, was that he was saying Iraq was a peaceful and happy place we just started bombing. We get a vague showing of Rumsfeld next to Saddam and the implication of more military industrial conspiracies as we supported Saddam in the eighties, but that's about it. Not mentioned is our relation to Iran at that time and the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-1988. Or the First Gulf War. Or the Kurdish rebellion. Or of Saddam's role as a torturer at the Palace of the End. There was plenty of blame to go around for everyone.I fully believe Moore knew much of his movie was bogus, and instead intended it to play into what the audience wanted to hear. Certainly a lot of gullible people were buying it up when it came out. The Democrats and the thinking Left didn't outrightly endorse the movie, but instead were more than glad to let it ride as long as it was helping them out.And therein lies the ultimate failure of Moore's "opinion piece" documentary. Judging from some of the remarks he was posting on his website last summer, he seemed surprised that the movie ran it's course and left the theaters. I really think he was expecting F9/11 to spark a revolution. But the only people who bought the message were already converted. A movie such as this, so blatantly out to destroy Bush, if anything had a backlash. Many people, including me, were motivated to go out and vote against Kerry. This cost the Democrats a lot of power, and I think Moore lost a good portion of his clout.Indeed, I believe this movie will be the high water mark of his career. Too many people now know his style and approach, and aren't willing to be featured in his movies. And I don't think anybody at this point is still believing his "common man with a camera" image. In ten years, I really think nobody will even know who Michael Moore is. Or was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>His Most Unimportant Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One has to maintain an open mind when watching this. I still haven't decided what category to place it in. It clearly is not a documentary, and it clearly isn't based on true facts, so I'll just take it as a political advertisement, and a poor one at that. It reminds me of an amateur filmmaker who is struggling to tie everything together. The editing of news clips to arrive at a predetermined conclusion was extraordinary. Not very professionally done but extraordinary none-the-less. The subject of the film is a moot point since it is a work of fiction based upon fabrications. The points Moore attempts to make have been proved false and most were known to be false before the film was released. I realize those in the blue states view this as the most important film of our time, but to say it must be viewed with an open mind is to shut out the truth which is what Moore claimed he was after. An open mind would have learned the truth before the film was released, because an open mind is attuned to his/her surroundings and would not be as eager to believe this film as the absolute truth without a shred of evidence. I look forward to the next Michael Moore production. He is the ultimate propaganda weapon of the red states.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am 23 years old, saw Fahrenheit 9/11, have friends in the military, and I voted for Bush. This film wasn't just bad, I can deal with bad films if they make a point, it was downright insulting to my intelligence. The connection that Moore tried to make with Bush and the Bin Ladens is where I stopped believing this movie could present evidence. So a guy who didn't take a medical exam in the 70's with Bush, invests money into Bush's business, but, heres the kicker, that man received money from the Bin Laden family, one of the wealthiest families in the world to invest. That is reaching for something that isn't there. I guess if you hate a leader enough you are willing to overlook the lengths Moore went to make a connection. Anyway, even disregarding the political stuff and looking at this film objectively(which I tried to so, probably not with much success), it is boring to the informed, disjointed, and sad really that someone would devote an entire film to hatred of another. I liked Bowling for Columbine even though I disagreed with its message, it was a cool way of looking at the events. Fahrenheit wasn't entertaining and was another example of just who much out of touch some people are with society that anyone would believe the BS in this "film".</fullReview>

I dearly hope that any profits he makes off the travesty of a film will go towards the building of the new tower at ground zero. I suppose it won't help the DVD sales now that the idiot who is responsible for 9/11 (total sarchasim here) just got re-elected with a 3 million plus lead! He even got Florida!!!!! OH YEAH:) Maybe we can finally get on with our lives as Americans and kill the enemies that stand against us instead of negotiate.

		<fullReview>After perusing so many of the comments made about this movie, I had to see it for myself. As a thinking member of the human race, I also rented FahrenHYPE 9/11 to see both sides of the story. "Believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see" - figured two halves would give me a whole picture. It did.Michael Moore is a hypocrite of the first order. What even surprises me more is that so many seemingly intelligent people on this site and out in the populace at large are being bamboozled by this guy. As spin doctors go, he is first rate. His editing skills are probably some of the best I've seen. As such, he knows exactly how to twist facts and change context just enough to turn disjoint snippets of information into a distorted web of flagrant and powerfully suggestive lies. To support this, I spent a significant amount of time following up on many of the claims made by his film, all the counterclaims made by Dick Morris' FahrenHYPE 9/11, as well as doing a little sleuthing of my own. I challenge ANYONE else to do the same, and after objectively reviewing all the evidence, to not come up with the same conclusion. This isn't an endorsement for or against Bush - it's simply a result of trying to get unadulterated truth.One review writer for this movie stated several days ago the same chant that has been reiterated for generations: "I can only wait until my generation goes into office. We will see change. We will open up America's eyes. We are your future, and we know what's right." (said in support of Moore's diatribe and referencing this drivel as a documentary). All the more reason that the Constitution does not allow anyone under the age of 35 to become President. My only hope for this individual and others like him is that with age comes wisdom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi guys. I'm a fan of Michael Moore's work. I enjoyed Roger &amp; Me and Bowling for Columbine, but did have to admit even in those films that some of his points were a bit unbalanced. I just saw Fahrenheit 9/11 for the first time last night. I do have to admit some bias, as I am a supporter of the president. Apart from lacking some of the zing and excitement of his past films, this film was, by far, the most one sided film of his that I have seen. Seriously! There are equally effective arguments to many of the points he brought up. Some of his claims were so absurd and lacking in logic. I appreciate his perspective, and am glad he made the film - he is free to present his opinions, and does it effectively. I just can't believe that people blindly agree with all of his points and use them as arguments against the re-election of George Bush. I wouldn't expect any congressmen or women to enlist their children in the the armed forces when prompted by Michael Moore. That is the individual's decision - not their parents!So what if the Bushes invest in a company that Saudis also invest in. I don't get the big deal. So what if the Saudi ambassador had dinner with George Bush days after 9/11. Wouldn't you expect them to meet to discuss what had just happen?Do you know how many warnings of terrorism this administration and the Clinton administration get/got on a daily basis? There is no way you can convince me that Sept. 11 was preventable. Who in this country understood that those terrorists were so willing to sacrifice themselves and pull off such a drastic attack?It is outrageous to suggest that George Bush was "in on" 9/11.What is Michael Moore's suggestion for Iraq? Just pull out all forces immediately?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** This may contain a couple of minor spoilers **Now I am by no means a fan of George W Bush, And after doing a lot of private research on Michael Moores claims in his previous movies I find the man repulsive and manipulative in his sole goal to make money. That said I thought i should see this movie and see if a leopard can change its spots.Firstly it is an excellent piece of cinema, The documentary is well laid out and seemless in its transition from start to finish. I liked the film for its though provoking images, mainly because Moore prancing around like an idiot and using his pathetic embarrassment tactics were cut to a bare minimum. The footage said more than Moore ever could. (the validity of the message TBC)Throughout the film i felt that for the most part the facts remain intact, however as a word of warning, do not take anything Michael Moore says at face value.The one suspect part of the movie that bothered me somewhat was his trailing of a US Mother, who at the start of the Documentary was pro war, until her son's Blackhawk is shot down in Iraq and is killed. Given the number of Troops in Iraq and the comparative few killed I find it somewhat remarkable that Moore has found this woman prior to her sons death.All said and done though well worth seeing, although it loathes me to put money into the mans pocket. However Moore did say himself that he was pro downloading of movies from the net and in the interview states that he is happy for people to do that with his work, then as a challenge to his motives I strongly suggest you download the movie instead of paying to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was based on things that were out of context. In some of the interviews, the people didn't know they were being interviewed. He basically used a hidden camera. He attacked people and as evidence he used quotes that were out of context. They had nothing to do with the point he was trying to prove. I hated that movie. He said that President Bush knew about 9/11. He had no idea that terriorists were going to hijack commercial airline planes and fly them into the World Trade Centers, attempt to fly a plane into the White House, or the Pentegon. If he would have known the who, what, when's...he would not have let it happen. And President Clinton knew just as much about it as Bush but he never mentioned it because Moore is a Democrat who is just trying to blame a republican.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore is probably the dumbest person ever to walk the face of the earth. He thinks he can fool anyone with old communist tricks , trying to warp reality. This movie is pure leftist political violent propaganda. As one other reviewer said there are no facts to back-up anything he presents, and besides America was a much better place before people like Michael Moore existed. Whatever your political views are if you have a little bit of common sense you will understand that Moore is an ideologist with extreme views that can only raise hatred among people who watch his movies. Please don't be fooled by this lying pig. Fahrenheit 9/11? no, 0/11. Avoid it at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a true documentary rather Michael Moore's opinion on the matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this documentary yesterday and while it is interesting, however, it is so unabashedly anti-Bush that this documentary is nothing more than one-sided view of things rather than trying to be a balanced view of Bush, terrorism, and the war in Iraq. One of the first tenets of journalism is being balanced in your report, regardless of your personal views but this documentary failed to do this. It is so skewed that Michael Moore does a great disservice to the viewing public by releasing such unbalanced documentary. One of the things I found disturbing is his editing of interviews to make it seem his interviewee's are saying one thing when in fact they are not, but you would not know this since Moore does not want to show this.While I am no fan of President Bush nor the war in Iraq, however, I believe all views on the topics should have been represented rather than Michael Moore's sole view on the matter. If this was to be Moore's interpretation on these events, then he should state it as such rather than try to pass this as a true documentary.I encourage all of you to read your local or national newspapers and magazines, regardless of your opinion, in order to get a balanced view on this topic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a documentary. To call it so is a disgrace to the many true and brilliant documentaries that have been filmed.Rather, F 9/11 is pure leftist propaganda, full of lies, half-truths, and misleading facts. See the upcoming film, "MICHAEL MOORE HATES America." This is a true documentary.Moore is a disgrace when he infiltrates the privacy of the sobbing mother of a soldier who died in Iraq, shoving the camera in her face even as she weeps. He exploits her emotions for political gain. Bush haters love this movie, sure, but anyone can be painted into a monster when you show half the story.Not a brilliant movie.To call it such is to expose that the reviewer is merely a leftist Bush-hater.Cheap shots such as showing Wolfowitz spitting on his comb are nothing but third grade cheap shots. This is not film-making at its finest. Hatred leads to one's downfall. Moore's hatred will hurt himself in the long run.By the way, the supposed champion of the lower and middle class, Moore, lives in a multi-million dollar apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and sends his kids to one of the most expensive and exclusive private schools. Can you say contradiction? -A Proud New Yorker</fullReview>

I have no problem at all with the topic, I'm not Pro-Bush by any means, but I know what Moore is capable of, and I know he could have made aninsightful, informative film on the same topic. Instead he chose to just make this exploitative, vicious, venomous, so-slanted-it's-near-horizontal piece ofpropaganda. It has its moments, and certainly there was some interesting information. But the overall message is ruined by the relentless hammering it home with a bluntheavy object to the viewer's skull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore's Film Lacks Credibility.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie lacks credibility because the director lacks credibility. Previous works by Michael Moore has been full of deliberate distortions and inaccuracies. Documentation of errors and misrepresentations in his previous films is well documented on the internet.The film was OK and interesting. However I would probably like the film better if it were produced by someone who is more honest and fair than Michael Moore. It's easier to make an interesting or entertaining "documentary" when you discard truths, distort facts, use fake setups, and manipulate editing. Moore has a history of doing unethical things to create his films. Because it's difficult to know what is fact, fantasy, and false setups you need to be careful when viewing films by Michael Moore. You cannot accept his films as being accurate because he has an agenda and makes his documentaries to conform to his agenda even if some manipulation or false misrepresentations are needed to accomplish this.I agree with much of what his views are in the film. However, I do not respect the messenger or the tactics he uses to convey his message. If this film where made by a director who had more integrity and honesty then I would have more respect this film. Because this is a film by Michael Moore I am left wondering what is accurate and what are intential misrepresentations that Moore has put into a film. I find it difficult to put much faith or credence in a film by a director who himself manipulates the facts and uses editing tricks, false statement, and ambushed interviews as part of documentary technques. I would like to see a documentary made about Michael Moore and see how well he would hold up under scrutiny if someone were to take a close look at him.If someone wanted to, they could probably easily create a documentary about Moore that would make him look worse then how he makes other people look in his films. Moore contradicts himself. He criticizes the integrity of others, but he himself uses dishonest tactics and false allegations to create his films. By doing so he discredits himself, his views, and his work.</fullReview>

The movie provides that, in December 1997, a delegation of top Taliban officials visited the United States at the invitation of officials from Unocal, a California-based oil and gas company with extensive business dealings in Texas. At the time, Unocal was pursuing a deal to construct a gas pipeline through Afghanistan. Moore notes that the delegation visited Texas while Bush was governor. He doesn't say the delegation met with Bush, but that is implied. In fact, Bush did not meet with the Taliban representatives. What Moore also doesn't say is that Clinton administration officials at the State Department did sit down with the Taliban officials and that their visit was made with the Clinton administration's permission.

Maybe 25% of the entire movie is actually factual. If you don't believe it, just read about what Moore is saying about it now. While he began by calling it a factual documentary, he now claims he never said that and that the "movie" is, in fact, a satire or something like that. I don't remember actual wording he used. It reminds me a lot of the movie JFK. All of us who were young at the time of its release thought it was all true. Now that we've read a little about it, watched the footage, and found out who Oswald really was we know otherwise.

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a talented filmaker, with a talent for using humor as a way of making the bluntness of his points plainly apparent. His films I often find disagreeable, sometimes highly so, but I often find myself laughing during them anyways. He is also someone i would call an ambulance chaser, taking issues out of the spotlight and using them to push his radical political agenda. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a film which does this to an eggregious, shameless extent, to the point where he goes against his own credo as a documentarian. Though his films often leave out much of the other side of the argument, they generally do a good job at educating the public on issues they are not well aware of. His latest film takes advantage of the fact that most of us are not well-educated on certain events in order to be able to make the ridiculous points of the film sound well-founded. Working on the assumption that most of his audience is A: liberal and B: ill-informed, Moore takes what is actually not the most confidential information and puts a radical spin on it, making the Bush administration look like it much more control over the events of 9/11 and beyond than it, or any administration, could possibly have had. It demonizes the president way beyond the point to which he is able to be legitimately criticized for his mistakes, which are legion. What he doesn't want you to remember is that our government is every bit as responsible for deciding on the actions taken since 9/11 as our president and that John Kerry, his party's chosen one, was behind the agenda every bit of the way until it went wrong.Michael Moore is a person that people look to when they are disillusioned at the current state of things, whether the rest of us like it or not. However, in the case of Fahrenheit 9/11, he uses the growing resentment of the bad state of things to hoodwink the public, and the resulting film has way more holes in it than in other Moore works. The film is ultimately a cheap shot at the right, which Moore made because he knew he could get away with it. It is not really documentary, and something worse than yellow journalism. It's sensationalism, and it's success has cheapened the value of the Palme D'or.</fullReview>

I don't know where to begin.Both Michael Moore's hatred for the Bush family and his disdain for traditional American values, are well documented in this piece of trash. Moore's a malcontent with a warped sense of reality. At least his early documentary, "Roger and Me", had some redeeming social value. "Fahrenheit 911" is pure left-wing hate propaganda. It's filled with lies, distortions and fabrications. I have no doubt, Moore's fellow malcontents in Hollywood will vote him an Academy Award for his efforts. I suggest Michael Moore move to France. Over there, Moore's overall film work would be better appreciated by all the anti-American Euro-socialists that populate the old world.</fullReview>

Not real surprising that he got a top prize, voted for by the liberal Hollywood elite, in France no less. Luckily I didn't have to pay to see it... just wasted a couple of hours of my life. Its also interesting to see how people have voted for this... two thirds give it a 10, and one third give it a 1... with very few in between. I would be very interested in finding out how many of the folks that gave this piece of crap a 10 actually saw it. How many of you gave it a 10 just because you agree with Moore's twisted politics and, like him, have a unreasoning hatred of President Bush?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's sad to see a talented person make such a politically motivated flick. If he would have shown both sides of the story, the movie might have some merit. I found the editing to be disruptive and it was difficult to tell what was real and what was done with a splicer and glue. Now, I understand why Disney wanted to distance themselves from it. There was just to much left wing rhetoric to enjoy the movie. The "A-ha!" factor was lame. If Moore would apply himself in a non partisan manner, he would be taken more seriously. This is not a documentary. It is one persons twisted idea of why something happened. I am sure the movie will do well financially due to the hype, but I believe it will fade with word of mouth letting prospective viewers know that it's a political tool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore and this movie make me sick and disgusted. This movie is nothing more that liberal minds at work trying to spread evil and chaos like cancer. Unfortunately many innocent people die during a war and many bad things happen. Thankfully it is easier for us to sit here in America and bad mouth all that's being done while the soldiers suffer where ever they are. I personally think that all of liberal Hollywood should mind there own businesses and remember that they have not made any great accomplishments or changed any ones lives yet. They sit in there wonderful homes and voice there opinions like they know something. I say this, Michael Moore and his mother, wife and daughters should go live in the middle east and see what life is like there. I would like to see his movie then. We are all lucky to live in this country and should show appreciation to it. Did I agree with x President Clinton, no I did not but I would not bad mouth him or go against my country in a time of need. Remember all you liberals who voted for that man. He just so happened to be a draft dodger who protested against his country in another country. Why isn't there a movie about that. If you don't like this country you don't have to live here and more important you don't have to work here. If Michael Moore thinks he can do better some where else he should try. Shame on him and this trash movie.</fullReview>

He fails, however, to mention that the events Sept 11, 2001 could possibly have been prevented if the previous President, as proved by the 9-11 Commission Report. There were many failures that led to the events; however, to blame one President (Republican) for all actions, is being a poor sport. As a person who supports left wing issues you can only expect it. The movie was a wonderful example of how America is so great. Had this movie come out in the former Soviet Union, Mr. Moore would have been dealt with quickly. For that reason only I gave it a "3". I would have given it a higher rating "7-8" if he would have shown more than a one-sided opinion. God Bless America!Watch and make your own determination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe Michael Moore is only but an opportunist. What I mean is that it has become popular to hate the U.S. and this 'director' has, ingeniously, spotted this and made a hit. But it is not only Mr. Moore, also BBC and CNN. No one sees these networks having their reporters saying ANYTHING good about Bush. The moment they do people will stop watching, which is obvious because the public sees and hears what they like. In some way its wrong because it's not the way news should be told, I always knew that reporting had to be non-partial and neutral (how can it when news centers are more left-sided). I believe people should see and think outside the box with such fragile things as the war on Irag and silly things as even thinking that Mr. Bush would missile the pentagon, I mean come on! But I guess that this subject and others alike make Mr. Moore's so called "documentary" look good, or alike, or even satisfy what most people want to see. I can't blame the people for hating Bush, all they see is a man making a war with no sense on the poor Iraqi people. But what I do blame the people is for not wondering why this man would do such a thing and even ask themselves "are the Iraqi people so innocent?" Of course, their not all terrorists, practically a very very small percent but that;s not the case. What I think is that people see short-term about this and not long-term. If one sees Iraq, one only sees no opportunity for progress in health, security and many other grounds. Though think for a moment now and wonder how Iraq will be in say 20 to 50 years from now, possibly nothing but at least now they have a better chance. No one sees this, nor the fact that not as many people would be dead if there wouldn't have been any resistance from Iraq. Who would think that the U.S. would go there to kill? Any ignorant, but I don't want to insult. It is very possible that Mr. Bush went there to get some oil but at least now terrorism can be abolished better. So anyways, I can go on and on with such cases but I'm afraid I haven't the time, all I want is for people to think by themselves, think that maybe Mr. Bush isn't that bad, that maybe others are making bad as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very easy to put together film clips from people and events in such a way to make anyone look bad. Moore had a clear agenda; he admits to hating Bush, and he did his best to make Bush, America, and our military look bad. Too bad so many Bush-haters can't see through that.Moore profited more from the American tragedy of 9-11 and the Iraqi war more than anyone else on Earth. Those who care about the truth have read about the lies and distortions in this movie; they are too many to name. His attack on Cheney/Halliburton is typical socialist spin; many of his friends on the left parrot the same junk. As of the end of 2004, 62 Halliburton employees have been killed in Iraq, while trying to do their job. Maybe someone on the left could explain how Halliburton could do things differently. Don't like a no bid contract like the one given to Halliburton? Great. Let's bid on a several billion dollar job. The problem with that proposal is that it would take 15 months for the bid, and conditions would change so much that the bid would be worthless. What other company in the world does what Halliburton does in these conditions? None. That's why they got the job. This is just one example to show how Moore's 911 is a cheap shot patchwork.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was full of contradictions, high-handedness, and frankly, s***. There was no central theme, no real point made, just as in "Bowling For Columbine." But its not a term paper, so I guess it could get a 5 out of 10. I will always side with those who defend the defenseless, and Michael Moore seems to do that very well. But just as the poor are exploited to fight wars, work meaningless jobs, and instill fear into the hearts of good old white Americans, are they not also being exploited here by Moore to further his own agenda? Remember, Michael Moore is a millionaire too. I can't help but think that Moore was the unpopular kid in high school who thinks he is smarter than everyone else and that includes those who he is "defending" here. Though Moore did call out the Democrats on a couple of occasions, I think that a better film would have focused on their failures rather than spend half the time playing connect the dots with Bush and Bin Laden. Moore's anger seemed just as misguided here as it did in Bowling For Columbine. Maybe Moore has a hard time calling out the Democrats because his job involves just as much hypocrisy and manipulation as theirs. But I might be wrong, Moore might be genuine and heartfelt, and I believe that Bush has lied to further the agenda for his administration. But in a fight between Foxnews and Michael Moore, I choose Trey Parker and Matt Stone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm an Independent. So I gave the film a fair shake. After I saw it, I decided to see if Michael Moore's claims were true. So I started researching them on the Internet. Guess what I found out? They were pretty much false and mis construed! I didn't find anything true!For instance, the claim most of the soldiers killed were minorities. FALSE. I checked the mortality report. Over 70% were white, and most were Iowans, born in my home state. Why? Because most of the troops are from Iowa.Second, the claim the Saudis flew out of the United States before any Americans could start flying again right after 9/11. FALSE. The Saudis only flew out AFTER the ban was lifted and AFTER they have a VERY deep background check by the FBI. Just like we Americans. Where'd I find this? The AP.Third. The Carlisle thing. Bush was not involved with the Carlisle group at ALL when he became President. The Bush's broke off all ties with the group two years before the candidacy began. Where'd I find this? The Wall Street Journal.Michael Moore even bragged that he's never been sued because "What I say is the truth." Well, get this, Michael Moore is currently being sued by an Illinois newspaper for changing one of their headlines and plastering it for all to see in his little film. I hope they win.These are just a few of the things of what I found out. If you just want to be fed a bunch of blowhard storyline by a pretentious director, that's fine by me, but I prefer to think for myself. The entire film is just propaganda by a mean-spirited individual who wants to make a bunch of money on the side. I have no respect for Michael Moore as a filmmaker, and even less as a person.

It is just a shame that some people do not understand the global danger of totalitarian regimes. And the one we face these days is the worst - it does not even recognize state borders.

		<fullReview>This film is incontrovertible evidence that Michael Moore is a propagandist, not a documentary filmmaker. As a propagandist, he is a competent spinmaster. In another time and place, masters such as the Nazis and Russian Communists would have been happy to have him serve them.See this film if you must, but be a true free-thinking person if you do so. Whatever questions Moore may ask, be sure to ask your own. Whatever "substance" one may see here, be sure to combine it with the much larger body of other, objective evidence that Moore does not see fit to present on screen. Do not mistake his presentation of half-truths and outright deceptions as hard, lucid analysis of the film's subject matter.Some may see this movie as a bold example of free speech, one that should be lauded for challenging America's political leaders. Free speech is indeed laudable, but so is objective truth. Ideals are virtues so long as they are fully and completely grounded in life's realities. When not so grounded, they are dangerous and ultimately self-defeating.At its core, this film is nothing other than political profiteering. It is one man's self-aggrandizing attempt to milk the prejudices of one political faction against another. Is this what you really want either America or the world to be about?</fullReview>

Brainless fools who believe everything thrown their way.The factual documentary this year is SuperSize Me. Mr. Moore would do well to take his hefty self and watch that movie. It is actual and truthful, unlike his politically motivated liefest.I am sure the lefty, liberal, tree hugging hippies love this movie and Mr. Moore. If Mr. Moore had his way, we would all be speaking french and bin laden would be our leader.Grow up people. The country is doing what it needs to protect itself, and if the lefties do not like it, MOVE TO FRANCE where the women are women and the men wave white flags.If Mr. Moore wants to dig up some truths, why does he not do a documentary on why France was really against the war....their loss of Mr. Sadam's money from their pockets......Hey, I have a bridge I can sell you fools!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a political science graduate student and I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 and its full of flaws. First there was the part about the Saudis and what really strikes me is that Michael Moore seems to forget that the investors were here in Clintons time. Bin Laden should have been persecuted heavily by both Bush and Clinton, everyone forgets that Clinton was the president during the first WTC attack in 1993, Clinton should have went after him as well. the Pipeline was planned during the Clinton administration..... this is extremely one sided film, I'm not calling it a documentary Roger and Me and columbine were documentaries this is simply misinformed propaganda.</fullReview>

He ignored or left out any point of view or facts that opposed him which makes a very poor documentary indeed. Maybe he really believe the American people are stupid, but we should give ourselves more credit than that and just pass this movie off as a fantasy flick. Celebrities flock to this because it takes the blame off of their morally corrupt lifestyles which is a huge reason why the religious zealots hate the United States.

		<shortDescription>Failed My Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I am a big fan of Michael Moore's film making. At his worst was his A&amp;E TV series, 'The Awful Truth', which was still good but not great. At his best, was 'Roger and Me' and 'Bowling for Columbine'. Particularly, the latter.Farenheit 9/11 is more in the flavor of the TV series. It doesn't come close to matching the greatness of his two prior movies. Basically, Farenheit 9/11 is a collection of TV news clips, most of them out of context, put together in such a way to suggest his point of view. Despite his attempts, I just found the connections he was trying to make via film far-fetched in some cases. Frankly, I found it boring and I kept looking at my watch all the way through.However, none of this is saying that I disagree with the essence of what he is trying to say, I just disagree with the way he's saying it. Everybody I've talked to has told me that they thought it was amazing and an important film to see. Of course, this always seems to happen to me. A movie gets high reviews and I go in to the theater with too high of expectations. I was just let down a lot.The worst part of the film was the TV clips, which were a good part of the movie. They weren't cleaned up a bit, they were blurry, and should have been "re-mastered" for the wide theater screen. It was as if my next door neighbor went out with his hand-held video camera and shot it. A very amatuer type look all the way through, which yes, Michael's films have been known for, but this was just too visually poor for the most part.Supporting most, if not all of what Michael is trying to say here politically, I feel he didn't do the cause any justice. I believe I heard on the radio that George Bush's re-election campaign was asked if they were concnerned about this movie being released so close to the election, and their reply was something to the effect that the movie was so far-fetched that most people would dismiss it. And despite it's poor quality as a film, there's enough subject matter there to get people thinking and to sway some votes against Bush when it's all said and done. For that and that alone, I applaud Michael. It's a shame I can't applaud him for the reasons that matter, such as filmaking quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People without a moral compass always find it easy to be cynical and mistrust those who really do have one. Michael Moore is one of these people.The true Michael Moore is well described in the book "Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man." It is very sad that he poisons the minds of young people and fills them with distrust. Bitterness, cynicism, and lying because it's the 'right thing' are all habits to be avoided. It is so sad that he spreads his sickness.Sitting on the side and attacking is easy. Being a victim is easy. Trying to do something is hard. Eventually Americans will see through his lies, because it is in our nature to figure these things out. As Reagan (someone who Michael Moore would undoubtedly hate) reminded us, "America is the Shining City on the Hill." Part of the price of a free society is that we have to put up with idiots like Michael Moore, but it is a small price to pay. I would like to invite him to go to Cuba or China and create a movie that attacks the government. He would see how a true totalitarian government would deal with someone like him.Skip</fullReview>

This is nothing more than a really long political commercial. It violates several election laws and if they wanted to take the time a lot of people could get rich from lawsuits for slander. Just another attempt by someone to make some money off of garbage. This film is poorly produced and many scenes are just unwatchable. Even if the quality were better it just drones on and on using stock footage for many scenes. That may be the one redeeming point. If for some reason you are forced to watch this drivel you can try finding the pre-1980 footage in a movie that supposedly was made in the past few years. Bottom line.

		<shortDescription>Moore should not be making documentaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you expect anything short of a biased opinion from this film then you are in for a rude awakening. This film was written by the left for the left and that is all there is to it. There is not even a shred of objectivity in the way this trash was made, and despite agreeing with the overall message of the film, I did not agree with the miscellaneous tidbits of liberal propaganda that were so neatly injected.Everything Michael Moore has ever put on celluloid lacks coherence. For those of you who might not know what that means, it means that Moore's films are like a piece of newspaper that has been torn to 1 cm shreds and mixed up in a big pile - and Moore "interprets" what is in the pile for you. For example, several of Bushes speeches and sayings were deliberately taken out of context and interspersed with what Moore was trying to say, using them as "evidence" for his arguments. There are portions of the film that do not fit with the central arguments being made. The section about the patrolman from Oregon and the Homeland Security department really have no place in this movie. It really proves nothing concerning what Moore is actually trying to say.There are portions of the film that are absolutely incorrect. The portion about "paradise Baghdad" - where see children happily laughing and playing under the rule of Saddam Huissein is pure &lt;expletive deleted&gt; and we know it. Moore should have been objective enough to at least portray pre-war Baghdad as the hard-life place we knew it was. Moore makes very convincing emotional arguments. The Lila Lipscombe section will bring the audience to fits and tears. These types of arguments do not belong in a documentary. It would be fine in any other Hollywood movie, but NOT a documentary. The film would have been much more effective if it had left the emotional argumentation and unnecessary portions out and had gone into greater detail about why the war had no purpose to begin with.In the end, one walks out of Fahrenheit 9/11 with the notion that it was a bad documentary and that Moore should not be making documentaries. He is a good filmmaker but his talents would be better suited making fictional films. One of the few pluses of the film-making is that it is likely to draw in many ignorant Americans who have no idea what their country is currently doing. Because it is emotionally-oriented it will likely keep the attention of the young people who have the biggest share in the upcoming election. In the course of doing this it will plunge in the lethal needle hanging over the Bush presidency. And for that redeeming quality it isn't such a bad movie after all. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore's hollow moral indignation just turned me right off. Where were the surprise 'truths' he promised us? This movie isn't a documentary about truth or about the war. It's an excuse to bash President Bush and to try and swing an election. Voters should be p*ssed that someone is trying to influence them with their entertainment. There's nothing new here. Moore just goes off about everything from 9/11 to the election of 2000 and hopes to paint some bad light on a President. If anyone gives weight to Moore's voice then they are giving him the power to change this nation. Is that conniving liar really the person you want deciding our future?Moore's willingness to milk the grief of a Flint mother just made me angry. I can't believe people aren't more outraged with the fact that a pure political propaganda film is being released nationwide in an election year. This is a move that would make Hitler proud. Moore launches a torpedo squarely at the ongoing campaign to finally get the president he wants elected. This is something the KKK would do and is disgusting to say the least.</fullReview>

There are some very powerful moments in this film, and if Moore really was doing an expose of our current times as he says, this movie might be relevant. Sadly, Moore lets his personal hatred of President Bush color any objectiveness that he might have had and comes up with a movie that is generally untruthful, boring and pretentious.

		<shortDescription>Propaganda, Not Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentary - Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film. * Propaganda -Material disseminated by the advocates or opponents of a doctrine or cause i.e. wartime propaganda.** Definitions found at Dictionary.com.It is unusual to start a movie review with definitions of two words, but this is the essence of my complete and total dislike of the film "Fahrenheit 9/11" written and directed by Michael Moore. If Mr. Moore promoted this film as a propaganda film, then I would probably give this my highest rating possible. But he falsely promotes and maybe even believes that this is a documentary film about President Bush and the events leading up to and after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Since he essentially lied to the American public to try and convince voters to vote for his candidate by the use of this "documentary," I feel his actions are inexcusable and are of the lowest of the low. I feel his comments in producing and promoting this movie are on the same level as the lies committed by President Nixon during Watergate, and President Clinton during the Monica Lewinski scandal. All three of these instances showcase lies to the American public with the appearance of honesty, and that is not what why founding fathers created this country. I have two main points that show why I feel that this is not a documentary but a propaganda film.1.) In the first 30 minutes of the film Moore explains how George W. Bush was able to steal the election from Vice President Al Gore. He states that his father, President George H.W. Bush was able to get elected, nominate and confirm some Supreme Court justices that would eventually hear the Supreme Court case Bush vs. Gore. Moore also states that Bush, the younger, new to have his campaign manager be the attorney general of Florida, who overseas the election results. Moore also says the Bush was helped by his brother, who is the governor of Florida. Moore states that Bush did all of these things to help steal the election from Gore. Well, according the Michael Moore, Bush is not only a genius, but a person who can tell the future. You see, for all of this to be true, Bush had to have known in 1987, that his father would win the presidential election in 1988, have two Supreme Court justices retire during his father's term. Know that his father would be able to nominate and get confirmed who he wanted on the Court. To know that his father would lose the election in 1992 AND that President Clinton would win in 1996, meaning he would be a two term president. Moore also must think that Bush new he would win the election to become Governor of Texas in 1994, and again in 1998, and to know that his brother Jeb Bush would become Governor of Florida, and ask the Attorney General of Florida, a close family friend, to be his campaign manager, AND LASTLY, to know that Florida would be the deciding state in the 2000 Presidential election. Wow, maybe I have Michael Moore pegged wrong, maybe he is a big supporter of Bush.Too me, this is pure propaganda, but we can't use that word because most people of history will be reminded of one of the greatest propagandist of all time, Leni Reifenstahl. She was the German filmmaker, who in 1935 made a movie called "Triumph of the Will." This too was a documentary on the great way of life the NAZI party and its leader, Adolph Hitler, offered to the people of Germany as well as the world. Now I am not comparing the two directors, I am just showing what some people will think of when you say propaganda film.2.) The other example of why I think this is a propaganda film is that on the night before the election, Michael Moore distributed his movie as a pay per view event on TV. He wanted to try and convince some last minute voters to change their mind. I have already commented on my problem with this, being promoted as a documentary. As a documentary, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is one of the worst movies every made. If documentaries are to show, "objectivity without editorializing," then this movie is not even close. When this movie is promoted as a propaganda film, I will offer a different opinion, until then, this movie and its director, deserve no praise, only ridicule.This review and others can be seen at Brian and Benn's Movie Corner at www.dockratent.com</fullReview>

It was also totally one sided; this was not a "documentary" more or less a "mockumentry" that tried to use facts without any say from the opposition. The facts are facts, I agree, but this didn't show both sides of the issue like how a real documentary is supposed to. As a piece of entertainment I'll give this a 4/10 but as a movie in it's supposed genre I'm giving it -3/10.If you like something that is thought provoking (in either the positive or negative sense)then I'd suggest you'd see this.

		<shortDescription>This smoke bomb was just that ... smoke and a bomb.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opening potshots ... at Bush regarding stealing the election seemed to give a guy he claims is a dumbski an awful lot of credit and clairvoyance ... did George really have that baby in the bag the way Kennedy did in Illinois in 1960 (not that that was mentioned)? I don't think so ... but I can see where democrats anxious to pounce on Bush might've been whipped into a mob-like frenzy in movie theaters (and on their way home) ... George knew that the friends he made along the way (and his brother) could actually steal that election all the way back when he was in the reserves? Somehow I think that if Democrats really bought into that congressional roll call Moore showed ad nausea, their senators (democrats held a majority at the time-but all they needed was one) would've responded.Regarding 9-11 itself ... I guess if Moore is right, the entire Bush administration (but especially the Bush family) couldn't wait for those 15 of 19 Saudi hijackers to attack ... and boost not only his presidential ratings but business, too. Jesus Christ, does anybody really buy into this s**t? I know that even John Kerry is smart enough not to (or why hasn't he jumped all over it?). If people really think that badly about Bush, they should probably consider a second American Revolution and not risk another tainted election. I thought Moore was just playing to the yahoo slogan screamers on the extreme left. It was absurd to the point of stupid. Essentially, Moore was claiming that Bush not only needed something like 9-11, he wanted it (for financial as well as political gain).The man I saw in that Florida classroom looked like someone had just kicked his guts out (not a man that had just found the single winning Powerball lotto ticket) ... Cheap shots aimed at the troops ... I mostly resented the cheap shots aimed at soldiers in the field (either already in the frenzy of a fight or about to be) ... Moore made them look like bloodthirsty rednecks out for a night of Muslim bashing ... it was in real bad taste and is probably one of the biggest reasons Democrats (including the Kerry-Edwards ticket) aren't joining the Moore frenzy ... and when he sympathetically shows wounded American troops later on in the film, it doesn't negate the unfair besmirching of those in the field he attempted to make fun of earlier.Flying Bin Ladins ... I like the sound of this title and can almost see them on a trapeze ... but I don't think Moore did much for his cause with true independents ... it was such a slanted and unfairly spun thesis I had to laugh a few times. Once again, a guy that has problems with the English language (as George does have from time to time) is going to put together the most elaborate plan in the history of the world to not only have his own country attacked (so that his ratings and income will sore), but he'll even figure a way to get the enemy's family out of the country safe and sound. Yeah, I would've liked them to stay behind for some questioning myself, but to suggest that George (and not the FBI ? as we now know it was that organization that made the call-one of several Moore inaccuracies) did that so his 'friends' could get away safe and sound to lend him money for another day is just insane.Once again, I can't help but see Moore floating the pink elephants those on the extreme left require to band together in blind faith against all things conservative.The War in Iraq ... well, he sure portrayed the pain and suffering of Iraqi citizens caused by coalition bombing and I have to wonder if a woman that had just lost her son to one of Saddam's torture machines would've had the same access to cameras during Hussein's reign ... unless, of course, Mr. Moore is suggesting that we've killed more innocent Iraqis than Hussein did. I was for the war from the start and still think it was necessary and that we should remain there, so I suppose I'm not the best judge of this segment. I did think his agenda was as obvious as it always is and I was glad to see him reach very far into the oil fields for blame. Sometimes I guess I was confused about just what Bush was supposed to be guilty of ...Was he trying to make money off the war for himself, his family and his Saudi friends?Was it for Haliburton and Enron?Was it because Hussein had tried to kill his father?Was it because his ratings were low and he needed to spice up the action?I guess it reminded me of those knuckleheads that blocked Fifth Avenue at the start of the war with signs that read 'No Blood for Oil' ... I honestly don't think they knew what they were even trying to say. I think Moore's message suffered from the same weakness.The poor woman that lost her son ... very touching ... it reminded me of the good he did in the Columbine flick by getting K-mart to remove bullets from their stores (the fact that he acknowledged a fallen hero). I thought it was a bit less than patriotic though, how Moore used that woman's grief to imply George W. Bush had sacrificed her son so he could line his pockets. What can I say ... the man (Moore) is pond scum ... but my heart does go out to that woman and her family.Bowling for Columbine was actually interesting, and when it wasn't advocating Moore's political agenda, was quite good. This smoke bomb was just that ... smoke and a bomb.Look, if you buy into this Moore fantasy, you're a Bush hater anyway. Those with Bush will see it as absurd. Independents, the ones that can think for themselves, won't be swayed at all. It was a popular film in Cannes for a reason, people ... the French hate us too.</fullReview>

Don't cheat people out of $10 to watch propaganda, and exploit their 9/11 emotions.He owes an apology to the victims of 9/11 in the U.S. and to the families who have sons and daughters serving in the military.

		<fullReview>OK...I'm voting for GWB come November. Let's make that clear before we get started.I wasn't going to see this film because I knew what would be in it, and I wasn't interested in contributing to Mr. Moore's box office earnings. A friend of mine (who will likely vote for JFK) offered to pay for my ticket because I `NEEDED' to see this film. So I went.It fulfilled all my expectations. There is nothing in this film you will not expect to see whichever way your personal politics go. In this respect, the film is certainly a failure. Because of this, it also likely fails in persuading anyone toward any view they do not already hold. Its only success then, is in mudslinging.Moore says he doesn't say anything in the film that isn't true. Maybe and maybe not. The presentation itself makes truth irrelevant in any case. The film reminds me of a political ad from the early 1900s I once saw where a candidate states, among other things, that his opponent was a practicing thespian in college and masticates in front of his family at the dinner table for God's sake. These were probably true assertions, but the way they were presented was clearly designed only to assassinate the opponent's character. If you're wondering how this applies to Moore, the media of the time never bothered to clarify the meaning of the words thespian (actor) and masticate (chew). Those who relied solely on those outlets took the statements in their implications and not their meaning, and the opponent lost badly. If you rely only on Moore's presentation, you may be getting some truth, but what it really means may be completely misrepresented or even irrelevant to the point he says he is making. We are lucky in this modern age in that there are plenty of outlets to answer Moore's film.Moore's motivation is well known. I won't go into what is misleading and irrelevant in the film. There are scads of people doing that for those who want to find out just as there are plenty rushing to support Fahrenheit 9/11. My own opinion is that this film is remarkably boring for all its polemics. It simply doesn't give one anything one doesn't already have whether that is hatred for GWB or indignation at how Moore treats him. The film doesn't persuade at all and makes no real attempt to do so. In the end, it simply doesn't do anything. Personally, I'm not casting an IMDB vote for this film. My own views on the subject are probably sufficiently slanted that it wouldn't be objective, and I like to keep such votes in that area when I make them.So see the film, if you like. In the end, all the ado about it will have no effect other than the publicity and increased box office that Moore was probably after anyway. The way the voting goes in November will not be changed by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the most artful yet shameless propaganda since Baghdad Bob claimed that the US tanks were not about to roll into Baghdad. The exploitation of a mother who lost a son is inexcusable. Running audio only to depict the 9/11 attacks and hearing people ask "what's going on" was geared to imply that something was being "hidden". Showing Iraqui kids at play and then showing them in hospitals burned and maimed looked as if it came right off of Al Jesera. Showing a public execution in Saudi Arabia (beheading by sword) was uncalled for without first including WHY this man was being executed. At no time does Moore show Saddam Hussein harming ANYONE which is patently untrue. Moore dwells on how Bush "stole the election" and that this was somehow a racial issue ... including showing in a joint session of Congress how not one US Senator ... not John Kerry, not Bob Kerry, not even Ted Kennedy would "come to the defense" of black congressmen. This is shameful propaganda of the worst sort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore propaganda from a man who hates America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Propaganda film producer Michael Moore has the first amendment right of freedom of expression. That's the most I can say. Beyond this, he uses everything from trickery, selective editing, and outright lies to push forward his political agenda. Mr Moore would not know a true "fact" when presented with one. He should label his films as what they are - fiction - rather than as documentaries. In this particular film, Mr Moore uses the tragedy of September 11, 2001 - along with his opinions of the events to push his election-year agenda. It has been made clear from the past, that he hates President Bush, and his policies.Anyone with an IQ of 70 or greater is capable of picking through Mr Moore's film and finding that what he considers "facts" are either outright lies or manipulated conversations through creative editing. My first suggestion to people considering viewing this would be - Don't! Don't waste your time on seeing this anti-American propaganda film, Don't give Mr Moore any more money in his pockets for using the tragedy of those events to further his agenda. Barring this, however, if you decide you must go, keep in mind that just because he is a Hollywood millionaire, does NOT mean that he is a political expert. He does not have the same information that our elected officials have. Not that he needs it, because he makes up whatever he is lacking. Keep this in mind. Remember that you have the power to learn the truth, and just because someone put it on a screen, does not make it true.This film got big recognition in France, a country that is known for being against us to begin with 9except when they need us to bail them out of something). Hopefully, enough people see through Mr Moore's agenda, and he is financially and professionally "encouraged" to move to a socialist country like France, in which his political agendas would be more suited.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the most brazenly manipulative cake of lies with a thin coating of truth I have ever seen. Mr. Moore appears to have lost his way and taken the pay-off, shamelessly trying to shift blame away from those ultimately responsible. In time I suspect that his betrayal will be revealed to all, but not before the hoards of misinformed are scarred for life. This film is basically a non-linear tossed salad of truth and lies, an incomprehensible roller-coaster of grotesqueness. For those that have at least a basic understanding of what really happened on that fateful day, imagine standing in front of a firing squad with your eyes taped wide open while your body is fired at with poisonous darts, for two hours, and you will have a rough sense of what it is like to watch this film. Conversly, for those that accept the mainstream media's revisionist version of the truth of 911, prepare to be deeply insulted and patronized. Now, maybe I have no right to make any of the above statements, since I walked out about half way through (something I have never done, I even can sit through Bruckheimer films!), but judging by the looks on the faces of the crowd as I watched them leave the theater, walking away from this steaming heap of evil may be the surest sign of wisdom.

He went on to say the movie completely changed his opinion, and now he was voting for the other guy this Nov. After a sobering conversation with another friend in particular, who happened to hold a masters' degree in business, I finally saw the movie.My opinion: Well said, 007-what a crock.One thing I find funny is the hard-line opinion of right-wingers, who say it's crap without having seen the film. But what absolutely disgusts me is the stupidity of this new band of Michael Moore-followers that have seen the movie and have completely swallowed it without having checked a single fact for themselves.'But what about Rush Limbaugh, etc?' The right may have Rush Limbaugh, but neither Limbaugh, Hannity, nor O'Reilly ever made a mass-consumable movie about pres. Clinton, re: White Water, China, or Lewinski. If this movie holds a single shred of truth, where is the cry for impeachment? Not even Michael Moore has been able to get a petition for impeachment to be taken seriously. I never saw Bowling for Columbine, but now Moore's credibility is absolutely ruined with me. This 'facts' of this 'documentary' are so over-the-top they would almost read like a comedy, if it weren't for the shock scenes and crying mothers, I'd almost think the Spinal Tap guys were behind it. I am absolutely disgusted with this obvious distortion of facts, and I will never watch another Moore movie. Hollywood has absolutely disappointed me by continuing to distribute this film.

He does not schedule meetings with people, he just blindsides them with stupid comments, and tries to get a reaction, and when they react like any normal human being does, he acts like it is a disgrace against god. Moore tries to have the same impact that Bowling did, But it is way off.

It presents a lot of peculiar facts. Of course all those small pieces of reality should make one wonder what kind of guy the US president actually is. But instead of just showing the facts, Moore cannot refrain from jumping to conclusions - moreover, he becomes a simple manipulator just as the man he's chasing. Moore is not a bad film maker, not at all, this piece is technically candidating for an A+. But to let the very plot make an over-stating fool of itself, which ALMOST happens towards the ending of Bowling for Colombine, is a mistake, which Morre this time he carries out to the bitter end.

It's okay for him to denigrate another but when simple valid questions about the balance of his film, he gets overly defensive. Kudos to Katie as a media reporter.I think it is time the Bush family makes a documentary about Moore. After all, fair is fair. What goes around comes around. Either that or Moore could star in the next Morgan Spurlock's documentary and perhaps a sequel titled "SUPER SIZE ME 2," a story about a couch-potato whose opinion we should all listen to. That, or a tale about a trip between the fridge and the film editing seat where clips of other people's film shoots are carefully cut to express a particular view. Don't get mad at this, Mr. Moore. After all, you should support free speech and respect other people's opinions too. Even though some views are not as profitable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you look up the noun "deceit" in the dictionary, you will find that the definitions point you to the verb "deceive." According to Webster's 9th New Collegiate Dictionary, the main (non-archaic or obsolete) definition of "deceive" is "to cause to accept as true or valid what is false or invalid."Now there are many examples throughout the movie of what I call MM-Facts, or Michael Moore Facts. MM-Facts are nothing more than deceitful tidbits designed to lead the useful idiots to pushing his agenda. Sadly, many "reasonable" people are being led by this man...and if any of them even checked the truth on half the facts they would see that Moore is a sham.Here is the first of scores of examples: The film shows CBS and CNN calling Florida for Al Gore. According to the narrator, 'Then something called the Fox News Channel called the election in favor of the other guy?.All of a sudden the other networks said, 'Hey, if Fox said it, it must be true.'We then see NBC anchor Tom Brokaw stating, 'All of us networks made a mistake and projected Florida in the Al Gore column. It was our mistake.'Moore thus creates the false impression that the networks withdrew their claim about Gore winning Florida when they heard that Fox said that Bush won Florida.In fact, the networks which called Florida for Gore did so early in the evening-before polls had even closed in the Florida panhandle, which is part of the Central Time Zone. NBC called Florida for Gore at 7:49:40 p.m., Eastern Time. This was 10 minutes before polls closed in the Florida panhandle. Thirty seconds later, CBS called Florida for Gore. And at 7:52 p.m., Fox called Florida for Gore. Moore never lets the audience know that Fox was among the networks which made the error of calling Florida for Gore prematurely. Then at 8:02 p.m., ABC called Florida for Gore. Only ABC had waited until the Florida polls were closed.At 10:00 p.m., which network took the lead in retracting the premature Florida result? The first retracting network was CBS, not Fox.Over four hours later, at 2:16 a.m., Fox projected Bush as the Florida winner, as did all the other networks by 2:20 a.m.CBS had taken the lead in making the erroneous call for Gore, and had taken the lead in retracting that call. At 3:59 a.m., CBS also took the lead in retracting the Florida call for Bush. All the other networks, including Fox, followed the CBS lead within eight minutes. That the networks arrived at similar conclusions within a short period of time is not surprising, since they were all using the same data from the Voter News Service. (Linda Mason, Kathleen Francovic &amp; Kathleen Hall Jamieson, 'CBS News Coverage of Election Night 2000: Investigation, Analysis, Recommendations' (CBS News, Jan. 2001), pp. 12-25.)So, how can the cerebral person actually take any of this movie seriously when it is entirely made up of this type of "fact"? If you like this movie I recommend other historical fiction like the Patriot, Braveheart, Nixon, JFK or Ken Burns' Baseball.</fullReview>

The only "doc" in this documentary is "doc"tored truths. C'mon, Mr. Moore...do your REALLY expect me to believe that Osama Bin Laden financed the Bush campaign?? If any of the allegations in this movie had any truth, then George Bush would have been impeached two years ago. There are plenty of us who would have made absolute sure that the man was put in jail for life! I must hand it to the forces of free speech, though. 50 years ago, this type of overt, falsified character-assassination would have been considered treasonous. I celebrate the freedom in this country that gives Michael Moore the ability to make his movie and sell it. However, I believe that self-proclaimed journalists have a moral responsibility to put aside there personal hatred in the name of finding the truth, instead of putting aside the truth to promote their hatred. Sometimes the truth may actually change their opinion. Shame on you Michael Moore. You truly bring shame on us liberals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ya know, Mike Moore was a great documentary filmmaker. Roger &amp; Me and Bowling for Columbine were personal favorites of mine, and I liked his TV shows too. So this movie was a really tremendous disappointment. I went in expecting another great documentary - I thought that the controversy simply came from the issues themselves, not from the way the movie was made. I was wrong. Moore makes it pretty clear from the beginning that the purpose of the movie is not to explore the dangerous implications of the patriot act, or to investigate the circumstances and causes of 9/11, but rather to insult George W. Bush. Those other issues are just to back up this main point - "Bush sucks". The shot of Moore's first encounter with Bush, where Bush dropped a casual insult "you ought to get a real job", is the giveaway. This is his answer to that insult, that's all.

		<fullReview>Whether or not Michael Moore has deliberately misled America more than George W. Bush ever did on Iraq, the end result of his hateful crusade is a muddled, underdeveloped mess that doesn't flesh out any of its themes. Moore has potential to be either a director of a hilarious political satire or a frightening dystopia film, but he can't have it all of the times.Moore oversteps himself on 9/11 by attempting to link together absolutely everything that he felt went wrong in the last four years and pin it on the shoulders of one man. The first hour deals with sophomoric allegations linking the Bin Ladens to Bush, Dick Cheney's ties to Enron, the president's capitalization on 9/11, which really are not incriminating enough to frighten. For me personally, the movie did point out some alarming questions, but did absolutely nothing to answer those questions in a convincing manner. Moore's movie only hits its stride in the final minutes when it attempts to link this system of wars to George Orwell's famous novel. Much like his marine recruiters pictured, Moore betrays all of our trust by assuming he cannot convince any reasonably informed person and trying to enlist the lower tier using twists, half-truths, sweet talking, and I'm afraid I must say it, full blown lies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fahreneit 9/11 Distorts the Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see 'Fahrenheit 9/11' Thursday expecting to be entertained despite political objections, but I was wrong. To say Moore took liberty with the truth would be like saying that Ken Lay took liberties with Enron's accounting practices. Fahrenheit 9/11,' like Enron's accountants, obviously figured that when it came to making money, the end justified the means. In both cases, the scale of deceit and deception is breathtaking. Though I'd need four hours to tell you the list of all the falsehoods from Moore's two-hour movie, let me give you a few glimpses into his twisted logic: Moore's movie begins by pitching his conspiracy theory about the 2000 election. We're all told in the audience by all recounting methods Al Gore won Florida. That drew a big gasp from the crowd. But, shockingly, this first fact cited by Moore's movie is a lie. Didn't anybody associated with Miramax or Michael Moore's movie read newspapers after the election, when some of America's most liberal papers published results from their independent review of Florida's ballots, concluding it was George W. Bush who won by all recounting methods?And what of the second conspiracy theory, suggesting that George W. Bush kept Americans grounded after 9/11 but let the bin Laden family escape American airspace scot-free? An FBI agent suggested President Bush's action was an insult to 3,000 dead Americans, while Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan dramatically demands on tape that we must have an investigation to find out who approved this.But Michael and the senator both know who approved the bin Laden transfer: It was none other than that Bush-bashing hero of the left, Richard Clarke. He admitted it in the 9/11 Commission. Now, it's funny how Michael Moore used Clarke's 9/11 testimony to bash Bush in other parts of the movie, but decided to edit out that part that lays waste to bin Laden-and- Bush conspiracy theory.These two gross distortions are in the first five minutes of the film. But I can tell you that this film can only add to coarsening of America's democracy. Moore seems to promote the following slanderous conspiracy theories in his movie: The Bushes and the bin Ladens were so close that Bush let their family skip out of town while Americans were grounded, That the bin Laden family somehow helped George W. Bush start his first oil company, and that George W. Bush cares more about Saudi Arabia than America because the Saudis funneled $1.4 billion to Bush family interests. America didn't invade Afghanistan to kick out the Taliban. America attacked Afghanistan so we could put an oil pipeline in Afghanistan. That's why George Bush didn't care if the Taliban got away. (Oh, really? I don't think they got away.) The White House purposely tried to scare Americans into believing there was a terror threat after 9/11 so they could pass the Patriot Act, which they had already dreamed up before these 9/11 attacks even occurred.We invaded Iraq for no other reason than their oil, allowing young American kids to die just so oil companies could make more money. Now, there are hundreds of conspiracy theories that are simply unsupported by the facts. But Moore goes on to show pictures of dead Iraqi babies, followed immediately by American soldiers talking about the rush they got listening to rock C.D.s while they shot at anything they moved in Iraq. Why didn't Moore just write "baby killers" on the screen and point to U.S. troops? I guess I shouldn't be surprised that Michael Moore would make this kind of movie, but I am stunned that movie critics, Hollywood moguls and liberal movie viewers across America really think so little of America, its soldiers and its leaders. Friends, it's a dark, grim and distorted perspective of our great nation. I think it's just wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I am not going into detail about specifics of this film. But, Moore has become the premier propagandist of not the political documentary, but the "Doctoredmentary" or as some call it the Crockumentary. Just like he did in Bowling For Columbine, Moore presents "his facts" in half truths, omissions, clever edits, lies, misinformation and falsities to tell the story he wants told, or believes should be told. He presents a story that is conflict with many facts that have come out. One of the main ones being the Bin Laden families leaving. The 9/11 commission of both Democrats and Republicans have stated that what Moore presents is not true here. This isn't the only incident of don't let the facts get in the way of your telling a good but incorrect story of which there are many.Moore has taken over the mantel of propaganda like no one else since Joseph Goebbels and Lani Riefenstahl.He has made the ambush interview and the clever editing of other interviews to give the appearances of different times and places and basically taking things out of context just to validate his point of view.The truth be damned, Michael Moore has a story to tell and he will tell it his way.Michael Moore would Make Joseph Goebbels proud and more than likely is in fact applauding from the grave over Moore's latest propaganda. How this gets considered to be a documentary, God only knows, but I always thought that documentaries had to have facts in them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any other lies you want to spew Mr. Moore. Good thing free speech comes without the idea behind it that it should not be lies also. Just like the shooting in Colorado, you do a good job of using tragedy in America to make yourself richer. Also using this tragedy to push you radical leftist liberal ways. You should be blaming Clinton and the terrorists who did this terrible deed, not the Bush administration. As always the Libs do a good job of pushing this crap out and calling it entertainment. I am never surprised when I see this but I am surprised that so many people will go see this crap. If you don't like the country you live in get out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavy-handed piece of political propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has clearly provoked strong reactions and that is a very positive thing. It has also helped break down some of the political apathy that plagues the West. Another positive thing. However, as a documentary it resorts to bludgeoning its viewers with its ideology rather than advocating for it and that I found hard to swallow. I have enjoyed Moore's efforts being a fan of the Awful Truth and even finding Bowling for Columbine thought-provoking but there were too many strained conclusions in this movie for me to not rebel. There were probably three key points that nauseated me: 1) It assumed its audience would be basically ignorant of most of its key premises (or possible alternative facts and hence conclusions), 2) It drew the worse possible conclusions from the facts available or the conclusion most suggestive of Bush family incompetence or conspiracy, and 3) It was definitely not above using its subjects in the worse possible way either to be held up to ridicule or manipulated for its own purposes. One key example - the Bushes are responsible for special treatment of Saudi Arabia... The US and the Saudis have had a close relationship for decades and Saudi Arabia has long been seen as one of the few Allies the US has in the Middle East. This is a relationship which has been extremely valuable to the US and will continue to be, regardless of the President of the moment. The Wahabist involvement in terrorism is well-known as is the funding coming out of Saudi however, that doesn't change the fundamental state relationships. That it got a rousing ovation at Cannes is certainly no surprise - it played right up to the prejudices of the Europeans and Hollywood's liberal luminaries. Some interesting and important points could have been made in this film - it is just a shame they weren't. As propaganda this film was highly successful, as a piece of advocacy it was sadly lacking.</fullReview>

Isn't it amazing that if Michael Moore isn't trying expose something he is tying to tear at your heartstrings with what is wrong with America...example Bowling for Columbine. Why does his ugly mug have to be on the cover &amp; movie posters of all his films? He isn't a movie star although he is now trying to be. Get this guy out of the camera and off my TV screen as well. He showed his true low class self by attending the G.O.P convention. Just what is this guy trying to prove, that he is as obnoxious as he is fat and ugly?

		<fullReview>One of the basic lessons one learns in English class is how to effectively create a persuasive essay in order to clearly articulate one's point. When one looks at the work of Michael Moore as an essay, it appears that he never learned that lesson. His films not only lack a clear thesis, but they also rely upon faulty information in order to try and create a picture Moore wants to present. However, in the end, Moore's films are not works of art. Instead, they are just angry rants like the ones on an internet message board. This was shown with the unclear portrait painted in 2002's 'Bowling for Columbine,' and it is shown again in Moore's film, 'Fahrenheit 9/11.' 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is a film not only made up of the already refuted claims of the far left, but it also lacks a clear thesis, only relying on the 'evil and incompetent' persona of George W. Bush to tie the film together which results in a poorly made finished product. Moore's film touches on several issues the angry left has levied against the Bush administration over the past four years, many with little basis in fact. His technique is to pile these accusations together mixing them in the film, confusing the viewer as how they are linked together. Moore goes from point to point, lacking clear transition and failing to develop a thesis. The points Moore has are these:1. Bush was falsely elected. 2. Bush did nothing more than vacation before the attacks on September 11th, not preparing at all for the possibility of terrorist attacks. 3. Once the attacks occurred, Bush waited to respond in Afghanistan because he had an army buddy who, back in the 1970s did business with the bin Laden family. In addition to that, Bush's father, as a private citizen, worked extensively in Saudi Arabia for the Carlyle Group. 4. Bush reacted too soon in Afghanistan because American business interests wanted to build a natural gas pipeline across Afghanistan. 5. After the attacks on September 11th, Bush prepared the public too much for the possibility of terrorist attacks. 6. America ended the peaceful regime of President Saddam Hussein in search of more oil for Bush's buddies. 7. To invade Iraq, Bush turned young, poor Americans looking for easy money and an education into death squads, massacring Iraq's civilian population.A well-formed documentary would use such 'facts' as puzzle pieces and form a complete picture with them to suit the director's need. Moore fails to do this. Moore, at the beginning of the film, paints Bush as an incompetent and corrupt man unfit to be president. The rest of the film is just repetitive. He just states his point in different ways with different 'facts.' He never completely develops the 'facts' he finds. Instead, he just goes into them enough to bash Bush, and then moves on to go after Bush some more.This was the same problem with 'Bowling for Columbine.' I left that film feeling it was randomly put together to show the audience that the problem with gun violence in America is complicated and there are no easy answers. One could blame gun violence on bowling as easily as on rock music or on lax gun control laws. However, after watching '9/11' I realized that the lack of a coherent point is just a common flaw in the work of Moore. In 'Columbine,' Moore pointed to a variety of possible causes for gun violence, but he never settled on one. The same is true with '9/11.' What is the effectiveness to show Bush's distant ties to members of the bin Laden family? Does Moore want to say that bin Laden and Bush were working on September 11th together? Why did Moore discuss a natural gas pipeline across Afghanistan? Does he want to say that Bush was counting on bin Laden to bomb the United States so that he would have the justification to invade Afghanistan so US companies could build such a pipeline? These and other points are just left hanging. Moore does not have a thesis other than 'Bush is stupid, corrupt, and evil.' This does not work. He needs something more, but he does not have anything else.Now, if Moore's 'documentary' stated that there was a large scale conspiracy involving the Bush administration, bin Laden, and the oil companies, he would have succeeded in making an untrue, yet a well-made film. Instead, Moore gathers random puzzle pieces filled with half-truths and speculation together and does not make a coherent picture with them. It feels like a half-finished film. Where is Moore going with the film? What is his point? Does he have a developed thesis? It appears that he does not. If this film actually had a thesis, it would be more successful. The 'facts' that Moore presents are based more on speculation than anything else. For example, he often narrates over George W. Bush, telling the viewer what the president is likely thinking. Is he thinking what Moore is saying? Probably not. Only someone as creative as Michael Moore would state that Bush is thinking about a National Guard buddy he had thirty years before who had business ties with the bin Laden family. For some of the more ludicrous claims, such as the before mentioned ties to Saudi Arabia and the bin Laden family, Moore spends a good portion of time, trying to make the accusation creditable, but only succeeds to criticize Bush for the distant ties to Saudi Arabian royalty and the bin Laden family. Remember, this is at the same time he is condemning the Bush administration for saying there were ties between Iraq and Al Qaida. It is interesting to note that the ties between Saddam and bin Laden are much easier to find than the ties between Bush and Osama. Another large part of Moore's film is that the Bush administration has created a 'climate of fear' with the American public, constantly warning them about the possibility of further terrorist attacks. As a viewer of this film, I asked, 'Now Moore is bashing the Bush administration for warning the public about the possibility of terrorist attacks? Was he not just bashing the Bush administration for not vigilant about the possibility of terrorist attacks? Moore has many such contradictions in his film.When Moore lacks facts in this film, he turns to personal testimonies. He finds one woman in Flint, Michigan who lost her son in Operation Iraqi Freedom and is now against the war. This woman is seen in four different segments of the film, only twice being identified as the mother of a fallen soldier. In all four of these segments, she is wearing different articles of clothing. To an untrained observer, one might think there are three women. That is just an example of the type of trickery Moore utilizes in this film.The sad part about this film is all the hatred that Moore directs at Bush. One scene, near the end of the film, shows this very well. The woman mentioned above goes to Washington to go to the White House. She talks to an Iraqi protester who states that Bush has killed his countrymen. She then answers that Bush killed her son, too. That is what Moore is trying to say throughout the film: Bush is responsible for all the deaths since 9/11 due to his greed. However, Moore knows, like everyone knows, that Bush is the wrong target for such accusations. Moore's film tries to make the target in this war a domestic one. Like many liberals, Moore has been against Bush since before day one. He does not care who succeeds in the War on Terror as long as it is not Bush. This is not the way we need to be in America. We should be able to criticize our leaders, but not to wage battle against them like Moore is doing in this film. Moore needs to turn his attention to the true enemies of September 11, 2001, not attack the man who has the most difficult job in the post-9/11 world.However, Michael Moore has made a film meant to attack not Osama bin Laden, but President George W. Bush. His film, Fahrenheit 9/11, is trying to convince the public not to reelect George W. Bush. However, it is not complete. It only gathers together speculation and hearsay, never creating a coherent work on why to oppose the reelection of President George W. Bush. There is no guide- no thesis- to show how these puzzle pieces Moore has gathered fit together. I wish that there was a deeper meaning to this film, something that was worth the hype, but there is not. The film is just like a poorly-written essay by a member of the angry left about the past four years. There is nothing in the film that conspiracy theorists have not heard before and that has not already been debunked by others. The film is not only out of date but is also poorly constructed. If this type of propaganda is the best the liberals can produce, I say, 'Bring it on.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very exciting but not factual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caution... Spoilers ahead! This movie is trouble, not because it's factual; because it isn't, but because it's emotionally powerful. It is chock full of distortions, misrepresentations, falsehoods and is hugely biased. Unfortunately, it does work to stir people (particularly the ill-informed) and there was at least one breakout into applause at one of the most deceptive parts. The trouble with this movie is that too many people seem to believe its message and that is pretty scary. People applauded at the end where he was interviewing Congressmen about having their children join the military and "help out" with the war effort in Iraq. The implication is that we are at war, not because if the 911 attack, but because our government has no skin in the game. He implies that if our Congressmen and Senators had children in the military, that we might not be in a war with Iraq. He points out that only one member of congress has a child in the military. When he sticks a camera in their faces on the street, and asks congressmen to have their children join the war effort, they look at him like he is crazy. The fact is that most any reasonable person put in the same position would do the same. It's a trap used to make a normal reaction appear to be somehow related to the question of whether or not we should be at war. Perhaps someone forgot to tell Michael that we have an all volunteer military. Isn't it easy to understand why so few congress people have children in the military? If you counted how many congressional children are lawyers, or politicians, you would see larger number because that's who those people are. The task I have now is to find out which congressperson has a child in the military, and then to find out which way that congressperson voted on the war. If this person voted against the war, then Michael may have a point. If this person voted for the war, then Michael's argument in this case is fallacious and because virtually every other argument is flawed, this makes his entire movie a falsehood. There are many sickening parts to the movie. In one, he follows the distraught mother of a killed American soldier around and captures her raw grief as she lashes out against anyone and everyone who might be responsible or her son's death. Only the Al Qaeda, Iraqi militants and former Bath party members escape her wrath. Another sickening element is that he portrays the Bush family as criminal because they are rich and powerful. In this country, success is good, but too much success makes you a target. Michael makes much of the connections between the Bush's and the Saudi's but he doesn't really mention that the Bush's were successful in the oil business long before daddy Bush was president. It is guilt by association and good old smearing.How about the part where he makes a big deal out of getting the 24 or so Bin Laden family members out of the U.S.A. on 9/13/01. Michael tries hard to make an evil connection between the Bush's, the Bin Laden's and Osama. He doesn't mention that Osama Bin Laden is an extremist outcast from the Bin Laden family nor does he mention that one evil brother does not a whole family of murders make. If Timothy McVeigh's family were held and questioned about what Timmy decided to do in Oklahoma, there would be a deafening outcry from the left. The reason the Bin Laden's were evacuated from this country on 9/13/01 is because intelligent people were aware that ignorant people like those Moore caters to would put that family in danger because of their ethnicity and last name. Michael is a very angry and hateful person who is trying hard to get others to join in with his particular brand hatred of the Bush administration. There are mindless millions who will certainly join in. What happens to a democracy when uninformed or ill-informed millions go out to do the voting?Something else I learned from watching this movie and the reaction of the audience is that there appears to be a majority of people (at this movie anyway) who blindly believe what they see on the screen, and they have no apparent ability to use critical thinking skills to test or challenge the validity of what is shown.I would really like to see factual point by point challenge to this movie in the form of another movie titled "Cooling off Fahrenheit 911".This movie is not a documentary, it is a political satire that falls far short of documentary status.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a lot of truth in Michael Moore's film. During its first eight months, the Bush administration did ignore the threat of terrorism. They have been protective of Saudis involved with extremists. And the war in Iraq not only had little to do with terrorism, but it actually interfered with the war on terrorism by diverting resources.However, Moore does so much grandstanding going for the cheap laugh that he damages his own credibility. Moore seems to put entertainment before informing, which is why `Fahrenheit 9/11' is something less than a good film. While it may cause many to justly question the Bush administration's policies, this movie will also mislead many viewers into thinking this is what a well made documentary looks like -- and `Fahrenheit 9/11' is nothing like a well made documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After sitting through this extra-ordinarily boring documentary, I have a little better insight as to how our society really is. Apparently wars aren't meant to be won, Bush invaded Iraq to make him and his friends rich, and the small town of Flint has a surprisingly high number of armed forces recruiters for its size. I had no idea. Michael Moore starts off saying the election was a sham, and that Gore really won. He failed to mention all the uncounted servicemen votes that were overseas (that were strongly in favor of Bush). And wasn't it Al Gore himself gaveling those "minorities" into silence in the joint-congress? I must say I didn't understand many points he tried to make in the film. Most of it was boring rambling about over-hashed topics.I must say, however, that I enjoyed seeing the brush-off he received from all those senators. They know to avoid him because he will take their comments and edit them into submission.I don't like a lot of aspects of this war, but there has never been a war that I did like every aspect of. War sucks, but is sometimes necessary. I've spoken to numerous people that actually served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they all tell me they need to be there. They support the President, the war, and their leaders. Michael Moore hates America. He's not a terrorist, but he is supporting them indirectly by undermining the very effort to rid the world of them.I don't have room for a point-by-point dispute about this film, so I'll just finish by saying everyone should see it, just so they can see how poorly this documentary was made. It had no tied ends, and had no real point. It reminded me of Bowling for Columbine -- One big massive effort to push his own political agenda. It won't work. Americans are too smart to be fooled by this transparent ploy. I must say to Michael, however, that he mastered the press on getting free publicity by "suddenly" realizing Miramax wouldn't do the film... a full year after the fact. Oh - and pleading for a PG-13 rating, while leaving occurrences of the F word and some extreme violence in, all of which were pointless... that was a great way to get attention too. Good job Michael.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was extremely disappointed on viewing this film. As a frame of reference, I have seen Moore's earlier film ROGER &amp; ME and this film does not compare to it in a list of ways. Where Roger &amp; Me is intelligent, this effort is like Moore being on Crystal Meth when he wrote the script. His teeth &amp; cutting edge appear to have rotted.Roger &amp; Me contained factual &amp; balanced content. Fahrenheit 9/11 contains little fact &amp; no balance within it's content. Roger &amp; Me actually took a subject &amp; made sense in addressing it. Fahrenheit 9/11 takes a subject (BUSH) &amp; attempts to smear it using political innuendo.Roger &amp; Me has a lot of great humor within the film along with it's valid criticisms of what happened in Flint, Michigan. Fahrenheit 9/11 has a little humor, but tends to be "preaching to the church choir(Democrats)" in order to achieve those laughs. That is the definition of cheap humor. The reference to Flint, Michigan in Fahrenheit 9/11 is an interesting picture, but it is the same picture that was in ROGER &amp; ME and yet Moore is trying to blame the current President for past events. The reason for that is obvious, it was the Democrats &amp; Clinton who voted for NAFTA &amp; GAAT which are 2 of the reasons Flint still looks like a bombed out city now. All of Flint's problems really began with the 1986 Federal Tax law changes, &amp; even Moore isn't smart enough to know that. Moore is a talented film maker. Unfortunately, his paranoid agenda ruins this effort. It is a shame to see this decline. Moore obviously made this film to make money. It is a shame to see him sell out to make a quick cheap buck, but that is what happened with this movie. He has lost touch with original skill used in making earlier movie.</fullReview>

If you want my reasoning, read all the articles at www.moorelies.com, including War, Lies, and Videotape or read all the books that are out that have clear sources to the evidence. In short, Moore lies, deceives, edits out, and avoids things in order to trick you. At the beginning, you see Gore during the 2000 election with a sign behind him saying Florida VICTORY. Moore than dares to say that the election had been stolen from the dems. Excuse me, Bush won the electorate fair and square and secondly, the footage shown takes place before election night- Moore is already deceiving us. He shows us images of fake newspapers that were clearly made up if you carefully examine and he shows clips and interprets them negatively without showing the whole footage which would twist his very words if he did. I could go on and on about his deception- jees, no wonder he never has the balls to debate with conservative republicans who can tear down his documentary in nothing flat. If you wish to see it, be skeptical- maybe all of the "documentary" is false. Miserable 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine was somewhat careless and at times bordered on left-wing propaganda although overall it had an intelligent and thoughtful message, but this new film makes no bones about its outward sole intention of attacking the Bush administration. Now don't misunderstand me, I believe that Bush is a cynical, manipulative, lying, self-serving and incompetent President, but I don't think that Michael Moore's particular brand of self aggrandisement does anything to discredit Bush - if anything it discredits his opponents by association.Moore's "discoveries" about Bush and the aftermath of September the 11th are fairly uninteresting to be honest and his conclusions are clearly flawed and in fact play directly to that race-baiting culture which Moore claims to hate. It is however interesting and at least pretends to be a piece of interesting creative journalism. The second half is nowhere near as instructive, informative or tasteful. Shocking shots of dead children and mangled soldiers are overlaid with Moore's particular brand of commentary, which varies from the coldly snide to the openly vitriolic. Interviews with surprisingly ignorant soldiers are tempered by the realisation that all of these men are in fact low-ranking teenagers, and their opinions tell you nothing about the overall war in Iraq (and they probably aren't that representative anyway). Finally we finish, as Moore loves to, with a loud, obnoxious rant, in which we see a grieving mother splashed across the scene as Moore yells at passing politicians, and various obnoxious and irrelevant people interrupt the overblown sequence. You do feel sorry for the mother, but mainly because Michael Moore won't leave her alone. This is trashy and thoughtless, it came out too early to cover the incredible and appalling Abu Graib atrocities or the official reports into the blatant lies that were told about WMDs or Saddam's "links" with Al Quaeda and in my opinion, discredits Moore more than it does Bush, a sad follow up to the promising Bowling for Columbine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Propaganda as I have never seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most terrible movie that I have seen this year. Even though I consider myself an independent voter, just seeing this tripe would make me want to immediately discredit any person who Moore supports. We have not seen propaganda like this since the Nazi's produced brainwashing films for their own country. Yes there is a grain of truth included in the smoke that Michael Moore blows, yet it is so shrouded with biased opinions, one-sided arguments and ridiculous claims. I give the man credit for this film, he does have talent for a great fiction that I did have a good laugh at, and it did make me think. However, the movie was portrayed as a documentary when in actuality none of the video footage was supported by a source, many of the people interviewed were all of one opinion and it was definitely biased. So as a documentary, it is terrible and fails at all of the qualifications. As a fiction that made me think and laugh, I applaud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally think Micheal Moore is an ignorant bias blind and one sided man who is looking to make a quick dollar on our Nation's Tragedy. I think It's funny how in order to argue his point he has to cut and edit film footage to make it seem like his theories and supposed "hardcore facts" are some what worth the time to listen to. If you are going to argue a point don't take bits and pieces of something to form your opinion. I am also sick everyone saying Bush hates black people. not everything is a race issue. If I'm cut in front of in a line its not because of my skin color, religion, etc. Its the organizations responsible and Bush is just an easy scapegoat for the problems. Its the government in the gulf coast that controls what happens and the procedures. This is another tragedy for our nation and once again people are looking for an easy blame, and the easiest is to point to the leader of the United States. I'm proud I'm American and I would rather have Bush be President and go to war then have Kerry be President and let the Middle East walk all over us. America wasn't born on the fundamentals of a pacifist, we will take you down for any reason if you try to attack America in any way shape or form, America was built on sacrifice and the lives of soldiers in EVERY war, and should not be disgraced by those that don't "support the war" you don't need to support the cause, but you better support the troops, there out there for you, GOD BLESS America!-Meghann</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore shoots himself in the foot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not seen this film till now, I was surprised at how poor it is, given the praise heaped on it (not least at the Cannes festival). Moore has some very good points to make, and the daily evidence from post-war Iraq only serves to reinforce the main thrust of the anti-invasion argument, but much of them are lost in a welter of trivia and scatter-gun diatribe.Yes, Bush is a fool, but it's all too easy to make a fool look foolish. Yes, the connection made between Saddam and Osama was and is false, but jump-cut editing from one to the other is not the same as a counter-argument. Yes, the election was fraudulent, but presidents should be judged on their actions after taking office, and the stable door is now firmly bolted. By mixing serious points on these issues with frivolous ones, such as the allowing of matches and lighters on planes, Moore dilutes his main points and provides his detractors with ammunition. And by his unforgivable manipulation of the relatives of 9/11 and Iraq fatalities (whose permission he may not have sought), his distorted references to pre-invasion Iraq (which didn't invade or threaten America, but most certainly invaded Kuwait), his selection (and manipulation without permission of the victims ?) of tragic war footage, he, like his very target, turns truth into propaganda. What is comedy footage of national stereotypes (e.g. Iceland, and omitting Britain) doing in a serious stance on one-sided war alliances ?Way, way better (and refused by the American networks - what a surprise) is Adam Curtis's documentary series The Power of Nightmares, which ran on BBC Channel 2 in late 2004 and early 2005 but is due on DVD - see IMDb pages and http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4171213.stm (last amended January 2005). This is everything Moore's film should have been, a coherent and evidence-based argument against a myth of global terrorism which is responsible for everything post-9/11. Curtis's view is that there is a threat from Islamic and other terrorist cells and groups, but that there is no network of organised anti-western interests (from al-Qaeda or elsewhere), and that Bush has used this 'politically driven fantasy' to justify Iraq, Guantnamo Bay and all the rest. This series is, I believe, is worth ten of Mr Moore's piece, and should be seen by everyone in the US and UK administrations. BAFTA awards surely will follow*, hopefully igniting fresh interest from non-UK media.Michael Moore now has everything to do to make up for his lapse. Perhaps the reason for his film's success is that anything critical of Bush and the new fundamentalism is viewed as more subversive and anti-US than it is. The tragedy is that while Moore has been fully vindicated by events since this film was made, (so we are told) 50% of Americans still believe that Saddam, and not the Saudis and Pakistan, were behind 9/11. For Moore see Curtis, and soon, please.* BAFTA for Best Factual Series, April 2005.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyways so today I go with my cousin Chris to go watch Fahrenheit 9/11. I didn't want to see this crap *ahem, movie, but since I had to write a paper for it for my anthropology class, I decided to go. Let me just tell you that this film aroused passions in me that I didn't even know existed. First of all let me say this is an extremely important film, and it is the duty of all patriotic Americans to go watch this movie to see what the media muckrackers of the left are planning to conjure up next to sway the public opinion of many feeble-minded Americans. Anyways, I could honestly say that this is the biggest example of Yellow Journalism in the 21st century.Although many of the stories are true, the opinions are all Michael Moore's opinions and all his opinions are sadly misrepresented. First of all he shows our nations president, George W. Bush, as an incompetent, greedy, self-centered imbecile who doesn't give a damn about the United States, and get this Bush was actually friends with Osama Bin Laden!!! WHAT A LOAD OF BULLSH*T!!! THIS MOORE HAS SOME NERVE! Well all I can say is that his criticisms of the Bush Administration in his documentary is the truth was exaggerated and some of the stuff that he talked about was purely fiction! The part that upset me the most is how he compared the Iraq war with the war in Vietnam and how he said the Iraq War is worst than Vietnam, First of all let me get this one thing straight 55,000 Americans died in Vietnam because of a war that was caused by democrats, JFK and LBJ as the main factors, In the Iraq War of 2003-2004 only 600 Americans have died and we have won this war as well! AS A MATTER OF FACT ALL WARS HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY DEMOCRATS IN THE 20th CENTURY, with exception of Bush senior in 1991 with desert storm and that wasn't even a war, that was an police action! Anyways I all I wanna say is that Michael Moore is a man who wields extraordinary power over the minds of ignorant feeble-minded Americans who come to watch his movie, his weapons of course are his camera and his entertaining and comical style of production. He is also a man who self-proclaims himself as a defender of the underprivileged and the urban poor when he himself is a millionaire and stands to make substantial profit with this movie and get this he makes over $30,000 a speech when he talks at various colleges around the country. He degrades our armed forces in this film as well and den lifts the army back up when he interviews Mrs. Lipscomb (who lost a son in Iraq) this sort of inconsistency in his movies just displays the level of hypocrisy this man has. This film made me realize not to hate Bush and his administration , as Moore surely intended me to do, but to hate Moore and his blatant lies and his perverse vision of America. I also realized that Moore is a very powerful man and he will persuade many ppl to go against this great government because of his movie making skills and his entertainment skills, But he is the biggest Muckracker, Yellow Journalist there is out there and he is a Media Darling! Hah! Funny his core supporters are college students, HAH, Mr. Moore I laugh at your face, I am a college student, I am a minority, I am also an American who refuses to play your mind games and refuses to drown in your liberal hypocrisy!!! Anyways, Go watch that piece of leftist crap Farenheight 9-11 see if your one of the weak minded or one of the stronger minded. God Bless! Bush 2004! Supramaxx Rating 1/10</fullReview>

Moores 9/11 is classic Leni Riefenstahl, stunningly put together with skilled editing and haunting soundtrack and totally devoid of truth and accountability. and like Leni Riefenstahl 9/11 is very unnerving to watch.So I hope you can sleep easy with yourself Micheal, to have your work compared to one of the most infamous movie makers of all times, the Nazis female god moviemaker Leni Riefenstahl, sleep easy my friend, truth is a stubborn thing.</fullReview>

It is truly so sick of someone to think it is funny to attack your leader like this waste of skin Michael Moore has done.

		<shortDescription>The Unmovie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I love movies because they exist in some halfway fold between reality and pure abstractions. When we experience a movie as individuals we are working through ways of mapping the one world to another, giving a narrative sense to life. But of course we don't see movies as individuals but as societies, and that makes things ever so much more complicated.I am convinced, for instance, that movies define love to a large extent. And other things as well, especially what it means to be an American in this grand experiment of immigrants. But this isn't straightforward, nor any conscious plot: there are many folds and dependencies.Nonetheless, there is a strong tendency to adapt movie stories to political beliefs. This first washed upon America with Ronald Reagan - himself a film figure. He was able to stick to solid movie narratives to literally shape American's beliefs. His simple, movie-based 'sunshine in America' notion caught fire, even in the face of pesky facts.Since then, 'conservatives' have adopted the movie locomotive and hitched it to the similar dynamics of religion to build a story. 'Liberals' (how do these names get invented?) have the unentertaining job of trying to pry minds away from the comfortable movie narrative and explain that life is not so simple.They are always bound to lose, especially when business interests have a reason to feed the machine. So what to do? What to do?Well, you make a movie about how dumb the Republican movie is. You weave a metamovie, or if you can an 'unmovie' that dissolves the fiction with facts. But even an unmovie is a movie, so it needs a simple narrative. Moore is faulted because his simple narrative is similarly simpler than life.But here it is: Bush is a febrile dimwit manipulated by slick weasels. Saudis pull money from the west and then feed it back with obligations. Thinking of the world as a 'Bonanza' western is getting us in trouble and seriously hurting people.I'll credit Moore with extreme movie intelligence in spinning a simple story (incidentally based on facts) to deliberately destroy a similar simple movie story spun by The Powers (which unhappily flies in the face of facts). In doing so, Moore cleverly omits much. For example, he shows administration babblers claiming weapons of mass destruction and terrorist ties. And he then says nothing at all about the truth of these, because we all now know they are false. Having us fill the gaps with what we know from outside the film is masterful, like just showing us Bush's vacant face. Is his brain fried by his admitted drug and alcohol binges? Moore never even hints... except for four bars from JJ Cale's 'Cocaine' when mentioning Bush's year-long absence from military duty. Showing the preparation for the press announcements is similar genius: it shows that these guys are all about spinning their own movie. And that one sequence where he literally sets the Bushites in 'Bonanza' with the 'smoke 'em out' mantra puts us the viewers as those who are smoking out the truth at a higher level.This is masterful storytelling, and could be a milestone in changing, but not breaking, our ineluctable need to see the world as a movie.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take Michael Moore's mask off, you'll find where Osama has been hiding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be the most ridiculous compilation of half-truths and lies I have ever seen in my life. People want to believe what he is saying, so they will. Unfortunately, liberals are all about things being perfect now, no matter what it might cost their children. Take Clinton for example. He was a genius at the game of covering the big picture up, and blinding America with half-decent short-run economical decisions, which in the long run ran our economy down the drain. By the way, if you think a man who can sit in front of the entire country and lie to our faces about the Lewinsky thing, is fit to be our president, then god help you. It's not the fact that he got a bj, its the fact that he lied to America's face about it. If he could lie about that, think how many other issues he lied to your face about!! I'm not saying that Bush is the perfect president in any way, just that his decisions are going to benefit the world down the line, as opposed to Carey's lies and the way Carey flip-flops on every single issue, which may, like Clinton's presidency, look pretty good at the time, when hes out of there this country will be less than it was when he entered the presidency. A few weeks ago Senator Carey had been lobbying a bill that HE PROPOSED HIMSELF, and decided that it would be an inconvenience for him to vote that day; his bill got shot down by one vote. Is this the man you want making your decisions? Not me. OK I'll mention a few things from this "documentary". So Moore is trying to connect the Bush family with the Bin Laden family. HE FORGOT TO MENTION THAT THE BIN LADEN FAMILY DISOWNED OSAMA. There are over 100 Bin Ladens over the world, who share Osama's blood, and of course Bush is going to talk to them and clear them out of the country. Where else would you start when trying to track a person down? His family maybe? So now you have Osama's family helping America to track him down and kill him, don't you think your going to protect these people? I'm sure if I was a bouncer at a club on 9/11 and I saw an ID that says Bin Laden on it, I wouldn't have let that person leave with their life, and neither would the 50 other Americans standing around me. Point being, Mrs. Moore only told you what he wanted to, which was what you wanted to hear, and that was far from the truth. Even the EXTREMELY liberal News group, CBS or NBC, I can't remember which one exactly, agrees with me, that this movie is too much of a blatant lie and it might backfire in Moore's face, causing Carey to loose more votes than he gains. I know that the movie in no way endorses Carey, but you have to be one ignorant person to think Moore had intentions otherwise. To all the people making noise about his speech to the "elite", what else is he supposed to say to these people?! "I'm sorry fellas, I'm going to have to raise your income tax 20% to help cover all of the people who can't find time to get a job, they need more money than they could earn at full-time minimum wage, uh, sorry I can't help you out, don't vote for me." Is that what he was supposed to say? Thats what Carey would be saying. America was built around capitalism, but there seems to be more and more of a liberal push to socialism. I don't want to be paying all of the worthless people who would rather stand in line at the welfare office than go to work every day. I want to spend the money I EARN on things that I WANT. Not on drug addictions of others. America needs to wake up, because if things keep heading in the direction that they're going, there will be another Civil War. One last thing...remember how much Moore hates guns from Bownling for Columbine? Well he has armed body guards with him at all times. If we lived in Michael Moore's world, his body guards would be handing out flowers, and Moore would be shot dead with an illegal gun. A gun in good hands (i.e. a LEGAL gun) counters a gun in bad hands (i.e. an ILLEGAL gun). If there were no legal guns America would be like the state of Maryland, people held at gunpoint and walked to ATMs, people ringing your doorbell and robbing you like that, shootings left and right...just think about it please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from the darkness. I have commented on this despicable, loathsome, atrocious piece of garbage several times, and now after viewing it several times since my last review, I feel compelled to share how I really feel about "Fahrenheit 9/11", Michael Moore's vicious, deceitful "pack of lies" which sought to unseat our president, a man whom I (mostly) hold some of the highest regards for, and who is sorely and evilly misrepresented in this abomination of a "documentary". I would just like to entertain to anyone who actually believes that every detail in this "film" is irrefutable and merely "exposing the truth", to visit some of the countless websites laden with pages and pages of information of Moore's innumerable deceits, distortions, and "cut-and-paste" tactics throughout "Fahrenheit 9/11"... can you say... Centigrade 9-11? After borrowing the DVD of this despicable film and viewing it in the solitude of my own home, not surrounded by the poor, ignorant souls who so shamelessly praise all of Moore's "patriotic endeavors" that accompanied me in the theater (free admission) months ago, I came to really understanding how people who haven't a shred of an idea about the affairs of the world as well as the history that has advanced those affairs, might be inclined to believe that George W. Bush is a sordid, avaricious, contemptible, bumbling fool, who merely "stole" the 2000 election, concocted the worst terrorist attack on our nation's soil for political and financial gain, and endeavored into Iraq in "fooling" America that it posed a threat when, to quote the brilliant Jim McDermott, "There wasn't one". I would just like to share a few of the many, many, many deceits Moore has so insidiously crafted throughout "Fahrenheit 9/11", so that some of "the truth" might be exposed: The only reason released National Guard records showed James Bath's name blotted out was because Federal Law requires the National Guard to black out the names of any Guardsmen whose medical information was on the same pages as the records with which the Guard releasing Bush's health records- these privacy regulations were only enacted in April 2003, before Moore's "surprise" National Guard copy; Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia has been a bipartisan power-broker for decades, and President Clinton himself repeatedly relied on Bandar to advance his own Middle East agenda; Taliban officials came to Texas in 1997, yet what Moore neglects to tell us is that Bush never even conferred with them; Oregon State Police (and thus Oregon State government) is strictly responsible for its security; Saddam Hussein did order the murder of Americans, for example: he permitted Abu Nadal a safe haven, funded suicide bombers in Israel who killed Americans, and ordered in 1991 the assassination of the American Ambassador to the Phillipines; Iraqi intelligence documents from 1992 list bin Laden as an Iraqi intelligence asset; the enormous "defense budget cut" Moore indicts the Bush administration was held over from the Clinton administration, Bush being powerless until the following year to reverse it; 33% cut in military salary? try not initially supporting a special increase bonus of $75, but then changing positions and advocating the bonus; Moore has ZERO evidence that Bush did not view the Aug. 6, 2001 terrorism briefing; Bush on vacation 42% of first eight months in office? try meeting with leaders and traveling across the nation in giving initiatives, briefing on the budget, meeting with foreign leaders (e.g. Tony Blair), which, if you detract weekends, which Presidents typically spend in Camp David to work on initiatives, accounts to only 13% time on "vacation"!; and on and on and on... Not to mention some of Moore's horrendous hypocrises: "praising" our troops and mourning their losses? Ha! Here's a guy that openly proclaimed on his website: "The Iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not "insurgents" or "terrorists" or "The Enemy". They are the REVOLUTION, the Minutemen, and their numbers will grow, and they will win. Sounds pretty sickening, especially considering that Moore pretends to be "on the side" of the troops and their families when he is actually advocating the ENEMY! Not to mention his eerie presentation of 9/11, recalling it to be a horrible, unforgettable event. Yeah, for any person of rationale and sanity! Moore on September 12, 2001: "I don't know why we're making such an issue of terrorism in this country. You're more likely to get struck by lightning than get killed by a terrorist." Despicable, isn't it. But wait, there's "Moore": (Referring to the heroic passengers who brought the plane down in Shanksville, PA): "The passengers were scaredy-cats because they were mostly white..." How can anybody with a shred of humanity and intelligence advocate or believe anything this MONSTER of a human being says or does? I am merely trying to expose the truth about a man whom many people have deemed a "great American patriot", and let you, as fellow citizens and thinking people, be the judge. President Bush was thankfully re-elected on November 2, and thus "Fahrenheit 9/11" deemed a miserable failure! Let's continue to show that our people are alive and functioning in sanity and not in sheer lunacy! I hope you're happy, Michael Moore... Zero Stars out of Four</fullReview>

Also it seemed full of cheap shots at George Bush using editing, using this method anyone can be made to look stupid. I was hoping for a balanced viewpoint, it was far too one sided. I must agree with other posters that the anguish of the bereaved mother was overplayed.

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is not a bad propagandist. He does many things skilfully. Note for example how he never actually says that members of the Bin Laden family have not been interrogated about about Osama and his whereabouts. He just repeats that it would have been reasonable to interrogate them, thereby creating the impression that they have not been interrogated, and that they probably know where Osama is! Have they been interrogated? Well, this movie sure doesn't answer that question. Neither does it provide any other answers. It does provide impressions and insinuations. Impressions and insinuations that almost without one single exception are false, and often blatantly so.You need a LOT of knowledge to see through Moore's propagandist lies. Now, if he just could bother to make his movies look good, then maybe he will be remembered in the future as the Leni Riefenstahl of the 21st century. If not, he will just be remembered as a big liar, or maybe not at all.If you are thinking of seeing this movie, see Fahrenhype 9/11 first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting choice of words from David Oldfield (an Australian Member of Parliament) after seeing this movie and giving it a rating of 10/10 as a propaganda film: "The ilk of which I haven't seen since Goebbels (Nazi Propaganda Minister). Michael Moore simply preys on the prejudices of the bleeding hearts and I saw it as a film of considerable misinformation. This is not a documentary because there is no balance to it. He writes specifically from the perspective of doing nothing but attacking George W. Bush, the Bush family and the Bush administration. You can write a dirty story about Gandhi if you set out to do it. It's very easy to make someone look bad when they have no opportunity for rebuttal.There's no skill in making war look terrible. Hiroshima was a terrible event but it ended war in the Pacific and saved millions of lives."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has many admirers, has won awards and made a lot of money. It was also one of the talking points of 2004. Unusual for a documentary. It is also utter rubbish, unless you're a leftist Bush hater, in which case Michael Moore is your god. This is absolutely not a documentary. A documentary must at least try to present a fair and balanced view of the facts. This never makes any attempt at that. Instead it's a continuous tirade against Bush and all he stands for. Now Bush is an idiot. Everyone except half the American electorate knows that. But if this had been anything other than a movie then Bush and Co. would have had, and deserved, a right of reply. As it stands it's a flawed work, preaching only to the converted. It fails in Moore's aim of convincing anyone but those with the feeblest of minds who always believe the last thing they are told. There is certainly a case to be made against Bush and his policies, the fact that Moore hasn't made it does us all a disservice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and muddled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the most important aspect of any documentary is the ability to entertain its audience. This does not mean it must be "fun." It can be moving, disturbing, or horrifying. But I think that, at the least, it should be able to maintain a viewer's interest ? if a filmmaker has succeeded at this, he has succeeded -- period. There could be thousands of lies in Fahrenheit 9/11, but if the overall product of these fibs entertained me I might be willing to at least recommend it based solely on thus.Alas, F-9/11 didn't really grab my interest at all. This has nothing to do with my political or social beliefs. I didn't agree with Bowling for Columbine but I still heavily recommended it and found it fascinating and well made.Fahrenheit is not well made. Moore resorts to one thing he has, up until this point in time, all so narrowly avoided: downright propaganda. Whereas his earlier films had moments of sarcastic wit and dry humor, a relief from the heavy-handed nature of the program, 9/11 has virtually none. No amusing interviews by Moore in which he tracks down reluctant interviewees, no unique animation sequences. In fact, there's barely any Moore here at all! Sure, he narrates the thing, but we see him so rarely, one begins to forget he's doing more than directing.Moore also falls victim to repetitiveness here. Many of the issues he touches, he later regurgitates in different forms. A majority of his "attacks" on Bush are sort of shameless back-handed slaps ? careless and sloppy. Moore also has a few contradictions in his material that stick out like a sore thumb ? such as the mother who complains that she was targeted by airline security, when in fact the reason this happened in the first place (which Moore seemingly forgets to mention) is due to a civil and racial liberties act.He has a few good points, but many of them hold no weight because when viewed from a different perspective, it's clear it's all quite insubstantial or painfully obvious. And his constant degrading references to Bush, and use of the first-person Bush verbal perspective with quotes such as "What would daddy do?", become grating and seem very juvenile. I thought Moore was above such childish name-calling antics. It's clear he hates Bush ? and that's mainly the problem with this documentary. He hates Bush so much, and with such vengeance, that his "message" is lost in the material. It starts out as a fairly balanced argument, but we get the idea that the more he rants and fumes, the angrier he becomes, eventually reaching a point where he totally abandons the decent approach of documentaries, and turns his film into a series of repetitive cheap-shots and unsubstantiated, biased rants.I liked Bowling for Columbine even if I didn't agree with it. I expected to at least find Fahrenheit 9/11 amusing. However, it's so venomous and filled with utter hatred, that I have a feeling only die-hard anti-Bush folk will feel satisfied ? the "middle region" of America with an open mind will feel like we've had a bunch of angry spew forced down our throats by a man taking advantage of his camera and editing abilities.Hopefully, Moore's next documentary will return to the well-balanced and amusing elements of Columbine, which was filled with wit, sarcasm, humor, yet retained its core theme. Fahrenheit is muddled and boring, and judged solely as a documentary I believe it is poorly made and in bad taste.For my money, Super Size Me is a superior documentary and contains the sharp wit and dry humor that Fahrenheit is sorely lacking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please Don't Call This a Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the first showing at noon today (an extended lunch hour on a rainy day). Reality check -- this movie isn't a documentary. Even Moore himself has described Fahrenheit 9/11 as an "op/ed" piece -- it is not unbiased journalism. If you insist this a documentary, then I will agree with you provided you agree that Ron Popeil is the single greatest documentation in US history. Let's just call Fahrenheit 9/11 an infomercial for Moore's political viewpoints. I had seen Roger and Me years ago, a clever "gotcha" piece. It was an expanded version of what 60 Minutes was in the early days, when Mike Wallace would show up after they got somebody to do or say something bad on hidden camera and then try to get that on-my-God-deer-in-headlights look that the bad guys always had when they got caught with their hands in the cookie jar. Clever, but also a bit dated these days as a tactic. Fahrenheit 9/11 is more sophisticated, but at the same time pretty transparent in its overwhelming desire to make Bush look like a moron. There were no surprises, probably because a tremendous amount of what's in the movie has been "out there" on the Internet for months. If we didn't have Iraq and Afghanistan 24/7 on many cable channels for months and another couple of months of hype about this movie, maybe it would have had more impact on me, but I wound up being quite bored. As for his editing style, I'd bet (as he was accused of doing in "Bowling for Columbine") Moore did a bit of rearranging of footage to make certain people look foolish -- some things seemed disconnected, though you were led to believe they were all part of one continuous flow. As one journalist said, the difference between a credible journalist and Michael Moore is Moore just rearranges things to suit his purposes -- a credible journalist will insert an ellipsis (. . .) between words to indicate they've edited for brevity, not content. With Moore, you don't get the ellipsis.So, Moore gets two thumbs up for being clever, again. But just being clever isn't enough anymore. I suspect this movie will do well financially. It can't have cost much to make. Those who hate Bush will line up to pay their admission to see Bush look like a bumbling hick and they won't be disappointed. Those who subscribe to various and sundry right wing conspiracy theories will also be thorough entertained.Here comes the tough critique: Others have written books or produced news stories that have unseated politicians, even Presidents. Moore's use of his films hasn't caused a single change material in the World. I think it's because he's too hung up on making people look foolish and less interested in using his considerable skills to investigate and report on real stories. But that sort of work won't make you quite as wealthy as Moore has become. He's created his own genre and is becoming ever more wealthy with each project. In that regard, you have to admire him as a financial success. But if his true motive is to change the world he's an abject failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has a fundamental flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I'm biased. I am a Republican, and (surprise!) am not a huge fan of Michael Moore. But I decided to judge the movie more based on its quality than on my personal opinion of it (more on that later). Here's what I thought: First of all, anyone who says that this movie is NOT propaganda is flat wrong. I heard Michael Moore interviewed on NPR's "Fresh Air", and he stated that the purpose of the movie was "to get Bush out of office". The explicit objective of the film is to impose an opinion on the audience; thus it is propaganda. Not that there's necessarily anything wrong with that.But some things were clearly wrong with this movie; mainly Michael Moore's typical habit of complaining about the way things are without suggesting how things SHOULD be. Moore tells us what he considers to be a problem, but offers no real solution apart from implying that change is needed. I know this would have been beside the point of the film, but the least Moore could have done was promote an alternative to the current state of affairs. The film fails in this regard--it's basically smearing George W. Bush, albeit often with (selective) facts, and nothing else. This is the biggest fundamental flaw of the movie.I could detail all of my other grievances concerning this film--that Moore excludes any fact that would weaken his conviction (exactly what he now criticizes the Bush White House for doing, strangely); that he chiefly includes interviews with not-so bright conservatives rather than ones with intelligent conservatives; or that the movie is, frankly, highly unlikely to change many people's opinions about Bush--most of the people who see this movie probably already hate Bush anyway. But I really don't see the need to. I give this a 5 out of 10 because, although I think Farenheit is ultimately flawed and unpersuasive, the movie did successfully present a case against President Bush. It's worth seeing, if for no other reason, to understand a very distinctive view on American politics. But it's not particularly good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disgusted by a man I had actually admired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Seeing Micheal Moore's first film I truly admired the man and frankly applauded his defense of the blue collar population. But when I viewed this movie I was disgusted. Let me point out that I did not vote for Bush in either election, nor do I support his policies. I saw this movie going in with an open mind of Mr. Moores views on the subject. But From the onset I was mortified. Why? you ask I shall list them for you.I was THERE on 9/11 I was on duty fueling aircraft at Newark Int'l Airport that Tuesday Morning. I saw BOTH planes hit, I watched BOTH towers fall, and I spent the next month either attending funerals of my family who died there or was at the pile helping in anyway I could.Mr. Moore said the Bin Ladens and the Saudis were allowed to fly when we weren't. I CAN PERSONALLY refute that and PROVE it. I worked at Signature Flight Support EWR, which handles all private,charter, govt, non commercial foreign aircraft at the airport. It just so happens that the Saudi Royal family arrived in NYC on Sep. 9th I have the photos if anyone wants them. I personally unloaded their luggage...fueled there aircraft..and loaded it when they left..As I had done nearly weekly as they visited NYC nearly as much for some years. On 9/11, literally one hour after the second plane hit.. the Aircraft was seized by Federal Agents and the Crew were detained for no less than two weeks. When the Saudi Royal Family left, with members of Bin Ladens family, who I might add do not share Osamas views and were not only outraged by his actions, but feared for there lives because of their relation to him and fled, Both The Saudi Royals and the Bin Ladens left only when our government cleared them to leave after questioning them all and this was not until AFTER yes I said after the general public was allowed to fly. Fact remains is WE were allowed to fly before they were.Mr.Moore states that Bush caused the attacks by bin laden who he allegedly was friends with. The Fact is Bush did not know Osama Bin Laden. He knew the Royals simply because he owned an Oil Company, any oil company owner would HAVE to have relations with the Saudis. He wasn't even Governor of Texas when Bin Laden first attacked the US. it was during the Clinton Admin. why does bin laden hate the US, simply put he did not agree with the Saudi royal family allowing US troops (which I was one of during Desert Storm)to be attacking a Muslim country from the country of the two holiest cities in Islam. He was then exiled by the Saudis because he threatened uprising if they didn't denounce the US. WOW BUSH's fault huh?This was someones personal view, not based on actual facts. It used footage that was edited to appear that things were said in a certain context. Of course it would when you delete what was said before and in between phrases used. And to say that his views were based on Facts is a farce. Now I am an American Combat Veteran and whether or not I like his views or disagree with them I will continue to Defend his right to have them and share them. Nut I will not defend someones right to manipulate the facts and Yes even create lies to convince us of his views. Give me an argument based on actual facts and I will be your staunchest supporter, as a true patriot would, whether or not I agree with you. But lie and misinterprate to give yourself attention for, lets face it is Mr. Moores motive,MONEY. I will denounce you.Thats Just me you decide on your own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The political commentary in this film was as timely as political commentary can ever be. The footage from Iraq needs to be seen, though it must be kept in mind that this is not a pacifist film. Propaganda is not art! This film is no masterpiece! Even though I agree with the political agenda it puts forth, I'm disgusted to see the international community give a film the Palme D'Or just because its political views flatter their own. If you want to see a well done Moore film, go watch Roger and Me. But remember, even satirical propaganda is not necessarily art! Declare the emperor naked, people, for Christ's sake! Valid political commentary? Maybe. But artistic achievement? I think not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, don't most movies on IMDb have a hyperlink to a page with all the goofs? In this case, it must have been omitted because the internet lacks sufficient capacity to record all the intentionally misleading and outright false portrayals.Perhaps if Moore were not such a blatant hypocrite, he might have an ounce of credibility. As you might recall, he made his name with ROGER AND ME which ravaged GM for laying off workers that were not needed because sales were down. Guess what Moore did? Right - he laid off his publicist and secretary because he didn't have enough work for them to do. He can afford to keep paying them (a charge he made against GM), but he laid them off anyway. As Leona Helmsley would say, "RULES are for little people", and no one can accuse this clown of being little!But back to the movie, bring on your lawyers grand liar! It is pure crap. I used to think that accountants and statiticians were the masters of deception - but Moore proved that it's the film editors that hold the grand prize.With three relatives in the military, including one in Iraq now and one already back from Afghanistan, it's clear that the only thing Moore cares for the folks in uniform is exploiting them for political purposes. The troops see right through him.Well, the large moron gets what he cultivated. We have recently moved to Ohio but had not re-registered to vote. After seeing 911, we were motivated - but no longer as independents - put us down firmly in Bush's camp. And in just the 5 days since seeing this "documentary" (so called anyway)we have convinced 11 others to register as well. Good thing we live in a battleground state. We also gave as much as we legally could to the Bush and Nader campaigns!Anyone who spreads as much hate as Moore must be soundly defeated by the ballots in November. If he thought he had a message, it was overwhelmed by the vitrol of the medium. When Bush is re-elected, I hope Moore realizes the credit he gets for creating the backlash making it possible.</fullReview>

This tripe is just as bad as the worst venomous "documentary" that the KKK or the Third Reich could have produced...just on the other side of the spectrum.If you're a liberal and just "Hate Bush" because he's "Stupid", then this movie is for you. If you are a "Bush Lover" then you should avoid this movie because it will just make your blood pressure rise. If you actually put some thought into your political views and side with neither party all the time, then be prepared to be saddened. This is what the major parties can create.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Abraham Lincoln said it best: "You can fool all of the people some of the time; Some of the people all of the time; but you can't fool all of the people all of the time."Anyone who believes that Moore's film (you can't call it a documentary) is delivering the "truth" has been "fooled"! There is a scene in Charlie Chaplin's 1936 classic, MODERN TIMES, that says it better then any words. The films starts with a mass of workers moving along and makes a quick dissolve to a bunch of sheep. The millions who have thrilled at the Moore garbage are a bunch of sheep being lead by a vicious wolf -- and a very unAmerican wolf at that!Recently I viewed the Documentary (one that is a documentary) that dares to stand up to the big, bad wolf (Moore). It is called FAHRENHYPE 9/11. It was made by a group that didn't set out to make a film to counter Moore's movie, but as they investigated they discovered that Moore likes to re-order time and to twist facts in a way the changes the truth (to put it nicely).One example of what Moore did was take a minor "Letter to Editor" entry from a newspaper and change it into a newspaper headline. It is on the screen for about one second, but it is a complete lie (and Moore knows it).A number of people who are shown in Moore's film also appear in FAHRENHYPE 9/11 and speak for themselves -- not as Moore uses them in his film. And they are not very happy with how they were misused. One soldier sends a message to Moore that he doesn't need Moore to speak for him -- he can speak for himself -- and it is NOT the lies that Moore painted.Do yourself a favor and get hold of FAHRENHYPE 9/11 -- instead of being lied to by a man who hates America, be inspired by a film that is honest and uplifting as it counter-acts the Moore deceptions! In fact, it destroys FAHRENEIT 9/11 point by point!</fullReview>

How can you sit there and make a movie about how much you hate Bush. Who cares. He forgot to mention anything at all that Bush has done good for this country. I am only 18 years old and i'm sure my opinion doesn't matter, but I have been raised as a strong Republican, but even if there was a movie made putting down Clinton, or any other Democratic president, I would still be p***ed off. It's sad b/c it might take a movie like this to sway the votes in November. After this movie was over people actually clapped. How could anyone clap for something so horrible. They didn't even say any facts about 9/11, it was all about how Bush was on vacation for a long time and he doesn't do anything good for our country. They make it sound like all he does is messes up. But people don't understand that when you are put into power the decisions you make are not going to please everyone. There is no virtual way to please EVERY person in America. But give the guy some credit. He's came into office during a time when America was under attack and he went and retailiated and destroyed Iraq. People complain b/c we killed innocent people, but who the hell died in 9/11? Innocent people. So before this Mike chump goes and attempts to make a movie making try to hate Bush and feel sorry for his home town of Flint, Michigan, he needs to get his facts straight and have an open mind instead of being so biased. It was a horrible movie and a definite waste of $8.00</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This thing stinks, I couldn't even get through the first 30 or so minutes. Horrible acting, dialog, presentation and story, because that's all it was. The cast was at best wooden and obviously nothing more than script-fed "Biological Puppets". Thank God I only wasted a buck on the "Dollar Rental". But if one were to go by the ratings it receives here and the supposedly balanced and objective media, it's the most important movie of the decade, nae, the century. BAH! The only thing missing was that the Bush administration used alien, sorry, "Undocumented Off Planet Persons" technology from Area 51 (ROFL) to control the four jetliners so it only looked like they were under enemy control. Come on, if Moore put that in they'd say it was so, too. You know they would. The fact is, the wars in Afgahnistan and Iraq were/are a complete success, in that those people have a chance to vote for the government they want, tyranny or democracy. Of course, the Liberal Elete say, "We don't have a right to force liberty on them". But try to force tyranny on a Liberal and what do you get? Easy, a Conservative. As for what it was designed for; Strictly to see to it that Bush was not re-elected, it failed, just like in the box office and at the rental counter. Now, when there is a movie with a distinctly Right Wing bias, Conservatives can look at it objectively and point out flaws, both major and minor, IE, The Green Barettes. The sun setting in the west and a pine forest instead of jungle, er, sorry, "Rain Forest", comes to mind. But, if a piece of tripe like this oozes out of Hollywood, Liberals clamber, stumble and climax all over themselves finding absolutely nothing wrong with it. If I were a Liberal I'd be embarrassed by this crud and change ideologies in a New York Minute.Do yourself a favor and pass this up for one the, "Evil US Government/Corporation plots against 'The People' with a mutated/genetically engineered giant snake/spider/octopus/shark/alligator that the liberal Native American/woman (of any race)/African American/Mexican American/Gay or Straight/in a wheelchair saves us all from", that you'll find on the Si Fi channel.

		<fullReview>As usual Mike comes up with a twisted truth that is more lies than truth. His truth is more like a Hollywood movie that is 'based on true incident'. If the people who like his movies would actually open their eyes and do just a little bit of investigation, they'd see just how much bias (lies) he actually put in his "documentaries" instead of excepting blindly his truth. I'd like to meet these people face to face as I have some swamp land and city bridges I'd like to sell them. I guess it's like Hitler said, make the lie big enough and enough people will believe it. This insults a reasonable persons intelligence so much that it's not even worth commenting on the movie.</fullReview>

Moore says no American's were ever threatened by Saddam ... HELLO!!! He threatened to kill George Bush Sr.Micheal Moore is so far to the left that it is impossible for him to make a true, fair and balanced film concerning this country or any of our leaders!Hitler was more honest with people about the holocaust than Moore is about Bush in this film!Bush did his job to the best of his ability! It is always easy to look back on something and criticize it ... but when you are actually in that situation it is an entirely different story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>farenhype 9/11 this couldent be moore wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore an acclaimed novelist and filmmaker is famous for bad-mouthing and as he claims "exposing" the truth about America, in regards to oil profits foreign policy and most recently the war with and occupation of Iraq.Mr Moore however is the master of the cheap shot, his ability to embellish and elaborate certain facts to the point where they are global conspiracy's, has made him what he is today. The man however should stick to exploiting the institutional problems that clearly do exist within America itself. Bowling for columbine Moore's first critically and globally acclaimed film challenged and explored the overwhelming problem of gun culture and the still existing problem of racial prejudices being fuelled by the media, leading to one of the most horrific juvenile crimes in American history the columbine high school massacre. This film was eye opening powerful and for the most part accurate. Moore's chief priority now though seems to be challenging the credibility and exploiting the truth about George w Bush his father and how they stole the general election using George H Bush's cronies, tame judges and electoral fraud. Although most of Moore's information on this matter is accurate Fahrenheit 9/11 is simply not.The film itself is really an example of Moore's regurgitation and repackaging of things said in earlier novels such as stupid white men and downsizes this. The first half of this film is mainly about America's dealings with Saudi Arabia and how it connects with the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Footage of Donald Rumsfeld shaking hands with Sadam Hussein and the Saudi's in the early nineties is quite powerful; using slow dramatic music this film could easily obfuscate one from the truth. But Moore doesn't focus on America's primary concern being to stay rich and get richer through oil profits in a truthful manner. He creates the illusion that every move America makes is decided by a secret cabal of white house officials who are in league with the terrorists the average American fears. He pushes his belief that every move is made in the interest of the Saudis. Interesting as this may be it does not at all correspond with America's most recent wars. Saudi Arabia was not too happy about the invasion of Afghanistan and so critical of the invasion of Iraq that they ordered Americans, off their territory. If the general thrust of this movie is as Moore quotes; "The truth and nothing but the truth." Then why do Americans keep doing the opposite of what their masters dictate?The next conspiracy theory in this film is about America only invading Afghanistan so Unocal could build a natural Gas pipeline that will be worth millions. Moore completely ignores the Talibans reign of terror or how terrorists took up residence there, but instead focuses solely on Unocal. The fundamental problem with this conspiracy is that Unocal abandoned their plans and is not going to resume them any time soon.The second half of this feature (much more credible than the first) is about the very controversial war in Iraq. Moore uses the most horrific footage one could find depicting the carnage perpetrated by the military. He then visits a mother in his hometown of flint Michigan who lost her son in Iraq when insurgents shot down a black hawk helicopter. Her grief is heartbreaking and far more powerful than any statistic that could be printed, but it is in my opinion milked for too long.Moore's film is filled with blatant contradictions, if there were far too few terrorist alerts prior to 9/11 then why is it a bad thing that there are more now. Furthermore if airport security was far too lax before why mock extensive measures being taken to ensure safe flights now. This film does not qualify as a documentary; anyone who believes it does should read a dictionary, which will clearly state that a documentary should; present facts objectively without editorialising or inserting fictional matter. This film crosses the line from selective reporting of evidence in support of a position, to fabricating evidence in support of a position. To be fair many documentaries are guilty of this but Moore is not even subtle in his approach, he doesn't seem to even attempt to hide his blatant disregard for facts.The main and most offending contradiction though, is Moors claim that there are not enough televised funerals of fallen soldiers in Iraq. But Moore has quoted that the Iraqi resistance are not the terrorists or insurgents but, that they are freedom fighters, and that their numbers will grow and they will win. I would pay to see Mr Moore visit the funeral of a fallen soldier and explain to the relatives that their son or daughter was killed by the Iraqi revolution. I would then join in the chorus about his supposed courage.People may call Michael Moore the thorn in the side of corporate America or the scourge of political hypocrisy but that does not make him right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore poses some interesting questions but the effect of the film is spoiled by the way he leaps to conclusions with no facts to back it up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing the film and remembering Moore's childish outbursts against President Bush at the Oscar ceremonies, it is obvious that he made the film just before the election, hoping to defeat Bush at the polls. Because it was apparent to many viewers that Moore is an ideologue with an ax to grind, his film probably galvanized conservative voters and Bush was re-elected. Moore's pseudo documentary is too much like Oliver Stone's outlandish JFK film which asks viewers to believe a conspiracy that is even more outlandish and unsubstantiated than the Warren Report which it seeks to contradict. Moore criticizes Bush for sitting in an elementary classroom and not reacting more quickly to the terrorist attacks. He suggests that Bush was befuddled. One could just as easily conclude that Bush was shocked and then reflective, not wanting a knee jerk reaction. An official inquiry into 911 concluded that Bush, like nearly every intelligence agency in the world as well as the U.N. believed that Hussein had nukes and was hiding them. Why else would he resort to subterfuge and kick out U.N. inspectors. Bush went to war only after Hussein violated over a dozen UN resolutions, yet Moore would have us believe that Bush merely lied us into war.What might have been a meaningful film that would encourage policy debate is seriously marred by Moore's personal politics, half-truths, and tendency to be disingenuous. Moose seems to be more interested in character assassination than enlightening his audience.</fullReview>

So you can believe I'm not politically motivated when I say THIS MOVIE WAS AWFUL.From its opening remarks, Fahrenheit 9/11 takes a very snide, condescending tone as if Moore were hiding his ignorance behind sarcasm. You know the type--the jerk at the office water cooler who can't formulate a coherent argument, so he or she resorts to cynicism, sarcastic baby talk and adolescent rhetoric. P.S. If you don't know the type I'm talking about, then more than likely IT'S YOU! :PThe issues presented in this film are indeed issues worthy of intelligent debate, but not in the childish way Moore presents them. It's totally discrediting.Conservatives of the world, I apologize. If you would please dismiss this silly Moore character (I believe "attention whore" is the term the kids use today), perhaps you would see that there are intelligent, learned, well-spoken individuals who embrace the liberal philosophy. No, we're not all PETA extremists, loud-mouthed protesters and hypocritical filmmakers.Liberals of the world, please don't allow this ad hominem propaganda to drive you to absurdity. I don't believe Moore is truly one of us. He's a sensationalist, plain &amp; simple.And to EVERYONE: Be very wary of anyone trying to force feed you anything! Best of luck.

		<shortDescription>Despicable, Unconscionable, Deceptive, Brainwashing Propaganda...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** Let me begin by saying that I went into Michael Moore's latest, "Fahrenheit 9/11" with the absolute lowest expectations, as I am not too particularly fond of Michael Moore or his "ingenious, incendiary, documentaries". I had expected all of the Bush bashing, blame America first, and sordid, brainwashing fallacy that was to consist of this atrocious film. "Fahrenheit 9/11", I am thoroughly convinced, was beyond even my worst expectations, as I hadn't anticipated even Moore to stoop so degradingly, intolerably low. Take it from someone who regularly (O.K. constantly) watches the news and is perhaps the most politically conscious youth in America today, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is nothing more than a Bush, American, capitalistic, and even militaristic hate machine, determined to undermine, most especially, our commander-in-chief, our men and women serving courageously for our freedom and security, and our very state of mind. Come on, folks. Does anybody with a right mind actually believe half of the garbage Michael Moore has emanated in this film?Does anybody actually believe that Afghanistan, whose people were brutally oppressed and whose government harbored al Quaida, is essentially the same today as it was BEFORE our retaliation in 2001? Aside from that, this is a film with no other purpose than an insidious assault and derision upon President Bush (wanting us to believe he is incompetent, ridiculous, and apathetic in leadership and abroad), thus endeavoring to unseek our president through deception, ridicule, and fallacy. Moore purports that Bush is a feeble, culpable leader who was uncertain and unprepared during the terrible attacks on 9/11, and who thereafter has been futile and disastrous in conducting a War on Terrorism. Perhaps the most atrocious part of the film focuses on a "futile, disastrous" Afghanistan campaign, resulting in very little but perhaps a worsened civility throughout Afghanistan. Then, he ventures into the Iraq campaign, implying that "evil American imperialism" has devastated every Iraqi families and that life was good and jolly under the rule of Saddam Hussein and his murderous regime. Good one, Mike. Torture chambers, mass graves, mobile weapons facilities. "Fictitious reasons" indeed. Now how would you believe such a statement would resonate with the men and women overseas who strove and succeeded in toppling the Taliban government, Saddam Hussein's Bath government, and captured a vast majority of al Quaida operatives and its associates in the process? Michael Moore's reasoning behind the War on Terror, under absolute, unevidenced assumption: OIL. If Michael Moore is deemed a "patriot" in the production of this film, then I am the dictator of the Republic of Mars. Furthermore, this liberal propaganda is about as one-sided as it gets. Take Michael Moore's interviewees: several congressmen: all Democrats (no Republicans), distressed, grieving mothers (Linda Lipscumb) and their equally upset son (War is terrible; there are indeed casualties...(while neglecting to focus on proud, confident soldiers, who are optimistic about their endeavors overseas), and devastated Iraqi citizens proceeding the War in Iraq (while neglecting to concentrate on devastated, oppressed citizens during the reign of Saddam Hussein). Moore neglects to even acknowledge "the other side", as such would merely compromise his thesis: President Bush has been a failure, from the grounds of the 2000 election to the War in Iraq, America and several other nations have been tarnished under his watch, and little has been accomplished since 9/11. I have always believed that a good debate could perceive and acknowledge BOTH points of view, instead of just one; I suppose Michael Moore thinks otherwise. My conclusion of "Fahrenheit 9/11": sometimes daunting (in its own fallacy), sometimes pathetic (often resorting to ridiculing Bush and his administration (sometimes when they are not even looking)) and always atrocious (endeavoring to brainwash whatever ignorant/undecided American into concurring with Michael Moore on subjects which should be examined objectively). Shame on you, Michael Moore; I can only hope that people are not as ignorant and stupid as you would like to believe Americans are. Let me exit with some Michael Moore patriotism: "Americans are possibly the dumbest people on the planet. We don't know anything that's happening outside our country. Our stupidity is embarrassing..." I'll make up my own mind this November, Mr. Moore. Zero Stars out of Four</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bush haters dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 is a Bush haters dream. Michael Moore makes a case for congress passing the patriot act (un-read) and taking away freedoms from Americans. Moore focuses the beginning of the movie with both daddy Bush and junior Bush having ties to the Saudi Arabian government. (This includes the Bid-Laden family and their business investments). I am surprised he did not make a case for the Easter bunny and tooth fairy since I would find it more believable than has argument. The later part of the film focuses more towards the soldiers fighting in Iraq.Michael Moore uses just enough truth to make believers of the ignorant and the extreme wing of the Democratic Party. Moderates and independents will find this movie hard to stomach, even if you disagree with Bush and his policies. Being a student of history and knowing about how skillful propagandist can influence people through their ignorance. I am sad that more of the mainstream news media outlets have not researched Michael Moore's failures in the facts department and reported it. What happened to the people right to know? If this kind of distortion is what it takes to beat Bush, then John Kerry and the Democratic Party are in serious trouble. This kind of crap can only hurt John Kerry in his run for the presidency with independent voters and liberal Republicans. Maybe Michael Moore is really a hard-core undercover Republican trying to damage the Democratic Party. If not, he should be given the damage he has done to the credibility of those trying to unseat Bush.The bottom line is Michael Moore does not allow facts to get in the way of his message. He is skillful in the manner he puts the film together. This is the only positive I found in this film. If the end justifies the means at any cost, then this is a great film. One would have to go back to Nazi Germany to find this level of propaganda and skill. Joseph Goebbels would be very proud. I give it a 7 on quality and a 1 on content. Don't waste your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Isane Rant Disguised as Courageous 'Dissent'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a white Republican male, but I'm also an international relations/national security studies student who has never voted for a Bush. For the same reason you can't watch a medical show with a doctor, you can't watch this film with me.Mr. Moore rants and rants about how United Defense is in cahoots with the entire Bush family. We'll ignore the fact that the *only* major weapons platform the Defense Dept. has canceled since President Bush took office was the Crusader artillery platform - an United Defense product. But that's an inconvenient detail.Mr. Moore was filming in front of the Saudi Embassy, and a uniformed Secret Service agent came up to him and asked him a few questions about his activities. The director than makes a huge deal about why the Secret Service is hassling him just for standing in D.C.? We'll ignore the fact that the US Secret Service is the only uniformed federal law enforcement agency in DC for that type of situation (can't exactly send a Park Ranger) and we're OBLIGATED BY TREATY (The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations) to protect foreign missions inside our country. I'd think we all agree the Saudi embassy is a lot more of a potential target than, say, the Jamaican. If somebody was filming the American Embassy inside Saudi Arabia, I want that person asked what they're doing. It's not a violation of civil rights to be asked what you're doing.The thing I found the biggest waste of time was little snide comments throughout the piece such as "the night the President arrived in Florida, he slept on fine french linens." As if the thread count somebody sleeps on prove something.So ignore this unbelievable contrite diatribe disguised as 'courageous dissent' against an evil system. Oh, and what really depressed me, was the total lack of respect to the Office of the President of the United States. I don't care who you voted for or what was done by who when, the entire system depends on respect for the office. Don't waste our time with "Rush Limbaugh didn't show them respect", I'm trying to be a citizen at a higher level than Rush and Mike. This is movie is a waste of time that's disingenuous at best, borderline criminal at worst. He had a chance to use a soapbox like few of us will ever have, and it's wrong to masquerade as journalism what he made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as a movie done in the genre of propaganda, it was very well done. I took notes on the allegations, and there were a river of them, and then compared them with the counter DVD, Fahrenhype 911. I had taken it all in and wanted to evaluate it based on what I could know, as facts vs. fiction (as it had an divisive affect between me and my friend). It turned out from my view now that it clearly is propaganda. Watch Fahrenhype 911 and see if you come to the same conclusion. Since Micheal Moore movie has allegations against the current US president and his administration I see it as truly damaging to the country's unity and encouraging to any who hate the US. The movie seems to operate through errors, misrepresentations or lies, and undermine the publics support for our national defense vs. terrorism (which Moore believed is a made up threat). My nation needs true patriots who uphold positive moral truths and this man, Michael Moore, seems to be far off in this regard, as he paints the president and his administration as the bad guys. Who is the bad guy during Sept. 11th? It's certainly not George W. Bush, as he was given the burdens that this event caused as the American president. Did he go to war in Iraq for his own personal gain? I don't think so and don't think he could have fooled the whole country in the way Michael suggests. Michael Moore ends up looking very foolish when this movie is compared to the information in Farenhype 911. I recommend anyone who want to know the truth about these matters go rent Farenhype 911 after seeing Fahrenheit 911, it you must see the later movie at all.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, it is so full of preposterous half-truths that no amount of artistry can cover the sheer silliness of the film's premise. An interesting study in effective propaganda -- and that's about it.If you hate George Bush, you'll love the Bush-hating. If you like Bush, you'll just be amazed that anyone can take this film seriously.In that regard, this film is similar to another recent controversial film, Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ", in that people take away from the film exactly what they take into it. Both are well-made movies in their respective rights, but both represent the sole view of the filmmaker. In both cases, these films do not tell the whole truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course Mike gets a few good jokes in, but completely ignores half of the relevant facts. Because this film is all about the content I wish he had be more fair like he was in BFC. At least there he somewhat fairly represented the idea that other countries have guns and low fire-arm related deaths, why is America different. In Fahrenheit, Mike ignores most of the facts that support going to war, the success had in Iraq, how terrible Saddam really was. Instead he takes things said out of context, ignores the messages the Bush administration was putting out there and most importantly he does not address the difficult situation President Bush was in at the time, which a "documentary" should do.Consider we had just had 9-11 and the American people wanted action. Many felt that the government/Bush administration was not "aggressive" enough. Compound this with intelligence from every source saying Saddam definitely HAD WMDs at one time and no significant evidence existed that they were gone. Additionally consider that Saddam was extremely unlikely to get rid of the WMDs himself. What was Bush supposed to do? Take the risk that Saddam had WMDs and let it go, continue with sanctions. Let inspectors spend another year? The fact is that we may not know for years if WMDs were destroyed in the first Gulf War, if they were smuggled into a neighboring country, or if they are still hidden underground in a mass grave of soldiers that hid them there. Yet Mike is confident that he is right.How many narcissists does it take to change a light bulb? One, he holds the bulb while the world revolves around him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8/10I watched "Fahrenheit 9/11" at the New York public premiere late last night in the early hours of Wednesday, June 23rd, the first opportunity for anyone not connected with Hollywood or the media to see this film. I say this so that you take prior reviews (particularly those dismissing the film outright) with a hefty dose of skepticism. I am also a Marine Corps veteran of Operation Desert Storm, and thus am acutely aware of the realities of war and its intended use only as a last resort when all alternate options are exhausted.I've seen all three of Michael Moore's films; "Roger &amp; Me", "Bowling for Columbine", and now 'Fahrenheit.' Of the three, this current film has a far more disciplined approach. There is generally far less music, grandstanding, and general joking-around. While perhaps disappointing to his long-time audience of liberal partisans (myself among them), this more even-handed approach is truly welcome, because it instills the documentary with a sense of reason and perspective that will appeal to independents and perhaps even conservatives. Moore's audience here is not his long-time left-wing choir; it is the millions of Americans who trusted a President to be one thing and who has turned out to be quite another indeed.The major newspaper reviewers justifiably point to the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes, about Bush's Saudi links and the carnage in Iraq, as the strongest segments. Indeed, the sequence where a series of minority representatives are gaveled to silence in the Congress is shocking in the extreme. Yet the film is fascinating throughout; it is sometimes inchoate and contradictory, but it constantly encourages and demands critical thinking. This is perhaps the real target of Moore's fury; the unaccepting, unthinking acceptance of authority figures and 'leaders' who have not earned that respect. He uses Britney Spears to make this point with devastating finality and grim hilarity. He asks, indirectly, which side are you on-that of unquestioning obedience to a betrayer of the nation's best interests, or the side of truth, criticism, and transparency. It will be hard for Bush supporters to muster the energy to defend their addled puppet after Moore's calmly launched but devastating salvos. Furthermore, it asks the American public to take responsibility for sending its children (mostly middle- and working-class) into harm's way for less than convincing reasons. The deaths of our servicemembers are the price we pay for this president's leadership, and Moore demands that the viewer analyze this war with a eye to its true costs and motives.I am sad that there are so many in this country who will refuse to see this film for head- in-the-sand political reasons. Moore lets Bush and his cabal do most of the talking, and as such lets them indict themselves far more effectively than Al Franken or Howard Dean ever could. The film makes an absolute mockery of this president, and it is *richly* deserved. It is likely that this effort will finally 'screw to the sticking place' the courage of a national media that has shamefully aided and abetted this belligerent and bumbling national disgrace.All this being said, this is not a depressing film, at least not for me. Many of the images and themes are certainly profoundly discomfiting, yet the very existence of this film (in nationwide release) is a testament to the endurance and beauty of the American system. This country has tolerated and then dismissed other scoundrels and crooks, and soon enough this current pack of liars and cranks will be added to the dustbin of history. You can thank Moore for his courage and true understanding of our freedoms, rights, and responsibilities that you have the opportunity to see this film and form your own judgment. Do that. Its high time for all Americans to become responsibly informed, and to consider anew the true ideals of American democracy and freedom which have lately become so distorted.Election day is November 2nd. That's the most important review of all.</fullReview>

Moore may be justified in his obvious dislike of Bush, but in the film he supports this using a number of mistruths or careful misrepresentations.These are serious flaws in a documentary. Moore crosses the line from selective reporting of evidence in support of a position, arguably something all news reporting and documentaries are guilty of to some degree, to making up evidence in support of a position. This begs the question: if Moore's position requires such tactics, is it defensible? I recommend watching this film and then watching FahrenHYPE 9/11, a pro-Bush counter to Fahrenheit which calls Moore on some of his careful deception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dude, where's the argument?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no need to have an objective point of view when making films, least of all documentaries. Most pieces of art have an element of personal opinion located within them, mostly discreet so that anyone of whatever opinion can be affected by it. However, when your point of view is so obvious, it's hard to convince anyone of your case if they are so conscious of your efforts to change their opinion. Having glanced at his books and seen three of his films, I think Michael Moore ought to take this advice seriously.The first scenes of the film offer the audience a change to play a what if game. What if Al Gore had won Florida and become president? From the way Moore's editing suite puts it, Gore won the election by a mile, the use of clips every time gore wins a state making it look like a cakewalk, until Rupert Murdoch makes sure that he overturns the will of the American people. Well Bush won in a, I think its fair to say dubious fashion, but you'd think the results of the 2000 election would have nothing to do with a film which from the title you would have thought would be about terrorism. It is perhaps a sneaky way of blaming bush in someway for 9/11. 'Would the event of the past 4 years been completely different?' asks Moore. I think most people would acknowledge that 9/11 would have happened anyway; as I don't think those thoughtful souls over at Al queda had a personal preference.But Wait, there's something fishy about the Bush family and the Saudis. The dark secrets in question are that the business dealings of the Bush family are somehow linked to the Bin Laden family. Well mystery solved: its all a big conspiracy. However Moore is at pains to point out that the only significant bin laden hasn't had contact with the family for years. Which leaves a 30-minute section of the film on a hiding to nothing, just a few rumours of shady dealings between business elites. It was at this point I could hear the crashes and explosions of Spiderman 2, playing at the screen next door, about the time when Moore was making some halfhearted effort to link Bush with Enron again. Yawn. I also found it interesting that Moore included footage from a public beheading in Saudi Arabia. For no other reason than to shock the audience, much in the same way long distance truck drivers use caffeine tablets to keep them alert through the long dull roads.Then comes the War, which really gives Michael the chance to play around with editing techniques. First of all did you know that only tiny banana republics gave support to the war in Iraq? The mockery of these countries in a section headlined 'the coalition of the willing' makes no mention of the 60,000 British troops sent to Iraq, nor does he mention the dozens who have died. They didn't exist. They were never there. Which should come as a relief to their families. Having watched some US news coverage of the war, I would guess that maybe 20% of the viewers knew this, which means that most of the audience of this film would have completely believed this point.Most of Fahrenheit 911 is desperately trying to prove a point. But I'm not sure what that is. That people get killed in wars? That rich, powerful people have international connections? That people who join up to the army are mostly poor? A silly section of the film concerns Moore's efforts to 'get members of congress to sign their kids up for the army'. Don't people usually volunteer? It turns out in fact that the rate of membership for the children of members of congress in the army is higher than average. Not that Moore mentions this of course. Like in any comedy film there are likely to be some moments of fun, and to be fair there are enough laughs to enjoy oneself. My favourites are the Taliban official who tells a female reporter he feels sorry for her husband, and the wacky inventor of a skyscraper parachute. It is virtually impossible to criticise this film without being accused of being a supporter of Bush of the Iraq war. But I wouldn't consider myself a strong supporter of either, and a film of half accusations and obviously heavily edited film material, is not going to convince anybody of your case either.The film ends with a quote from George Orwell, on how the state manipulates the media and pursues a war with its own people as well as those overseas. However those familiar with the quote will be aware that it is from the totalitarian world of 1984. But the way Moore uses the quote you would think it was a comment on the current US administration. There is something troubling about the use of this quote, namely that it refers to a world where there is constant war between 3 identical totalitarian governments. It Moore suggesting that there is no difference between life in America and life in a Taliban ruled Afghanistan? No difference between the tactics of Al queda and the US government?I liked Roger and Me, and Bowling for Columbine, but I'm sorry Mike, having read your frankly appalling, amateurish books, and seen this film, I'm afraid, like the song you desperately wanted to put over the credits at the end, I won't get fooled again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointingly unconvincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with this film is that Moore's style is built on visceral reactions rather than carefully crafted argument. The resulting disorganized rant may be enjoyable for those who already share his views, but it is unlikely to impress anyone else. Even those who agree with him on many issues (I, for one, do) may find some of his assertions hard to swallow. The most bizarre claims he has made, though, are thankfully absent from the film. For instance, anyone who reads his 2003 book "Dude, Where's My Country?" will discover that he has actually questioned whether Osama Bin Laden was responsible for the 9/11 attacks:"Who attacked the United States on September 11--a guy on dialysis from a cave in Afghanistan, or your friends, Saudi Arabia? .... How could a guy sitting in a cave in Afghanistan, hooked up to dialysis, have directed and overseen the actions of nineteen terrorists for two years in the United States and then plotted so perfectly the hijacking of four planes and then guaranteed that three of them would end up precisely on their targets? .... How did he organize, communicate, control and supervise this kind of massive attack? With two cans and a string?" (pp. 15-6)For those who are wondering, this is not the only time that Moore has tried to pass off a ridiculous statement with a "How could it be otherwise?" tone. But any doubts he may still harbor on this matter are not presented in the film. All he does is briefly mention that "Bin Laden was a Saudi" to back up his claim that our real enemy is Saudi Arabia, not Iraq.Moore does deserve credit for calling attention to the now-famous clip showing the President remaining in a kindergarten classroom for seven minutes after having been informed that the country was under attack. It would have made sense for Bush to cut the session short, especially since we now know that the Pentagon had not yet been struck and a fourth hijacked plane was on the loose. The footage gives the impression that Bush wasn't sure how to act on his own, without the guidance of his advisers.Unfortunately, Moore's portrayal of other events is not quite so defensible. In his depiction of the 2000 post-election controversy, for example, he shows Jeffrey Toobin asserting that a statewide recount in Florida would have shown Gore to be the winner "under every scenario." But extensive studies by newspapers across the country showed that Bush would have won under certain criteria, a fact that Toobin himself has acknowledged. (See Toobin's book "Too Close to Call," pp. 278-9.) This highlights why some have called the film one-sided. It's one thing to express a viewpoint, it's quite another to ignore contrary evidence.The problem thus may be more in what the film doesn't show than in what it shows. Take the famous scene where Moore confronts Congressmen and encourages them to enlist their sons and daughters. We see some getting flustered by the proposal, others refusing even to speak with Moore, who then assures us that not a single Congressman took up his offer. What we do not see is one who answers Moore eloquently, but it is entirely possible that at least one of them did. That's the problem: every single shot of the film is designed to make his targets look as ridiculous as possible, and he doesn't include footage that fails to serve that purpose. The film has just too much calculation to be believed.This becomes particularly important when he shows a woman whose son died in Iraq, and who stopped supporting Bush because of it. We watch her become indignant, and then hysterical, after a passerby asserts that her grief is staged. The trouble is that the sequence does feel staged, not because the story was faked (I'll assume Moore wouldn't go that far), but because Moore probably looked into many personal accounts before he found exactly what he needed to make his point. I'm sure that not everyone who has lost a loved one in this war has blamed the President.We are also treated to graphic images of soldiers with debilitating wounds, of civilian casualties in Iraq, of Iraqi women cursing America for the destruction brought upon their families. But Moore could just as well have chosen to show the victims of Saddam Hussein, who has caused far more death and devastation than Bush has. The film omits this fact, and an uninformed viewer might even get the impression that Hussein was a benign dictator. Instead of building a real case against the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Moore resorts to generic antiwar propaganda that could be applied to any war the U.S. has ever fought. It's amazing to me that in the entire film he mentions WMDs only once, as though they're a side issue rather than the crux of the matter.If the film's purpose is to overthrow the Bush presidency, as Moore has stated, then this implies a narrow focus. The film's endurance depended to some extent on the outcome of the 2004 election. Had Kerry won, people might have given this film credit for helping that to occur, and it may have come to be seen as a historical marker. But a documentary that does little more than lampoon contemporary political figures is not likely to become a classic; its current popularity is mostly a byproduct of the public's strong feelings about the election, which are sure to dissipate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fahrenheit 9/11</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterpiece in filmmaking. Michael Moore made such a moving and wonderful film with Fahrenheit 9/11. Let's put politics aside. Fahrenheit 9/11 is not a masterpiece for its politics, it is a masterpiece for it's presentation. The film really opens your eyes to Michael Moore's filmmaking art. Moore seriously felt that there was something fishy going on, and honestly said what he felt: Bush is a failure, and a war criminal, and that the Iraq War would've happened regardless of 9/11. Plus, it was number one on its opening weekend despite being in only 800 theaters. Impressive! I applaud Moore for this masterpiece, and I hope that he can make more masterpieces like this in the future.4/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Think-A-Thon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I was watching Fahrenheit 9/11 in class yesterday, and I think it throws up some very interesting questions that we all ought to think about, and try and come up with our own thoughts, since I don't see those as questions with definite answers. For those of you, who haven't seen the movie yet, it's made by documentarian Michael Moore, and focuses on the presidency of George W. Bush. Detailing the points in his first four years of presidency which stood out the most, the film was mostly critical of the actions taken during this time period, not only by the President himself, but also of the media, and people who were working for/were worked for by George W. Bush. Hope that wasn't too confusing! Anyways, so I was watching the movie, and I was thinking, some of it simply didn't match up. I mean, Michael Moore is all critical about President Bush's actions, but if you look at it realistically: How would you react when you are told that two airplanes had crashed into a set of office buildings that signify the capitalistic nature of the Western world? Keep in mind that you are currently sitting in a classroom in an elementary school. I for one would not be the person to change my demeanor, and announce the fact. After all, you have to keep your cool around kids, since you don't know how they would react. But I mean, okay, everyone reacts differently, ole George and I might agree on this one, but others ? Michael Moore, for instance ? certainly don't, but that's fine.Still, Mikey didn't give up that easily. Digging up facts about the past, and connecting Bush with Saudi Arabian families directly connected to Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda seemed impressive at first. After doing a little research on the internet ? prompted by a list of things I found interesting in the movie ? I found that Moore has been evading interview opportunities with some of his harshest critiques ? usually he is all for opening his mouth and distributing his opinions, is he not? And he was pretty subjective in the research he conducted, considering that I think he wants to open up our eyes to the truth he sees. I'm saying this because he omitted information about various themes addressed in his documentary ? questioning of the bin Laden family when they were flown out of the United States AFTER CONSIDERATION of the FBI.Of course there are things that kinda disturbed me with Fahrenheit 9/11, but I can't deny that it was well made, and of course there were issues which I think were correctly represented, for instance the portrayed heroism of both journalists and soldiers in the American media. The bits of American soldiers, perhaps quoted out of context but still this seems alarming to me, saying things like they put on music when going out in their tanks, and usually listening to music which either makes fun of the situation, or even seems disparaging in respect to the Iraqis that are affected by the military presence. I harbor an utter distaste toward that ass that was singing the song by the Bloodhound Gang, full of enthusiasm.Another example exposed in the documentary, where I find it embarrassing of how media blunders ? considering that I plan on making my career in the same self field ? is the very beginning, where the news stations are shown to predict Al Gore as the next President, and after Fox News broadcast the prediction that George W. Bush was most likely the next President, the other news stations followed suit. It reminds me vividly of something we learned in Psychology called 'imprinting', where little ducklings learn to follow their Momma Duck, otherwise they wouldn't survive. Now, I ask myself, why did those news stations suffer under the strange hallucination that they were little ducklings, instead of independent Momma Ducks? I really don't know? What is left to be said is that Fahrenheit 9/11 has certainly made me think ? both about negative points to the documentary, as well as intriguing points raised by Mikey about the actions of the Bush administration. Well filmed, it most certainly is a good watch, and I recommend for everyone out there, especially you to watch it too, and get your own opinion sorted!</fullReview>

One says, "He is a Propagandist......." Other says, "He is the conscience of America" It's up to you to decide whom you like...... Even if you do not support Moore's view, you will surely admire him as a great satirist of our time. Observer rightly called him "AMERICA'S GREATEST SATIRIST". The DVD advertisement goes like this: "THREE FILMS TAKING THE TEMPERATURE OF A NATION". Now Moore is the famous American name only after Chomsky in the intellectual world.

		<shortDescription>A Critical View on the Bush Administration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore tackles the controversial topic of the Bush Administration, the terrorist attacks in September 2001, and the war in Iraq that followed. When it comes to Michael Moore films, you need to take the information he presents with a grain of salt. He presents his information with HIS message in mind so facts can be presented out of context to bring the viewer to the conclusions he wants. Despite this, one has to admit that Moore presents a LOT of incriminating evidence against George W. Bush and his connections between the oil industry and the Saudi government (including the rich Bin Laden family). A person can't deny that this movie provides it's viewers with some very persuasive evidence that causes a person to question what their government's intentions truly are, where they're priorities really lie. Moore doesn't say anything that doesn't have some form of proof behind it; anyone with the time to research the issue could've connected the dots and seen the same troubling situations (i.e. the Bush family's closeness to the Bin Ladens and the Saudis, Cheney and Halliburton, etc.).I also appreciated how the movie gave us a closer look at those directly affected by the war: the soldiers and their families. We hear testimonies from soldiers serving terms in Iraq who have come to realize that they're over there fighting for the wrong reasons; we hear soldiers commenting on the terrible things they've had to endure and perform in the line of duty. We see the effects of the war on Iraqi citizens caught in the middle and it helps you begin to understand why other countries view us the way they do. Probably the saddest portion is watching Lila Lipscomb of Flint, MI, go from flag-waving patriotic parent of two soldiers to a disillusioned mess when her son dies for a war we had to right to start.Personally, I share a lot of the same viewpoints as Moore in his portrayal of our government since 2001. While I support our troops with everything in me, I fear they are dying for a ridiculous cause. I can't watch this movie without it inspiring a bit of anger in me, having seen the result of America's actions. I feel that everyone should see this movie and form their OWN opinions based on the information presented, but it is definitely a must-view for any American.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this in theatres as a Republican back in 2004. I voted for Bush that year. Four years later, I voted for McCain. This past election, I voted Libertarian, having come to the conclusion that the major parties were too corrupt to trusted. It's been so long, we keep forgetting the tenuous rationalizing, the weapons that were never there, the freedom that nobody in the Middle East (except the elite, I assume), ever got to benefit from. I've always been under the impression that the world would be better if democracy spread throughout it. But, you have to respect the ideals of that democracy, or it's a democracy in name only. "We don't have time to read the laws." 1 out of 535 representatives had a child fighting the war (and probably against his parent's wishes). There was a time in America's past (1870s-1900s) called the Gilded Age, where the government was vastly corrupt and we fought wars for corporations (the Spanish-American War of 1898, the annexation of the Philippines, etc). The difference between now and then? Information. The internet. The truth finds a way to get to you. I wouldn't presume to tell you how to vote in any future elections, but I hope you stick your ideals when doing so, and I hope you do not compromise those ideals in the name of safety and I hope you do not withhold rights from other people because their traditions and way of life is different from yours.

		<shortDescription>Captures a Dark Moment in American History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fahrenheit 9/11," Michael Moore's diatribe against the Bust administration and how it used the public's post-9/11 fear and insecurities to charge ahead with its dubious agenda, is about as subtle as you would expect. But it's also fiercely entertaining and has the power to enrage, characteristics that are pretty much synonymous with any Moore documentary.People who did not live through the years immediately following 9/11, or who were too young at the time to understand what was going on, will never appreciate the degree to which our nation was polarized, a polarization that was epitomized by two of the year's highest profile films -- "Fahrenheit 9/11" and "The Passion of the Christ." It wasn't a pleasant time to live through, but I'm glad I did, because I feel like I was a part of history as it was happening.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>United We Stand...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comment is simply to express how I feel after viewing the film. I saw it about two months ago as I wanted to think over the issues and to compare how things revolve around in America.I understand that 9/11 affected so many lives in America and I never forget the experiences seeing everyone standing together regardless to political parties they believe in. I could even remember the night driving through the streets, honking to show my love and support for America, when the people carried the signs "HONK IF YOU LOVE America!" It was a good experience for everyone in America to support each other.Now, after seeing that film, I felt that Michael Moore is being extreme in his ways. Frankly, I believe that if President Bush did not do well, we could have the power to impreach him based on the evidences if they exist. I am not going to stand up for Bush or to speak against him. What I believe is to support America. This film appeared to be extremely and unnecessarily harsh against President Bush. Personally, I have no respect for Michael Moore immediately after seeing his speech when accepting the award, "Shame on you, President Bush." What kind of mature man is he? Now, he announced that he is going to make the "sequel" of this film following Bush's victory after recent election to "educate the voters." Is he saying that the people who voted for Bush are being "stupid"? I believe that people have their rights to vote from their own opinions and their own instincts. (Personally, I voted for Kerry because I believed it's time for the change, but Bush is being President again and I am fine with it. I just go in the flow.)Once again, I am simply expressing how I feel after viewing this film. I am not saying that the film is evil or whatever. I am just concerning how much the people is willing to believe by the film alone. UNITED WE STAND... I have many friends with different political opinions and I don't really care as long as I respect them as my friends. I used to be a conservative republic, but now I believe in independent. The best way to make America stronger is to support each other regardless to the opinions we have in political issues. DEMOCRACY or REPUBLIC - who cares? We are Americans and we just need to support each other and to stand stronger together as Americans.Since President Bush is working as President, it's not really end of the world. It's only four years and we will have more opportunities to make better for America by having someone to represent for everyone in America. I hope for a better leader like Arnold Schwarzenegger (unfortunately, he is not American-born citizen). I am interesting in a leader who is running as a President of United States of America, not President of Democracy or Republic!Bottom line - this film is not beneficial to watch. I simply believe it stir up bitter and angry. What good will it do for us?UNITED WE STAND!</fullReview>

When I watched this movie, it left me with a sick feeling about Bush and Co. But I started wondering why has no one else corroborated all Moore's claims. Surely Bush would need to answer some hard questions from Kerry and Co, but why is no one asking him? Either Moore is the first super-sleuth to put together all these clues (doubtful) or there's something fishy going on. Come on all you ivory tower, liberally educated types; the answer is easy. It's a pack of lies. If you have a spare couple of hours, you can read a point-by-point debunking at http://www.davekopel.com/Terror/Fiftysix-Deceits-in-Fahrenheit-911.htmThis film does not care a whit for truth, but only about painting the worst picture possible of the right wingers. It is an absence of conscience. It is an insult to be lied to, and we should be insulted by this film. Don't agree? Go see Kopel's website. To deliberately spread misinformation about a candidate just before an election is unthinkable. It is pushing democracy aside for personal goals.

		<fullReview>The danger to me of this film is the misleading idea that Democrats are the answer just because Bush is a totally untrustworthy official. Yes, Moore did a great job of bringing certain ideas to light, but to me its "No kidding!". Who doesn't know that to vote is a joke in this country. I am sick and so tired of these zealots from Hollywood etc. announcing whenever possible that Americans need to vote. All it does is perpetuate a notion that it matters. Politicians of that stature are liars. I don't care if its a donkey (how appropos) or an elephant symbol we never, ever are told the issues unless we have the ability to reasearch ad nauseum which, of course, maybe 2 percent (I am being idealistic here) of the population actually does. I can think of no president during my life that ever followed through on his election promises. Presidential candidates have money to back them up and money can hide anything.We need someone who has a degree in character not in politics. In short, if Moore was as brutally honest as he claims to be in his films he would have to admit that he could make a film equally scathing about Gore, Kerry, Kennedy (oh yeah, that's been done!) and even Jimmy Carter who is now being lauded as a wonderful president. I don't remember that tone in this country when he was in office.If this movie gets awards, I'm going to go out and get me a camera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I admit straight away that I haven't seen this film yet, just seen a few promo clips and the news that Moore has just won the Palm d'or at the Cannes film Festival. But what's really interesting is the way all you Americans are getting in such a lather when most of you haven't seen it either! The reactions that this largely un-seen film is provoking are hysterical, and it all serves to demonstrate just how split modern America is between Liberals and Conservatives. I personally don't like Moore's style of reporting all that much, and the whole Lib. vs Con American thing leaves me cold. No doubt Con. Americans will try to portray Moore's victory at Cannes as proof that the French hate "us" even though the jury at Cannes was mostly made up a variety of nationalities including Americans like Tarantino. Also, before all you Lib. Americans start feeling smug and that Moore is some kind of martyr just remember that he is a millionaire who lives a life far above the vast majority of working Americans.I did see Bowling For Columbine and felt the facts were skewered badly to make a point. Okay, don't all documentaries do that, you ask? Maybe, but I just wish Americans could get beyond this whole Lib. vs. Con. thing, it really is boring and dull for us non-Americans.That's why I'm in no particular hurry to see this latest example of Moore's opus, it just feeds into that whole Us vs. Them, Lib vs. Con. debate that is so asinine to anyone with even half a brain.America- wake up to the fact that the rest of the world really doesn't care about your boring internicine squables, and please start making decent films again like you used to do.Peace...</fullReview>

I realize that his point of view is legitimate (not that I agree), but if he simply told the truth and defended his position, I could take him seriously as a documentarian. Moore is all about the shock value, which I know makes for a compelling film but not a documentary. He is not the only one to do this; I have not seen a good documentary in many years. A good documentary should be like a argumentative essay. It should take on its subject head on and defeat the opposition point by point. Moore's documentaries don't do this. What makes it far worse is that so many film critics can't see this. It makes me question film criticism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Liberal flamethrower Michael Moore is a skilled propagandist, and not above resorting to cheap tricks which certainly enliven 'Fahrenheit 911', his documentary about the Iraq war, but which could allow his targets to suggest that he doesn't quite play fair. But there's nothing fair either about the stupidity, venality and corruption of George Bush and his associates, which Moore hilariously and chillingly presents in this film. There's little here that seasoned observers of Bush won't already know, but as evidenced by his recent re-election, there are still plenty of Americans who would benefit greatly from learning the facts. Although not as intellectually decisive as Ian Curtis in his recent series for British television, 'The Power of Nightmares', when Moore ends with a quote from George Orwell he hits the nail exactly on the head. Four more years seems a long time indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enter Moore's "The Spin Zone"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I fully did not intend to ever watch this movie because I did not want Michael Moore to get my money, any of my money. But I watched the whole thing at a friend's house for free and unfortunately curiosity got the better of me. As I have seen every Moore movie Moore has made (for free) I figured why not. I'll tell you why not. Because Moore is attempting not just a rewriting of history but a bastardization of it just like Bill and Hillary did with their books "I Did Not Have Sexual Relations With That Woman" and "The Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy". Nothing his "brilliant expose" brings up factually is either new or shocking if you are educated and follow politics like I do which most Americans are not and do not to their shame i.e. The Carlyle Group, Halliburton, Enron, the Bush-Saudi connection. Moore is very persuasive and convincing that is true but the problem is that his so-called facts and evidence he made up are not and therefore so are his suppositions and conclusions. The most blatant lies are that Gore actually won the presidential election (Moore swiped an editorial headline from a newspaper and turned it into a fictitious headline and is now being sued by them) and that Saddam posed no threat to U.S. security, didn't have chemical weapons, and had never murdered a single American. Where were you when the Gulf War was happening? Thought I'd forgotten about that one didn't you? He leaves out the important facts and the full story substituting coincidence, wild conjecture, and BS while at the same time trying to make the President look like he is more evil than Hitler which is impossible as nobody is worse than Hitler except Stalin and the Devil himself. Viewers beware Moore with his textbook duping of unsuspecting people will be pulling on your every heart string like he always does and don't forget his trademark inclusion of poor Flint, Michigan into every single movie he makes when is he gonna give it a rest NOBODY CARES ABOUT FLINT, MICHIGAN even the people who live there! Conclusion: Nice try Mike but we aren't fooled by this either. You have YOUR OWN political agenda (like getting this one out to the masses before the 2004 election happens to influence the outcome) and the mockumentary you received so much undue praise for proves that. A smart person listens to BOTH sides of a story and then passes judgment as the truth lies somewhere in between and I didn't see anybody interviewed with a opinion other than his (obviously not even-handed or a documentary) It does leave you with something to think about and ponder (false journalism in films and political propaganda as a tool to blind people to the truth.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore or less?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to comment on this as good or bad entertainment, in an unbiased way.Here's an idea of what you're going to watch :It' is more like a very long political campaign commercial, against the incumbents. If you relish 'paid-for-by...' type of late season ads, you'll like this. If you're voting for the challenger, you'll think it's the greatest thing, since 'Gone with the Wind' (It's not as long, but it'll feel that way)The first part deals with the oil trade and the connections between the Saudis and the west and the oil trade ( by the way, that have existed this way since the first world war). Then there are a lot of graphic civilian and troop casualties, but absolutely no graphic images of the 9/11 attack. (I guess Mr. Moore wanted to be sensitive to 'those people') I found this rather odd, but after carefully reading the disclaimer at the beginning of this, er, whatever it is, it appears that it is not meant to inflame everyone.My advise: it's exactly what you'll expect, based on what you've heard, and if you're looking for entertainment , well, this isn't all that much fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike in the US, the European press has generally been pretty anti the Iraq war all along, so the general feeling this side of the pond was that something fishy was going on, even if we didn't quite know what it was. So it was with great interest that I watched this film. Now the first part seemed pretty good. All our fears were confirmed about what Bush &amp; co were doing and I was left with the feeling that any doubts that the US administration were a bunch of cowboys were totally misfounded.The second part of the film I found pretty distasteful though. It basically concentrates on the civilian and US military casualties and is very obviously grossly biased. Apparently Iraq was full of shiny happy people before the US invaded. I think not. So not entirely happy with the film as a whole, I did some research on the web. I can recommend Dave Kopel's site (amongst others) to provide 'the case for the defense' as it were. Studying these sites was a very enlightening experience. Suddenly a lot of 'facts' in the film were much less clear and I was amazed how I had allowed myself to be mislead on some issues. Just shows the real power of the media.So this film is definitely a 'must see'. But don't watch it in isolation.And finally, given that in places the film is such an obvious distortion and given that this will likely create a backlash, could it be that Moore is actually a republican?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Um ... so what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a member of either US political party. In fact, I despise the two-party system. I don't like Bush. Don't hate him, but think he isn't intelligent or strong. So I go see F 9/11 to find out what I don't know. What I discover is, very little. Michael Moore is a man whose motivations I admire. But in F 9/11, after seeing image after image that attempts to say something, anything, negative about the Bush presidency but rarely actually gives proof of why we should think that, I walk away feeling used.Oh, Moore shows us Bush is a timid man, possibly one who doesn't make a move (literally, in one instance in a classroom) without an advisor, but really, many top CEOs, movie stars and other in charge of large enterprises wait for handlers and assistants to direct them, sometimes to a fault. And he talks about the Bush family's connection to the Bin Ladens (old news for some). And he shows soldiers and parents questioning the Iraq war (just as some did over Vietnam and Korea). And then, in an odd twist, he returns to his Roger &amp; Me roots and goes to Flint, Michigan, where he makes the specific and general point that the poor fight our wars while the elite (in this case, kids of Congress members) don't. Gee, that was true in the Civil War.OK, so maybe some people don't know this stuff, or haven't thought about it. I can accept that. But the way Moore goes about making some of his points is highly manipulative, on the order of the same things he seems to accuse the Bush presidency of doing.[Minor spoilers] For instance, he spends a good 10-15 minutes on a woman whose son was killed in Iraq, and on her and her family's grief. She questions why he had to die, and even says what has become a cliche in these case: "The parent should never have to bury the child." But while anyone would have sympathy for this woman and her family, this is nothing new. It happened during the Vietnam War. It happened during the Korean War. Questioning the goals of the US in a war and grieving over lost lives didn't start in 2003. And Moore knows this. But by spending so much time with this woman and her family, Moore tries to emotionally affect -- manipulate -- the viewer. This isn't about new information, or new ideas. This is about making you feel a certain way by appealing to your human emotions. Hitler did it, too. And it says absolutely nothing.Moore does the same with vets who have lost limbs, and even a Marine who refuses to go back to Iraq. OK, fine. They feel that way. And it is a terrible thing to lose limbs in a questionable war. Not a new thought, and I hope these guys can lead happy lives. Next?Even the opening credits are designed to manipulate. They show members of the Bush presidency having makeup applied before being interviewed on TV or giving a speech. Ominous music plays in the background. Are we supposed to think they are putting on their game faces, getting ready to perform? It is hard to say. But the truth is, almost everyone who appears on TV -- including Moore -- has makeup applied. It is a visual medium. Bush is no different. So?Finally, the mini-sermon about how the poor fight our wars is not only old news, but it is easily explained. I graduated high school in the early 80s, and even then I thought -- as did many of my peers -- that those who joined the armed forces after high school did it largely because they had few options. Almost no one who could go to college -- whether on a scholarship or with financial aid or by paying themselves -- joined the military. It was an option of last resort. It wasn't preferred, except by a small percentage of people who wanted the military as a career (and these folks often went to the academies). So, the fact that the poor fight our wars -- and that recuiters go to places where they can find poorer people -- is not some scheme. It is the way it works in our society. The only way to change it would be to either enforce mandatory military service or pay the military so much that people would choose it over other careers. Somehow I doubt Moore would like either option.In the end, I left F 9/11 dissatisfied, and a little depressed. Because if THIS was the movie that had so many people gasping, then those people either haven't paid attention or don't think about things much. And that was the saddest thought of all. I gave F 9/11 a 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subpar docu-drama with little redeeming value.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I thought the movie would have more spiffy action and high jinks. But most of it is just boring interviews that went on way to long for what little each piece had to say. I think any high school graduate with an inexpensive video camera could have done a better job. Spoilers below:The whole bit about the Bush and Bin Laden families was stupid. Rich people know each other, so what! Osama himself has been ostracized from the Bin Laden family and even Saudi Arabia for decades. Moore made it all sound so ominous. But his connections were so tenuous as to not be believable. However, I did understand the rich vs the poor (Or, rich helping the rich) bit and I wholly concede that point to Moore.I did like the bit about the two military recruiters who trolled Moore's hometown looking for young people who had few options in that out of work wasteland. That was just evil. It's too bad Moore didn't expand on that a little more than he did.The whole bit about President Bush at the children's school on the morning of 9/11 was just bogus. Moore distinctly said "he was told about the attack". In fact, all his aids told him was that a plane had evidently hit a building and they didn't know if it was an accident or not.Basically, the movie tries to paint Bush and the republicans in a very bad light with a lot of smoke and mirrors. Taking things out of context, using innuendo, and parading people with disgruntled lives doesn't lend itself to good documentary style. In fact, I couldn't call this a documentary at all. It is a docu-drama style film that is mostly just boring. The film is about two hours and twenty five minutes long. Properly edited it could have been a nice thirty minute piece. Still, I recommend it to aspiring documentary film makers so they can see what not to do! I was so hoping for something better....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Think to yourself why someone doesn't want you to see this movie? I have seen many news medias tell us, that this movie is bad, they attack Micheal Moore personally, they say the movie is all lies. I wonder why they don't want the people to see it? Why they have fought, this movie from coming out? Why have they fought, this movie from coming to your local movie theater? Why would they fight so hard against a movie? I did go see it! I cried, I laughed, I questioned, and I fought the knot in my throat and stomach. I don't want you to believe everything you see. Take a notebook with you. When you see something, you don't think is true, write it down, then when you get home, get on your computer and search for the answers. BTW, everything that the critics have said, has been addressed and debunked on Micheal Moore's website also! But don't take anyone's word for it, search for yourself and find the answers, to the questions that you have. The thing that Moore accomplishes above all in Fahrenheit 9/11 is to debunk the myth, that people who do not support Bush also hate America. Moore gently kids groups such as Peace Fresno, a group of sweatshirt-wearing, cookie eating people who meet and discuss world peace. But he treats American soldiers with deadly earnestness. He muses, not without a bit of awe, that many of them come from impoverished sections of America, such as his beloved hometown of Flint, Michigan. "They fight so that we don't have to," he says. But if it gets people to start questioning their leaders and asking how much we are willing to let them get away with, then it will have done a service.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a documentary, but it's never dull. And though I've heard from the other side that there are lies in the film, I've not seen a challenge of anything specific.Indeed, the film is mostly a string of news clips of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice, Powell and Moore lets them speak for themselves with damning results. There is some narration by Moore, and the other most heard opposition is from Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA) who is a psychiatrist and describes the Bush admin applied Machiavellian strategy. The film is an emotional roller coaster, goes from laughter to tears, and even an occasional fright. Great soundtrack. Obviously I recommend this film. I think that Michael Moore has done a great public service.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this the other day, Friday at rush hour, and was profoundly moved. I had to hold back my tears during many of the more personable parts, including the mother of the dead soldier. While I choked up, others in the sold-out audience wept hard and loud. The movie was good, and I do suspect that it will best Documentary again (compared to Super-Size Me I almost positive) but, like most documentaries (especially Super-size me) it was biased, but with just cause. Though I did get tired off all the attacks on Bush, since we already know he's a fool, I thought that overall it was a very, very powerful film, as I said in the beginning with all the crying that could be heard. But, I don't think he really nailed it, he did go after Halliburton, but even after that he went on with the outright attack on Bush, causing more laughter, but, I think he should have gone more after the companies that own Bush and not cheap laughs at his stupidity. Don't get me wrong, it was an awesome documentary, I like it better than Bowling, but, what they didn't say was that even if Kerry wins, the companies that own Bush have already switched to Kerry's side, (already!), and now Kerry will just be the puppet for mass destruction. But, the good thing is that we can hold Kerry closer to the fire, Bush is flame retardant, no pun intended, but Kerry is much brighter, which could be a bad thing, nonetheless, we can hold him much closer to the fire than Bush ever was.Great documentary, really doing its job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore does what numerous others in pages of books and hours of interviews have been unable to do. He takes a complicated web of deceit and puts it together in a way that people can understand. He cuts through the lies, shows the hypocrisy, and levels the political playing field. Neither Democrats nor Republicans are spared in this film, which looks at the nation in crisis, brought on by its own heads of state. Kudos to Michael Moore!In addition, I am especially impressed with Moore's refusal to make this movie into a Kerry-campaign message. In fact, the Democrats take the heat, too. We citizens were misled and forced into this war; I remember as the war drums were beating last year, not feeling like I could say anything critical of it. I have never felt oppressed in this country until that moment, and I am glad that Howard Dean broke the ice, that Michael Moore has kept the dialogue going. I just hope that this whole thing turns into a real discourse in which all leaders are criticized, including the Democratic candidate. Our government is in a stranglehold by the monied elite, and it is time to take it back. Thanks, Michael!</fullReview>

There are moments of revelation: Lila Lipscombe's journey of understanding is nothing less than stunning. There are images that are so hard to look at I had to close my eyes.I don't ever remember seeing a movie, documentary or otherwise, where the audience stood up and applauded at the end.

		<shortDescription>There are always Three Sides to Every Story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Your side, the other guy's side, and the truth. It's funny to me, how when two sides (liberal and conservative) battle each other so intensely, the weaker side will find a way to win the argument. It seems any opinion can be "proved" right; one just has to log on to the internet, or thumb through some independent, slanted magazine, to find SOME story that will vindicate their claims. I miss the days when there were absolutes, the truth and lies. Now every "fact" claimed is FALSE and TRUE, depending on who you ask.And I guess in a political climate like this, men like Michael Moore, who hold such sway over an already fickle and ignorant electorate, can flourish. And so can their films.FARENHEIT 9/11 is basically two hours of conspiracy theory, chock FULL of "facts" that, again, are both TRUE and FALSE, depending on what website you happen to read. Moore asserts, that according to many newspapers and independent investigations, and post election private recounts, Al Gore was SUPPOSED to win Florida. HMMMM. I remember reading, at the time, that several independent recounts were launched, some by liberal newspapers, and all found that BUSH did indeed win the Florida election (narrow margin irrelevant -- a win is a win, fair and square). I guess I read different newspapers at the time. Also, Moore again jumps on Bush for the infamous escape of the Bin Laden clan from America (which he also had a whole chapter on in his last book). While I agree that it was a massive security oversight, I seem to remember a blurb from Richard Clark's 9/11 testimony that HE was the one that allowed that to happen, as he was still in power at the time. Also, everyone seems to forget that the Bin Ladens left on private jets, three days later when airports had re-opened. Like I said, there are three sides to every story. Hell, maybe ten. In any case, Moore goes on with his massive conspiracy theory, manipulating the audiences with the heartbreaking story of a patriotic woman who loses her son to the war effort in Iraq. While her loss is devastating, and heartbreaking, I'm sure lemming-like audiences will forget that she is one of MANY who has lost a son, daughter, brother or husband to this war effort, and to the countless wars before it. Death is always a risk when one joins the military; that's why it's always considered such a massive tragedy when civilians are killed in a war. That is part of a soldier's duty: putting his or her life on the line. Sorry folks, but despite what shady recruiters tell you, joining the military aint just about getting the government to pay for your college tuition, it's about sacrifice. I guess it's our own fault we have lost sight of what it is to give part of one self, or sometimes, all of one self to the greater good. I'm sure if you tracked down someone from the depression area, they would tell you we've had it too good for too long. This is not the rainbow-colored paradise sheltered college students seem to think it is...this is an angry planet that is constantly trying to kill you from the moment you are born. While my words sound cold, that is war. People die, and it is sad. War is sad. But it is also infinitely more upsetting when someone uses those deaths to his advantage to sway opinion and make money. That is a dishonor. To make a long review shorter, I can live with these wild conspiracy theories. Nevermind the ridiculous fact that people have drawn up this Machiavellian drama which implicates the Bush family as a sinister bunch maneuvering about a global chess board in the quest for ultimate power (what is this? Star Wars?), afterall, it's popular to hate a Republican president. I can forgive Moore and all his fans for that. But what really upset me was Moore basic thesis statement: "Bush is evil, and his misled us all, and the military is made up of nothing but poor people from poor neighborhoods who are doing all the dying for us, and we should be grateful to them."This is UNACCEPTABLE. I'm sorry, but that makes just about as much sense as the old claim that "It was mostly black people who died in Vietnam." Neither are true. While not to downplay the contributions of the poor, and for that matter, EVERY class in American society to the United States Armed Services, it currently is, and always has been, the MIDDLE CLASS that has made up the military, and its casualties. A warning to you easily-swayed folk: THIS is how communism rises, and freedom is lost. Someone comes along, and turns people against the "evil" rich, by saying that they are out, 24/7, to screw you over. This is dangerous stuff, and if these people get their way, we will all be in a big mess...just ask Russia, Cuba and China. It's FUN to be a communist, isn't? In the end, everyone envies our American freedom. Let's not lose it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love him or hate him, Michael Moore presents facts and images in ways that we as Americans have never seen before. His latest endeavor, Fahrenheit 9/11, will go down in history as the film that helped to bring down a corrupt and dangerously inept administration.The film's power lies not in it's statistics or it's director's obvious message but in it's ability to make one laugh, make one cry and make one think. I did all three numerous times during the film and I will never be the same again.He managed to put a human face on our 'evil enemy', the men, women and children of Iraq who are suffering endlessly due to the prolonged occupation of a foreign power. I, as an American, am shielded from images of Iraqi mothers crying and holding their dead babies. Images of charred and battered bodies lying in groups on a roadside. Images of pre-Invasion Iraq that, while not perfect, had amusement parks and cafes and discos and shopping malls but now those things, along with their food, water, electricity and loved ones, is gone.Mr. Moore highlighted the nefarious way George W. Bush came to power in this country, almost under the cover of night and how he has spent the most time on vacation than any American president in history despite presiding over one of the most tumultuous times ever.The scope of the film touched on the poor, the elderly, the veterans who, when they come back to home, have their benefits cut off by the same president that claims to care so much about them.I am neither democrat nor republican (both parties have their problems) but as an American I thank Michael Moore for opening my eyes and letting me see the truth for myself so that I may make up my own mind.I firmly believe that every single American should see this film. Conservative. Liberal. It doesn't matter. If you claim to love this nation, you should bear witness to one of the most important American films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Follow up on Moore's claims to see if they add up. I find that they don't. For instance:9/11: Moore's attempt to make it appear that Bush's (in)actions were what allowed 9/11 to happen.What that leaves out: Bush authorized the arming of Predator drones before 9/11, something Clinton hadn't done. He also was scheduled to sign into effect a plan to wage a covert war against Al Qaeda right around 9/11. This is despite his government being only partially filled out and burdened by Clinton holdovers due to Democrat obstructionism in the Senate after the recount controversy. Clinton hadn't even clarified whether the CIA and military had legal authorization to kill Bin Laden on sight. I'm not opposed to Bush taking even more action than he did, but these were all things Clinton had refused to do. This is meaningful when you consider that Bush did all this in eight months, despite Senate Democrats foot dragging and slowing the filling of his government. Killing Bin Laden in 2001 wouldn't have stopped the 9/11 terrorist attacks anyway, but I think it's safe to say it's a shame Bush hadn't been in office longer.Halliburton: Moore implies that Bush invaded Iraq to, among other things, award a no-bid contract to Cheney's former company, Halliburton.What that leaves out: Halliburton is one of less than a handful of companies in the world (and the only American one) capable of providing the services that Halliburton provides. Also, past Presidents have awarded no-bid contracts to Halliburton, including Clinton during the Kosovo conflict. Furthermore, Cheney donates most of the dividends from his Halliburton stock to charity.These are just a couple.Also worthy of note: http://FreedomKeys.com/whyiraq.htm</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Check out this film if you want the Government-Approved watered-down version of what happened regarding the Destruction of the Twin Towers. Moore fails to address why on 9/11, our air defenses at Norad were told to stand down, or by whom... so if you want the fat-cat imitation of radical journalism, exposing the pre-approved issues, waste your time and money on this cheap rip-off of Alex Jone's independent documentary "911:THE ROAD TO TYRANNY". The difference when watched side-by-side is this: Moore pretends to care about truth, and dishes it out in tiny bite-sized pieces mixed with lots of opinion gravy; while Alex Jones lays it all out in front of you like a big juicy steak, which some people may have a hard time chewing, but Jones spares nowone in his pursuit of truth. Fahrenheit is not nearly as good as a much earlier Michael Moore Documentary called "Blood in the Face," which I consider a "must see." Bottom line on Fahrenheit is: If you want the fluff, see Moore; but if you want the stuff, see "Road to Tyranny."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless for a non-American</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only real reason that I set the video for this film when it was on Channel 4 last Thursday was to basically see what all the fuss was about. I remember vividly seeing Michael Moore's "stunning" acceptance speech at the Osacrs when he won Best Documentary for "Bowling For Columbine". I also remember watching said film and actually quite enjoying it. So, hoping to get the same experience from this movie as I had done for his previous one, I settled down to watch this.I did not enjoy this film. Simply and honestly, I did not enjoy this film at all. For a British person this film has very little relevance to our society. I can understand clearly how relevant it would be to an American audience, of course, but this went too far in their direction. At least "Bowling" had some relevance - we have had a number of school shootings over here, such as the 1996 Dunblane tragedy. This film was too heavy on the gore and war footage for my tastes, but in a way this was a good thing. Not enjoyably, but politically. At the end of the day, this is after all an anti-war movie.It also happens to be an anti-Bush movie, and this is where the biggest faults lie. It just is anti-Bush, anti-Bush, anti-Bush...AUGH!!! Enough already! It is clear that you don't like this man, Moore, but you don't have to shove it down our throats! If you're going to make an anti-Iraq war movie, then why didn't you mention the fact that the British ARMY HAVE ALSO FOUGHT ALONG SIDE THE Americans AND DIED ALONG WITH THE Americans??? Sorry, but that really takes the biscuit. It's like all these WW2 movies where the Yanks saved the world from the evil Nazis...WHAT ABOUT THE FLIPPING British?Ahem. Of course, you may be wondering why I have given this movie 5/10 if I didn't enjoy it. The answer is simple: criticism. Political criticism. For what it's worth, this is a good example of the evil of politics and the true villainy and utter stupidity that we face in the Western world in terms of our leaders. The fact that we have this man as one of the most powerful in the world is scary enough without the film's examples!

		<fullReview>If you didn't hate Bush before, you do now. Nothing but criticism and blameworthy discussions about the president. There are a lot of persuasive parts in the movie that make you question your trust for Bush, but overall, Michael Moore tries too hard. The movie was so long that I didn't feel like watching debates.We all know that Bowling for Columbine was considered a false ending and a bribery for the handicapped, and for all we know Fahrenheit 9/11 is the same thing. You have to understand that lash outs at Bush, doesn't necessarily make John Kerry seem much better.Mr. Moore, next time you want to make a documentary, please, hit yourself over the head with a shovel, and ask yourself what the output would be if you opened your opinionated mouth again.4 out of 10.</fullReview>

But I must say that I wasdisappointed in viewing a film that met my expectations exactly- nosurprises, no discoveries, just blah, blah, blah, George W. is anidiot. Fahrenheit 9/11 tries too hard to be effective and insightful. Thenarration seemed inappropriate for the subject. Of course this filmhas gained a great deal of hype after 9/11 and now during theelections, but I would have hoped to see more criticism of thismediocre documentary. I am a true-blue democrat, but I could not take this film or Mr.Moore seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that a lot of Republican pundits have savagely attacked this film as being a distortion of the truth. Heck, some of those people have actually seen the film, not many, but some. Does Moore despise George W. Bush? You bet! Does he hope to tarnish his image with this film? You bet! Does that mean that this film is propoganda, which seeks to distort the truth? Well, let's see. Is the mother who lost her son in this war a distortion? She was military through and through, a flag waving supporter of troops, whose family had more than given to the cause. She turns out to be one of the biggest opponents of the war and Bush. Is she being distorted? Is that Moore feeding her lines? What about the many soldiers that talk about how they were mislead and can think of nothing but leaving a "bogus" war? What about the Bush lies in which he continued to tie Bin Laden with Saddam? When in reality, the Bush family has much closer ties to Bin Laden that Huessein. War has always been used by despots for control of the masses. Give the people an enemy, raise an army and keep people scared and loyal. However, as this war wages on, all I can remember seeing are those Halliburton suits, throwing parties and delighting in the amount of money they were going to make off of this tragedy. The bottom line is the money to be made, not the lives that have been and will be lost. In this country, people say that if you are not supporting the President and the war, you are not patriotic. Well, if patriotic is one that blindly follows a liar and a thief, call me a traitor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this for free which was the only way I was going. A friend had bought advanced tickets and couldn't go at the last minute. A documentary belongs on TV, the big screen actually detracts from it. Anyway, I sat with a whole bunch of people who quickly became bored when they realized that this wasn't a movie, hype or not. The film itself stunk, nothing but comments over rehashed news clips. The Daily Show and the cable news channels do this everyday...and a lot better. Moore presents a very weak case that Bush is in cahoots with the Saudis, made all the weaker by news stories that have come out in the past few months. I liked Roger and Me quite a bit but Moore has gone steadily downhill since then. Someone needs to remind him that when you make a documentary it's about OTHER people. Thank God Lucas &amp; Spielberg don't jump in front of the camera as much as this guy. Save your money and wait till this hits cable and you are REALLY bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, let me say that I come to this movie with a decidedly biased viewpoint: I didn't like Bush before I saw this movie. However, I don't see how you can question the validity of it. The film was compiled of real footage, and it was sewn together brilliantly. Moore makes several very good points which we can not afford to ignore.However, I don't want this review to turn too political (if that's possible). The fact is, I gave Fahrenheit 9/11 a 10 because it was very funny, very sad, and extremely interesting. No matter who you are, this movie will move you (at least I hope that's true). Moore has achieved a decided mastery of the documentary film genre (although some wouldn't call it that). His team finds amazing footage and manages to sew it together in the most effective way possible.No matter your political view, you should go see this movie, and watch it with an open mind; it's going to effect the political atmosphere in our country for several years.

He may be a good filmmaker... but he is so obsessed with hatred for Bush he is consumed with trying to degrade them by any means at his disposal. A movie should be entertaining or at least educational. Unfortunately this one is neither. A documentary weighs the facts and comes to an educated conclusion.

The more obese the person, the more skin they have, and if they have more skin then they are certain to have more sweat glands, no? You see where I'm going with this. The obese body also has many flabby crevasses in which bacteria can proliferate. Bacteria reproduces most rapidly when enjoying a warm, dark, and humid environment with limited oxygen.

		<fullReview>OK, Let's cut to the chase with a few aesthetic and otherwise classified bla bla in the cinematic sense, and then wrap it up in a bow. But just realize that this isn't really a movie review?it's just some bla bla about this movie?which I just saw. Ps, I don't think there are any 'spoilers' in this text, but if you are worried, just don't read it.The cut to the chase:1. The soundtrack was totally hilarious for 10 minutes, then it became the underling theme for 'hey, it's joe-key joke time' that never became 'hi ?larious' as intended (I mean they didn't even use the original versions of The Animals or The Who?even with the set up of 'won't get fooled again' as the big 'rock' launching pad, for which they could only procure some 'reprise' version?which harshed my stuff. Apparently, Cadillac or Lincoln or some derivative has the Rights on that one. And they totally ham- it-up with the bonanza 'hee-haw' bit where they make Bush look like a moron?wow, I didn't realize that Conan O'Brian wrote the setups for Late Night will Michael Moore). But I have to admit - there are a few choice cuts like the theme song from American Hero?Ca, c'est beau.2. The bit about the family from Flint, MI that lost their son is - although the first piece of film that honestly made me cry since I don't know when?maybe Slingblade - is completely unfair. This family's pain is something I hope I never have to suffer through and I am deeply sorry for them and all like them, but the directing is exploitation and vicious on this storyline, and therefore, bogus.3. The voice-overs and imagery are often inappropriate?or rather?unsuccessful, in the sense that Moore hopes to assume the narrative role of someone other than himself, (for instance the opening 'it is only a dream, or is it?' preface/opening sequence) while maintaining the 'it hits home' reality bites angle. But in affect, this just makes the narration sound too tabloid and preachy?with leading questions that just prove that there are some good people and some bad people - way to uncover the universal truth there, captain.4. The stuff about ?who is in the-'coalition of the willing' is racist, or was that ironically ironic?or otherwise one of the permutations of ironically ironic characterizational improvisations?or maybe it was just that 'feel good' filler material, intended to provoke some cheap laughs to keep the audience engaged? What about the alignment with Spain and the UK? I'm sure there is some free footage of 'Benny Hill' on the net somewhere, non? That piece was as Anti-Hollywood as you can get. Je ne sais pas, mais on y va.5. And as much as I can't believe I write this, the low-blows to the Mtv 'sweet sixteens' and their apparent spokespeeps Britney stuff and Rickie Manudo, is not fair?they're not on trial?but no matter how you set it up and frame it, the Britney stuff was right-on. The front row laughed at that point.Well, I could probably write about this thing all night. But that would be tiring, and we like to 'take it easy' chez nous. The thing is, is that I just saw this flick at the 9:45 show and now it is totally 4:55 in the morning?and it is still on my mind obviously?(or else I would be in my warm bed right now, and that is the stuff).But regardless of however my initial, politically-changed, yet hopefully-subjective bla bla might appear to a reader of such things, understand that after I hit 'submit' and all the 'email tone' floodgates have been all flooded and stuff, (with apologies for the clich sap you are about to sip) I will remain an American - that will not change no matter which questions bla bla and what who what why where bla bla. The Paul Simon:This is an important film on the whole, and it is a must see I 'spose. But I wanted to come to know something marvel after this 'Salle un' tony danza extravaganza, which did not happen with Fahrenheit 911. And that - is a disappointment. If he could only go 'TO THE YEAR 2000', maybe his predictable and sometimes bombers of 'hot-to-the- touch' bla bla would be potent, instead of the contrary.But y'know, I still have respect for this guy because this film is bold and it takes some of those things that AC/DC talk about in that song of theirs (that bonnie billy totally mucked up really mucki-like) to make a thing like this real?and that is the real deal. That is to say that this guy is making noise?which is redeemable and commendable? but the film?pas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen all of Moore's films. From the very first one, I could see way down the road an agenda on the mind of Michael Moore. He was angry, but no where to vent. So, he enters film. Wish he hadn't. There's enough junk being pumped out of Hollywood already that's geared for nothing more than making a buck via sensationalism. Moore is a master at this, but doesn't excuse him being just another big fat idiot occupying space on Earth. We have all the big fat idiots we can stomach. Was that a pun? Anyway, since Moore has made the big-time(another pun?), he's only become completely insufferable. "Fahrenheit 9/11" gives us a glimpse of what might have happened to Waters if "Pink Flamingos" had won an academy award. There's just no stopping insanity when it's on a roll. I thought that "Naked Lunch" was the most depraved meaningless film I ever saw until I previewed "Bowling for Columbine", but "Fahrenheit 9/11" takes the cake. Here is a sprawling panorama of self-indulgent, condescending garbage bent on maligning the President and country that filled Moore's pockets so much so that he can afford to super-size all his meals now. Living off the fat of the land(was that another pun?)and giving nothing in return. No glory to "Old Glory" in this flick. Just another big fat idiot venting childish anger while he bites the hand that feeds. Was that yet another pun? Save your hard earned cash and wait until it hits the buck theaters if you just have to watch someone make a fool out of themselves.</fullReview>

But the fact is ? we all knew this before! Well, at least I knew it. But, you may say that almost all documentaries are about facts that are known to mankind. Well, Michel Moore's previous controvercial documentary Bowling for Columbine was though also fake and insincere, was at least witty and even clever at times, and ?the brief history of the US' was simply hilarious.  In this movie Mr. Moore tries to be your ?good-fat-buddy', he seems to be so frank and sincere that we can not not beleive him. If he says Mr.Bush is ?bad' and Saddaam (sp?) is ?innocent', than we belive him, but once again, WE KNEW IT!!! This movie is not even trying to be witty, just bare facts narrated by fat-millionaire-Moore. I just can not believe how his guy managed to make the jury at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival so blind, that they gave this movie a 20smth minute standing aviation and the main prize. The movie end with Moore trying to persuade MPs to send their sons to Iraq. Doesn't this remind you of something? Yes, You are right, it's Michael's tradition to finish his movie with an ?honest' speech and with an unfinished interview/chat.  Let me hasten to add, that I gave this movie a 4 because Moore showed us nothing new, just made a movie so that he could be called an American Hero, who opened the eyes of simple Americans on their ?evil' President. I don't know how couldn't people in the US not know this, we here in Europe knew it for a long time.</fullReview>

If you see it with a liberal bend it will confirm your worst fears (Bush really is the antichrist and conspires with Osama Bin Laden). If you see it with a conservative bend you'll see it as mere propaganda (that must have been editing trickery because Bush would never be flippant about the 911 attacks). If you're just looking for entertainment, it's mediocre at best. If you're looking to be informed, turn on CNN, FoxNews, MSNbc, or better yet: PBS. It's not great, but it's not awful, but don't believe me (see above).

Some of the answers in Bowling for Columbine are to questions never included in the movie. And for the record, I don't like George Bush. After Fahrenheit 911, however, I've found that Micheal Moore has little more credibility than the dirty politicians he both supports and condemns. This is not a documentary, it is a political propaganda piece, and should be treated that way. I support Disney for not dirting its hands with this.Don't vote for president in 2004.

Michal Moore conducts interviews with bait &amp; switch questions, conclusion drawn from totally irrelevant statements and journalism without context. While this film did give me cause think about the Iraq war and terrorism in general, it left me feeling that I was watching a video of some internet conspiracy theory that had gone on too long. As he did in Columbine, he duped people into looking foolish, paraded grief as some special insight and conducted a strident, personal vendetta directed toward GWB. Though I don't agree with all of the administrations decisions and policies conducted in the Middle East or even many of the "Homeland Security" vs. freedom implications, I could not give any credence to this biased, poorly assembled, piece of propaganda. Perhaps propaganda was the category under which the Palm d'Or was awarded and in that case, it may have been deserved.

		<shortDescription>Film insults its viewer and is hypocritical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no problem with documentaries being biased. I think it's inevitable that any presentation of material will always favor certain conclusions. This movie, however, far from being a well-researched, thought-provoking piece, is inane and insulting. Here are three simple examples:1) After a Senator refuses to "enlist" his son in the Armed Forces, Michael Moore essentially makes the "see-I-told-you-so" argument that the Senators will recruit people relentlessly from Flint, Michigan, but won't sign their own sons and daughters up. This makes no sense for several reasons. First, why would you ever be allowed to sign someone else up for the armed forces? Secondly, the Senator in question SERVED IN THE NAVY. He SIGNED HIMSELF UP.And he talks about it with Michael Moore and the Marine Corporal accompanying him. So Michael Moore's point is completely lost in that episode.2) One of the major themes of the movie is that the White House (and especially President Bush) is in bed with the Saudi royal family. He uses this hypothesis to circumstantially explain all kinds of things, without any support for his claim that resembles "evidence". If the Saudi royal family exerts so much influence over US policy, why did it allow the United States to open up its largest potential oil-producing competitor (Iraq has the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world)? This doesn't make sense. A movie that brings up issues like this without touching even such cursory and obvious points of contention is simplistic and insulting to its viewer. It assumes its viewer knows nothing about the world and will accept whatever speculation the movie offers as truth.3) The opening of the movie claims that all the major analyses of the Florida election results show Al Gore would have won. This just plain isn't true. There were three major studies done on this issue. One concluded that has the votes been counted accurately (as in a hand-recount), Al Gore would have won. The other two studies concluded that Bush WOULD HAVE WON BY MORE. Michael Moore taunts his viewers and mocks them. Either because of his own ignorance or his desire to manipulate, he created a movie which manipulates, obscures, and misleads. This is precisely what he accuses the Bush administration of doing. Because I remember history, read the papers, and study these issues, it is blindingly obvious to me how deceptive the movie is and how much it both preys upon people who don't have time to do the research themselves and insults those who do.</fullReview>

Moore is a disgusting humanbeing it makes me sick to think there is actually a person this bad that he attempts to make a career out of tragedy.This is basically Moore trying to get rich and trying to say its him telling the truth about bush. The truth about bush is he is a good president he may not be the best but he is certainly not the worst an he is much better then Kerry could ever be. So Moore please when there is another terrible tragedy please don't try to make millions off of it please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally based in falsehoods and distortions of fact.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read all of these critics given this film high marks, and I couldn't understand it at first. Until I realized that they were mainly critiquing Moore's film techniques. I guess in those terms, the film is good. But there is one problem. This film is supposed to be a documentary. Documentaries are supposed to be a kind of film that presents factual information or ideas based in fact. Moore's film is NOT a documentary because it does neither. Its an editorial piece, meaning its an expression of opinion that does not necessarily have to be based on fact. This should not be called a documentary.Now, the big problem with this film-it is full of falsehoods and misleading distortions of the facts. For example-the film presents the conclusion that the U.S. went into Afghanistan to put in an oil pipeline. Those who think that oil companies are the root of all evil will agree with it. But there is one problem-there is absolutely no factual evidence that this is true, while there is overwhelming evidence that the U.S. went into Afghanistan to get the people who sent terrorists to kill thousands of people in New York and Washington.Can Michael Moore say that he believes we went to Afghanistan to get an oil pipeline? Sure. I can say that John Kerry married a member of the Heinz family because he likes ketchup. It doesn't make either true, because there is no evidence supporting either conclusion. Now, here's the rub. Moore uses a technique of going to people and asking them a general question, then using that as evidence of some specific claim. It would be like me finding an interview with Kerry where he is eating a burger with ketchup on it, and my using that as evidence that he married his wife because he likes ketchup.2+2 does not equal 10. That's why Moore's film is so full of crap.He also used editing techniques which deliberately set out to make American soldiers and President Bush look evil. He shows footage of dead Iraqis and women crying over the bodies of their dead loved ones. Then, he immediately cuts to footage of American soldiers saying how they like the adrenaline rush when they go into a firefight. Then, he shows more footage of dead Iraqis, then shows President Bush laughing, at what we don't know.What I want to know is-where is the footage of American soldiers wounded with arms and legs blown off in Iraq? Wouldn't that be a good anti-war statement for Moore to use? He doesn't. Why? Well, let me make a statement based on some evidence. He doesn't care about the American soldiers who have died in the war. What's my evidence? In Caen, he told reporters that he hopes more American soldiers die in Iraq, to teach America a lesson. Does that sound like someone who cares about wounded or killed American soldiers, by hoping there will be more?Back during the Monika Lewinsky scandal of the Clinton administration, Hillary Clinton spoke of a "vast right-wing conspiracy" to get her husband. I think there is clear evidence that was true. But now, America faces a vast left-wing conspiracy to get President George W. Bush, made up of people in the media, editors of major newspapers, and Hollywood types, all of whom do not like President Bush and conservatives like him. They know that the big issue of this election is not going to be jobs or the economy or the environment. The statement "its the economy, stupid" does not apply in the world we live in now. The big issue of the election will be the war on terror conducted by the Bush administration from 9/11/01 to now, in Afghanistan, Iraq, here in America, and in other places. This is an area where Bush is strongest. But Bush is not a very articulate person, so its hard for him to combat attacks on him that are not necessarily based in fact. So, the vast left-wing conspiracy can use mis-information campaigns against him with greater ease than they could against, say, Reagan during the 1980's.Michael Moore is a part of that conspiracy, and this propaganda film is his contribution to the left-wing's efforts to remove Bush from the presidency. His techniques are Stalin-like in their use of mis-information and twisting of historical evidence. Don't believe the mis-information. Don't bother seeing this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. The greatest piece of Left Wing liberalism dogma I have ever seen. Mr. Moore uses every ounce of creative force he has to prove that what he said at his Oscar acceptance speech was true...in his opinion. This is way too one sided for me, and obviously Moore has an ax to grind with President Bush, as well as an ego the size of the Grand Canyon to prove he was right. You will love it if you are a bleeding heart liberal, despise it if you are a hate-mongering right winger and think what I think if you are somewhere in the middle which is that it is too one-sided. No wonder why leftist Hollywood loves this film. And Moore should have gotten Mr. Bradbury's approval before he ripped off the name of his genius book. No class at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misrepresentation of Facts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly can't stress how dangerous this film is. In his usual way Moore presents legit facts in ways and with images that make you think 2+2=4. I myself left the theatre feeling quite disturbed, mixed-up and not proud to be a US citizen. Fortunately, once you are out of the theatre and have had time to think, which hopefully you will do, logic steps in and you see a bit more clearly. It's the visuals that are in bad taste in my opinion. We are subject to many of the worst images associated with war and we should be disturbed but that in and of itself doesn't mean that we should never go to war. The truth is that Michael Moore could make a very convincing film about how he himself profited from the events of 9/11 but you won't see that. Instead you will see him doing this same number on our President. Let's not forget that Mr. Moore is a multi-millionaire at the expense of folks losing jobs in Mich, kids dying at Columbine and now those who died in New York and Iraq. Michael Moore has not and probably never will give a sizable portion of the profits from his films or books to the victims he likes to exploit. These are not non-profit undertakings. He has made more than enough money to never have to work again and be much more profitable than those unfortunates he first showed us in Flint, MI. You'd have to look a long way to find such hypocrisy. Please remember when you watch this film that Michael Moore will be making millions off the events he is presenting to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cynical Everyman Michael Moore does yeoman's work in his latest attack on "The Man." Sensational, yes, but in an eagerly awaited installment of our great social debate, our man fires blanks in a target-rich environment. We have been served one man's Jihad for more self-absorbed attention and box office returns wrapped in an MTV bun without the fixings. In this episode, instead of General Motors or the NRA, Mikey's sites are set on a branch of American Royalty, the Bushes, and his emotionally-based conclusions, like the dog, just don't hunt.Production values have improved with Mikey's journey along the road to truth, justice and the American Way, but a once promising sage of our nation's foibles has lost his way. Like a Robert Ludlum novel, he sees conspiracies, and like Ludlum in his older years, the contrived and artificial story line has become tedious in the telling.America's favorite counter-culture millionaire has thrown gasoline on the flames of self-righteousness. If the topic wasn't so serious, the scope and breadth of this film would pass as a national lampoon of the first order. As it is, Mikey has so muddled the facts that the most compelling discussion of our day has slipped the grasp of this once grand story teller. He coulda, woulda, shoulda, but didn't.I winced when Elvis took the stage in later years, a diminished reminder of the brilliant talent that once was. I give Farenheit 9/11 a very disappointed *1/2 out of **** stars with the * going to the memory of the King.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I start, don't get me wrong, before watching this movie I had nothing against Michael Moore, quite the opposite. I had a lot of respect for him. I quite enjoyed "Bowling for Columbine" and felt it was a well-made documentary.That being said, I was terribly disappointed in this movie when I recently saw it for the first time. I've worked in the Media industry and I've seen how journalists put the spin on a story. Usually they start with one small fact and expand it out with conjecture, mixed with their own personal opinion and some sneaky editing, you've got a documentary that backs up your own opinion.Even though the said documentary is really only LOOSELY based on facts.This is what he does, he shows some disturbing images, mixed with a soundtrack that will rip at your heart strings, then he cuts to an image of a politician (mostly Bush) saying the complete opposite to what you have seen. Bingo! That person is now a hypocrite.What he doesn't do is take into account the matter to which that person is referring to at the time. You don't hear the FULL statement, just the snippet Moore wants you to hear.The movie itself is well made, but please keep an open-mind when watching this. It only shows ONE side of the story and I always thought a documentary was meant to show BOTH sides.Please know, I don't hate Michael Moore, he is doing after all what he does best. Getting his opinion across. I just don't wish people to read into this movie as fact, and form conclusions, without taking into account the full debate.I've given it a 1 as I feel as a documentary, it fails completely because of the point listed above.I hope "Sicko" turns out to be more in the spirit of "Bowling for Columbine" than this movie.</fullReview>

Where are we now in the US of A other than where Moore predicted we would be in his film? Where is Dubya's approval rating now--like an Oklahoma winter--mid to low 30's? We all have tons of money in our pocket--right? And, ah, yes, his recipe for success? SEND MORE TROOPS!! Osama Bin Laden hasn't been caught, and it's been almost six years. In fact, you won't even hear his name mentioned unless some archival footage has come out to the main news media about his disdain for what Dubya is doing now--and you can count on Fox News will be there to pick it up.Lets face it, I put more faith in the goings on of the world today in Michael Moore than our current administration. In years to come, if we are still around to appreciate the omen this film produces, we'll all look at it with a big "I told you so" blaring right in our faces.</fullReview>

Liberals FEEL that their opinions are superior and it feels good to go with the chanting and the slogans. Except for the leaders of the Liberals, who know what to say to exploit the masses. A conservative is concerned about what is best for all, but a liberal is only concerned about his own self interest. I'm guessing that Hollywood is profoundly liberal because they fear that morality would cramp their style and reduce their profits.Moore is heavy handed in his propaganda. This film doesn't rise to the level of a documentary. The only people that are going to be swayed by Moore's arguments are those that failed to get an education from the public school system.

		<shortDescription>What IS a documentary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The documentary used to be an art form unto it's own; a film dedicated to imparting information, "facts", if you will, to the viewer. From Jacques Cousteau telling us about the undersea world to Ken Burns' recent films, they were informative, often painstakingly researched, and generally, if you were interested in the stated subject, entertaining. I loved just about every one of them.Enter Michael Moore. I remember, the first time I saw "Roger &amp; Me", thinking it was a funny film. A documentary? Of course not, but a comedy made in documentary style. Surely no one would believe that Roger Smith wantonly and maliciously single handedly destroyed Flint, Michigan for personal and corporate gain, right? Little did I know at that point how seriously Mr. Moore took himself.These days, the documentary is under assault. With television shows like "Who Wants To Marry My Dad?" and psuedo-documentary films like "Supersize ME", the form has been diluted. Which brings us to this film. It's title could have been "George &amp; Me" because nothing has changed. Sure, he can get better interviews, he has better equipment, he got (eventually) a better distribution deal but, in the end, it's the same film he's been making for 15 years. And one could laugh about this if it weren't for the fact that, with the worldwide distribution and all, there's a chance that folks around the world who aren't familiar with his work (see "Canadian Bacon") might actually believe it's a compilation of facts! Which might, in this post-9/11 world, encourage some fanatic out there amongst the rabble to actually believe that our government and, by extension, our security, are that inept, and encourage them to take their shot.But, I digress. If you are of a liberal bent, see "Fahrenheit 9/11" and lose yourself for 2 hours in Mr. Moore's fantasy world. If you are of a conservative nature, see the film anyway, if only to be able rebut, with authority, it's obvious inaccuracies and omissions. But do the brotherhood of documentary filmmakers at large a favor; pay to see "Spider-man 2" then sneak into "Fahrenheit 9/11" instead. Don't encourage this type of film making by throwing money at it! Oh yes, and Michael? I was tempted to take a cheap shot at the end of this commentary, but I wouldn't want to encroach on your turf... </fullReview>

It turns out that the whole movie, while pretty boring, was just over the top propaganda.Moore never defends his views, all of his assertions are speculations and never considers the other side. One of the points made in the movie was that a woman's son is sent off to war because he had no choice for college due to lack of financial aid and parents couldn't afford it. That is fine, but what about student loans? When someone signs a document that enlists them, they need to be fully aware of the responsibility that comes with that.Like most liberals I know, she blames the Republicans for him being killed, and not the fact he thought the army was a better choice then work programs and student loans. I also found it humorous at the lack of civility LIBERALS showed the President when he was inaugurated(sp) by throwing eggs at the car. Bush won the election, he won Florida. It was recounted an infinite amount of times and Gore never had it. It's really sad to see that people actually gave this guy funding to produce such a film.

Instead of the incendiary expose we were promised, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is more like a Bic lighter that has been fired up at one too many rock concerts. Instead of rousing any rabble, it sees Moore restating information -- in his trademark "just folks" voice that softens sarcasm with bemusement -- that anyone who is really concerned about the direction the wars on terrorism and Iraq have taken already knows. Moore shamelessly exploits a mother's grief in a scene where she visits the White House to vent her anger, a trip blatantly patterned on a similar journey taken by relatives of victims and wounded survivors at the end of "Bowling for Columbine."

With each passing day, more and more respected liberals are openly criticizing the factual errors that make up the fabric of this film, and the credibility of the man who made it. I believe this work will go down as a poster child for the phrase "politics of personal destruction." What is most disturbing to me is the absence of national responsibility that this episode has revealed in many people. The children of the sixties (which Moore barely qualifies as) have come of age, and are still children. Isn't it ironic how that supposedly peace-loving youth has bred some of the most intolerant, evil-minded adults.People, it's alright to embrace an opposing or unpopular point of view. That's where many great things are born. But it's important to truly understand your point of view. If you don't question your own beliefs, your world is built on shaky ground. One last thought...Accentuate the positive.Stop with all the negativity. At the individual level, we all make mistakes.

There are no facts to back-up anything he presents, and besides America was a much better place before people like Michael Moore existed.Don't be one of the fools to waste your money. Take my advice Watch a real movie like 30 seconds over Tokyo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judged by what it is, a propaganda film, the film is quite good: it hits all the right buttons playing to people's fears and prejudices. Like all prop messages, "facts" are grossly distorted and twisted to meet the intent of the film: to incite fear and loathing by means of grotesque images and thoughts. It's a very calculated and carefully executed symphony of hate that is intended to play to the worst instincts of the viewer. This isn't just some version of events that's at odds with received truth and therefore perhaps worthy of debate on that point; the film takes truth as a departure point and plunges into an intentionally perverted retelling of one of the most significant events of modern times.If you're entertained by this sort of hysterical yammering, I suggest you recall the old warning from the Sixties: "Too much speed or politics can rot your brain."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Documentary? Give Me A Break!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there was some great footage in this film, the total lack of objectivity and balance was extremely annoying. How this can be considered a documentary when it's so full of one-sided opinions is beyond me. Where's the balance? Point - Counterpoint? It simply didn't exist in this political commercial. As a former military person in a different war, I was very offended at his description of the 'rush' that soldiers get from killing babies. That whole sequence was disgusting. Michael Moore was on screen much less in this film than his previous work and that was refreshing, although his voice narrates throughout. It's not surprising that Michael Moore spends his life bashing George Bush but, come on! Enough is enough. If you're going to bash the President at least try to make it somewhat factual. This was more fiction than fact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typical Moore movie, uses everything possible to prove his point whether it is truthful or not. Fahrenheit 9/11 didn't expose anything that most people didn't already know. The movie is basically a cheap condensed version of "Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War", and "Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election." in one movie. I'm all for getting bush out of office but at least use more credible sources, and don't take everything out of context. The only thing good about this move were the little clips of bush making himself look like a complete and total idiot and that Moore wasn't in the movie as much as he was in his previous releases (Roger &amp; Me, Bowling for Columbine)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Moore -- Simplistic, Lying Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By now, all sophisticated filmgoers understand Moore's recipe. Skillful but misleading editing, unrepresentative but emotionally powerful images, narcissistic self-involvement, and a complete disregard for truth or subtlety. The result, to be sure, can be powerful propaganda. The fact that so many Americans seem to be taken in by it is evidence that the American educational system is in bad need of overhaul. Courses in critical thinking need to be taught in every American high school.Many viewers of this film were apparently struck by Moore's implication that Bush gave members of the Bin Laden family free passes out of the country while airplanes were grounded. Gong! Turns out, this was a fabrication. The planes were not grounded...and the Bin Laden family members were interviewed before being allowed to leave.Many viewers apparently believed that members of the Taliban flew to Texas to meet with Bush. Except that Moore never said that, he only deliberately implied that. Many viewers were impressed by Bush's apparent confusion when first confronted with the developing facts of 9/11. Of course, virtually any person can be made to look stupid, small-minded, confused, mean, whatever if a camera happens to catch them at the right moment. Jimmy Carter was paralyzed for more than a year when the mullahs took hostages. I'm sure that, during that time, there were thousands of minutes when he stared vacantly into space, wondering what to do next. So what?Moore has a way of presenting "facts" that lull people into false premises. For example, in "Bowling for Columbine," he seemed to "randomly" open a door in a major Canadian city and found it unlocked. The message is that there are profound differences between Canadaand the U.S. Of course, anyone who has lived in any major Canadian city knows that Canadians lock their doors, and that it is highlylikely Moore staged the event shown in the film. I'm sure Moore will convert some people with this film. That is what propagandists do.</fullReview>

Take particular note of Moore's claims about the Bush administration supposedly allowing the Saudis to leave America on airplanes WITHOUT being interviewed and BEFORE airspace was re-opened in the days immediately following 9/11. Both claims have already been debunked as being blatantly FALSE!! Heck, even the title has been ripped off from well-respected science fiction author, Ray Bradbury, without permission!!Moore now claims that he'll put extras on his upcoming DVD release (appropriately timed so that he can attempt to alter the course of the fall election in HIS direction) including supposed footage of "interviews" with random people from other nations that tell what they think of America. Hmm...wonder if these will be FAIR and BALANCED interviews, as they should, or if ole Mikey will undoubtedly edit out all the people who's views would happen praise the Bush administration??

So far, plenty of people have publicly stated a great deal of this film is no more than Moore's personal opinion. He has not sued anybody, nor will he. Moore is just a lap dog of the Democrat Party, and like typical Democrats he always appeals to people's fears, not their dreams. Moore is among the greatest cheap-shot artists of all time. He will never permit the truth to stand between himself and the story he wants to portray as the "truth". He is a sad example of someone who attempts to portray himself as an artist, but is no more than the second coming of Geobbels himself.</fullReview>

Moore is manufacturing lies in an attempt to swing an election, to the glee of his pals like Soros, the Nazi expatriate who wants a President that will subjgate the United States to the will of the UN. I grieve for any country that would be swayed this way. There is only one reward for mindlessly following Moore and his lies into voting against Bush.

		<shortDescription>Another comedy from the skewed world of Mr. Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall the good old days when mr. moore was someone to be taken seriously, where his political convictions meant something, where he was after that all so fabled word "the truth", but that was Roger &amp; Me, and that was 15 years ago. In farenheit, mr. moore takes what information is already readily available to the public, be it through general knowledge, government papers, etc... and turns it meet his own political goals, which seem to be an utter hatred for our current puppet of a president, mr. bush. Necessary, no, amusing, maybe, comical, by all means. However, the movie does portray some things that we all as humans should at least acknowledge, the atrocity of war, the hatred of peoples, and the undesirable death of innocents; but all this can be done with a film such as Stalingrad (1993), and not with a piece of propaganda that utilizes this country's recent wound to prod at and make you . Not to mention a bit of prisoner sexual abuse footage shot in Dec, that never made it to the media. Why? Could we not have prevented the abuse of numerous other POW's? Who knows, but it sure points to what undoubtedly is mr. moore's end game, the greenback. Anyway, enough of this rant, but I do wonder if mr. moore will make a film about one John Kerry his ties to the Kennedy's, the Heinz fortune, his somewhat questionable senate voting record and a little thing called special interest. Yeah he probably will, being an independent and all (sarcasm off).</fullReview>

This film is so propagandistic I can only speak of it in terms of "Triumph of the Will" the well known propaganda film made by Leni Reifenstahl, Hitler's favorite filmmaker. Moore is so selective and spins his private take on the tragic events of 9/11 that truth is carefully obfuscated. Give me the same footage and I can make a totally different movie. Moore is counting on the infamy of the event and a polarity in the body politic to insure a big success on a low budget piece of garbage. What he's doing in fact, is spinning a spider web over nearly 3000 unfortunate souls to advance his political agenda. His title should have been Fahrenheit 200, the temperature at which film negative burns. Disgusting. Moore get a life.</fullReview>

It is well made as Bowling for Columbia was, but in spite of getting better Michael Moore criticism has fallen into an hymn of auto satisfaction. Every shot of this movies are so biased that after a while it fails completely to convince the viewer to even listen to Michael Moor's arguments which might be a little bit true. For example as he was talking about America's coalition for Irak we see ridiculous picture which should represent countries and the lack of support that they bring to the USA, but no mention was made from UK, Australia, Japan, Spain, Italy, South Korea, Poland... which forces are definitely more serious than the one show in the movie. Michael Moore only used to defend his idea the tactics to turn his enemies into ridiculousness rather than trying to find any good arguments. All in all if what we see is right, we can conclude that Bush has no brain, his administration is only thinking about selfish interest (how about Moore.. do all the money he made from his pictures and books go to charities or poor Iraky kids?),Irak was the best country in the world far from the corrupted world of USA, Marroco do only have monkeys, Roumania still lives in Middle Age, Holland people are retarded hippies who spend their time smoking pot, every person with a turban is a terrorist, and that if a person of your family is a criminal we should imprison all the family.</fullReview>

He's excellent at persuading, by leaving out the other side, but as for his credibility? He has none. Michael Moore makes some very valid points in this film, but he says NOTHING to support the other spectrum, nor does he even acknowledge it. The only TRUE evidence that Michael Moore gave to you is a grieving mother, longing for her dead son. It's worth watching/renting. In my opinion, the war wasn't justified, but before you make a final verdict on whether to scorn or praise George Bush...see another movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily Moore's best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever pushed the notorious self promoter Michael Moore to drastically reduce his screen time (in comparison to his other films) in Fahrenheit 911, it was a wise choice. As far as I'm concerned he could/should have reduced that screen time even further, but in spite of the weaker sections of the film (where he plays an interviewer who makes his interviewee points for them and feeds his subjects their lines) this is still a brilliant and powerful film. Even some of the questionable paths Moore follows are thought provoking, though not necessarily in the way he might have intended.The most powerful areas in the film for me are the talking heads from various area's of government who, without being pushed, matter of factly state some observations that we rarely if ever heard on national TV networks during the build up and first year of the Iraq invasion. Most of these points made have become more and more obvious by events in the world as time has gone by, and will likely help this film garner positive recognition for years in spite of it's potential to be a quickly dated documentary. The Lipscomb section of the film was generally well handled and might have the biggest impact on non-partisan viewers. Especially powerful here was the confrontation before the blinders-wearing woman accusing Lipscomb of making up the story about her killed son in the military in order to make a political message (though of course, she could have accused Moore of this). That bit of film will be a slap in the face for Moore haters who refuse to consider that they may have been duped in the race to war by their leaders under the guise of being protected from terrorism.This film is flawed but still an important work, and likely a relief for much of the world that worries the USA is sliding towards becoming a dangerous rogue nation behind extremist Neocon pied pipers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mike Moore Film in the Proud Tradition of Joe Goebbels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&lt;&lt;Some Spoilers&gt;&gt;First off, the title of this film irritates me. It is a rip-off of the excellent Ray Bradbury book/script 'Fahrenheit 451'. Obviously, both films are fiction, but the Bradbury film is well written and has substance. Fahrenheit 911 is entertaining and not much more ? with way too much Moore.I am not associated with any political party, and in the current political environment, I am inclined to vote 'E ? None of the Above'. Thus, I am fairly objective. I watched this movie with an objective mind. Early in this film, my mind objected. To say it has a hidden agenda is a gross misrepresentation. The agenda is most assuredly, not hidden. It is subtle as a hand grenade. The timing of the release clearly reveals its political agenda to cast aspersions at the President. This is a valid tactic, since you can't say much positive about either candidate. Where is Alfred E. Newman or Pat Paulsen when we really need them?'Fahrenheit 911' presents a series of 'facts' about George W Bush from the 2000 election, 9/11 attacks and the subsequent invasion of Iraq. All the valid facts could be presented in 5 minutes, however, there is the political message to sway the ignorant and uninformed, i.e., the typical Moore aficionado. F-911 depicts the administration as sinister and corrupt. It promotes the assertion the Bush Administration lied about the WMD. I don't know if they had WMD, or not; but, anyone with an IQ over room temperature would realize the WMDs went to Syria when CNN announced the invasion. Personally, I do not support the Iraq war. It seems like a bad flashback of Viet Nam. I am not a fan of Mike Moore. Give him a disaster and a camera and he is all set to rake in the bucks. Flint, MI is having hard times and Mike is there ? camera in hand and cash in pocket. Kids get killed by wackos in Colorado and Mike makes money, er, a movie. The terrorist jerks kill a bunch of civilians on 9/11 and Mike makes his contribution to his bank account. Yet, no one questions HIS motives! This film may be characterized as Liberal propaganda. This statement is not derogatory. Propaganda has a sinister overtone in America, but propaganda is just presenting a point of view without presenting a dissenting point of view. However, portraying this film as a 'documentary' is a blatant misuse of the word. A documentary is based on facts, not innuendo. Mike raises questions and makes unsupported assertions, but he does not present supporting facts. Hence, the film is not a documentary. My belief is that 'Fahrenheit 911' is a just a political vehicle. It appears that most people either proclaim it as an epiphany or denounce it. I found it entertaining, but I wouldn't want to have the unenlightened use it as a historical document. It is simplistic and strongly biased. Many processes and systems failed us on 9/11. Didn't we learn anything from the first and largely forgotten attempt on the WTC? Willie Clinton was President at that time, and he wasn't taken to task in this film.I guess MM is posturing for a cabinet post in the Democratic Administration?.. Secy of BS, perhaps?2/10</fullReview>

It's clever and funny (in a dark way) but it's not just "documenting" its subject matter. Although I happen to agree with SOME of Moore's points of view, too many things are kluged or deliberately distorted to prove his points. Newsweek and other generally reliable mainstream news outlets have questioned the veracity of several key points of the content in this film. In the end, Moore undermines his own credibility and the validity of any point of view he might hold. Nevertheless, all that has not stopped Moore from getting disgustingly fat and very rich on an amusingly bundled package of half-truths and some outright lies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have found Moore's previous films to be largely entertaining, particularly Bowling for Columbine, but was surprised (given the high acclaim) to end up virtually twiddling my thumbs, debating whether to just bolt towards the end of the movie. It started out well enough, but for me it trailed off substantially. I would have cut a good 20 minutes out of the film.I will not be voting for Bush (just to let you know something about my politics). Watching BFC, I became interested (that's a good thing, right?) in looking up some gun-related topics and was surprised to learn that Moore was a bit disingenuous with some of his material. So before watching F911, I labored thru all of the "56 deceits" page available on the internet. It was informative to watch the film knowing what things were left out and the complete story behind some of the scenes.Now, I will be the first to praise Moore for raising some valuable issues, and I would also let you know that many of these "deceits" are subjective or immaterial, but the bottom line is that there were a number of disturbing disconnects from reality in the movie. In all fairness, no one that I have seen on any side of politics has written a 100% truthful book, for example, generally because research of that depth and breadth is hard to come by, but Moore's intellectual dishonesty in some of this film is to me inexcusable.I tried to think of it as just "entertainment," kind of a Daily Show via film, but in this case for me the entertainment was surprisingly lacking, and I find it disturbing that many will look on this as a documentary, as the gospel truth. I have to assume that the universal praise for this film has a lot more to do with belief systems than with film-making.</fullReview>

All I saw in the movie was a loud cry to the US saying "Do NOT reelect the warmaniac bush, he'll kill all your children". I do not see myself as a pro-war person, maybe not even pro-bush, but this is what the movie looked like to me. In my opinion the movie was created to mess with peoples minds and reminded me a lot of Soviet propaganda. If you have not yet seen the movie I cannot advise you to, but still, if you choose to anyway all I can say is: Make sure you know where to vote before you watch it, and guard yourself from what you see.

Or the way he paints a phony picture of tranquility in Iraq before the bombs start dropping! Nonsense! Moore is a dangerous breed, but I personally think most INTELLIGENT AMERICANS see him for the buffoon he is. Maybe Hollywood likes him, what with them mostly being ivory tower rich types(Barbra Streisand..ect) who say they are for the little guy but find no guilt in taking 25M paydays or charging 2000$ for a concert ticket! What hypocrisy! But in the end, this movie may actually BACKFIRE on the Democrats effort to seize power. Americans by and large aren't stupid. Yea, many of the dolts who get welfare and other public benefits will vote democrat because they are promised that by liberals in return for votes, but the rest of us see the LIES and know Kerry is a dangerous man if elected to the presidency. Our biggest fears won't be Bush for another 4 years, but terrorist having their way in a weakened America! God have mercy on us if Moore gets his way! 911 sucks!~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think making a movie based on such false accusations is immature and very unprofessional, this is just another strategical method for John Kerry to get in office. The people that made this movie should be ashamed of themselves for such obscenity. They have ridiculed, falsified, and mocked the very president of the United States, and their own country. The very man who responded to such an act as 9/11 in the only way a president could. If John Kerry had been in office during 9/11 and not acted on such an occasion the same way, he would have been a traitor to us all. Such films do not move my vote and they shouldn't move the rest of the public either. I only hope the public will see this movie with its real face (just another campaign method) and not for the falsified information that it is.</fullReview>

Michael Moore is nothing more than an arm of the democratic (socialist) party. This film will make happy those extreme liberals happy. People who will like this are those types like white computor nerd liberal men who hate themselves and cackle at things like south park and watch baseball and rave about things like the race of the pitcher. These type of men are churned out from colleges now by the millions. Or the newly created image of black males as arrogant, loud mouthes and crude that come from rap videos and are now considered acceptable types but they are unbearable. Or militant feminist girls who have been taught from childhood that girls don't smile and are never sweet and they should be mean and aggressive, self serving defensive people. These girls are so brainwashed they do not know who they are.It is an awful lie filled film. We have reached total bottom of the barrel with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, but hardly a "documentary"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentaries by definition are objective. Michael Moore's recent films give no indication of his even *trying* to be objective. His agenda is well-known (ever since he was booed off the stage at the Oscars in 2003), and this boorish propaganda, while thought-provoking to this political moderate who has no vested interest in either political party, is an insult to anyone with a brain who wants to think for themselves.Like "Roger &amp; Me" and "Bowling for Columbine", Moore takes a lot of liberties with the truth in order to make his repetitive point(s). Creative editing, lack of contextualization and blatant misrepresentations litter this film. Again, it's thought-provoking, and that is never a bad thing. But the delivery under the pretense of objectivity is laughable, and the fact this film is even qualified as a documentary is ridiculous.Moore has basically become the Rush Limbaugh of the Left (yes, he's a big fat idiot). Why people give him a platform is beyond me; I agree with many of Moore's social opinions, yet I vehemently disagree with his tactics. They are akin to teaching racism to the next generation of America; preaching hate and anger isn't a good idea, especially when you're doing it dishonestly. Shame on you, Michael Moore, for you're just as vile and reprehensible as those you choose to "expose" with your "documentary". Just because you may stand on a higher moral ground doesn't excuse your intellectual slum job in this film.</fullReview>

Roger and Me was a masterpiece of work but Moore has become self-involved to go after the political right. Moore could be a great movie maker but he decided to be a press manager for Osama Bin Laden. Moore might need to attack issues such as the homeless in America. Another good topic he could cover would be how the priest molested children for several years and the Arch Bishops ignored it. I am not condemning the Catholic Church. There are also topics such as the ill treatment of the elderly and the failing disposition of public education in America. Is your agenda ignoring the Oklahoma Bombing.Is the reason you are not questioning it is because you liked that President. Or better yet, tackle the first WTC attack.I am glad that I saw this movie free. By the way, there were only nine people in the theatre. Mr. Moore!

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be extremely thought provoking. Whether or not Michael Moore is biased .. his point is that war should only be an done when absolutely necessary. I can't agree more. What seems strange to me is that the USA have not learnt from their mistakes in Vietnam. I am a victim of the Vietnam War ... an orphan who has been adopted to a family in white society where the prevailing notion is that "we in the west have a superior way of life and have justified/religious notions for inflicting suffering on innocent people because of a greater and glorified end result"! What makes the war in Iraq worse is that is was unprovoked and that the US thinks it is superior to the UN and the notions it stands for. How could the world stand by watching and allowing the US to bypass an organisation setup to prevent the recurrence of historical events that called it into being?! What kind of super power are we allowing to dominate the world? Who is standing up to this and questioning whether it should be allowed? I say bravo Michael Moore for thinking outside the square and being brave enough to have personal attacks launched at you because you can see that something is very wrong here.I also question why some of our Australians are dying and fighting in a country we have no right or need to be involved in. I can imagine within 10 or more years .. the world will be saying that the US made the same mistake they made in Vietnam - that they had no right to invade! Where are the weapons of mass destruction? We were all duped as it was a means to an end for Bush! How does he sleep at night? I'm glad we have a democracy that allows films like Michael Moore's to exist. Someone has to speak up because like he points out, most Americans are being brain washed by their media who only give out the messages the Government and those in power wish to portray.Michael Moore's films are refreshing and thought provoking .. they question us to not be like sheep .. blindly led .. but to think for ourselves. Is Moore correct .. is war necessary in Iraq .. is Bush a crazed idiot seeking to lead a nation on his own agenda .. similar to the power Hitler had over the German nation? One has to question these things otherwise we are at risk of losing our integrity, our souls, and our beliefs &amp; values.Michael Moore is a thought provoking writer/producer who reminds me of another deep thinker - John Pilger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a documentary, just stabs at President Bush and his administration. I usually like Moore's stuff, but if he is not going to be objective, his work just turns into political propaganda. Nice to know these things are going on in the Presidents Administration, but the other side is not represented at all (if not as a joke)- I'm sure if the film wasn't as slanted as it was, I would have enjoyed it.Moore is just riding on spectacle, using one of the Nation's horrific events to listen to his babbling self. I see the benefits of making a 'movie' out of everything because it will be able to touch a lot of people, but if people are not given the right facts entertainment must not be the proper way to feed people clips and half truths. Moore is manipulating the power of entertainment to get people involved in politics (GOOD), but not in the way that people 'should' be getting involved. Now, everything is a joke or must be portrayed in the way that Moore puts it- making people want to tune in. But at what cost?? What will it take for people to tune in later? an even bigger spectacle. Farenheit 9/11 is worth seeing, but please don't praise it for its documentary aspects, because it has none- just propaganda in a different package.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's true colors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore simply cannot help himself. He truly does hate America's military, the Republican Party, the Bush administration, and more specifically, President Bush. He may not be the only person who does, but Moore goes a bit further by producing a movie about his personal demons (listed previously). The film is rife with misleading clips and incomplete interviews that are edited (quite well I must say) that extract only the items of Moores paradigm of anti-conservatism or anti-military. Mr. Moore attempts to associate President Bush with the Saud royal family, basically indicting the President of invoking a war for personal financial gain. He also makes ludicrous claims that George W. Bush secreted away Osama bin Laden's family from the U.S. prior to military action. Further claims that the invasion of Afghanistan was to build an oil pipeline. Every one of these, as well as virtually every other claim in the film, have been debunked. Without going into the debate of why the war was started, suffice it to say that Michael Moore is simply putting his hatred onto cellulose for the liberal world to revel in.As for the technical side, the film is sketchy, poorly segued, and oft-times painfully edited by trying to drive home the point that America is fighting a contrived war (Moore's assertion). Moore has some skills as a director but unfortunately his political punditry is going to be his trademark and he has become the media darling. Primarily because he is tickling the ears of the left.Overall the film is not even worth seeing. Where does one go for a refund?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great documentary on a bad President</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call it propaganda if you wish; it's still good. Now that the 2004 election is over, it's history instead of politics. Fifty years from now it will be the primary image that people will have of the administration of 'Dubya', and it won't be a flattering picture.The true test of a documentary film is that one can learn something from it without falling asleep. This is a keeper. We see Dubya as a glory-seeking chickenhawk more intent on enriching his cronies than on seeking to act in accordance with reality. We see his war as his glory, and others' tragedy, whether of Iraqi civilians or Americans killed or wounded in action. We see Dubya's war as a rich man's war and a poor man's fight. We see that the military recruiters can find plenty of cannon fodder from the places like Flint, ravaged by industrial ruin (fitting allusion to "Roger &amp; Me"), but few from the still well-off suburbs. We see the depersonalization of the enemy as a tank crew takes delight in an obscenity-laced rap song "Die, m-----f-----" while firing at the enemy. We heard of little of this during the first Gulf War, waged honorably under the elder Bush.We see the clever methods of media manipulation of the '43' administration -- Bush and Cheney contradicting each other on the sort of responses that Americans should have toward terrorism. "Be brave", says Bush; "be scared", says Cheney. Confusion makes people scared to oppose those who supposedly know better than we do. I chose to not watch this film until after the 2004 elections. I had seen smears that it is all propaganda, full of lies, unpatriotic, and disrespectful of our brave soldiers. The real disrespect goes to those who least deserve respect -- the Bush administration.</fullReview>

Moore is so brilliant in his creation of propaganda, that his film may rival in strength the Frank Capra film series from WWII, WHY WE FIGHT, which has been credited as one of the reasons the Allies won the war. Moore in his hatred of Bush and corporate America may have in his exuberance done more harm to the USA than Bin Laden. I am not surprised that Hezbollah is distributing the film all over the Muslim world. Moore may cause Bush to lose the election, the US to lose the war in Iraq, the world to lose the war on terror, the Middle East to lose its pro-western governments, and the USA to lose its prestige around the world. It is a propaganda bombshell. It's a good thing he wasn't around in WWII. One might call his work a "labor of love." In this case, though, it's pure hatred. It is not hard to realize why 40% of children in Canada think America is evil. Remember what Pogo said during the Vietnam War? "We have met the enemy, and they are us." Different war, different meaning.PS: I'm still not voting for Bush. Free speech and The Howard Stern Show are equally important, and THAT'S a fact.</fullReview>

This is clearly a Propaganda film: prop?a?gan?da Information that is spread for the purpose of promoting some cause. (In this case, 'Ditch Bush')Moore has done nothing but dredged the sewers of crackpot mania to regurgitate conspiracy theorists views that have been flowing around the hate filled corridors of liberal talk shows and 'news' outlets. Sprinkle that with the pain of those who either have lost love ones on 9/11 or in Iraq, and you are looking at this film. He leaves out and glides over quickly, facts like Richard Clark okayed the Bin Laden flyout. In true hick fashion, he has condemned the entire Bin Laden family, as if you a Hatfield and they are the McCoys. Truly this film is looking at 9/11 and Iraq in a vacuum, what you aren't told is the vacuum is located between Moore's ears. Evidence that has clearly been proven is AWOL, replaced by Moore's interviews with Bush haters. Hate isn't a platform, and with supporters like MoveOn.org, who know NOTHING about moving on, he isn't out to show America and the rest of the world what actually happened, instead telling them what they wanted to hear. Riddle me this Batman, how much of this money is going out to the victims of the events of 9/11 and the children and spouses of soldiers who gave their lives so that HE could profit off them?! Ironic, isn't it, a filmmaker makes LOADS of money by making a film accusing others of trying to make money off the pains of others?I guess ironic isn't fitting, HYPOCRITE is?.For those wack jobs that say, 'you didn't EVEN see the film?'

		<fullReview>::Possible Spoilers:: (Is that possible for a "documentary"?)Most things I have seen for and against this movie tell why the movie is good or bad based on its political message. Therefore, I will explain why this movie is awful while trying not to discuss politics. First of all, do not go into this movie expecting a documentary, notice how a put documentary in quotations earlier. This movie is indeed little more than Michael Moore explaining why he hates George W. Bush for 2 hours which may or may not appeal to you based on your beliefs. However, this brings up my first point. This movie is two hours long, which is at least 30 minutes longer than it needed to be. The material in the movie is spread much too thin for this to be an interesting movie for 2 hours. By the end of the movie I found myself looking at my watch more than the movie to see when it would end. Unfortunately I did not know how long the movie lasted so I just looked at my watch. At the start of the movie Moore draws conclusions and presents facts that are at least interesting to watch and think about involving Bush and the Saudis. Also, the high point of the movie is Michael Moore riding in an ice cream truck reading the Patriot Act to congress. The movie could have been alright had it not lost focus after the whole Bush and the Saudis bit. After that the movie loses focus and is uninteresting. The last part of the movie is Michael Moore talking to this woman whose son died in Iraq. Except there really isn't much talking she just cries uncontrollably for half an hour and bemoans her terrible situation which she seems to think she is the only person to have only endured. Well guess what? At least 1000 other parents have suffered the same thing this war so shut the $&amp;^%*&amp;% up!!!!!!!!!!!!!Then after you think she is finally gone for good, she shows up in Washington and starts crying on Pennsylvania Ave. looking at the White House. This whole 30-45 minute ordeal is by far one of the most boring segments I have ever seen. Do yourself a favor and leave the movie after Moore quits talking about the Saudis. The Iraq war segment offers no substance at all.Rating: Only considering the first hour of the movie, it is thought provoking, interesting and should keep people that hate Moore intrigued. However, the second hour of the movie is terrible. No other way to put it.D+</fullReview>

It speaks to the big problem of the war and the class distinction of having the poor fight a war for the rich man's oil. But this important message is lost among lies about the 2000 election, mistruths about the timing of dealings with the Saudis, deceit about the desires of Iraqi citizens, US troops in Iraq and families at home. If Moore would stick to the facts he would make an ironclad 'documentary' about real problems, instead he makes a mad rant-filled piece that serves only to further divide the positions.</fullReview>

For example, before the title even comes up, he asserts that the claim by Bush's cousin at Fox News that Bush won the presidency caused the other networks to automatically change their calling of the election for Gore (why would that happen? it makes no sense...), and then asserts that this somehow cemented the election for Bush (how could that possibly happen?). It goes on down hill from there...Whereas some of Moore's films really poignantly detail the matter that he is working with, this flops because it is basically a film about blaming and accusing George Bush for everything and going beyond the boundaries of logic to do it. I am not a big fan of Bush, but Moore's claims just took me right out of the film. I am sure that if you hate George Bush like so many do you will love the film, but if you are independently minded (and surely if for some reason you actually like Bush) you will not appreciate the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a Bush-basher with the best of them, and I was looking forward to watching a movie about Bush's horrible decision-making and leadership. Lord knows Moore had enough material to work with. What I saw was a movie that did every thing it could to make Bush bad, including using misleading presentations and outright lies. I watched 15 minutes of this movie before taking it out. What I saw in the first 15 minutes was this: 1. It was said the Republicans lost control of the Senate early in Bush's term. This is not true. The party went from a 51-49 majority to a 50-49-1 majority, with the tiebreaking vote being the Republican Vice-President. 2. It said that Fox News stated on Election Night that Bush won Florida because he had a relative working at the station. What he fails to mention is that regardless of the relationship, Fox was right, or at least as much right as the other stations initially stating that Gore won. The race was too close to call at the time, and Fox was no more wrong than the other stations. 3. He said the reason Florida went with Bush is because of Katherine Harris is a Republican. He fails to mention she was overruled by the Democratic State Supreme Court, which was then overruled by the Federal Supreme Court, which, by all counts, can be considered split by party. Regardless, Katherine Harris is not where the buck stopped on this one. 4. He said the reason no protest of the election could be done in Congress is because no senator had the guts to sign a protest. The reason no senator signed a protest is because Bush had won every single recount the state of Florida did, and therefore, had no reason to sign a protest. Remember, Gore himself conceded the election. 5. He uses an innuendo to question the reason Bush blacked out another person's name from Bush's military record because of the person's questionable history. As all military records are confidential, and were only being released by Bush because he is a public figure, he had no right to release papers that showed the name of another person being reprimanded, and therefore, blacking out the name was required. These are the ones that I can remember of the top of my head in only the first 15 minutes of the movie. I should make a documentary on how to make a documentary. Moore needs to go watch "Hoop Dreams" to see how a documentary should be made. All that subject matter and he blows it. I wouldn't be surprised to hear that some people voted for Bush in 2004 BECAUSE of this movie.</fullReview>

I can't believe that people were actually talking about how brilliant this film was and how it could change the outcome of the 2004 election. It even won the top award at Cannes Film Festival. I find it incredibly hard to find a single statement in this film that isn't false or makes a valid point. Moore loosely links Bush to the Saudi Oil family through past business deals when Bush was in the oil business. He tries to act like the Saudi family is in control of the US government because Saudi Arabia owns shares of US stock. Even though Japan, France, England, and many other countries invest more in the Dow and Nasdaq. Moore seems to incinuate that the the Saudi's were responsible for the attack, even when Al Qaeda claimed responsibility. A lot of scenes in this movie are from stock footage that is meant for shock value. The end with the woman walking up to the steps of the White House is staged. If you listen you can actually hear a woman who walks by say "This is all staged" right before a conversion with a protester and the old woman who lost her son in Iraq. Moore's attempt to get ahead at the opposition to the war and Bush. Not even worth downloading a copy on the internet for free. A complete waste of 2 hours 1 out of 10</fullReview>

Instead he chose not to bother with trivial things, like the truth and facts and lazily opted to instead cater to those who are willing to believe without question whatever he shows them.Shameless exploitation of the tragic events of 9/11 and the families of the veterans he purposely misrepresented with his infamous creative splicing of clips to create from real people the characters and events he wants to portray. Real people, who have since been trying desperately to condemn this mockumentary and fight the giant (both in power and girth) who has used them to express a point of view they do not share.I actually enjoyed Bowling for Columbine, and Roger &amp; Me, even while disagreeing with the majority of what both films expressed. After this though I feel nothing but disgust and absolute disdain for Michael Moore, who has needlessly caused further suffering to people who have most certainly been through enough. I'm sure, if he had taken the time he could have found more family members of veterans who actually agreed with his point of view, but he instead chose to hack and splice his opinions and express them through those who do not, thereby victimizing them further.Luckily, I saw a news program with just a few of these people and after hearing what they had to say I didn't purchase a ticket, or rent this movie. I saw it on a free HBO preview event. If you must see it, I would suggest you see it for free like I did. No matter what your political positions are, there is just no justifying what he did to those people for the sake of making a few bucks to stuff into his already fat wallet. I for one won't be contributing to his fortune.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buffoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has again demonstrated he is a left wing, America hating, Bush hating, lying, distorting, buffoon. Given his ability to lie with a straight face and grossly distort anything/everything President Bush says or does, he would make Joseph Goebbels, one of history's greatest liars, blush. Moore probably should have stopped after his "documentary" on big business. At that time, he was at least somewhat funny. Now he demonstrates forcefully that, given his hate for anything American and allowing this attitude to form grossly distorted opinion, he is merely irrelevant. For anyone believing this buffoon, I would like to sell you some beach front property in Arizona. Moore's job is easy, requiring little or no talent. Take unflattering pictures of Bush and his cabinet or friends, then overlay this with lies and distortions passing off as legitimate commentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inaccurate Story Takes Away from My Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If part of enjoying a movie involves the story and the story is factually incorrect, it often takes away from my experience. This is the case with Fahrenheit 9/11. The story is so blatantly one-sided and unfair that I couldn't help wanting to give a giant rolleyes in every scene. How am I supposed to take a film seriously when its entire premise is dishonest?As you know, Fahrenheit 9/11 makes some very serious accusations against the United States government. True, it may be, that our government is faulted. But in this film's story, everything under our present government is faulted - nothing is clean!How ridiculous.Most of Moore's accusations range from the serious to the absurd. Take them with a grain of salt. (I would accept the charges Moore makes if there weren't other numerous, merited possibilities for each scenario). After each accusation is made, we see "the proof in the pudding." Moore strings together an unrelated sound bite, a jazzy sound track and a condescending narrative piece to prove to the audience he's right. To me, it's very transparent."Emotion is cheap" would be Michael Moore's mantra to film making. Many of his segments involve somebody who was hurt by our present government. He shows us their pain by filming them - they're crying and they look depressed. And why? Because George W. Bush is evil. This is the level of sophistication that Moore bases his movie. What a silly, silly man.Moore has disappointed me yet again. He has so much potential to put together a quality piece of film! He knows when to use the right music to support his statements, he understands the power of editing (but abuses it), and he knows how to make a controversial movie. For his next piece, I only suggest that he's fair, balanced and writes an honest story.Voted the lowest rating possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't see this movie - read some books instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just revised my vote for F9/11 from a 7 to a 5, after reading the book "Fraud - The Strategy Behind The Bush Lies...". My initial impression of the film was that it was a deeply flawed piece of journalism that used innuendo, insinuation and emotional appeals much too heavily, but it was still an important film and deserved credit for getting the issues into the public arena, given the failure of the mainstream US media to do so. I gave the film the benefit of the doubt for its failure to provide solid arguments and evidence because I figured it was probably hard to find evidence of deception by powerful people with huge resources available to cover them up.Reading FRAUD has revealed to me that it is *not* hard at all - there is a wealth of evidence that the author seems to have assembled mainly from searching media archives and databases. Rather than insinuation and conjecture, the book presents page after page of solid facts and figures that demonstrate the breadth and depth of the Bush administration's deceptions on practically every aspect of their goverment, all from accredited sources (often government sources or right wing sources themselves). I thought that F9/11 was a good start that didn't really aim wide or high enough in its targets, and FRAUD has confirmed this more than I could have imagined.I'm sure conservatives out there will dismiss the book as "liberal lies and propaganda", but much or most of the information there is quoted from sources that are clearly not "liberal institutions". The author also provides insightful analysis into the workings of republican organisations that manage to promote and maintain the deceptions of the Republican party, and convince ordinary Americans that they're the ones defending their rights and any information to the contrary is part of some absurd "liberal conspiracy".So, unlike many other reviewers here that will urge you not to see Fahrenheit 9/11 because it's all "lies and propaganda", I say go see it if you like but make sure you follow it up with further/deeper research, because the film barely scratches the surface.The more independent research I do (and I read both liberal and conservative sources), the more horrified I am by the state of American politics and society today.</fullReview>

Moore's rampant misrepresentations and editing of the information and the footage are worthy of the spinmeisters of the Third Reich, or of Stalinist Russia, not of any documentary tradition that I ever studied in school. One word describes this work - PROPAGANDA. What's worse is that Moore passes himself off as just a working stiff, a blue collar guy, while retaining legions of lawyers to protect himself from those who challenge his distortions, and all the while he's overseas telling European audiences what dunces his countrymen are. Michael Moore is a fat stupid white man, to paraphrase one of his titles, and anyone who bothers to do the research, instead of joining in with his hateful chorus, could find out for themselves just what frauds that he, and this awful movie, really are.</fullReview>

The FBI has files of questioning around 30 Saudis.- The firms Saudis invested 1.4 billion in "connected to Bush": 1.18 billion of the money was in a US Defence Department owned company that trained Saudi troops. At the time of the donation Bush did not even own the company; it was owned by the Carlyle group, on which Bush served on the advisory board.- A pipeline Moore says Bush planned and this caused him to favor the Taliban rulers was in fact planned during the Clinton years. Bush never met with Taliban rulers. (THEREFORE MOORE WAS BLATANTLY LYING HERE)Do not see this worthless propaganda crap. Moore is more misleading than he charges Bush of being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore Needs to Grow Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, against my better judgment I went to see the film and for about an hour and a half I witnessed a person obsessed with his absolute loathing for another person. My wife walked out after about 30 minutes and told me she would wait for me in the lobby, while she was there she tried to get her money back. There were two things that I would like to say about the film:1. Moore needs to grow up. Yes, this may be a nail in the coffin of the demise of the Bush presidency, but any point he could have made was made moot by his obvious, repeated and childish assaults. By about 45 minutes into the movie it actually got boring. The pattern of beating a point to death became silly. Thanks Mr. Moore. You have made your point clear ? you don't like George W. Bush, not only as a president, but also as a person; mostly as a person. Move on. (yawn) 2. The debates regarding who/what/when about the movie are moot. This movie is not about facts. Moore even said so on `The Daily Show' on 6/24/04. This is his `opinion', based upon the facts as he sees them about George W. Bush and he is going to present them as he `sees them' about someone he does not like. Several times my hand went up during the movie and ?BULLS*IT' was uttered. It's not in what was said, it was how it was said. This is Michael Moore vs. George W. Bush. Do not make the mistake in thinking that it is anything noble. Like `Bowling' he is not after change, Moore is after extracting his pint of blood and does not care how it happens.So, during the movie there were many who applauded and cheered Moore's statements on ? that is to be expected. At the end of the movie there was light applause ? expect also. What was not expected were many of the audience actually booed and said ?BULLS*IT' out loud. Moore is going to make a lot of money on this film. He may even take home a second Oscar (not because the movie is good ? esthetically it's pretty poor). He has demonstrated to me that he is a simple ambush artist that goes after wounded prey and after President Bush is voted out of office he will claim that it was because of THIS movie, not because Bush was simply not good enough for the task and it became obvious to the voters of the United States of America. The last thing that this movie has done for me is convince me that being a conservative is a whole lot better than being a liberal, especially if Moore is now the standard bearer for liberals in this country. Woe is to the clear minded and rational liberals of the USA - you are now going to be lumped in with this sad, pathetic excuse for a human. </fullReview>

Maybe if he would not pick and choose quotes and insert them in the story to make his point it would have been better. Nothing more than a lot of liberal propaganda but it is good for a laugh. It is fine that he does not like President Bush and Moore has every right to put what he wants into "his movie" but the number of people who actually believe it is all fact is down right frightening.

		<shortDescription>Dares to Expose a Corrupt Administration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the documentaries Michael Moore has produced this one is certainly one of the best?mainly because it exposes the truth about how the American people were manipulated after 9/11 and essentially misled into invading Iraq. For starters, I vividly recall how John Ashcroft used the color-coded terrorist advisories during certain strategic times to keep Americans in a state of fear. I recall how the Bush Administration kept telling us that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and to be fearful of a "mushroom cloud" in one of our major cities. I also recall how this same administration down-sized our military during the Iraq War and as a result kept sending the same troops back again and again into combat in an effort to avoid having to spend money on more soldiers. Not surprisingly, these savings were then diverted to the defense contractors who proceeded to make lots of money while our troops were exposed to all kinds of trauma and heartache on multiple occasions. I recall all of this and more. Yet rather than throwing these politicians out of office we reelected them?and that was perhaps the biggest shame of it all. In any case, although this documentary is clearly one-sided and takes a few cheap shots here and there, it still asks the questions for which no right-wing Republican has yet to answer or take responsibility for. Again, while this film certainly isn't perfect, it sheds some light on certain issues which I believe every American should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A controversy magnet done properly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 is the most controversial documentary ever made. Michael Moore's film, which is the highest grossing documentary ever, is an extremely one sided attack on the Bush administration, specifically on their handling of the War on Terror post-9/11 and the Iraq invasion. To be honest, while I classify F911 as a documentary, it does stretch the term considerably, more often than not resembling propaganda. In its attack on George Bush, this has as much subtlety as Nicolas Cage when he's in maniacal mode, and this is one highly manipulative movie. While taking Moore's choice of music, footage and narration, you can always feel his manipulations. Some of the facts in the film appear to be distorted and some people will absolutely hate this movie. However, I will put this out there: Michael Moore might be the best editor in cinema. His editing is borderline genius, and his use of interviews, footage, music and humour, while as stated before manipulative, is brilliantly clever and not only informative and thought provoking, but very entertaining too.The first hour of the 2 hour documentary keeps going up and down. For every inspired moment there's one where the editing and distortions are too obvious. The second hour is where this really hits its stride and becomes more neutral and spends less time forcing its message down the viewers' throats. F911 is, in the end, a very powerful film and even though its methods are questionable it always makes good points and provokes thought. In terms of humour, it's often very funny and although Moore putting all of his personality into the movie could be seen as adding to the one-sided nature of the movie, it still gives F911 a real sense of character and it makes for a very interesting viewing experience. This is definitely worth watching overall. It's flawed and I personally found it a bit grating at first, but it got going and by the end it had grown on me a lot. Even in its weaker scenes there's always a lot of thought and intelligence going into every sequence. This is a bit of a marmite movie, so it's worth seeing to see what your opinion of it is.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michale Moore's 9/11 is by turns, Entertaining, Incisive, Infuriating, Heart-Breaking and Slickly Populist!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 is a fiercely furious and unabashedly partisan challenge to the George W. Bush administration. In his incisive diatribe, Moore makes his points with an avalanche of facts, wisecracks, and often-snarky, sometimes-outraged commentary. But much more than a scathing indictment of Dubya-era complicity, Michael Moore's expos lays bare the devastating heartbreak now central to America's wartime reality.Before Moore gets to America's "war-on-terror", he establishes his argument for why Bush's Presidency is invalid to begin with. Moore revisits the election debacle of 2000 and then shows how Bush was essentially a lame duck President (who spent 42% of his first 8 months of office on vacation) until the fateful morning of September 11 when those planes slammed into the World Trade Center, forever changing everything. In one of the more talked-about sequences, President Bush sits in a Florida classroom and reads along with second-graders the book 'My Pet Goat' - fitting, since Bush here, is Michael Moore's pet goat, in the sense of the word meaning "a target of ridicule". Bush sits there vacuously as the students read aloud; a timer on the screen tells us that he sat there for seven minutes, his expression blank and his manner untroubled, after hearing that the second World Trade Center tower had been hit and that America was under attack. Nothing Moore can say is more quietly damning than this footage.Most of the movie is wickedly enjoyable ? we see President Bush talk about terrorism when he's on the golf course, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld explain the "humanity" of our surgical strikes and Congressmen duck when asked if their children will enlist to fight in the war they voted for. Much of the material about the administration and the war is already well-known to people who follow the news carefully. But assembled as a dossier of complex inter-relationships, conflicts of interest, ignorance, thuggishness, it's a devastating attack. The movie provides a persuasive commentary on the long-standing ties between the Bush family and the Saudi Bin Ladens and, more importantly, on the Bush Administration's extravagant hoodwinking of America which, ultimately, points us to the imbroglio in Iraq. The sentimentalism and the clownish muckraking (laying it on thick at times with banjo music) ? both trademark Michael Moore ? are certainly on display here, but Moore isn't so fast-and-loose with them this time. He creates a true and sober picture of the government-military nexus that feeds on America's poor as it willfully wages a war outrageously suspect in its motives. Moore powerfully draws attention to the toll that Bush's war has taken on Iraqi innocents, on American soldiers and the grieving families of those soldiers who died fighting for an unjust cause. While not a radical departure from his usual style, Fahrenheit 9/11 stands as a sign of cinematic maturity for Moore. He finally matches his rhetorical power with an aesthetic sensibility that is at times almost artful - moments in which he drives his point home visually in a way that stuns you into silence. Michael Moore is angry and he wants America to be angry with him. Regardless of where you stand in the political spectrum, you will be!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This notorious movie is red hot! Fahrenheit 9/11 is worth taking the heat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Known for his stridently left-wing political opinions, director Michael Moore doesn't beat around Bush; he takes on the right-wing, conservative George W. Bush! While, some viewers will be offended by Moore's anti-Bush message. For the most part, most American people love the documentary for its infamous views on post 9/11 government policies. This documentary became one of the highest-grossing documentary of all, because of that reason, alone. So Mission accomplished for Moore. Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say, this film had a great smart funny tone to it. I love, how he brought up, information that people might not know beforehand; like how the Bin Laden family escaping from America or how Saudi Arabia can overruled U.S policies, due to their oil relationship. Whether, if you believe in or not with Moore's standpoint, you have to agree with me, that the film also, created an emotionally powerful emotional atmosphere. This film is designed to provoke strong feelings, and I think for the most part; it worked. The movie does a great job, using war stock footage from both the Afghanistan &amp; Iraq War to show, how disenchant, some of the U.S soldiers, are. The sequence with the woman visiting the White House, after losing her child in the war is very heart-breaking. You can't help feeling sad, that her son, die over nothing. One of the biggest sequences in the film was when Michael Moore approached several Congressmen confronting them about signing a draft for their children to go fight the War. While, the sequence might seem powerful; it rarely makes any sense. First off, not every Congressman may have any adult children. Second off, those who are age, can't have, have their parents can't order them to enlist. Third off, the movie makes it seem, like members of Congress weren't willing to send their own children, into war. However, there are, some children of Congressmen that are serving the military, like Rep. Mark Kennedy, which was cut from the film. Very manipulative. Moore wasn't the only one. Moore show a montage of pitch-together old-news footages, really capture how fear-mongering works to control the masses. It's scary that, some people are willing to give up, some freedoms to have a little bit of security. In my opinion, the Iraq War was a blunder &amp; anybody that vote for the war should admit to their mistake. Anybody who still believes, Iraq is hiding WMD really needs to wake up. Some of them, are so damn blinded, that they still claimed that Fahrenheit 9/11 contains a lot of distortions and untruths facts. While, there are somethings that may be. I felt like the majority of the film, was presented as correct facts. After all, in response to the critics, Moore did published a list of facts and sources for Fahrenheit 9/11. While, Moore makes most of his points, very clear with an avalanche of facts. There were some commentary that was indeed wisecracks, cheap shots, and outright not-well define to be, taking serious. One of the biggest things that I hate about the film, is how the movie portrays Saddam Hussein's Iraq, prior to the country's 2003 invasion by the U.S military. The country is made out to look, like a peaceful, nearly non-violence place to live, instead of the cruel place that it is. It seems like Michael Moore forgot, how mess up, Iraq was, before 2003. While, there's strong language, and extremely upsetting imagery, of real-time violence. Most of the movie is wickedly enjoyable. After all, it's fun to make fun of George W. Bush. He truly was idiotic, at times. Still, somethings that Michael Moore's point out, were somewhat overblown. I cannot say, I'm a big fan of Bush, but I had no problem, in how Bush handle himself, during 9/11. While, I'm for Bush, here, I'm glad, I'm not as blind, as Bush's followers were. It's scary, how some of them voted for the Iraq War, without reading it. I think some of the big reasons why, most representatives stay away from the film was due to that fact. I really wish, the movie had more politicians' interviews. While, the lack of cooperation from the Republican Party &amp; the White House is very clear. I still don't know, why Moore couldn't find, any other upper-government bureaucrats to talk to. You would think, Democrats and Independents parties-member, would use this medium to voice their opinion about Bush. Undoubtedly, the movie was made in a last ditch intent to get George W. Bush to lose the United States presidential election in 2004. So, what happen!? Bush won, re-election, because ex-Vice President Al Gore or Senator John Kerry fail to stand up, here. It's seem like a very lost opportunity. They probably regret not doing so. Besides that, I just glad, this movie was even made as there were a lot of people trying to stop the film, from being made. One of those people was author Ray Bradbury, which the title of the film alludes to. His novel, Fahrenheit 451 was about a dystopian view of the future. So adding 9/11 to it seem like a good title, but Bradbury so upset by, what he considered the film be renamed. It wasn't until he saw the movie, that he change his mind. Even the film's movie production companies try to stop the film from being made. Disney's CEO at the time, Michael Eisner, a friend of George W. Bush called Miramax's chairman at the time, Harvey Weinstein, ordering him to drop the film. Miramax felt Disney had no right to drop the film, since the film's budget was well below the level that Miramax needed to seek Disney's approval, and it would not be rated NC-17. So Miramax sued Disney in court. They settled things out and the film was indeed shown. Maybe not, in Saudi Arabia, but it was indeed shown. Overall: It's a must-see movie, so check it out.</fullReview>

Moore tackles Bush's economic policies, his horrendous policies that affected the poor, and just about everything including how he east his cereal. Moore isn't playing hissy fit though. he takes an idea and opens it up to see how much damage the Republican Party did t this country and to Iraq. With a stylish and sarcastic feel to it, "Fahrenheit 9/11" handles how we as people deal with violence and how we respond to various situations and reminds us that non-fiction is what we need in a time where many people to be reminded and woken up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... and thus so is this review about a film focusing on what were seen as the effects of the second Iraq war. Let's face it. Chances are you either loved or hated this film before you even saw it. Personally, I liked it a great deal. I liked the fact that Michael Moore uses the politicians' own videotaped words to indict them, but I also disliked the insinuation in the film that American soldiers were jar-heads who enjoyed or were callous about the killing and suffering of ordinary Iraqis as a result of the war. His final thought in the film is an important one - after all the lies told about why we went to Iraq, why would anybody ever trust us again? This lack of trust was important in the context of the 2008 Presidential election cycle. It caused an unusually high level of participation of young people and saw voters of all ages largely rejecting potential nominees perceived as Washington insiders, and besides Sarah Palin, helped elect Barak Obama to the presidency. Much of this can be traced back to the level of cynicism Moore displays in this film.Also, and somewhat off-topic, I have to wonder how it is that Michael Moore was able to see the damage that such quotable quotes from conservative politicians could do, and yet then-presidential candidate John Kerry could not in 2004? If I had been running Mr. Kerry's campaign I would have been constantly rewinding and replaying the moment when President Bush is speaking at a fundraiser talking about "his base - also known as the haves and the have mores". What could have done more damage to the President's faux image as some average Joe who enjoys clearing brush on his ranch in Texas? At any rate, I think that although it is very dated at this point, it is still an important film and is worth viewing as a moment frozen in time. Just realize that this IS Michael Moore we are talking about and that he does like to go over the top quite a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore 9 / 11.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004): Dir: Michael Moore / Featuring: Michael Moore, George W. Bush: Michael Moore's fantastic followup to his previous hit Bowling for Columbine. This time he addresses issues that are kept from the public that resulted in one of the darkest days of the century. Moore targets U.S. President George W. Bush and various elements that surrounded the terrorist bombings of September 11th, 2001. According to the film Bush was warned prior to the incident but chose not to act. Moore interviews those who have lost family to the tragedy and even address those whose children were sent off to fight. One particularly amusing sequence involves Moore approaching members of the White House asking if they would send their children off to fight. Moore's film is powerful and sad but it is not without the trademark humour much of which makes Bush look like a jackass. One could just watch Moore make fun of Bush for ninety minutes and that may even suffice as a passable documentary. Moore is one of the best of documentary filmmakers whose physical presence has become familiar. Whether viewers agree with him or not, he certainly makes his point in his ploy against the media's desire to exploit this stuff. A must-see for anyone seeking understanding on what happened behind the scenes during that date that will long haunt our memory. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore At His Most Opinionated, Yet There's Plenty To Agree And Disagree On.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fahrenheit 9/11", possibly remains just as controversial now as it did back in 2004. Where I definitely consider this documentary to be the one where Michael's opinion really has a much larger presence than it needs to have, it's exceptionally well put together and really shows off some of the well known absurdities of George Bush's time as President.Whereas the first half focuses on Bush's campaign and actions, the remaining half focuses on the devastation of the Iraq War. The segments where people in and outside America "cheerlead" the War, as well as the prisoner abuse kind of unsettles and angers me. The fact that a majority of soldiers are made up from the poorer class systems seems like a no brainer, and I do like it when Moore tries to persuade Senator's to sign up their children. It's crude and absurd, yet sometimes there is no right and wrong when it comes to War.Final Verdict: The only thing left to mention is see it and make up your own interpretation. In many ways it's all a farce, but thanks to the freedom of speech we'll always have our own opinions. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polit-Docu Goes Ambient</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rewatching "Fahrenheit 9/11" after a few years I came away with the impression that it was 20 minutes of intriguing political documentary about the connections between the Bush and bin Laden-clans, followed up by 100 minutes of ambient, Kodak-coloured Chicken Soup For The Politico.So my tip to you would be to only watch the first twenty minutes of the documentary, or to watch the rest a few days later if you, for completism, must.The way this movie was apparently made was by sending camera teams to a mixed bag of assignments, and by then skillfully editing all the segments together. This makes for entertaining viewing, but also makes sure that none of the information can take hold in your brain. A roller-coaster ride of a documentary that is more suited to MTV rather than PBS.</fullReview>

I felt that this film consists of biased, moneymaking aspects to merely attract audience by showing false controversial facts. I am not an American, but I feel that when you have directors like this one in your country you don't even need any enemies. Judging by the ratings this movie has received I am amazed, once again, how good a "controversy" sells. Truthful or not? Doesn't really matter. It has become fashionable in the West to bash our governments,their views and political beliefs. Agreeing with the West is extremely unpopular. It would be boring. The sad part of it is that our adversaries are laughing at us.Well done Moore! Your project worked! You have made a step up in your ratings.. I suggest you do some research on each "fact" presented by Michael Moore in this film and you would be surprised. I would give this movie a "0" if I could. 1 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Typical Michael Moore Stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certain things are consistent when it comes to the work of Michael Moore, and Fahrenheit 9/11 fits the pattern. It's sometimes humorous (especially the use of what might be described as Bushisms), it's often sombre (I think of the mother who lost a son in Iraq), it's almost always thought-provoking (the army recruiters at the mall in Flint, Michigan and the Congressmen Moore tries to convince to sign their children up to go to Iraq.) Those are the positives. It's also - as Moore always is - so obviously biased as to have little credibility as a documentary. Moore doesn't like George Bush and he disagrees with the war in Iraq; neither does he make even a pretense of fairly representing the views of those who support the Iraq War, settling instead for out of context quotes and caricatures from them (and yes, indeed, Michael, there are two sides to every story - even Iraq.) I agree with Moore on both Bush and the Iraq War. Still, I have trouble accepting this as a serious documentary.The title misleads. What the word "Fahrenheit" refers to I'm not sure, and "9/11" gives the impression that this film is about 9/11. Actually that dreadful day gets little mention after the first few minutes in which Bush gets slammed for staying at his "photo-op" at the elementary school in Florida. That actually never bothered me. What would he have accomplished by rushing out in a panic, anyway - and the Secret Service was probably happy to have him in a secure location given the circumstances. Most of the film, though, is actually a rather devastating critique of the war in Iraq, with 9/11 simply the backdrop to the whole thing; the administration's dishonest excuse for invading that country. And it is effective - to a point. The problem is that by now most people have already made up their minds. Those who are against the war will love this; those who support it will hate it; those who against all the evidence still think Saddam Hussein planned 9/11 will think Moore is a traitor. I think he made a modestly interesting movie which certainly isn't unbiased or even-handed but which probably accomplishes what he wanted to accomplish with it. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, I was impressed, but I'm ashamed of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the movie (which didn't strike me as much as Bowling for Columbine, probably because of the huge public attention on Fahrenheit beforehand and because of the fact that I already had an opinion on that man in the white house), yes, I was impressed. I hadn't known all or forgotten details about the Florida disaster, I hadn't thought the Bush-Saudi relations were that close, and many other things. Of course, I thought, Moore has an aggressive way of bringing facts to the public, but hey, he has a good reason to do so. I went home and a couple of days later thought I'd check the net for what Moore opponents had to say. I found a page from Dave Kopel, which I strongly recommend to anyone having seen the movie. This page is not Bushy or Republican at all. He confirms Moore in several statements, such as the ones on the Patriot Act, but he lists 59 "deceits" in this movie. Yeah right, I thought, like I wouldn't know who the good guys are. It turns out I'm not so sure anymore. All of these "deceits" are backed by a lot of information, and are presented absolutely journalistic and objective. No such thing as Moore-bashing. And they make you think about how Moore does his job. Go for yourself, see the movie, and then read the page (search for 'Dave Kopel Fahrenheit' at google) and THEN think/research for yourself. Anyone who believes Moore opened her or his eyes should be ashamed, ashamed of not knowing all of the facts Moore presents beforehand, and ashamed of being misled by Moore in the same way the Bush administration misleads its people.My summary: Moore's cause is right and necessary, but his means are no better than those of Bush. If the American public really needs and welcomes this sort of "documentation", I'm even more afraid than Bush could ever frighten me. This might best pass as a satire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes credit away from itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've previously seen "Bowling for Columbine" and found it to be overall pleasing, so I entered the cinema for Fahrenheit 9/11 with my expectations set fairly high and I was disappointed.This documentary tries to make some valid points, but opposed to Bowling for Columbine, Moore decided to shove it down our throats this time and it's annoying. Moores approach to the subject and his way of interviewing and presenting those interviews takes away credit that he deserves.It's obvious that Moore is trying to make some statements and it's okay to make those, but it must be done in an appropriate way to preserve creditability and Moore blows it this time. I don't really disagree with Moores views and what he's trying to say with this movie, but I'd wish he'd do it with more dignity. I won't be making references to this movie in future discussions, simply because doing so would make me seem like a fool eating this one-sided documentary raw.Moore most obviously does not have enough faith in his statements or his audience when he chooses to present the story like he does. He calls it Fahrenheit 9/11. Well, I'd like to say Fahrenheit Michael Moore. Cool down Mike, don't let your creditability and integrity burn by exaggerating your otherwise valid and noble point.None the less, I'm looking forward to Sicko next year. :)By the way, I'm a European so I'm not going to vote for either the democrats or the republicans, I'm a socialist but if I had to choose, I would prefer Kerry and his democrats - after all, American administration does have an international effect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think "Fahrenheit 9/11" is going to change any votes, but it is entertaining. If anything, it makes me never want to vote again. When I saw the movie on the weekend it came out, the audience was composed of mostly white liberals who hated George W. Bush (aka Dubya). I'm somewhat in the political center, so I wasn't going to vote for Dubya anyway, but there was nothing in this movie that made me think Kerry would do a better job. What I got out of the movie is that the world is run by super-rich families like the Bush family, and they don't care about anything but the interests of their own class, and Dubya is low enough to use 9/11 as an excuse to grab Iraq's oil. Fair enough. But Kerry is super-rich too, would he really do anything to make my life better? This movie preaches to the choir, it's basically a propaganda movie for lefties who already can't stand Dubya. I did enjoy it, and it should be interesting to see if this movie ages well. I do take my hat off to Michael Moore for making this gutsy film, and there are some really funny parts. As topical entertainment, it's very good, but I don't think it will topple George W. Bush.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most important film I have watched in my entire life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never felt more angry about the western world and democracy as I do now that I have watched this movie/documentary. I was skeptical of the events following 9/11 before watching. Now I am dismayed that there have not been any independent enquiries against Messrs Bush and Blair's actions. Today, I am ashamed to be part of the western world for the first time in my life, and will now always be so!The BUSINESS connections between President Bush, the Saudi Royal family and MEMBERS OF OSSAMA BIN LADIN'S FAMILY must classify the events of post 9/11 as the greatest conspiracy in the history of the world.Part of me had always dismissed allegations that the war in Iraq was about oil and money. My conscience refused to allow me to believe that ANYONE could be capable of waging war without just cause. Surely they knew something more that the media had revealed about Iraq's capabilities or connections with terror. The appalling truth is that they didn't.I am now in no doubt that there were no weapons of mass destruction. There was no link between Iraq and Al Queda. We were lied to about the reasons for going to war, Sept 11 was used as an excuse to illegally invade not 1 but 2 foreign nations and it is on ALL our consciences that we allowed it to happen.Those most responsible (ie Bush and Blair) will never be brought to justice. The events of the last couple of years will most probably fade in to history under the heading of "probably best forgotten"I do not know how many lives were lost in the wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq on all sides, but I do know that all of their blood is on the hands of Bush and Blair. This was not a movie. This actually happened.The current political feed is "OK we made some intelligence mistakes but Saddam was a really bad man and were better off without him so it's all OK really" I am beginning to question if even this statement is bourne out with any facts.How could this happen. Part of the explanation is in mass media. Political manipulation of the worlds media has convinced billions of us that "they must know what they are doing" How could so many of us unquestioningly allow these events to take place. How could our politicians lie to us so convincingly and so shamelessly.I am not a religious man but I sincerely hope there is a Hell. If there is it has 2 reservations for Bush and Blair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, lets look at this as a movie, not as something that morons are debating because they dislike Moore's politics. I seriously doubt half the negative reviewers even saw the film, but lets see what we have here.First of all, its a joke that it won the golden palm as the best film at Cannes, unless of course "Kangaroo jack II" was the only film running against it. The movie is about 20 minutes too long, with certain sequences just playing themselves well beyond their usefulness. Also, so much of the film involves clips from shows like "Larry King" and others that you feel that you're watching something hastily edited.I felt it could have gone two ways - either as a super-serious indictment of the War in Iraq, or as a document of the Bush administrations actions regarding the events of 9/11. Its tough to be both and doesn't succeed there. When Moore is TOO populist, he comes across as preachy. However, when he pulls brilliant stunts like reading the patriot act over an ice cream truck PA system, trying to get members of Congress to get their own children to sign up for the draft and the like, while cleverly editing together soundbites of Bush sounding cavalier, self-righteous and absurd at the same time - well, thats when the film truly hits the mark. I wish he would have gone after the media for their complacency after 9/11 - there's plenty of good stuff on that - but he only scratched the surface on it.Overall, an important document and sign of the times. But not a perfect movie by any means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A call to political responsibility?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few reflections on seeing F9/11: (1) This film is devastating for Bush. The current response from the Bush camp is "to do the opposite of what Moore expects" (paraphrased from a news article); that is, remain silent. The material in this film demands some sort of substantive response. If no such response is forthcoming, I fear that not only will Bush be soundly defeated by the non-Bush voters in the next election (and that mode of voting is no better than blindly voting for Bush), but also there might also be some sort of political revolt in the meantime. (2) A similar investigation into the backgrounds of others in Washington (including many prominent Democrats) would show some of the same connections that Moore betrays in his film. So, the fact that Bush and his Republican friends are in bed with wealthy international businessmen is not news. We are all aware that Big Business runs Washington. I think it is deplorable, but Government sets the climate for Business. Thus, the two are inextricably intertwined and ever shall be. This is why "we the people" ought to be wary, regardless of who is in power. (3) The film moved me to distrust the entire political process and not just Bush. In fact, the film is as much of an attack on "we the people" as it is on Bush. This is a wake up call to everyone to take some political responsibility! The underlying tone of the whole film is that Iraq might not have happened if America was not completely asleep! This is a healthy perspective. (4) There is a possibility that this film will have the same impact as the media Moore critiques in the film. Moore presents (openly) his opinion, that is, his particular construal of events based on a portion of the facts in the case (there is so much he could never actually know due to the nature of the factual enterprise he is investigating). So, he asks for audiences to believe his construal of the facts over the media and other investigative journalists' construal of events using the powerful (read "easy to access") media of film. Does it really do any better to turn the unaware against the ruling powers by only providing them the other side of the story? There is no clarion call here from Moore for investigation of all sides in this film. In this sense, I think this film has the potential of perpetuating the stupidity and laziness that it so clearly attacks. (5) This film did reveal to me a side of the events of the past few years that I simply did not know. I had my suspicions, sure. But I simply didn't know or investigate things very deeply or carefully. I guess I'm as guilty as the next guy for simply letting the machine run. But I will say that because of what I've said above that this film needs a HUGE disclaimer placed on it stating (even though it is implied in the very genre) that this film is a work of opinion, or political commentary. Given the way film works with the modern public, the average viewer will take the things in this film (construed as they are) as "fact" and then follow through to the conclusions that the film offers. Because there is no such disclaimer on this film, a counter- wave is being generated (and we are already hearing it) over against the vision that has prevailed to date regarding Bush and the War. Now, I'm not saying that this is wrong. However, I'm critical of the spirit driving this counter-wave. What we are beginning to hear is NOT the political dialogue that Moore imagines in a true democracy, but simply the negation of the current political power structure. My sense is that if this film is effective in unseating George Bush and electing John Kerry, we'll simply find ourselves on the other side of the same coin in a few years. The only difference is that the cast of characters will have changed. There must be a third (or fourth, or fifth) political option presented around which real people might rally. Moore knows that these other positions are available in our republic, but he pulls this punch for the sake of his goal in this film...ousting Bush. And this is the ultimate tragedy of this film: its very, very narrow agenda and its very short-sighted goals. In conclusion, we do see and hear some significant things in this thoughtful commentary on Bush by Michael Moore. This is a film (and not a documentary) that an informed public should take with some seriousness and investigate it further. However, its narrowly focused agenda keeps the film from reaching the greater purpose of calling the viewing public to embrace its true political responsibility, which is more far-ranging than simply voting Bush out of the Oval Office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What This Film Is, and Isn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings. I thought I'd like to add some helpful comments about this film.First of all, it is not a documentary, at least as far as I understand the term. It is not "Titticut Follies" or "Point of Order" or "Startup.Com". It resembles more of an extended Editorial, wherein Mr. Moore vents his spleen, and offers his commentary on certain political and social events in the United States over the past four years. This is nothing you wouldn't see or hear on FOX News or CNN. What makes its approach unusual is its unflinching Democratic/liberal point of view. It's been a long time since we have heard something as outspoken and unrepentant as a Liberal point of view in the U.S., almost as if it was considered treasonous to criticize the current Administration for its policies. That kind of silence is poisonous to a Democracy. No politician is sacred, none; and whatever your opinions about Moore, kudos for him for initiating such a debate. The other aspect of this film is Moore's feistiness. He WANTS to provoke your opinion, pick a fight, and hopefully start a National Debate. Whether you agree with Moore's approach or beliefs, he has performed a valuable service to the Nation by doing so. It must also be kept in mind that this is still a Hollywood film, and Moore has become quite skilled in promoting and advertising his product.As for the film itself, it presents its events in chronological order, starting with the 2000 Presidential Election results and leading up to the current debacle in Iraq. Most of the information presented in the film is not news: nearly all of this material has been previously made available through various media, through books, television, magazine and newspapers.Most people, however, may have forgotten or ignored many of these events over the past four years, and part of the shock is seeing all this woven together and presented all at once. Still moving and heartbreaking are footage from the 9/11 World Trade Center; especially for me, the brief footage of the woman holding up a picture of her missing husband, asking to the camera for anyone to contact her of his whereabouts, while struggling not to break into tears. Equally moving are the footage of returning Veterans from the Iraqi War, seeing them crippled, and hearing their thoughts and opinions. We must not forget our veterans.And that's another highlight of this film. Moore does not merely take pot-shots at the President or his cabinet or his 'inner circle'. He also takes his camera to the besieged cities in Iraq, showing the human cost of misery there and then going to interview our soldiers and asking them what they think about it. Not since the Vietnam War has the public seen the brutal face of War put before them so bluntly and candidly. Moore's stated intention for releasing this film was to influence the course of public opinion and to affect the outcome at the polls this November 2004. We shall have to wait and see what effect, if any, this film has on the elections a little over three months from now. Whatever its outcome, this film remains a valuable time capsule of these extraordinary events and the toll it has taken on ordinary American citizens.</fullReview>

And the term "instigative" applies to someone or something that incites people to action or even rebellion.I therefore christen "Fahrenheit 9/11" an example of "instigative journalism", since Moore clearly aims to get the viewing public riled up enough to vote Bush's ass out of office.And I'm signing this to lay claim to the newly coined term "instigative journalism".Paul Leroux Ottawa, Canada(using his partner's e-mail address)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Bowling For Columbine lots of questions, few answers, but another powerful documentary from Moore whether you like him or not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the doc that Disney tried to suppress for a year is out in the UK. Number one, I've never seen a virtually sold-out preview before, on the Sunday with two major tennis and soccer finals which would have otherwise captivated the British and kept them inside. Mr Moore has to thank Disney for wetting themselves and essentially trying to ban this documentary for a year- advertising he couldn't have bought.On the subject, Moore's been here before. He knows the power of cinema. That's why it's no great spoiler to say that the use of sound and no vision at the proper start of the film grips you and besides nobody needs to see 9/11 again, we can all remember it and parts of it were in the last doc. In fact how many spoilers can you write about very recent history instead of a conventional narrative fictional film? Basically it's Moore's take on the last four years, with some historical research thrown in. Perhaps because it's ongoing history and not a single event which happened then stopped like Columbine, there's less gallows humour and in fact, the film's less funny than Bowling For Columbine most of the time, except when it's laughter borne out of disbelief.I don't know who said that Moore didn't separate himself out enough from "Fahrenheit" and so made the subject matter less important; he pulls a couple of his trademark stunts but the film doesn't lose any power, in fact they provide some of the scant humour in the film. The only figure who remains distant, with whom there is no Charlton Heston-style showdown, is Dubya Bush himself even though a lot of the documentary's about him. Other players are quite happy to talk except the Congressmen or Moore uses media footage, for example, of bombed Iraqis. One stunt is quite funny, but the other one is a little pat- since politicians have hardly ever wanted to put their kids in the army anywhere in the world for the past century or two, underlining the fact in the film's a little facile and obvious. That's really the only flaw I could throw at the film if I were being picky.I guess being a journalist makes it easy for me to discount Moore from the story and listen to what he has to say, and that's why I also didn't mind questions being asked without answers being handed to you on a plate...for the next 50 years until they're declassified. As the Weinstein brothers are in charge of distribution, here's hoping the flick is re-issued around Oscar Eligibility time, as it might just do the double for Moore or at least, get nominated. And thanks to Disney (indirectly) many more people are going to see this than otherwise would have. So go watch it. As far as pacing goes, it does drag towards the end but that's only because the pain of the participants is very real and very uncomfortable, especially the parents, the Iraqis and the soldiers.Excellent and necessary film-making, again. Like I said, why Disney chose to "anti-hype" the film instead of just showing it and making the money the Weinsteins will now get (they need it, certainly), is just another unanswered question.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Disturbing Truth About Fahrenheit 9/11</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Disturbing Truth About Fahrenheit 9/11Fahrenheit 9/11 has been greeted with controversy ever since the media was aware of its production. With most cases being marred by political ideals, it is only proper that I personalize this review, instead of generalizing due to the reality of the film's party-line politics. There is no doubt that Michael Moore's film is biased against George W. Bush; however, the information is irrefutable and cannot be ignored. Personally, I'm an Independent, and am praying for voters to oust Bush out of office, however, personal agendas aside, Fahrenheit's factual argument in irrefutable. .Instead of using his usual rant-filled voice over, Moore's commentary reserved but effective, he lets the facts speak for themselves, and they echo loudly. This film does not argue party lines like people think. It is not about Liberals vs. Conservatives, Republicans vs. Democrats, or Bush vs. Kerry. This film is about Bush vs. himself, and how his actions before the election to date have affected us all. When it boils down to it, the issue becomes about ethics and morality. The facts spell it all out, and it is scary.The word 'disturbing' is occasionally used to label certain feelings that may be attached to media. Films like The Exorcist, Schindler's List, and Freddy Got Fingered. When it comes to content, these films are not remotely related to each other except in the connotation that each strikes a delicate chord with society. The Exorcist was extremely frightening, Schindler's List was very graphic in its depiction of the holocaust, and Freddy Got Fingered was downright vile and disgusting. In the case of Fahrenheit 9/11 that feeling hit me. I went into the theater expect a savvy expose trashing Bush and his ability to handle the presidency, however I left experiencing something completely different. I was simply disgusted by things that Bush and his administration did over the last 4+ years. It was disturbing. Just in case you forgot, I am an Independent. Let say, I was a party-line Republican whose vote for Bush contributed to his re-election and then proceeded to watch the film when it came out on video a month later, I would be so embarrassed that I would feel too incompetent to ever fill out a ballot again in my life.Eighty-five years ago, the Chicago White Sox were the hottest team in baseball. They were a lock to win the World Series, but gamblers paid eight players $10,000 each to lose the championship on purpose. One of those players was 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson. He was given money, with no understanding of what was going on. 'Shoeless' Joe's statistics were phenomenal during the series, however when a jury investigated the scandal he was implicated and in turn banned from the sport. Why did this happen? He signed a contract that implicated him. No one understood how this could happen, until someone saw the contact, it was marked with an X. 'Shoeless' Joe was illiterate. He signed his career away. The newspapers donned the headline of the little boy who ran up to his idle and cried, 'Say it ain't so Joe, say it ain't so.'Well when it comes to Fahrenheit 9/11 it is so, and there is nothing we can do about it unless you go to the polls and voice your opinion. Whether you like Michael Moore or not, political ideals have no bearing in the simple fact that whatever your stance, if you are even thinking of casting a ballot the November, you must see this movie. Otherwise, you might be the next one crying, 'Say it ain't so.'**********/**********</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Juxtaposition of 2 Kinds of Destruction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not expect to start to cry while watching a blank dark screen and hearing the aftermath of the first crash into the world trade center, and then hearing the second plane hit. And I had forgotten that Bush's inaugural motorcade was met with such fury. To learn that George H.W. Bush is in a position to share information from his daily CIA briefing with his employer the Carlyle Group, and tolerate the appearance of impropriety--that he could use that briefing for financial gain--sickened me. It was good to be reminded of these things. I am a close reader of the news so not much was new to me here. But to see Michael Moore reveal the Bush administration destroying what we most value in our country--the liberties that have made us uniquely and responsibly American--and juxtapose that destruction with the terrorist destruction of the world trade center on 9/11 was powerful and rang true for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore as "Genuine American Working Class Hero" comes out punching!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Michael Moore's latest film, Fahrenheit 9/11, to be surprising, moving and funny; overall very well done. There was a little too much 'name-calling' type humor for my taste, and I found my thinking less provoked than his prior film, 'Bowling for Columbine.' I also thought it exploitative to use a distraught Lila Lipscomb crying for her son killed in Iraq, but such dramas are what makes for engaging and eye-opening cinema. Criticisms of his film aside, I'd like to put things into perspective. Michael Moore has made himself into a genuine American working class hero, without help from rich relatives, or a willing corporate elite. Tough, very tough to do these days. He is caught in a no-win media gambit: he wants to reach a wide audience with shocking revelations of widespread corruption, deceit and lies, yet he knows to reach more folks, he needs to be more entertaining to bring folks into the theater. Judging from the incredible success of his last two films and every book he writes, I'd have to say he has a winning formula. His films, I believe, are all about teaching us-by example-that average folks can make a difference in the world. Just get your nerve up and do something. You don't have to be an expert. And this last piece of 'advice' I've gotten by his example we would be wise to take to heart: It's our country, our democracy to give away or take back! The choice is up to each one of us.It appears too many of us are too quick to judge his pandering, impolite, confrontational style. If you think about it, a polite and subdued populace is very much in the interests of the status quo. That's not to say we should all go out into the streets and start burning cars and trash cans like the anarchists at the Seattle WTO protests of '99. But there is a definite role for a personality like Michael Moore. He represents, in my mind, a courageous tiger speaking out for those without voice and defending their interests. Dangerous by any measure from the perspective of the right wing and their apologists!What I also appreciate so much about Mr. Moore is that he knows what it takes to BOTH entertain and challenge. And by challenge I mean both the public's minds and the status quo. And here is where the courage comes in. He's not afraid to be wrong. That's anathema to the middle-class instinct (I include myself) towards waiting until we have all the facts and waiting until the appropriate number of experts have given us permission to act. Democracy lives and breathes by our enthusiastic involvement and cannot wait for marginal voter turnout every four years. I will also say that outrage has so few outlets in our society and especially our tightly-controlled media. As the bumper sticker says, 'If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention.' Michael Moore is paying attention and he deserves our thanks for the role he plays in kicking some ass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not only a moving documentary but also a great and important film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" is arguably the most important film of our generation. Nobody that experiences the movie can deny that it is well crafted whether you agree with what he is saying or you do not. I am an admirer of most of the things that Mr. Moore attempts to tell us, the people of the United States, to prod us to become active in the democratic process. I believe 100% of what this documentary tells us about Bush I and Bush II waging war for control of Iraq's oil reserves and enabling their rich friends (as Bush is quoted in the movie addressing his supporters at a white tie fundraising dinner: "This is an impressive crowd -- the haves ... and the have-mores. Some people call you the elite; I call you my base.") to get richer by awarding fat government defense contracts to their businesses.The movie should win the Academy Award for Best Picture because it is a great movie whether you believe it is fact or fiction. Hopefully, when it does win the statuette in March 2005 the movie will have been a part of kicking Bush's regime out of the White House. The final point Moore makes in the movie that Bush attempts to use but cannot verbalize: "Fool me once shame on you." (2000 election) "Fool me twice shame on me." (2004 election)"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The issues brought up in this film are important enough that they should be given a good hard look. Whatever conclusion you ultimately come to, if there is even the most remote chance that any of this is true, then we would be fools not to. Critics claim that what is suggested in this film is lies. That possibility exists. However, there is more evidence to support the state of affairs in this film than was ever presented in defense of our going to war in Iraq. So why did we go to war over there? Perhaps it is that this film finally offers some real answers. That would do it for me, however I need to complete 10 lines so I'll fulfill that obligation like this.</fullReview>

This film didn't tell me much that was new, but it put it all the anti-Bush stories and perspectives together into one visual record and inspired me to make my first donation to a political party, with the goal to pull bush out of the Whitehouse by his roots. Even if only half of what Moore postures to be true is indeed true, we've been misled and manipulated, at a huge cost in dollars and lives, and we have been led into a war that could make us more vulnerable to terrorism than ever before. I hope we are successful in making a democracy over there, but as a show of how a democratic society is supposed to work, lets do a regime change over here!

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore Brilliantly Exposed Corrupted President Bush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** LOTS OF SPOILERS***For all the people who are calling Michael Moore's movie a bunch of lies and deceitful banter, you really need to go back and see the movie again. Mr. Moore mostly lets the footage speak for itself. Watching President Bush be informed about the Twin Towers being struck by a second plane and then watching him steer blankly at a children's book should be a serious WAKE UP call to all the fools who voted for this man. President Bush was never truly fit to run our country and the overly rich people and corrupted government who pushed him into the White House are now looking like idiots. Bush looks totally LOSSED sitting in the classroom and without his advisors he doesn't know what to do. I sat in the theater and just shook my head. It was like he already knew something like this was going to happen sooner or later. He doesn't even looked shocked, but more puzzled.Michael Moore shows what happens when republican government cheat the people of the U.S. to elect an incapable President. It was quite obvious that President Gore (yes, he should be President right now) was shafted after 1000's of minority votes were eliminated from the tally. Bush has his brother and friends to thanks for that. Even when the minority people (mostly Black American) tried to instate a recount there wasn't one Senator who would signed the proposal. More corrupt B.S. One of the things I didn't realize was that President Bush's inaugural event was a bust after people started egging his limo and riots broke out. For some reason, I don't remember seeing this on T.V. Where was the press? After watching this movie, there are so many unanswered questions that need to be answered by President Bush and his staff of stooges. Like why was the Bin Laden family allowed to leave the U.S. without being questioned by the FBI and CIA? Any U.S. citizen that committed a crime of this magnitude would have had their entire family arrested. Why was the search for Bin Laden suddenly halted and then turned to Saddam Heussan who wasn't involved at all in the 9/11 attacks? Did the Bush's investments in defensive corporations have anything to do with Bid Laden, his family and the focus being turned to Saddam? Of course it did.I laugh at people who put down President Clinton for lying about having sexual relations with Monica. Lewinski? What did Clinton's lie have to do with how he ran the government? Absolutely NOTHING. It made his integrity look bad, yes, but he still was doing a much better job at running the country then both Bush men put together. He actually lowered the country's trillion dollar deficit and that's a fact. The unemployment was at it's lowest in years when Clinton was in office. Clinton's lie compared to Bushes lies are like night and day. Why? Because Bush's lies actually effect people's lives. There were NEVER any Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq. Bush sent our men and women their to fight a war that was never needed (except to make the Bush's and Saudi Arabians more wealthy). These are facts people. Michael Moore proves this and no one is disputing the claims. If MM was smart he'd go into hiding for a year, as he's probably a wanted man by every government assassin out there. President Bush should retire and go back to doing what he does best. Playing golf!!Moore's film is brilliant and very well filmed. I thought it might be boring when I first started watching it, but I was totally engrossed through the whole film. It amazed me how the Marine recruiters steered clear of the rich people in Michigan and instead heading for the poor minority urban areas to recruit men and women for the Marines. Why is this? Rich people are too good to fight the war for their country? B.S.!! I laughed when Mr. Moore went to Washington D.C. to ask the Senators if they would enlist there kids into the service. They looked at him like he was nuts. Every Senator out there (except one) believes their kids are too precious to be enlisted. Well, the poor minority folks believe the same thing. What happens is because they are so poor and without jobs, that they have almost little choice but to enlist just so they can make a living and work. I personally will NEVER send my kids to any government defense service. I don't believe in WAR and I definitely don't believe in meaningless war like the one we waged in Iraq. Even the soldiers who are there don't know why they are still there. More and more of them are dying right now for NO GOOD REASON. The person to blame is none other then President Bush and his staff. Anyway, definitely see Fahrenheit 9/11. It will change the way you view the government. People keep saying this in M. Moore's opinion, but as you can see the people of the U.S. are doing most of the talking in the film. So you are calling all these people liars are well. Sorry if the FACTS hurt, but it's about time someone told the truth and exposed the government and all it's corruption. I pray that one day the government is no more. It may have been a good idea back when George Washington was around, but it's totally corrupt now. U.S. may be land of the free, but it's the home of corrupted overpowered old men. They need to remember that they can't take the power &amp; money with them when they die.I give Fehrenheit 9/11 a rating of 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I submitted a review of this film after seeing it on opening night. For some reason IMDB chose not to post it. I'm sorta glad. It gave me a chance to read a bunch of other reviews on this site.I notice that, even though over 90 percent of the reviews I read were positive, the film only gets around an eight. A number of people rated the film a minimal score of one. I wonder if they saw this film before rating it. I doubt it.All the negative takes on the film seem to have a couple of things in common: either they indulge in ad hominem attacks on Moore ("This is a terrible film. And Michael Moore is fat") or they say that the film is full of lies without providing any examples.Documentary films, more than any other form, are made about subjects that the filmmaker feels strongly about. And Moore is obviously upset about the "pass" that the media has given to Bush and his Administration.There was very little in this film that was new to me. But I've had to go looking for it. The So-called Liberal Media, if it reports on it at all, buries it deep in the paper. Most of what I know is from newspapers in other countries, like England, Canada and Australia.The truth, like water, always finds an outlet. If the newspapers and broadcast media (the latter in the hands of just 6 corporations now) had been doing their job, there would be no need for the avalanche of books that have come out in the last year or two. And there would have been no need for a film like "Fahrenheit 9/11".I hope that every voter (especially those who didn't cast a ballot in the 2000 race) sees this film with an open mind. If he/she disagrees with Moore's position, that's fine. But don't do so on the basis of the knee-jerk reaction of the right that says that if you disagree with what the President is doing, then you must be anti-American, a terrorist sympathizer or someone who "doesn't support Our Troops".Freedom of Speech is one of our most treasured rights as Americans. Without it, and the free and open debate that flows from it, democracy itself is at risk.See this movie with a friend. Argue and debate what it says. But don't condemn it out of hand because it contradicts your world view. That's un-American.A must-see. Ten stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore does two excellent things in this movie. He shreds George W. Bush &amp; Co. in joyously vicious lampoonery. I'd have laughed if I wasn't already crying. Well... I guess I laughed anyway.And, he lays out the case against Bush, the Bush family, their friends and supporters in exquisite detail. He does a job that would do any skilled government prosecutor proud. Better than the 9/11 Commission, the Warren Commission and the Watergate Commission rolled into one. Never mind swaying an election, he lays out a pretty good case for impeachment and hanging. Seriously.Unfortunately (for me, anyway) he does one more powerful thing which I didn't exactly "enjoy". Moore provides a powerful emotional catharsis for the loss and pain of 9/11 and Iraq. I sobbed. Who knows, maybe it did me good to get it out of my system and I should send him a check for the therapy session. I'm still a bit teary the next day. Luckily though, the scenes that set me off were actually quite short and not everyone had my reaction. Most of the packed house (at 5:50pm on a Sunday!) seemed to have had a clearly enjoyable time. Oh, people? Leave your small children home. This movie is totally inappropriate for them. At the very least they'll be loudly fussy and cranky and disturbing to the other patrons during the quiet and emotional scenes. At the worst, they'll have nightmares for years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a man people love to hate. I, myself, am on the fence. I didn't particularly enjoy "Bowling for Columbine" and I've not seen his earlier work, but "Fahrenheit 9/11" is an astounding film. Factually sound and relentless in its assault on the Bush White House, "Fahrenheit" takes us from a real art-house opening with the audio-only attacks on the World Trade Center to the run-down neighborhoods of Flint, Michigan, to the front lines of Iraq.Particularly notable during the Iraq segments is the Fallujah debacle, complete with charred corpses being dragged through the streets and beaten with steel rods. Whether or not you think an R rating is appropriate, the film certainly earns it with these grotesque and horrifying scenes.More important than the Bush-Bashing, I think, is the expose of the Military-Industrial Complex (which Bush and Cheney happen to be part of). Moore expertly connects the dots between the Bushes and oil-rich arabs. What we're left with is the government and cowed mass media badgering a populace to start a war which is in no way involved with the attacks of September 11th... a war not about WMD or al-Qaeda, but a war about the second largest known oil reserve in the world.The only thing I would have to liked to see in Moore's "Fahrenheit" is republican Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell address, warning Americans about the dangers of the Military-Industrial Complex... which is in full swing here.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An informative, sometimes funny, but most importantly a movie for the entire American audience to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore started to intrigue my interest in Documentaries. Before his film, `Bowling for Columbine' was released in 2002, I probably had very little interest in that area of film. However after viewing `Bowling for Columbine' I became very interested in the documentary area of Film. I personally really admire Michael Moore for his work and his ability to talk about serious issues in his documentaries. I would like to say that I was really looking forward to Fahrenheit 9/11 even before all the controversy started up about the film. But let me say something else about this film and that is it's not the same type of documentary like Bowling For Columbine, The Big One, or Roger and Me is. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a different type of documentary all together and Michael Moore himself is barely in the film but plays the part as the narrator. Fahrenheit 9/11 is easily Michael Moore's best work to date and this is probably because the movie talks about issues that are still going on now in the world and because Moore himself does not try to persuade you to believe in what he is saying but actually shows `facts' from newspaper articles, news programs, interviews, and actual documents. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a film that talks about 9/11, how George W. Bush and company had ties to the Saudi Families, how George W. Bush quickly forgot about Bin Laden and just placed the blame on Saddam Hussein, and finally talks about why the hell we are still at war.Love Michael Moore, Hate Michael Moore, Fahrenheit 9/11 is not Moore's typical film. Even if you typically don't agree with Moore, I feel this movie is important for everyone in America to see. As I said earlier you barely see Moore during the movie. I think he actually shows up 3 times for a very short period of time. This movie is more about stating facts than opinions. The movie makes a lot of sense for those who don't believe we are living in the picture perfect world. It talks about how our government lies to us and how we have an idiotic `War' president running this country. George W. Bush always came off like an airhead to me but after seeing this film that is officially confirmed. Moore even interviews troops that are fighting in the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. It's seems most don't even understand why they are at war and why they are still over there. Michael Moore even interviewed one troop who came back from the war and stated that he rather be thrown in jail then go back to war because he just couldn't figure out what the hell he was fighting for. A lot of pretty shocking and depressing stuff is being talked about in this film.Fahrenheit 9/11 is not like `Bowling For Columbine' in the sense that it's not nearly as amusing. Sure, some of this movie is funny but the majority of this is serious. I personally was on the verge of tears during some of the film because it was depressing and sad. However, I know life isn't always great and people have a lot of hard times and bad things happen to good people. This movie makes you think about the issues that are going on today like how over 800 died in the war so far, the rise and the decline of the economy, the losses of jobs, and many other things.This is without a doubt the best movie you will see all year and that is because it's an important movie to see. You will learn very important information from this movie about George W. Bush and the current state of the United States. Sure some of this will shock you and some of it will make you depressed but I think ultimately it will be a movie that helps the American Citizens make a difference. Even if you Hate Michael Moore, I believe this film deserves a chance because of the actual footage that is being displayed. It's an important film for everyone to see who is planning on voting in the next election. Go by yourself, Go with Friends, but ultimately see this movie because it's important and should be seen by all Americans.If Michael Moore ever runs for President he has my vote. I think Fahrenheit 9/11 is the best documentary that he has ever put out so far. I am a big supporter of this man and each of his documentaries is more important than the next. This movie as many already know has taken the box office by storm with over 21 million dollars and the movie is only showing in 868 movie theaters. I had to purchase my tickets for this film two days in advance and stand on a 30-minute line to see the film but was it worth it? Absolutely. I like movies that challenge me to think, make me feel real emotions, and make me want to do something about the current state of the United States. I will continue to support this movie by seeing it a few more times and tell most of the people I work with or talk with, to see this movie. I think it's shocking, depressing, and funny but most importantly a serious film that talks about serious issues. My rating for Fahrenheit 9/11 is a big 10/10.</fullReview>

Even though I am a Bush supporter (lesser of two evils in 2004) I found some of his shady dealings interesting. As for him being a little slow, I already knew that. There were some things I disliked though. One, you don't need to edit out of context tape to make Bush look stupid, although it was hilarious. Second, his portrayal of Iraqis was not accurate. While people in the 2 or 3 major cities of Iraq live decently, most of the people live in the desert and are starving. As someone who was in Iraq when we first went in, I can tell you the majority of Iraqis were happy to see us. As we drove through poor villages we were cheered as liberators. Also factually distorted was that AL Gore should have won Florida, also not true. Both independent and liberal recounts showed Bush won. The main thing I did not like though was the communist undertones. Of course mostly poor people join the military, that's why I joined, but this a Capitalist society, and that's the way it works. It isn't the government's job to take money from rich people and give it to poor ones. This is America and anyone can be rich if they work for it. Anyway, other than the socialist undertones and a few distorted facts I really enjoyed myself, and found myself clapping along with everyone else at the end. Despite being everything he hates, a rich fat white guy, Moore is a good filmmaker, and I look forward to his next film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, but Simplistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Moore's film today because I am firm believer in the principle that one ought to give something a fair hearing before praising or criticizing it. Furthermore, as a student of politics, I think this is an extraordinarily important film insofar as it may have a tremendous impact on the American political landscape.STYLE: Independent of the film's content, which I will discuss below, this is outstanding work. Moore is a master of manipulation - he is able to weave images, words, and music in a way that is truly remarkable. After viewing his films, I usually find myself admiring his skill as a filmmaker.That being said, I am firmly in the camp of those who believe Moore's films are not, properly speaking, documentaries. Obviously, this contention depends on how we define the term, but suffice it to say that there is a big difference between Errol Morris and Michael Moore. Although both deal with "non-fiction" subjects, Moore's projects seem much more willful and agenda-driven. Without meaning to use the term derisively, Moore's films are more accurately described as propaganda. He does not "allow facts to speak for themselves," as he is so fond of saying. Rather, he manipulates facts by shading, twisting, and simplifying them. As such, it is fair to say that what Moore does is much closer to Leni Riefenshtal than it is Errol Morris, who allows his subject to exist relatively independent of his will. (My comparison to Riefenshtal is NOT intended to be substantive, but rather stylistic).SUBSTANCE: In terms of the content of the film, only so much can be said here. (I recommend Christopher Hitchens' treatment of the film's content on Slate.com). At the point where style and substance meet, the most disturbing thing about Moore is his tendency toward simplification. If only the moral and political world was as simple as Moore describes it! Perhaps the most unsettling aspect of Moore's film is not any of the many logical leaps he makes dissecting the inner workings of the Bush administration. Rather, it is his complete lack of humanitarian concern for what is going on around the world. If Fahrenheit 9/11 is to be believed, Iraq was one of the happiest places on Earth before the war began. Apparently, it was a country of beautiful children laughing on playgrounds and playing with kites. Like his dismissive attitude toward the genocide in Kosovo in Bowling for Columbine, Moore seems completely insensitive to the plight of the victims of totalitarian thugs. In recent interviews, Moore has said that liberation must come from within a country (See Cannes Press Conference). Once again, if only it were so simple. It is easy to say that while you sit at your computer in Manhattan. It is a bit harder for the men, women and children that are being brutalized in these various countries. War is indeed an awful thing. Moore should be applauded for bringing that point home with such vigor. With that being said, however, I think all of us would do well to reflect upon the tensions between pacifism and humanitarianism. Oh how we all wish that we could have it both ways. Unfortunately, we live in a complicated world. It is all the more unfortunate that BOTH Mr. Moore and Mr. Bush fail to realize that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In my opinion, Michael Moore's best work to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a 9/11 family member,I was invited to a small private screening of this movie before it's "official" opening in Cannes. This movie deserves to be seen, no matter what Disney says. Michael Moore does a fantastic job of exposing abuses within the Bush administration. It's amazing that the coziness of the Bushes and the Saudis had never been reported on in this much detail before. ("liberal media" my eye) Conservatives will not like this movie, but they should watch it anyway. Even if you disagree with Micheal Moore's politics, this movie will make you think long and hard about the direction the country is moving in. If you aren't concerned, you very well should be. There are some truly funny moments, and some very touching moments as well. Watch it with an open mind and form your own opinion, but watch it.Personally I think Fahrenheit 9/11 delivers a very important message that needs to be heard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Controversial But Powerful And Entertaining Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Michael Moore, whose aura of controversy only grew after his Oscar acceptance speech at the 2003 Academy Awards, Fahrenheit 9/11, like Moore's Bowling For Columbine and Roger &amp; Me, promises to expose the corporate wrongdoings and big-money scandals perpetrated by America's financial elite.The film takes a critical look at the presidency of George W. Bush, the War on Terror, and its coverage in the news media. The film is the highest grossing documentary of all time.In addition to criticizing the administration's handling of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center, Moore digs deep into the surprising relationship with the Bin Laden family held by both Bush administrations, and questions whether or not potential Saudi involvement with the attacks has been ignored.This is Moore's most powerful movie -- the largest in scope, the most resourceful and skillful in means -- and the best things in it have little to do with his usual ideological take on American power and George W. Bush.Obviously,it was a film full of rage against the former 43rd President of the United States.But despite the fact that this is an extremely one-sided in its indictment of the Bush administration,this is one worth watching documentary for the humor and the debates it'll stir as well as the satisfaction and entertainment one gets from the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fahrenheit 9/11 falls short of greatness, but no one would agree that it is not a liberating experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A roaring triumph at Cannes, Fahrenheit 9/11 is surprisingly not nominated for an Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. The Golden Palm winner is one of the most provocative films to come out of the new millennium. The man behind it is no stranger to controversy either: Michael Moore writes, produces, and directs the hit film. Sandwiched between Oscar-winning Bowling For Columbine (2002) and Oscar-nominated Sicko (2007), Fahrenheit 9/11 is more serious and less humorous, but equally well-researched and argued.Fahrenheit 9/11 explores issues leading up to the September 11 tragedy as well as the consequences thereafter. Viewers are brought back to that hotly-contested election that pitted Al Gore against George W. Bush. Bush wins it and assumes his role as the President. In this film, however, Bush assumes the role of a target board, a helpless lame-duck who is viciously hacked down by Moore who shows completely no sympathy for a man he feels should be held responsible for the suspect handling of the 9/11 incident and the innocent lives lost in the absurd invasion of Iraq.Moore is at his scathing best in Fahrenheit 9/11. He makes accusations towards the Bush Administration and backs it up with solid facts from reliable sources. Using a mix of archival footage and scenes he shot, Moore gives viewers a rare glimpse into the lifestyle of Bush, his infamous 'Pet Goat' reaction to the news of 9/11, his almost family-like links with Saudi Arabia (the country which produced more than three-quarters of the terrorists responsible for 9/11), and an eye-opening but disturbing look at the struggles and sufferings of Iraqi civilians and American soldiers in Iraq.There is still that sarcastic Mooresque humor that pops up once in a while despite the seriousness. Even then, one may feel there is an information overload and this makes it less fun to watch than his other features. However, Moore succeeds in making us seethe in anger (which is the whole point of the film). And with a bit of subtle manipulation, he even leaves room for us to shed a tear or two through mournful interviews with parents of soldiers killed in Iraq.Fahrenheit 9/11 is an important addition to the world of cinema not because it is a great film (it is not Moore's best output either) but rather it uses the medium so purposefully and convincingly that firstly, it tells the truth which most would have realized by now, that Bush is no better than a terrorist; and secondly, it gives defeated Americans a powerful voice that has been consistently silenced by the Bush Administration. Never has the virtue of 'freedom of speech and expression' been so patriotically emphasized in a film. The fact that this film even exists is astonishing. Yes, Fahrenheit 9/11 falls short of greatness, but no one would agree that it is not a liberating experience.GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Integral Vision, not Moore to Come?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an outsider, I have to expose my opinion on this recently seen film. I wouldn't merge into American Policies nor it's propaganda attempts onto Moore's calendar of irony, but just review the movie as a documentary. And I believe there is just a limbo between the documentary and the movie nature of this...product.How can't I like Moore? His humour is spicy, rectal, sharp and direct, shameless of responses and reactions, every word he speaks blades a double edge. Doesn't matter on which side you stand, you got to acknowledge the guy's charm. But there is something I find incomplete: Moore renders politics with an eye that few might call "integral". His lateral view on things seem biased, showing only clipped sides of the story. He seems that when he is in problems he will edit the scene and go forth with obsolete critics. It's interesting, funny and attractive, but I really doubt the nature of being either a propaganda attempt, or a true documentary. A true documentary should stay true to the Integral vision of the things and present them clearly with no subjectivisms. All I can see is Moore, disliking the government and with power on his hands directing an instrumental attack regardless of constructive criticism.A five sounds fine, because it is intelligent and fun, but since it's not fully compromised with the whole nature of things, I beg for Moore to overcome his whimsies and propose practical, beneficial help with his camera and witty charm.That's my two cents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iraq, war and tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am studying in the United States and originally from the Middle East. From my point of view, Fahrenheit 9\11 brings the audience most of the truth (spoken and unspoken) about the Bush administration. It lays a stress upon how meaningless the war in Iraq was and really strong in the way that it shows how both Iraqi and American families suffered. I think its strongest effect on me was that I really felt that I and all the people in the Middle East had to actively do our best at least to share the grievance of the Iraqi people. Maybe we can't go there and stand against American troops and convince them that this war isn't just, actually movie tells us that they have also seen the reality but unfortunately they are under command. However, there is still a lot we can do and have to do as the tragedy goes on in Iraq. Americans also need to be more conscious and operative against these weapon and oil barons that have lot to determine and blacken their future. I think it should be all of our duty as human beings with decent reasoning to stand up and do our best starting tomorrow against this tragedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, this is not actually a movie, its a documentary. Im not a USA inhabitant, but I saw the pain that September 11 caused. I was wanting to see this documentary for a long time, M.Moore is an excellent documentalist because he makes them from an outside point, he forgets the BS of being a fake patriot, and goes up to the power to defend the commoners, the cannon meat as politicians used to call them. The documentary is great, depicting a whole business hidden from many Americans while they were told that they were actually "freeing" Irak. The oil business. The movie shows both politicians and big companies debating the division of the oil income, and isn't that just great, a mother loses her children, a wife her husband, a son his father, and all that companies and the government that supposedly cared about you, the USA people, actually care about is money income and money income. Today was the first time I saw the documentary, I already new some things, mostly because living outside of the USA gives us more uncensored news. But, the whole deal between Bush and the Bin Laden, the promotion to government position of former employees, the participation of the Bin Ladens as contributors(share holders) of one of the companies that is "helping" the US corps, and the participation of the division of the oil of companies like DHL and, guess who, MicroSoft. Yes, the giant of information is making profit of every dead, injured, active soldier. I know that in the USA M.Moore is known as an anti American, but if defending the helpless is anti patriot in any country in the world, then we actually deserve to be wipe out of the earth. To the people that has family members in active service, or are planning to do some service, don't do it, you are not helping your country, your are helping corporations like Bush hidden business, DHL and MS to make profit out of your life and your comrades life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a controversial discussion this film causes!! Love it, hate it, narrow minded, open minded, I just wanna talk film!! I SOO expected to love this movie, all my friends and relatives expected me to love this movie. This movie was just okay. First off I will let readers no I am NOT a republican, I am a student of politics, I love American politics and I am a staunch democratic supporter!! I am not a fan of Bush and I was in shock and disgust to learn he had been voted in again. VOTED IN AGAIN PEOPLE!! Apparently this film didn't make that much of an impact.Fahrenheit 911 for those of you living in an underground cave and haven't heard of it is film maker Michael Moore's testament to the underhanded and misleading facts behind the Iraq war and the 911 attacks. He uses interviews with victims, soldiers, congressman, and news footage, war footage, alleged "facts" in order to prove his point. The film is entertaining, Michael Moore is ALWAYS entertaining. Unfortunately he aims for entertainment over truth I think. Moore creates and edits his way through facts in order to try and sway people to his opinion. I believe the definition of a documentary is a film that presents facts objectively without editorializing. Moore goes way beyond editorializing and turns his films into an essay style where he is trying to prove his point. There is NOTHING wrong with that. Free speech all the way but let's not shroud it in a "documentary."The first half of the film I found myself getting annoyed with Moore's constant bring up "facts" with no idea as to where he gets these facts, where they are found or where to look for them. He brings up connections between Bush and Saudi Arabia, the Bin Laden's, different corporations and I don't dispute these facts, he may very well be correct but he doesn't give any indication as to where this information is coming from even to say a private source would be helpful. How can you believe something with seeing the evidence to back it up??Moore's absolutely amazing editing ability could turn Santa Clause into an evil looking criminal. The way he cuts and hacks news stories, photo's and audio clips to make the person look downright guilty is unfortunate and unfair when trying to make an impartial decision. The second half of Fahrenheit goes right for the emotions. We see how the war and the taking of young soldier's life effects ONE woman and her family. I KNOW there are other families out there he could have interviews, why ONE woman to get his point across. I just don't believe he did everything he could have done to make a captivating and realistic plea to ending Bush's own regime of terror.It makes for an interesting conversation piece but truly if the facts Moore presented in this film were as true as he claims them to be I think there would be a bigger investigation going on and I think Bush would have been forced to make a statement or perhaps even resign but the film barely made a wave in reality to the American people and this is proved fact because who is your sitting President?? Oh that's right the man voted best Villain in a movie on MTV. Michael Moore is sitting on his mountain of cash thinking about who next he can victimize rather than using his talent to truly bring out the facts. He's a talented man and he can swing people's views but for me Fahrenheit didn't cut it. I was sadly disappointed and I wanted to love this film. Still check it out because everyone has and everyone is talking about it!!6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well presented look at the man America voted for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** Forget your pre-conceived notions about who or what Michael Moore is or stands for - while 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is clearly 'Anti-Bush' and thus ruffles many patriotic American feathers, the one thing any detractors need to realize upon viewing F9/11 is this: MOORE DID **NOT** PUT ANY WORDS INTO GEORGE DUBYAH'S MOUTH!You will see the President's mindless blather, the gaffs, the blinking, the blinking, the oh-so-frequent-blinking, the mouth open &amp; not knowing what to say or do, will see how reliant he is on his support network below him to, and will see the now famous, ever pathetic, and frankly shocking lack of urgency in his reaction to being told of the terrorist attacks on New York's World Trade Center's Twin Towers.This is all REAL. This is all Dubyah. America, this is your President!!It is your President, as presented by Michael Moore, make no mistake about it. But Moore does a fine job of offering the viewer a 'closer look' at the President, and as a result Fahrenheit 9/11 a 'must-see' film.Forget Iraq. Forget Saddam Hussein. Forget the oil. Forget the corruption. Forget the War on Terror, forget the "fear". Forget Michael Moore: One simply does not expect the President of the United States of America to make so many gaffs, make so many inappropriate remarks in front of the cameras, and appear so clueless so often. The result is that you wonder how anyone could have possibly voted for this man in the first place. THIS is the leader of the most powerful nation in the world??I am writing this 2 full days after the 2004 election results are in, and as you all know by now, America voted for 4 MORE years of Dubyah. The rest of the world is dumbfounded at the result (in a global Internet "vote", only 9% of 113,522 votes went to Bush; 77% chose Kerry). In the real world America, the east-coast, west-coast, educated populations all voted against Bush. Rural middle-America and the Bible-thumping southern states all voted in favour of Bush. The consensus is clear - Americans are ignorant (of how they have been manipulated by Dubyah), and Americans are now the laughing stock worldwide.Hopefully now that the election is over, pro-Bush Americans who were avoiding this film will now be curious to see what it was about it that their fellow Republicans were so angered over. Of course, it is of no consequence now, but do yourself a favour - watch this film with an open mind - and you will likely realize what a horrible mistake you've made (twice now).It's a shame that the election came about a few days into November -- I'm sure Fahrenheit 9/11 DVDs will be popular next Halloween. If you keep your eyes open (and Moore keeps you captivated &amp; things move along at a good pace) - it is, in fact, pretty scary stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seems like a lot of people are upset by this movie. It upset me too. But I'm not upset at Moore or the movie itself, I'm upset at the main characters in it. The story this film tells is deeply sad and infuriating at the same time.I think a lot of people misunderstood Bowling For Columbine to be anti-gun. To me, it was not anti-gun. Rather it explored American sensibilities and asked questions about who we are as a nation and why we are so afraid. Those questions are present in F911 also. Only this time, we're also presented with the point of view that on top of being afraid, we've been manipulated and cheated. And we continue to be manipulated and cheated, especially those most in need.Fact checking aside, I'm glad someone finally drove home the point that our army is not 100% volunteer based, as many folks recruited come from underprivileged backgrounds with no real choices in life. I don't know what the answer is, but hypocricy is certainly not. Telling the enemy to "bring it on" with no knowledge what it's like to serve himself is disgraceful at best. Wining and dining with your elite base while asking people for sacrifices is unconcounable. Making a buck on an unnecessary war is murder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbiased? Of course not. Amazing? You bet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best way to start this review is to point out that there is NO SUCH THING AS UNBIASED DOCUMENTARY. The only unbiased documentary is one in which only footage is shown, nothing is edited, and there is no music or narration. I myself have never seen a documentary like this, and most likely, neither have you.As for the movie itself, calling it a documentary would still not be entirely accurate. It's a cinematic declaration of war. Moore sheds his heavy involvement a la "Bowling for Columbine" and prefers to let the majority of the movie just be facts speaking for themselves. Outside of an interview or two, the Patriot Act reading, and asking the Congressman to sign their kids up for the war, he mostly stays behind the scenes, narrating the scenes.And that's what makes this one so compelling. Where as Columbine was impressive mostly for the things Moore himself said and did, Fahrenheit is amazing for what simply happened. If Columbine was an attack, Fahrenheit is an all-out assault. The first half hour is arguably the most compelling, drawing ties between Saudi Arabia and the Bushes, the financial aspects of it all, the negligence and outright corruption that filled all events post-9/11.There is no starkly new information here if you read a lot, but for the masses, there will be a lot of things on the underbelly of the administration that they have not seen before. Moore doesn't make any effort to balance his opinions, right from the get-go we see that he will be tearing Bush down piece by piece. And it does.Naturally, Moore injects his humor in where needed to break up the heavy-handed subject matter. Occasionally he just needs to let Bush talk and that's that, but some segments (the bit on the Coalition of the Willing is priceless) are simply hilarious. And the movie ends with one of the most incredible Bush quotes of all time.Simply said, go see this movie. 9/10, for a few parts that drew on too long. But in my small town, this is the first movie I've seen get the kind of ovation it did.</fullReview>

The only problem I had was the obvious slant to the film. I did not expect to see any support for Bush at all, but I also did not expect to see downright opposition in what I thought was a documentary. Perhaps and editorial film would be a better classification for this.This movie was not at all impartial. Unfortunately for Moore, it looses some affect on those like myself. The facts he presented were well thought out and researched. However the slant he put on them lost some credibility.It began to sound more like a Democratic campaign film. Had he presented the facts without bias, he would have made a stronger impact on me. Instead, it makes me question the points he almost had me convinced of. I was left wondering what else about it was his opinion.Overall, I am glad I watched it at least to know the other side. It did not however sway my thought process at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[Possible spoilers ahead]I am one of those who neither hated nor loved this movie. The best thing about it is the Big Idea that Moore wants us to understand ? that it is a crime to send working class kids to fight a war on the basis of the lies about WMDs and terrorism that the Bush Administration peddled for a year and a half after September 11th. Moore is actually fairly low-key in pushing this point, even though he says it as straightforwardly as possible at the end of the movie, because he doesn't (for the most part) hit us over the head with the cute ironies, embarrassing images and heavy sarcasm he is so prone to use otherwise. Even the Marine recruiters, like the sheriff in Roger and Me who made a living out of evicting the unemployed, come off as people doing their job in an unjust system.Moore sets up his argument with the unsensitized pictures of what bombing and occupation mean on the ground in Iraq ? something we almost never see in the U.S. media. While we still do not get close to the Iraqis in these scenes, given the distances created by language and culture, or even to the American soldiers, thanks to Moore's scrapbook approach to telling his story, we do get a few minutes to see what this sort of hell is like. And that makes his point that much more powerful when he brings the story home to Flint, to the VA hospital and to Lila Lipscomb's kitchen. (As for the commenter who told her to shut up, what is it about her grief that you can't bear to watch?)The problem is that Moore weighs down this message with a lot of tendentious arguments about Unocal's plans for a pipeline, the departure of Saudi nationals on September 13th, and other debatable points. It isn't enough for Moore to point out the criminality (in moral terms at least) of Halliburton and others getting rich off the war; Moore needs to find a scandal, one that will make the war a federal crime as well. That causes him to fixate on Bush and the Bush family's relations with the House of Saud. I had a hard time seeing what the point was: we know we are in close alliance with the Saudis, but how does that explain why we went into Afghanistan, or why we waited four weeks to bomb Afghanistan, or why we invaded Iraq? Moore doesn't offer any explanation and I don't think he's got one.Bush is a great target. Moore desperately wants to defeat him this November. And he probably could not have sold as many tickets if he had not skewered him so frequently and so well. But this would have been a better film if Moore had stuck to the point he really wanted to make.</fullReview>

If I wanted between them to win, I would pick Bush only because he's experienced and I actually don't trust Kerry at all. What this documebtary stands out for, is that Moore is making Bush look bad. The scenes were hilarious like when they are making fun of Bush sometimes like the vacation scene and the 9/11 attack. The Iraq scenes with the soldiers were the best part of the whole thing because all of it is actually true and very realistic. Overall, a great documentary that has a lot of explaining to it and if your a die hard Bush fan, don't see itHedeen's outlook: 9/10 ***+ A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Academy Award winning director and writer Michael Moore gives us a visual and auditory treat as we look at the lies and deception of the Bush Administration and their handling of the events post 9/11, including the theft of our personal liberties with The Patriot Act.There is nothing new here to those who pay attention to what is going on in America. Political columnists like the late Molly Ivins and others have kept us abreast of the machinations of the Bush family. We know how George Bush has benefited with his relationships to the Saudis and seeing them get special treatment was no surprise. We know that Crogress doesn't read what they vote on, and many of us knew that the Patriot Act was written prior to 9/11.But, what Moore does is wrap everything up in a nice neat package that is easy for the uninformed to digest and learn. He is a master at using humor to make a political point. This film should be watched every year on his birthday.Besides that, we get to see again just what a twit Britney Spears is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive and shocking display of the sad truth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary/movie is for those who are open minded and can take criticism. Michael Moore did a wonderful job by re-collecting testimonies, video and audio footage, and even re-creating the events of before and after of one of the most tragical events in modern history.Moore gives the weapons to the audience in order to create a (negative) opinion towards Bush's government since 2000. The movie tried to work as a an anti campaign before the presidential elections of 2004 but it didn't fulfill it's main job. Where this movie succeeds is in the information field. The video footage is simply brilliant because it displays some things that not even independent news channels would air. Take as an example Mr. Bush's behavior when he is noticed about the 9/11 attacks. He just sits down and thinks but does nothing at all, mean while a group of kinder garden students read. That footage is more than compromising.Also, the history behind the Talibans' relationship with the Bush family is shocking, and disturbing."Fahrenheit" is a brave effort in the investigation field that deserves a lot of recognition for trying to tell a hidden truth that nowadays, it's more than well known.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Josef Goebbels could not have done better! Yes, I saw the film. Pure propaganda, with no more intention than to stir the masses (at least the mislead liberal base) against the President. Moore is obviously nothing "moore" than a malcontent, evidently desiring that the US was France, Germany, or some sort of European conglomeration which represents his imagined educated intellectual elitist point of view, which has no basis in reality. Wake up you fat pig! There really aren't that many who share your distorted views of the US or the world! I've seen "Bowling for Columbine" and "Fahrenheit 9/11". Both appear to be nothing more than a spoiled brat's attempt to get everyone else to see his warped point of view, and neither film held any value for me whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Documentary, despite taking a stance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It should surprise no one that Bush supporters have widely attacked this film as "full of lies" and "not a documentary." Some have even inaccurately stated that Michael Moore "admitted" that it is not a documentary. In preface to my own comments of the film, I would like to set the record straight: documentaries OFTEN take sides, and Michael Moore has repeatedly said that Fahrenheit 9/11 IS a documentary, albeit one with a point of view. Also, please don't say that the film is full of lies (or that "half of this movie is probably incorrect," as one IMDB reviewer said) unless you are willing to show concrete examples.My observations:Fahrenheit 9/11 does an excellent job of pointing out some of the major problems with Bush's invasion of Iraq that have largely escaped (at least until recently) coverage in the mainstream media. Moore shows the Bush administration's efforts to create a connection in Americans' minds between the 9/11 attacks and Iraq, then plays them off against later statements by the same individuals that Iraq was never connected with those attacks. He demonstrates that much evidence countered White House claims of on-going weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs in Iraq and how subsequent searches for WMD evidence vindicated the dissenters. In the most powerful part of his film, Moore speaks with the family of a soldier killed in Iraq, with the mother showing alternately grief and outrage over the death that need not have occurred. Moore also discusses how close friends of Bush have profited tremendously as a result of the invasion.Another strong point of the film describes the poor White House performance on terrorism prior to 9/11 and poor response on 9/11. The White House failed to hold any meetings with their terrorism task force prior to the 9/11 attacks, failed to act against hijacked planes that remained in the air -- in one case, for hours -- after the initial impact on the World Trade Center, and allowed members of the bin Laden family to fly around the country in preparation to leave the United States during a time when all other civilian air traffic was grounded. Moore describes all of this and more.Not everything in the film works, however. The first part of the film deals with the 2000 election debacle in Florida, describing the series of steps that disenfranchised voters and led to Bush's "victory." While the criticisms of the process in Florida are accurate and many viewers may be unaware of some of the details of the fiasco, this subject is quite separate from the main topic of the film and is better handled in columns and books by Greg Palast or in the documentary "Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election."While closer to the point, Moore also misses the mark by focusing on the Carlyle Group: a corporate entity uniting George Bush, Sr. and others close to George W. Bush with Saudi Arabian oil interests. While the issue of the Carlyle Group merits scrutiny, the group does not have clear connections to 9/11 or to US response, and no policy statements from the group that would confirm suspicions were offered. A better case could be made in reference to the Project for a New American Century (PNAC), which Moore ignored entirely. PNAC's members fill the administrations upper echelon, and they have publicly available position papers arguing that the US should aggressively use its position as the world's only superpower to support US "interests" around the world.Perhaps the most quintessentially Michael Moore section of the film deals with Moore approaching members of Congress and asking them to send their own children into battle in Iraq as a sign of good faith. The effort is met with predictable responses, as Congressmen alternatively express their incredulity or avoid Moore entirely. As entertaining as this and some other moments are, the film's best feature is Moore's maturation as a documentarian in the more serious, hard-hitting segments of the film.Moore casts a wide net in Fahrenheit 9/11 -- at times too wide -- ending up with a film with far more hits than misses and provides much information not known to most Americans even today. Isn't that what a documentary should do?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only positive thing that could come out of people hating this extraordinary documentary would be for them to rush to enlist to go to fight in Iraq. The news media chides away from showing people like that lady from Flint, Michigan, who is, as far as I'm concerned, the true heroine of the film. Her pain at having lost her son in Iraq is, at times, hard to take. All I could hear around me was quiet sobbing as she was telling us the story of the death of her son. Another thing missing from this war is the arrival of the coffins draped with American flags. And for that matter, no cameras have gone into the hospitals where these young soldiers who have lost hands, arms, legs, are recuperating from wounds they have suffered from the war. The general public has been kept uninformed about these young people so no one can witness the end result of the war.The Iraqi conflict should have ended a long time ago if children of privileged Americans would have died as a result of their being there. In one of the most hilarious segments of the film, we see a few Congressmen scurrying away from questions presented to them by Michael Moore. Of course they have children, but, no, these kids will never see a day of combat in their lives. We'll never see the Bush twins in beautiful downtown Baghdag any day soon!The biggest horror of it all is the killing of innocent people during the bombings. The images of children's bodies being dumped in communal donkey carts are too much to take, as is the case with the Iraqi woman who is shown crying in front of the camera as she mourns for five dead relatives that just died in an raid. Regardless how one feels about the present administration, the facts are there for anyone to see and reflect upon the atrocities presented in the documentary.War is hell, no matter how anyone sugar coats it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best film to see if you want to see the worst president in history take the worlds super power and flush it down the worlds dirtiest toilet. His humorous, yet sarcastic depiction shows military personnel discussing their disgust, politicians showing their anger for this joke of a presidents foreign policy. His detailed description of the hell the soldiers deal with on a daily basis gives us an idea of the soldiers perspective as well as an understanding of what their feelings are on this unjust operation. There aren't any holes with which I could think of, it was accurate with moore's portrayal of the relationship b/w the saudi family and bush, the strong dependence of the US on arab oil, and the many reasons for which we continue to occupy Iraq. This is one film that any person who want's more information on the most corrupt administration in U.S. should watch. This is a true documentary, one that will leave you wondering why, and i quote the daily mirror from the UK, "How can 59,054,087 people be so dumb". I feel this is a telling statement for anyone who has a progressive liberal mindset. Moore makes a film that has accuracy, humor,anger towards corruption, and an overall feel of excellence in film making. GO WATCH THE FILM IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War Is a Racket</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Major General Smedley Butler of the US Marine Corps wrote back in 1933 his famous essay on modern warfare entitled "War is a Racket". Smedley Butler served his country for over thirty years in the US Marine Corps on three different continents in some dozen military engagements. Having won the Congressional Medal of Honor twice, not once, for courage and valor above and beyond the call of duty Gen. Butler came to this sad conclusion to the service that he rendered to his country at the twilight of his long and distinguished military career. Seventy years later Michael Moore came to the same conclusion that Gen. Butler did: "War is a Racket". Unlike Gen. Butler who put his thoughts on paper Michael Moore put them on film in his explosive documentary "Fahrenheit 9/11". The movie focuses in on the fateful summer of 2001 when Pres. Bush received but ignored a CIA report on August 6, 2001 about a possible impending attack by Osama Bin-Laden's Al-Qeada terrorist group on targets on American soil. Bin-Laden planned to use hijacked passenger planes to pull this terrorist operation off,that's exactly what happened on September 11, 2001 a month later. The Bush Administration used that tragic event to push for and pass the "Patriot Act" that that compromised the US Constitution and Bill of Rights. At the same time Pres. Bush pushed for war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq which had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. Being that the Al-Qeada was in Afghanistan not Iraq and protected by the Taliban who ran that country President Bush had no choice but to attack Afghanistan. By the late spring of 2002 both the Al-Qeada and Taliban together with their leaders Osama Bin-Laden &amp; Mullah Omar escaped the pursuing US and allied forces by getting themselves lost into the rugged mountains on the Afghan/Pakistan border. Bush used only 11,000 US troops in that war, less then there are policemen on the island of Manhattan, against a country bigger and more populated then the state of Texas.By the summer of 2002 the Bush Administration started to mass US troops in Kuwait for the invasion of the real target on their radar scope Saddam's Iraq. The Bush Administration together with the cooperation of the US media started to plant stories of Iraq being responsible for the 9/11 attacks by being allied with Osama Bin-Laden's Al-Qeada. The American public was also told that Iraq had possession of WMD, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and would use then on it's neighbors as well as the United States. After months of pounding these rumors into the minds of the American public on March 19, 2003 Bush and his Neocon/hawks finally got their wish as the US invaded Iraq, something that GW Bush &amp; Co. wanted since they took office back on January 20, 2001. The Iraqi war has already cost the lives of some 12 to 15 thousand Iraqi's and almost 1,000 US servicemen and is still going on with no end in sight. The 9/11 Commission has come out with a statement that Iraq had nothing at all to do with the 9/11 attacks on America and found no evidence that Iraq had WMD. Michael Moore exposed the crude propaganda of the Bush/Neocons in going to war in Iraq as well as attacking anyone, like himself, who's against that war as being unpatriotic. Moore does this by showing us those GI's who were severely wounded in that war at a local veterans hospital which the US media never shows and which we hardly if ever see or hear Bush or members of his administration visit. Since the start of the war in Iraq Bush with the majority of the congress cut as much as 60% of veterans benefits behind the scenes. while in public Bush &amp; Co. claimed to be such big supporters of our fighting men and women and that anybody who was against their policies in Iraq were bad for the troops fighting and dying there and responsible for the losses that they are suffering in Iraq. Even though those against the war want the US servicemen not to be in that country and suffer the casualties that they are suffering there in the first place. Like the wounded GI's in the veterans hospital the Bush Administration as well as the US media refuses to show the returning flag-draped coffins of dead US servicemen coming back from Iraq as well as Afghanistan, it's just too depressing for the American public to see were told by them. Even though Michael Moore leaves out the footage of the brutal 9/11 attacks from his movie he does have the very graphic and bloody footage of the fighting in Iraq. The shocking scenes of dead and wounded US servicemen and Iraqi civilians and soldiers made many in the theater watching the movie turn away from the screen. Of all the 535 members in the US congress only one has a son serving in Iraq. At the end of the movie Michael Moore with a US Marine recruiter by his side goes to the Capital Building in Washington D.C. trying to get the sons and daughters of the Congressmen and Senators, who for the most part support the war in Iraq, to voluntarily go fight and die in the war that they seem to be so supportive of: to no ones surprise there were no takers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full frontal assault on George W. Bush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*There is one inescapable truth to be gleaned from "Fahrenheit 9/11" and it's this: Michael Moore despises George W. Bush. This documentary was created with only one purpose in mind and that is to derail any chance Bush has of being reelected. If Bush does win in November, this documentary will be a failure. If Bush loses, I wonder how much credit Moore will give himself for Bush's defeat. He would probably deserve a little credit.If Michael Moore can't score front row seats to the Democratic National Convention then no one can. "Fahrenheit 9/11" is about George W. Bush and why Moore thinks he's a dangerously incompetent buffoon. It chronicles his life of privilege and excess. It explores every possible connection that he has to the Saudi government and wonders if Bush and co. have more interest in keeping the Saudi's happy, (making sure the Bin Laden family got on a plane for Saudi Arabia, etc.) than in keeping America safe. As you may surmise, Moore has made up his mind and decides to attack Bush with all of the film-making power at his disposal. So Michael Moore declares jihad against Bush. Is there anything to it? Yes. There are two points that validate Moore's film. Moore makes the argument that the Iraq war was completely unnecessary and Bush made a fatal error in starting it. He may turn out to be right. As I write this comment, Iraq is completely on fire. There is no letup in the amount of attacks. If one were able to see the future of Iraq, what would you see? All I see is more chaos and destruction for years to come. Was it worth it? Sure, Saddam Hussein was knocked out. So now what? What will Iraq look like in November when Bush is pushing for four more years? Will the Shiites, Sunnis, Wahabis, Kurds, Turkmens, al-Qaeda and the U.S. all be holding hands singing GIVE PEACE A CHANCE? Not likely. The second point that gives "Fahrenheit 9/11" some weight is the fact that Osama Bin Laden is still at large. This is the single greatest failure of Bush's presidency. Bush likes to write Bin Laden off as a marginalized figure who can't do much from the tribal lands of Pakistan or wherever that dirtbag is hiding. That is what the government said when he was hanging out in Afghanistan in the 1990's. The fact is that one man can and does make a difference. Killing Osama Bin Laden should be the first thing on the agenda. Osama has got to go. So where's Osama? Who knows? My guess is somewhere on the border with Pakistan and Afghanistan. You would probably need 100,000 troops to invade those tribal lands to put Bin Laden's head on a stick. Bin Laden is worth the effort. Does Bush really care about finding him? I don't know.The sad truth about 9/11, the Iraq war, and the fruitless search for Bin Laden is that we'll never know the real truth. Unless you're sitting in the halls of power in Washington or planning massive attacks with Bin Laden, you will never know what goes on in the real world. All normal people know, (like me), is what the government and the media tells us. We base our opinions on incomplete facts. "Fahrenheit 9/11" is not THE TRUTH. It is Moore's opinion of George W. Bush and that opinion is mighty low. It is a timely documentary that should be seen by all voters. Moore is trying to get voters to run Bush out of office. Will he succeed? Time will tell. At the end of the movie, Moore lets Bush do the talking for him: "There's a saying in Texas, Fool me once....shame on you. Fool me twice....well you're not going to fool me twice."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I see it, any documentary, that hits so hard the government has to release its own documentary to disprove the first, has to be worth seeing. Yup, a film cleverly titled 'FahrenHype 9/11', supposedly detailing the lies and false truths told by Moore's film, was released. When I go to Blockbuster, all 3 copies of this film are frequently rented out. And 'FahrenHype 9/11'? I've never seen it rented once.Let's face it, we all know there was something up with 9/11, the War against Terror, and Bush's entire first term in office as a whole. You'd have to be downright stupid to not see it, or at least in denial. Moore spills the beans here.Did you know that almost 1 trillion dollars of the U.S. economy is from Saudi money? Or that the appointed leader of Afganistan was a former adviser to an oil company owned by a friend of Bush? Or that Bush and his pals invested in a defense company prior to 9/11? Or how about, after 9/11, 2 dozen Bin Laden family members were flown out of the country? Well, now that you *do* know, are you getting a little suspicious? It's not hard to see what was on Bush's mind during the war. After all, with several investors to his companies being connected to Bin Laden in some way, he was in a tough spot. How to conduct war on the man without PO'ing your buddies, who know the man. Bush thus did what he had to do to save face, and invade Afganistan. He just did a half-assed job of it, and went on to invade Iraq for reasons lost in a sea of red-tape and falsehoods Bush has weaved into the web of lies that make up his presidency.What sort of amusing and yet, ridiculous things happened here? how about people beng allowed lighters and matches aboard planes, but a mother being forced to give up her bottle of breast milk? Or the simple fact that there's a larger police force in Manhattan than there were troops in Afganistan.I'll admit it, I was anti-Bush before I saw this. So of course I loved it. I mean, one Congressman actually says that Congress didn't read the Patriot Act. What is that? Pass a bill without reading it? And then using the Patriot Act as an excuse to bust down an old guys door because he called Bush an asshole? Ha!I will say this now- watch this film. You know what, Moore probably does tell some half-truths here and there. And like Bush hasn't? Overall, a great film. And if nothing else, listening to Moore voice Bush's supposed inner thoughts in the classroom, the morning of September 11, is very funny."Which one of them...screwed me?"The more pressing question is: Did Bush himself, screw the troops who gave their lives, fighting a war in a country that posed no threat? Did he screw the Amercian people, who sent their family members to fight. Did he screw the innocent civilians of Iraq and Afganistan? Come to think of it, who did Bush *not* screw?Sadly, the answer is: no one. Bush screwed us all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the topic and the trailer, I went into this film with great anticipation for a social commentary and a documentary that would rock the world. Within the first 10 minutes, however, the film presented itself as what it truly was: a no-holds barred attack on the President and his administration. Rather than focusing on the whirlwind created following 9/11, Moore breaks away to attempt a scary story of a big bad wolf, which was more of a ad hominem attack than a concise argument of his point. If Michael Moore wants to make a film about evil, he should start where he stands and make a film about Hollywood. Then again, he would not bite the hand that feeds him, especially when he's eating so well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fahrenheit 9/11: 9/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been about an hour since I left the theater where I saw Fahrenheit 9/11, and the Green Day song "Walking Contradiction" is going through my head, because that's what the Bush administration is. I'm going to try to stick to the movie in this review, although I didn't do a good job of that in my Bowling for Columbine review. I'm not a huge Michael Moore fan. He's often too extreme and close-minded, but that doesn't mean I wasn't up and cheering (philosophically speaking) during his controversial Oscar acceptance speech at the 2003 Oscars. I see his point more times than not, and often agree with him. If he makes up facts, so what? He conveys them in a persuasive manner and gets his point across. And, come on-even though the GOP lies day in and day out, Moore can't make up a few facts without being publicly scrutinized? Fair and balanced my ass.Fahrenheit 9/11, a play on Ray Bradbury's novel Fahrenheit 451, is about an hour and twenty minutes of bashing George W. Bush, half an hour of why the "war" in Iraq sucks, and then something to tie it all together. I never liked Bush and never will, and Moore does a good job of running his face in the mud where it belongs. Moore thinks that he's bringing up some long-hidden facts about Bush, when they aren't, but like everyone, Bush has skeletons in the closet, and they're gleeful put out here. There's a few omittances of facts here and there-such as the real reason why Bush waited seven minutes to take action after the 9/11 attacks, but still, his face is priceless! I don't mean to sound hateful towards 9/11, but it shows how much of a limp fish Bush actually is. I find it hard to believe that people can defend this clown-well, besides big business. Moore's first few minutes are about Gore losing the election, and it made me very angry-none of the political events that occurred from January 20, 2001 until now would not have occurred if Bush hadn't meddled around in other people's business.Moore loves drawing up connections, and he does that left and right here. Some are quite farfetched (it's like he's playing six degrees of the bin Ladens). He also seems to demonize most Middle-Easterns and the entire bin Laden family. While they're not perfect (hell, they appear to be pretty evil in the movie), they're not as bad as black sheep Osama. But that doesn't nullify the movie in general (see, I'm trying to stay on topic). The movie is jaw-dropping. Fahrenheit 9/11's a powerful piece of celluloid. Call it a documentary, call it leftist propaganda, call it what you will, you cannot deny the absurdity of the American government. It all stems from Moore's seemingly smaller ego. He pushed his (not all that attractive) mug in every frame of Bowling, but here he shows restraint and more maturity. You see his face a scarce few times, and his so-called outrageous stunts are kept to a necessary minimum. This new type of Moore appears to show more maturity and is more appealing to the people.I must admit that when the movie switched over to Iraq and the soldiers, it became a little less interesting. The point was proven, but some of it just seemed like it was padding for a 2 hour runtime. There is no pleasure greater than seeing Bush knocked down a peg (he's like a square peg in a round hole, actually), and Fahrenheit 9/11 fulfilled that need. The whole movie in general is amazing and a departure from what some people didn't like in Bowling. This is a dead-on attack of Bush, and if you're voting for him, you won't like the movie, because you think it's all lies. Hopefully you'll come around and just realizing you're lying to yourself.My rating: 9/10Rated R for violent and disturbing images and for language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(which is always sold out) and I felt surprised how it is not propaganda at all, as its opponents say. Everything in this movie is just showed from the real. Never Michael Moore suggests some opinions to the audience. We take our deductions from what we see, not because M.M. says to us what is his opinion (anyway easy to understand). I grew up in Rome (Italy)watching American movies. America has always been my dream and my myth. I came to live here 8 years ago,I invested here all my money, I love America and its people.When I started to ask to my American friends how a kind of a such disastrous and embarrassing president can even hope to be reelected, somebody asked me: "Why you are so anti American?" . In Italy we are used to bad politicians since 2,000 years and when I say bad I mean able to anything. I don't think that a person who don't like a negative bad president is against the country but in favor of the country. I'm not democratic and not republican and for sure not communist as I'm a paying guest, but what this movie says, for me is nothing new. I already have been listening Mr. Bush to lie about the Weapons of Mass Destruction and all the rest. I can see everyday that Iraqi people don't feel Americans as liberators but invaders for oil reason. Anything we have been watching in this movie we have been already watching on TV, but not focusing it. Everybody between us have had the occasion to read,before watching this movie, that the "Halliburton", the company with billions dollars of interests in Iraq, is owned by the vice president Cheney .Anyway this documentary is very very interesting as it is able to resume in 2 hours a good part of the acting of the more powerful man on the planet. I liked that, with so serious theme, this movie is very often funny and makes you laughing . A must to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore vs. George W. Bush. A very one sided war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some more objectivity wouldn't had been a bad thing. This documentary is extremely one sided and is nothing more than an 2 hour Bush-bashing. I'm not a Bush fan, not at all and I dislike his politics and personality but it doesn't seem fair that they only showed one side of this story in this documentary. A documentary should in my opinion be always objective towards its subject, or else it loses its power and credibility.I liked "Bowling for Columbine" very much, so I also expected some great things from this documentary. Although the end result wasn't that bad, it still disappointed me.The documentary does provide some new good insightful information but the documentary was really like Oliver Stone's "JFK" at times, it features lots of conspiracy theories that all don't sound really implausible but at the same time also are quite far fetched.The documentary is not always told in the right way. It tries to put too much information in it and handles a bit too many subjects. The documentary begins with how Bush 'stole the elections' and ends with the Iraq war. Not everything in the documentary feels really connected. Also ending the documentary with a mother's grief just didn't feel right and it was cheap that Michael Moore used this to proof his point.Michael Moore obviously has something personal against Bush and he is extremely biased with this documentary. I like his style of documentary making but he didn't handled the subject of this documentary very well. I'm still interested in seeing his next projects but at the same time I'm hoping for some more objectivity next time.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Any conservative who never served himself and would never be willing to let a child of theirs serve, but has NO problem letting YOUR child serve would have to feel just a tiny bit de-nutted watching that scene unless they have absolutely moral character at all. Mike, you hit a home run in that scene and it's part of what made this movie an instant classic. I am a teacher and I solemnly promise that I will be showing this film to my students for years and reminding them of this arrogant administration and of how fearful and stupid we were as a nation. As a man who served in the United States Marines, my championing of this film is my personal kick in the balls to all cons who would sacrifice your child but never themselves or theirs.

		<shortDescription>Business As Usual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that conservatives and liberals alike are looking at FAHRENHEIT 9/11 through the filter of their own agendas: it is not really an attack on the Republican Party, nor is it really a Democratic election-year commercial. At heart, the film is an attack on political powers influenced by big business, which strives to manipulate the public through fear in order to turn a handsome profit. But this is not to say that George W. Bush doesn't get a terrific beating here--he does, and so does his administration, with Ashcroft coming off as particularly ludicrous. In the first third of the film, Moore goes to tremendous pains to demonstrate the existence of a "good old boys" network between the Bush family and Saudi money men, a network Moore claims facilitated the flight of wealthy Saudis from the United States in the immediate wake of 9/11. While intriguing, Moore's position on this point is distinctly interpretive--but there is much more in the film that is not.In the past, Moore has been accused of startling his targets into unstudied responses by unexpectedly leaping out at them with camera in hand, but no such accusation can arise here. In FAHRENHEIT 9/11 Moore relies upon media coverage of Bush, and while the coverage is edited for effect there is no dodging the bullet: Bush was where he was, doing what he was doing, and saying what he was saying of his own free will and in full knowledge that the cameras were rolling. If Bush emerges from this looking like a buffoon, he has no one to blame but himself.At this point the film's edge turns razor sharp and deadly. It is very easy to forget what someone said in an interview or speech several years ago--but it is also easy to roll the footage and remind us of it, not to mention pointing out various inconsistencies in the process. But for all the film's Bush buffoonery, the most chilling aspect of FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is the portrait it paints of corporate greed and human tragedy.In parts of the film Moore approaches his subject with a comic edge, pointing out some of the absurdities arising from the Patriot Act. But simply put, there are a great many people making a great deal of money out of the United States' invasion of Iraq. Corporations and investors rake in big bucks while, as one American solider puts it, an American trucker driving five miles a day in Iraq makes more in a week than a solider will make in a month. When one adds to this chilling observation the fact that the Bush administration has done everything from cut military pay to seek closure of V.A. hospitals... well, it all adds up to a fairly poisonous portrait of both business and politics as usual. Lives are lost, but no matter, at least so long as the polls are good and the money keeps rolling in.Is the film biased? Without a doubt. Is it speculative? Yes, but only to a certain degree. Will it make you stop and think? You better believe it. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take That President Bush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's fourth film Fahrenheit 9/11 is a classic mixture of emotions and a truly genius film about the world after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The mixture of file footage and interviews with both government officials and ordinary citizens shows the mixed feelings that many people have about the current war in Iraq.The film begins explaining the mistakes made during the election in 2000. It begins with a great big celebration that shows Al Gore and many other celebrating his Florida victory. Then it goes into a series of documents, interviews and news footage that shows what George Bush had done before and after September 11, even a funny look at Bush teeing off and fishing while on vacation. There are two parts of the movie that work well on hinting on the mix of emotions most of the people around the world have been feeling since the war began. The first is footage of Iraqi families and children living a normal day of flying kites and living normal lives, away from any fear or trouble from their government. Suddenly, a bomb hits and obliterates a village.Micheal Moore's film is great and definitely worth seeing to form your own opinion on it. The film is one sided, yes, but that only helps to get the main point across. I recommend this film and I feel it is a great artistic expression about the Iraqi war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like one reviewer has said, you feel hood-winked when you watch Fahrenheit 9/11. It is clearly distorted and deceitful, and is NOT a documentary. A documentary is something that is true and not misleading in such an irresponsible manner. See the movie Fahrenhype 9/11 if you want the truth behind Moore's untrue deception. This movie even features some of the people that were "used" in Moore's film, without their knowledge, as they declare such. Their clips were not accurate, in that they were taken out of context, and many times were submitted by reporters to Moore and used without their consent. Again, this is straight from them, just so you know the truth. 0/10 rating. This movie is awful.</fullReview>

I have enjoyed Michael Moore movies in the past, and I especially enjoyed Bowling For Columbine. We need journalists to question authorities, it's a critical part of democracy. This movie however, is nothing but anti-Bush propaganda. It's full of misinformation and straight-out lies. If you decide to watch this movie, make sure you watch Fahrenhype 9/11 right after. That way you still have the possibility of making up your own mind, instead of buying into Michael Moore's propaganda machine. Terrible movie, terrible journalism, just terrible. Michael Moore - you should be ashamed of yourself. 0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Fahrenheit 9/11' is a brilliantly edited montage of Bush Jr.'s questionable appointment to the U.S. presidency, the disaster of 9/11, Bush's reaction to the disaster, and ultimately a bigger picture of Jr.'s 'friends' in the U.S. and around the world.This film is slick, even stylish in it's delivery. Many scenes will leave you wondering, 'Where did he find that piece of film!' The increased production value of this film gives it a much different feel from many documentaries. Gone is the newsreel feeling, replaced by brilliant stock and original footage that call out for one's undivided attention. Unlike other works in this genre, 'Fahrenheit' is more than the dull drudgery of facts and stats. It both enlightens and entertains while pressing it's point.As for subject matter, Fahrenheit 9/11 will certainly be more divisive than other Michael Moore works. The reason? It aims straight for the heart and takes no prisoners. The only shades of gray will be those in the dim theater, certainly not on screen or in the dialogue. The film is most certainly biased and unbalanced, but if that's what you're after, this is the wrong place for you. This film represents opinion, but opinion that is worth hearing nonetheless.See it and judge for yourself. I must mention that 'Fahrenheit' has been widely discussed and attended here in Canada, as it will most likely be in the same manner around the world.We'll all be watching this November!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a rite of passage in a Democracy than a movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right up front I'll make my positions clear.This film is clearly a personal grudge fight, in addition to a cry for national sanity in an insane situation.Re. Michael Moore; I loved ROGER AND ME, and was less, but still moderately impressed with BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. I'm made a bit uneasy by Moore's style of "ambush journalism". Roger Smith had it coming, and the tactic (the only one possible in dealing with him) showed his true shallowness, arrogance, greed and cunning. However, Moore came off as a bit of a bully versus Charleton Heston when using the same tactics; that interview showed a frail old man who came to a battle of wits while hopelessly and totally unarmed... an ironic posture for the spokesperson of the NRA. Re. George W. Bush; I didn't vote for him and I was utterly disgusted by the fraudulent election of 2000, wherein The Supremes circumvented the electoral process and installed a Caesar by fiat. Mr. Bush is clearly intellectually unequipped to handle the job and too ethically challenged to be trusted in office. Once he was actually in power and SOME of his policies were exposed for all to see, my attitude changed somewhat. I felt (and still feel) that the old Roman penalty for corrupt public officials should be immediately applied, but with a slight modification; Bush should be tied and sewn into a sack with a half dozen or so rabid weasels, and the sack tossed into a fast flowing river with plenty of rocks.That having been said...I resisted the powerful urge to see this film on the opening weekend; long waiting lines and crowds are tiresome (I had my fill of that in the service), and I don't have the patience to deal with a hoard of clueless Yuppies and the collection of Bush supporter protesters in front of the theater that had been promised by local groups. I therefore waited until a noon showing on Monday... surely the crowds and brouhaha would have slacked off by then.Imagine my surprise when, arriving early, I drove into a crammed parking lot, and found myself in a waiting line anyway... at NOON on a workday!As for the film itself... I expected no huge surprises from it's content, and I didn't get any. Moore has produced a solid, workmanlike documentary. It expressed the maker's Point of View (as any other documentary does), and presented the facts of the situation at hand clearly and pointedly.What struck me even more than the film was the audience there to watch it.In the period between taking my seat and the start of the showing, I noticed something very odd... something I've never seen in a movie theater before.Headed up the aisle to choose a seat... an elderly man with a walker. Then, another... and a third. Now, one with a cane. Next, assisted by a Lady (apparently his wife), a man struggling up the aisle pulling an oxygen cylinder on a small cart to feed a nasal cannula. Then a relatively young woman struggled up the aisle with a cast on her leg and crutches... and finally, installed at the head of an entrance aisle by an usher, was a man in a wheelchair.That's when the importance of this film struck me full force.For these people, going to a movie theater is a major hassle, an expedition that requires logistical support, planning, and a whole lot of effort. Despite all of that, these people obviously felt that THIS film was WORTH the effort. After the fight to get this film distributed, these people were NOT going to let it pass them by.During the showing... there were few demonstrations or catcalls; this audience was intently watching and listening. As the credits came up, there was applause... not a roaring ovation; it was scattered and in some cases tentative... but applause nonetheless.When I was leaving the auditorium I was deeply disturbed and made uncomfortable by what I'd just seen and heard, both on the screen and in the audience... and for the 2:15 showing, there was ANOTHER long line waiting to get in.Maybe the long lines and crowds are saying something that Mr. Bush should be paying attention to.This administration has held pitifully few press conferences, and they've seen no need for openness with their constituency. Instead, they've tried every way they can to close off information sources and manipulate the media. That policy is what made the huge crowds for FAHRENHEIT 9/11... people DO care about their country and it's actions, and they'll get ANY information about it they can find, and get it anywhere they can.</fullReview>

Okay that wouldn't be bad, but about 15 minutes into the film, it starts to loose co-hesion, and really starts not to make any sense at all. It becomes somewhat of a diatribe. And we all know what that is! (Constipation of the brain, resulting in diarrhea of the mouth).This "mock-u-mentary" suffers from glaring waste of time scenes, interviews, etc. Out of 2 hours of film, 30 minutes is what I would consider, usable information.This movie will have you screaming: "Make it stop! Oh please! Make it stop!" A real snoozer/loser." Don't waste your time with this "excess baggage!"Rated no stars.Wayno</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More entertaining fodder for discussion from Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've found that the way to appreciate a Moore documentary is not to judge it by how closely it reflects truth but, instead, by how successful it is as a catalyst for discussion. In that respect, this is a fine film.Moore unmistakably pushes his own agenda in this film, which was his attempt to persuade voters to oust Bush from office in the then-upcoming election. Of course, he was unsuccessful in that regard and must have felt doubly devastated since he sacrificed Oscar eligibility in order to televise the film.While this film bends and omits facts I don't think that it was as egregious an offender as "Bowling for Columbine". There were plenty of unpleasant facts already in the public consciousness, so I suppose that Moore didn't feel the need to invent situations of his own. That being said, there are of course some cheap tactics like approaching politicians to get them send their kids off to war. At least that's in support of a valid point; that the 'haves' are quite content to let the 'have nots' die in order to uphold the country's supposed freedom.Probably the most laughable point put forward by Moore was the quote from George Orwell's "1984". He's spent the entire film attacking the Bush administration for ineptitude and a flimsily justified war and then compares them to the unstoppable power of 'Big Brother'? Give me a break.On the whole, I do think that the film is fairly well done from a technical standpoint though not nearly as artistically rendered as "Bowling for Columbine". With that in mind, I recommend the film with this caveat: Don't just mindlessly swallow what you're presented with like the anti-intellectuals of Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>polemical film that grows more poignant with time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moore inspires extreme emotions in people. The comments on this board are testament to that. Even the most incoherent gibberish gets dozens of useful votes as long as it takes a swipe at Moore.Watching this movie now, with Iraq still in chaos, the sub-prime fallout pushing world economies into recession, Al Gore an Academy Award and Nobel Prize winner, and Bush as lame duck as Presidents come, it is hard not to think, "What if...?" Criticism of Moore for lack of journalistic ethics or not adhering to certain documentary conventions is disingenuous - the man is a self-confessed polemicist, looking to add left-wing bias to counterweight what he sees as the overwhelming right-wing bias in the establishment media. Yes, he left out the UK in his Coalition of the Willing sequence, but did you need to be told the UK was on board? Having said that, you do wonder if Moore's antics make it all too easy for his critics to dismiss him. Trying to get Congressmen to sign up their children for service in Iraq raised a titter, but it is hardly hard-hitting discourse - and it does provide an easy target for your enemies. Why did no Senator support the African-Americans from the House of Representatives in their protest? Was the involvement of the Bush family in the Florida election completely above board? These are valid questions that still need to be answered. The same people who condemn Saddam for election fraud will turn around and claim it is disrespectful to the office of the president to even consider the possibility of vote-rigging in Florida. They prefer to deflect their attention to Moore's burgeoning waistline and bank balance. If Moore really wants to create change, maybe he has to think about toning down his showboating and letting the arguments take centre stage.Is this all ancient history? Bush won a second election fair and square, so who cares how he won the first one, right? It's all Barrack and Hilary now, who even mentions Dubya these days? I'm not so sure. I think Moore has posed questions that people will return to. Bush may never face trial, but history will continue to judge him, and Moore has gone some way to setting the agenda for that process. The skill of Fahrenheit 9/11 is not in the evidence it presents, but in the arguments it sets out to create. Love it or loathe it, you can't ignore it.Ted Heath, commenting on the decline of British politics, noted that opposing politicians in the British parliament used to say, "I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it." At some point during the last 30 years, that mindset changed to, "How dare you say that!" Depressingly, the brouhaha caused by Fahrenheit 9/11 would suggest that shift is now a universal trend.</fullReview>

You are told about liasions between Saudi Arabia and the Bush family. Maybe there is such a thing, maybe there isn't, but you have no time to tell, because of the speed of the telling.The second hour is better, where you meet real people or the back-bone of the US. This has always been Michael Moore's best work and this is really tough stuff against the Bush administration, fair or not.Moore wants us to believe that the Iraqi war is about Big Business wanting more money. The Marxist analysis comes at the end, telling us that what it's all about, is the conserving of society's structures. Even if you're not into socialism, it's refreshing to hear. And it's obviously also commercial, so why not? Everyone should be satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Presidential elections are just around the corner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's new movie goes where no white house politician in their right mind would dare go - it, despite Moore's now infamous disregard towards Bush's politics, tries to show the best possible "truth" behind America's political agenda in the last 3 years and makes some pretty good points along the way. Bush is interpreted as America's no. 1 liar and you have to give Moore credit for digging up the stuff he does. But something else happened while I was watching "Fahrenheit", something very peculiar. Somewhere along the way I actually started feeling admiration towards Bush himself, he was no longer the dumb and fumbling president of the most powerful country in the world, underneath this carefully and meticulously presented mask he was a darn good genuine rotten businessman that had everyone thinking just the opposite. Boy did we all underestimate him, he was the worlds most powerful money-making machine that used September 11th and other scandals to fill pockets for all of his friends and relatives all along. For not making the vast majority of the world realize this soon enough I salute him, he sure did his homework on deceiving people as far as behind-the-scenes happening was concerned. Moore eventually feels like a highly liberal savior that has a lot of strings to pull as long as we're talking about disgracing president Bush, yet he seems powerless when attempting to "persuade" congressmen to sign their sons and daughters into the army or when the reality line is pulled. His truth about the mishap of 9.11. is highly watchable and persuasive from a democrat's perspective, yet now we the people are smart enough not to see nor only black nor only white. It's always the gray that makes the strongest impact. Yet this one does shift much more into the area of the people that now mourn over the loss of soldiers, sent into harms way for a cause that wasn't all that necessary to begin with. A well made documentary that I predict is going to be remembered as a groundbreaking achievement of campaign persuasion. Unintentional, of course! 8/10</fullReview>

He has become a master at using (opponents would say "misusing") a complete panoply of film technics to drive home his points and urge his audiences to action. These include very selective editing of interviews and news clips; mechanical juxtaposition of images to manufacture the "truth" of a person or event (often to ridicule); commentative music (often to ridicule); and many moore (sic). Non-fiction film can be usefully divided into five categories: Entertainment (like travel films and reality TV), Information (traditional documentary), Instruction (how-to films), Aesthetic experiences (like films of the avant-garde from the 20s &amp; 30s), and Propaganda (like Riefenstahl, Vertov and others). Obviously these can intermix in any one work. A useful analogy to print media: Moore makes editorials, as opposed to news stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie together with another critical viewer and we both - while aware of Moore's tactics and aware of most of the facts beforehand - could not help but shake our heads in disbelief most part through the "documentation". It's simply unbelievable. Is this what you get when you educate a nation via television? The problems lie deeper and Moore fails to touch those since he does not have an answer. However, he does have passion for his cause and he speaks his mind, one would think.I can see how Disney did not want to distribute this documentary, still by their attempts to stop this they just helped Moore push it even more. Make of that what you will, but it really is one documentary no one should miss. I gather Moore goes to some lengths to provide facts on his web site to further prove his "case", a case that concerns all Americans and all world citizens alike.There are of course a lot of Moore typical elements that downgrade this documentary to a soap style, slow moving, propaganda piece, but the moments play with the spectator emotionally and as such can be justified, only that it does not have the desired effect if you as spectator can detach yourself from these scenes, which you should. A documentary should be objective, fact driven and not play with emotions. But then again, Moore is rather emotional when it comes to Bush and Fahrenheit 9/11 shows that at times.Highly recommendable. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Let your Blinkers Get in the Way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much of the debate about this film seems related not to the film itself, but to its politics. I really get the impression that a lot of the people who are so against it haven't yet bothered to see it, or at least weren't able to set aside their blinkers when they did. Scroll down and notice how many of the critical reviews don't mention anything specific about the film, instead attacking Michael Moore's politics and left-wing politics in general. Let's have some facts, not just petty name-calling.And yes, I know Michael Moore doesn't always have the best track record for promoting the 'facts'. But therein lies the key observation about this film: it's not a documentary, it's clearly, obviously and honestly a political polemic. Michael Moore's purpose in this film is not to put across a 'balanced perspective'- he's trying to make a point. It's not a debate, it's an argument, and a very powerful one at that.Then again, the main weakness of this film is that he never seems to decide exactly what his 'point' is, beyond 'we shouldn't have invaded Iraq'. Is he saying that Bush is an incompetent, lazy moron, or is he saying that he's a conniving weasel who schemed to send his country into an unjust war? There are also several periods where the film seems to drag (particularly the section from Sept 11 to the start of the Iraq War).While some have disputed this film's 'facts', it makes some observations far more clearly than I've ever seen in a mainstream US film before. Is it healthy, for example, for the leaders of a country to have such extensive ties with some of the biggest companies in that country, and indeed with leaders of a foreign power? Is it healthy for someone to become President mainly because his father was (the reverse observation of this is why is it so hard for someone from an 'ordinary' person to get anywhere near the top- see biographies of Margaret Thatcher or John Major for how 'ordinary' people can make it in class-ridden Britain, and ask yourself why that doesn't happen in the 'land of the free')? Why did we hear very little about the representatives' challenge to Bush's election? Why did so many people believe the falsehoods about WMDs? And finally, what kind of indecisive fool sits there reading a children's book with a stunned mullet look on his face when he's just been informed that two planes have crashed into the World Trade Centre? A President's job is to make decisions. That was NOT what I call 'strong, decisive leadership'. Even if Michael Moore does show it a little out of context, any half decent politician would have been right out that door. I know this for a fact because I have seen it happen in other (much more minor) situations. Why not this time?All these ideas are covered in the film. It's a powerful, powerful film- where the audience rollercoasters from laughter to tears to outright anger. Even if you don't agree with Moore's politics, try to keep your eyes open and consider the facts objectively. It's really quite disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting... *spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie a few days ago. It was funny and interesting. It presented a lot of facts that has been in the background for quite some time. This film is not based on the whole of reality, it's Moore's opinion. He attacks and makes fun of Bush at almost every turn. And although it is one sided it's interesting to see someone like Moore who is a proud American to reveal things that are shameful to America. So it's a different path to the usual American movies wherein the Americans are the heroes who defeat the evil terrorists. America and its bureaucracy here is the enemy.However I was surprised that i wasn't surprised by this politicking and hidden agendas that Moore revealed. America throughout its history has always been one that looked after itself and colonized or said they will conquer and attack a country for their benefit. I'm from the Philippines and President McKinley at that time announced it as benevolent assimilation but in reality it was to exploit the country and gain military bases. Moore did not explore this aspect in the film. Hopefully this film would lead others to better pursue the subject. i have to also wonder whether this film was created to discredit Bush, Moore is afterall a dedicated Democrat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's best film is his least entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't complain so much about Michael Moore if 1) he wasn't so crummy to people who don't deserve it (I don't mind when he picks on the head of GM or Charlton Heston), and 2) if he didn't have the disturbing ability to insert himself into touching private moments that don't need Michael Moore's presence.Happily, both of these tendencies are mostly absent from Fahrenheit 9/11. Republicans and Democrats take it on the chin, but the "average Americans" are offered up without condescension, a rarity in the past for Moore. (He does get a few cheap shots at small countries like Costa Rica and Iceland, though.)As for my second point above, it might be useful to compare two scenes. In Bowling for Columbine, we get a scene where Moore comforts a woman on camera. The woman needs comforting; Moore is there; he comforts her. But there's something smarmy about the event ... it's not clear why we have to see Moore with his arm around the woman, except to point out that Michael Moore cares. In Fahrenheit 9/11, however, there are several emotional scenes, particularly those with the woman whose son was killed in Iraq. Moore remains mostly off-camera for those scenes ... he lets us see the woman's grief, it's powerful and important to what Moore is trying to say, but he leaves it be, he doesn't insert himself for no reason.As usual, Spinsanity takes on Moore's cavalier attitude towards facts, and there's plenty to kvetch about, but even here, Moore is improving. As Spinsanity notes, the film "appears to be free of the silly and obvious errors that have plagued Moore's past work." They do go on to note that the movie "is filled with a series of deceptive half-truths and carefully phrased insinuations that Moore does not adequately back up," but to be honest, that doesn't bother me much ... I have no objection to Moore the rabblerouser, editing his footage for maximum impact, I just don't like it when he lies. And there would appear to be very few lies in Fahrenheit 9/11.I'd have to say there's some irony in the fact that Fahrenheit 9/11 is Moore's most successful film at the box office, and also the least "entertaining." Perhaps Moore should have been trusting his audience all along to get his arguments, without the cheap stuff. Eight on a scale of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The view from Down Under</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this polemic (not documentary) at a house full preview in Sydney. The movie is particularly interesting to Australians because we were foundation members of the 'coalition of the willing' and our elections are also due in a few months.The first half of Fahrenheit 9/11 is a mixed bag: some worrying but unproven insinuations of inappropriate liaisons in high places, a few laughs and even some boring moments. Hardly deserving of the Palme d'Or. But the final 30 minutes are a powerful indictment of war, not just the war in Iraq. There are scenes of mangled bodies (too graphic for TV) and the wailing of mothers on both sides of the conflict. I found the scene where recruiting officers chatted up unemployed youths in malls of poor neighborhoods particularly poignant (Does this really happen?). Moore uses these scenes and, most tellingly, the words of George Orwell (from the novel, 1984) to expound his thesis ? the victims of war are largely the patriotic poor who fight to preserve the privileges of the rich and powerful. This is a powerful and disturbing message that is hard to refute. 9/10.</fullReview>

Fahrenheit 9/11 goes beyond the headlines that Americans do not normally hear about the America's trouble with Iraq. Innocent civilians and military lives are being lost in Iraq for what? Oil?

		<shortDescription>Important film that shocked me to the bone and needs to be seen by everybody.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't really describe in words what I have in mind right now after seeing this beautiful documentary by Michael Moore. I find it very brave for a filmmaker to go and do such a good job in a documentary that might cost them their own life in a country that claims having freedom above all. I also find it great how Moore manages and expresses his own point of view, while others criticize him for having one. I guess many people cannot handle the truth especially now days. Many of those who criticize this filmmaker's point of view should consider thinking about this movie with an open mind. Just focus on the subject and forget how much you agree or disagree with Moore. How about this film as a documentary? Is it good? Is it bad? So how bad is it? Actually I might disagree about some of the points raised by this movie but that's deep inside my head and it was meant to be raised. You're free to think. It's actually much better if we do think. And to tell you the truth, my life was shocked few hours ago and this shock still affecting me.Ignoring the technical details in my review for now and focusing on the emotional side I got. This documentary kept me interested minute by minute and second by second. I loved the way music was used. I also noticed something else about me there in the dark room (cinema theatre that is), and what I noticed was being touched as a human much more than focusing on the technical stuff as an amateur movie critic. I guess the beauty about Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004) is that it was meant to make us think, feel, raise questions, and mostly know (or get closer to) the truth in a positive way that might change your life.Sometimes it is political and sometimes comic. It's even sentimental few times, but thought provoking after all and trying to stay as close to the absolute real truth as possible. Reminded me of Oliver Stone's daring, brave, great masterpiece that is JFK (1991) in many ways. I note here that both of them had great masterwork of editing using materials which we all surely saw on TV here or there and it involves conspiracy too.In short: Important piece of work that needs to be seen by everybody (despite what MPAA says).10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important, but unfocused film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of Michael Moore's work, and an ardent anti-George W. Bush American, I was obviously looking forward to seeing what Moore had to offer us in `Fahrenheit 911', a film which gives an overview of the 2000 election and war with Iraq. Moore's first two documentaries, `Roger and Me' and `The Big One' largely went under the radar because the `enemy' was essentially Big Business. `Bowling for Columbine' turned him into more of a national figure because he took on a more controversial subject ? and therefore everything he did was viewed with higher scrutiny. `Fahrenheit 911' was proving to be ultra-controversial before it even hit theaters, so based on past criticisms I had heard of his work, and my own reservations, I have to admit that I went into this film with some trepidation.I think with F911, Moore relied more on letting the footage hold its own, which was an overall wise move on his part, based on the subject matter. There are some moments where I knew that there was editing done, but I don't consider that to be duplicitous, or even highly relevant ? what I found refreshing was that the most crucial moments were allowed to speak for themselves, with sometimes frightening and sickening results. (Bush's `7 Minutes' after finding out about the WTC literally made me sick to my stomach) By largely staying away from the spotlight, Moore was able to keep the viewer's eyes on minds on the subject matter, and this was a wise decision. Bush looked inept all on his own, without any help from Moore.F911, however, is not a perfect film by any means. The information and images provided enraged me, but the film was fairly unfocused and therefore I didn't know what to train my rage on. The film started strong, with some lighthearted touches (playing `Vacation' by the Go-Gos while illustrating how long Bush was on vacation during his first months in office was absolutely hilarious) but once we hit the war, Moore showed us some really disturbing imagery and gave the audience some pretty scary figures, except I was still raging over the first act of the film, so I had to compartmentalize my anger and move on. I also was a bit confused over the business transactions between the U.S. and the Arabs; either I was not getting it or it needed to be mapped out a more straightforward manner. I certainly got the gist of it, but all of the links seemed to get blurred a bit. One of the most highly criticized moments of the film, (Moore showing the children of Iraq playing in the streets, etc. before the U.S. bombed) failed to raise a flag for me, however. For anyone who has read Howard Zinn's `A People's History of the United States' there are several ways of telling a story, from all perspectives while still being factual.While its success is not surprising, the magnitude of its success is. I saw this film on opening night in suburban Wisconsin, and the late showing I attended was packed. When the film ended there were whistles, clapping and cheers, and I have heard similar tales from around the country. I'm not so sure that the film is so much superior filmmaking as it is compelling subject matter, but the mix of the two make `Fahrenheit 911' an important film.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but wonderful. See this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is a breathtakingly dramatic and revealing expos into some of the factors and motives which led to the invasion of Iraq, and the consiquences of them.The film is heavily biased against George W. Bush and his administration, but I see that as a positive rather than a negative. They deserve all of it and more. As such however, you won't get the full truth from watching this movie alone, what you will get is the less told side of the story.The filmmakers are guilty of sensationalism, editing for dramatic effect, and presenting facts, opinions and evidence which support their own arguments and opinions in a more favourable light than those that don't. Were they not to do so however, I know I would have been a lot less interested and compelled by it, and it would not have had as much of an impact, both emotional and intellectual, as it did on me.One could easily dismiss the conclusions drawn from such a film on these grounds, but to do so would be missing the point. What's being sold here is basically the truth.Osama Bin Laden was not caught. There were no WMD. Iraq posed no threat. American corporations, some of which are run or owned by the Bush family and the president's staff, stand to make billions in profit as a direct result of the invasion.Bush, his associates and the media companies they own and control are broadcasting their messages 24/7, do yourself and your mind a favour, and take a couple of hours to hear Moore's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if this is a model he can follow in the future, but I hope he can.As a rule, his work is insightful and obstreperous, but undermines his intent by his insistence in being on camera more than he needs to and by being self-righteous at times. In Fahrenheit 9/11, he's on screen minimally, and he lets the real subjects speak for themselves, whether they are people he approves of (some U.S. soldiers in Iraq, some Iraqi citizens, some parents of U.S. soldiers) or people of whom he disapproves (many of the individuals in the George Bush Junior administration). By letting each speak to make their point, the points are stronger.This film works better than The Big One or Roger &amp; Me, though they are original and worthwhile work themselves. I hope Moore makes more films like this, staying behind the camera and letting the facts speak for themselves in front.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Political Cartoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think you can appreciate Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 best by thinking of it as a political cartoon rather than as a documentary or, as Michael Moore himself suggests, an op-ed piece. You don't look for objectivity in a political cartoon. You don't even look for truth. You expect to see the cartoonist's opinion. You expect his opinion to be expressed in extreme hyperbole. The images in a political cartoon are caricatures. They are easily recognizable, but they are not intended to be accurate depictions. So, this is what Fahrenheit 9/11 is: it's a political cartoon, and a very well done one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 is unmistakably a Michael Moore documentary being very similar in style to Bowling for Columbine. The first half of the movie covers Bush's election and the early period of his Presidency and the second half deals with Iraq. It finishes with a wonderful reading from Orwell's "1984". The movie delivers a strong anti-Bush and anti-war message.This movie won't change your opinion if you're already anti-war or pro-war. And you won't learn anything new if you get your news off the Net rather than traditional media. But if you're unsure about the war and you use newspapers and TV for your news then this movie will blow you away. That's who Moore is trying to get at. And he will -- if they see this film.This documentary is exceptionally well made. It's factual (if selective with its facts), fast paced, emotional, engaging and challenging - exactly what a documentary should be. The media's reaction to this movie and the exceptional number of very low ratings on IMDB (from people who - I presume - have not seen this film) sort of proves Moore's point about the one-sided, intolerant nature of modern America.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just brought my brother (not normally knowledgeable or interested in the US) to see F911, and he loved it. The cinema was packed too.One thing they could have done is explain all the major players a bit better - I had to point out who Rummy, Ridge, Cheney, Powell, Dracul- sorry Wolfowitz, Daschle, Rice etc all were at the start. But I concede that most people going to watch this will already have some knowledge of the subject matter. But still...It's splendidly put together too. The guy knows how to put together docutainment...Seems more to do with differences between the haves and the have-nots (or the haves and the have-mores, as Bush says....) than any perceived differences between dems and reps. I loved the recruiting Marines. Those guys were slick....The supposed gaping holes in your coastlines were covered. I refuse to believe that bit is true though. It couldn't be.There were several times that my eyes tended to sort of fill up....it was quite emotional in places.Obviously the WTC attack, which was tastefully portrayed (unlike some recent Bush ads), but also the wailing Iraqi lady, and of course Ms. Lipscombe. When she was getting hassle in front of the White House from some crazy Ann Coulter wannabe who questioned whether she'd lost a son at all, you couldn't not get mad.I can see why someone at Fox New said it was a brilliant piece of work, quite frankly. It's not anti American in any way. It shows soldiers in bad light in some places and pawns in others. Sounds about right.If you're conservative, I can understand you not wanting to see this. It should have you quaking in your boots...If this movie causes a swing as small as a single percentage point, that might make all the difference.I along with Michael, will have my stubby fat little fingers crossed...Besides, I've got ?20 riding on the result, and I've never gambled in my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a British viewer I experience a different film from that which the American audience will. Removing the idea of political impact come the elections, the film stands on its own merits as a view of the poor state of the Bush administration. This is not Bowling for Columbine. Humour is present only in a small number of scenes. Moore himself is largely absent from the scene also. This is a far more serious enterprise. I actually felt too overwhelmed by the maze of facts and would have preferred the film to have a more focused structure.

		<shortDescription>Good, but not a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a little too much Moore polemic in this documentary to make it truly great - especially when you consider his previous track record for making features that are fairly balanced. Early works such as Bowling for Columbine and Roger &amp; Me are great examples of guerilla documentary-making, but at least they show a natural progression which allows the story to be developed by the circumstances that occur during their creation. Who could forget the brutal rabbit slaying in Roger &amp; Me, or Columbine's crippling of K-Mart? What about the final confrontation between NRA member Moore and its president Charlton Heston, which culminated in the previously macho former movie star skulking away in disgrace? These are fantastic scenes that emphasise the importance of each documentary's subject matter.The problem with Farenheit 9/11 is that Moore has already explored many of the themes in his last two books - Stupid White Men and Dude Where's My Country? Add the fact that he's been pretty heavily involved in the preliminary presidential candidate elections and its a recipie for disaster. Instead of informing (or at least giving an unbiased overview of the current state of affairs in the US), Moore continuously strives to implant his own opinions and critiques rather than to take a step back and let his audience decide. There's insinuations aplenty as circumstantial events are cunningly linked together to make arguments and analysis - effectively turning Moore into a commentating historian rather than a craftsman - and although its probably all true, there's very little evidence to back up his claims.All of this doesn't necessarily make Farenheit a particularly bad film, but it certainly doesn't make it a phenomenal one worthy of the coveted Palm D'Or at Cannes. Rather, what we're presented with is a solid 3-star offering that is entertaining, but rarely truly informative. And when you're comparing it to previous work such as Bowling for Columbine, its a bit of a disappointment to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IF MM HAD CALLED THIS MOVIE 'THE BUSH CHRONICLES' WOULD RAY HAVE REACTED THE SAME WAY?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been said about the Shakespeare-purloining ('Something Wicked This Way Comes') author Ray Bradbury's less than enthusiastic reaction to this movie's title. While accusing Moore of 'stealing' his 'Fahrenheit 451' title, the prolific Bradbury surely knows he has no legal legs to stand on. Every professional author knows (or should know) you can't copyright a title. And since Mr. Bradbury never registered his title as a trade name (he probably never thought of marketing a line of 'Fahrenheit 451' firemen action anti-hero figures), he is really staggering on wobbly swamp land with his argument. This leaves him only the last refuge the right-wing scoundrel always likes to try and fall back to when cornered: the moral high ground.Don't misunderestimate me, this doesn't mean Bradbury is a right thinking wingnut just because he doesn't relish a leftie like Michael Moore adapting his novel's name for a political propaganda movie. Even though Ray is on record calling Clinton a 'shithead,' and a pre-911 GW Bush 'wonderful,' I'm still willing to give the guy a break. Anyone who could write such a book as 'Fahrenheit 451' probably has some reservations in the back of his mind somewhere about some aspects of the Patriot Act. At least some. Another reason I don't think Bradbury is a true right-winger, in the Main Street/Wall Street sense, is that he gave a now infamous Paris interview in 1990 to one of those expatriate American (America-hating?) writers in which he said, unequivocally, that there had never been any real totalitarian strain in U.S. history. Ever. The Klan is bad, yes, and misguided politically correct liberals might want to ban 'Huckleberry Finn,' but none of that is any sort of seed ground for fascism or communism (I guess he meant in the European sense of the terms). Nor, despite a professed dislike for tax increases, did he offer up that old 1930s Chamber of Commerce canard about the New Deal being an uncontrollable vine creeping towards socialism. Hopefully he knows the real kudzu from the counterfeit dandelion version. He even said the homeless needed to be taken care of, and AIDS was a problem we could do something about, so obviously he can't be a bona fide bootstraps reactionary. With that in mind, fast forward fourteen more planting seasons, and no matter how angry you are about Florida, no matter what you think of roving wiretaps, enemy combatants, or the military-industrial 'no-bid' complex, if you take Ray at his word, there is no way Bush can be any sort of homegrown Hitler, and the Republicans are not exactly Nazis. I think Ray is right. And for that matter, Michael Moore is too.'Fahrenheit 911' for all its shortcomings as serious PBS style critical documentary, does seem to disabuse such outr 'new' New Left silliness with its own silliness. The Dubya in this movie, and the people surrounding him who do such inexplicable things as sing cheesy original lounge act songs at press conferences, or spit-slick their hair down for quick photo-ops just aren't competent enough to be good Nazis, even if they wanted to be. If they were, Michael Moore would be ash floating out of a chimney by now, or at least bug-eyed senseless from too many concentration camp storm troop sodomy sessions. And the horny 'red state' camp guards would not be making home movies and posting noisy digital pictures of Michael in flagrante delicti on the internet either. No siree, Bob.'Fahrenheit 911' is a wickedly funny movie in the sloppy overzealous collegiate way that all Michael Moore's movies are. The Bush we see here, mangling the language and goofing off with Poppy deep sea fishing, slicing golf balls between off hand comments about evil terrorists, and joking about his 'base' among upper crust donors is no reincarnated ghost of Adolf stalking the nightmares of the ACLU. He is not even a good Chaplin parody. He is a parallax version of what those French types who offered Moore his Palme d'Or at Cannes see: the ultimate 'Ugly American.' Assuming Bush's politics are bad, they represent the worst from American political traditions, not European. A dysfunctional home track trifecta of William Jennings Bryan's washed up religious myopia, William McKinley's missionary imperialism, and Warren Harding's amiable mediocrity and fat cat cronyism (there, at last, is a valid American 'ism). This is the Bush that 'Fahrenheit 911' shows us up front, and should more fully explore. Instead it then just settles for more quick laughs by showing the Bushes, father and son, and their Saudi lackeys doing an endless series of hundred million dollar handshakes over the years, followed by hints at the usual fairly well publicized conspiracies. I'm thinking Ray just didn't like the idea of his philosophical novel turned into that sort of a political burlesque show. The kind of superficial visual agenda marketing device, that God forbid, portends the death of reading itself, just as in the book whose title it debases. If you have ever read 'Fahrenheit 451' you know it's not just about fireman who set fires. It's about a future, written long before Jerry Springer, where the visual and audio media have rendered the printed ones obsolete by dumbing down the populace to the point they no longer care they don't read. A future almost realized. Would you rather watch 'Survivor' or read 'Lord of the Flies?' Would you rather go see 'Fahrenheit 911,' for the shits and giggles, and a rush of adrenaline anger, or sit down and wade through Craig Unger's book, 'House of Bush, House of Saud,' or Kevin Phillips, 'American Dynasty?' A well rounded person might do both, but don't assume most people who go see 'Fahrenheit 911' are that well rounded. Could this be where Ray is coming from? If it is, he may have a bit of a point, though I would not say he's 100% correct. The Bush first half of the movie is really hilarious, and the second half, once it settles into the original footage from Iraq and the home front (and ideas not 'borrowed' from Unger and Phillips) packs some serious thought provoking punch, whether you agree with it or not.Ray is likely no reactionary (even though he says the internet is a 'scam,' and claims never to have driven a car in his life), and may have slightly inflated ideas about his own good writing, but what I can't understand is where was his displeasure back in 1994? That was the year another controversial and wicked political propaganda burlesque show marketed as 'documentary fact' came sneaking into town to prey on the overly impressionable. Jerry Falwell's, 'The Clinton Chronicles.' Okay, so even if Clinton were a 'shithead,' was he also an international drug smuggling kingpin, and Vince Foster's killer? Bill Clinton, in Falwell and his minions' minds, is everything diabolical that a distorted, imagined agenda-driven caricature can be, except perhaps a colonizing, body snatched space alien. Sadly not a word of protest back then from the author of 'The Martian Chronicles.' Shame on you, Mr. Bradbury.</fullReview>

Emotional strings should be manipulated, cute jokes may be made, gimmicky interview tactics are okay, but in the end, I'm sorry to say, this is a cursory hack job. Art this ain't. But I really hope that this mediocre handling of 'facts' that are truly smelly, an administration that is truly smelly, does sway the dazed herd, does somehow affect the apathetic to choose the less smelly of the two candidates. I really hope this thing helps get that guy out, or it really will be "shame on me" for each and every one of us conscious enough to realize it...The Massage, that is, the PR, IS Great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And it's over the fence!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm no stranger to Mr. Moore's film-making. He picks and chooses which pieces of reality to put in his films in order to present his opinion. He's publicly admitted to that. However, I was _floored_ by this work. The money spent on my ticket was repaid in full by the looks of many old-timers walking out of the theater on wobbly pins, with a look of "what have I supported all these years?" on their faces. If you praise or deride the film for bashing Bush, or the Iraq war, take your blinders off. There was a larger scope to this film and here it is:a) Media Biasb) The draft should never have ended.Throughout the film we find ourselves thinking "Hmm, I don't recall seeing THAT on the news," and we're right, a lot of it wasn't. The Orwell quote at the end is a masterful implementation, with the perfect preceding images to fortify its power. To say that he presents the soldier who sings "the roof is on fire" as an analogue to the "rush soldiers get from killing babies" is, well, *^*&amp;ed up. Soldiers were conditioned to place war as fun and games by the government, and there are the fruits of their labors. Grotesque? You betcha. But what else is there to war? It sure isn't the romantic junk they told us it was back in the 19th century!But hey, we can all just go watch Neil "Biased? You damned well bet I am" Cavuto on "Fair and Balanced, We report; You decide" Fox for the real story, right?Take hits at Moore for picking and choosing facts? Go for it, believe me, it's _nothing_ new to pick and choose facts and spin stories on screen in America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mad Bad &amp; Dangerous to Know</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 911 is the best anti-war film I have ever seen. It is both a documentary and propaganda. All documentaries have a point of view and Michael Moore is no shrinking violet when it comes to kicking butt and taking names. Moore's often cringe inducing antics are kept to a minimum and the film is more effective for his absence. When he does show up to try to recruit congressmen's sons to fight the war it is one of the film's finest moments.Is this personal and brutal assault on the Bush administration unfair? Hardly. No position in the country should be looked at with a more critical eye and no one can make the president look more foolish than the president himself. The heavy-handed portrayal of Bush as an idiot initially plays for laughs but the comedy becomes black very quickly as the death toll mounts.It's all so disturbing ? the president's blank stare, the Saudi connection, the black screen as the planes hit the towers, the images of grieving families on both sides of the war. Is it exploitive? Is it manipulative? No more so than the nightly news. The movie explores the economic hardships that lead people to serve in the military. This is hardly uncharted territory. We all know that the poor fight so that the rich don't have to. But knowing this doesn't lessen the impact of seeing US soldiers talking gleefully about killing. They are poor and misled and are fighting others who are equally poor and misled in a war with no purpose and no end in sight. Moore's renegade style is exhilarating. He will stoop to any means necessary to expose hypocrisy and search for truth. If a little knowledge is a dangerous thing than he must be the most dangerous man in the country. This film will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you feel hopeless, helpless and angry. But ultimately, it will make you think and that is it's greatest accomplishment. Someone said that Fahrenheit 911 is Michael Moore's gift to the American people and I agree. In terms of history, what will Bush's gift be?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bowling for Iraq</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part I truly enjoy Michael Moore's coyly sarcastic voice-overs and use of silly music and pop songs to spin his web of opinions about politics and war, but as a documentary film-maker he serves the viewers best when he shuts up and lets those being documented speak for themselves. The segments featuring the patriotic mother from Flint, Michigan grieving over her son's death as a soldier in Iraq are some of the most raw and powerful scenes in any film I have ever seen. And the most damning sequences are when Moore allows George W. Bush and his cohorts to be themselves. No voice-over or commentary is needed. The ignorance and arrogance is overtly apparent. Blazingly one-sided, this is brilliant propaganda film-making by Moore. Unfortunately as a film and documentary I don't think this is a good as his previous effort, "Bowling for Columbine." With that film at least he accomplished something tangible (i.e. getting K-Mart to stop selling a particular type of ammunition). The only thing apparent here is the controversy he drums up. There are some inspired moments, like when he attempts to get members of Congress to enlist their sons and daughters in the military to help fight the war in Iraq or when he drives around Capital Hill with a bull-horn reciting the Patriot Act. But most of it seems like taunting, and Moore is too well known now to get away with some of the things he used to get away with years before. Again, the film works best when it shows raw footage of Iraqis and American soldiers at the forefront of the theater of war and then juxtaposes them with scenes of rich Saudi Arabians and Bush and his friends far away from the strife. Like usual, Moore preaches to the converted. He puts together pieces of a puzzle most liberals already had a pretty good notion of. I just hope this film incites the liberals as much as it does the other side, so that we might finally stand up for our liberal ideals and take back this country. War is hell, and so is political discourse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my Favorite Moore Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say I liked this movie. I'm a fan of Michael Moore - I think his film Bowling for Columbine is the most amazing, touching, well-done documentary I've ever seen. But this was lacking something for me. Maybe because I feel as if he was very biased to the liberal side, much more so than I expected. He uses all this crappy heart-wrenching music during sad parts that made me think of CBS news. UGH. I didn't fall for that, but a lot of people there did I'm sure.My theater was full of rich white people, which because I live in the DC Metro area, isn't very surprising. I even had to stand in line to see it! I haven't had to stand in line to see a movie since Star Wars. And I was even seeing this on a Monday night (both theaters sold out)! So I was expecting to be blown away, and most of the audience was blown away I think. There was cheering and clapping at the end of the film, but I feel like all those liberal richies were just there so they would have something to talk about at tea tomorrow. Since I've been in the military, it was more a painful movie for me. When I saw the scenes with the guys with the blown off limbs doing rehab at Walter Reed, I thought about my patients at Bethesda Naval. It's a sad, sad thing war. Moore does capture that feeling and makes sure he gives props to the troops and he does show the reality of being there in Iraq.And when you see Dick Cheney's former company and the Bush family making a huge fortune from the war, it makes you sick. Yet I felt manipulated in this movie, like I was really not getting a complete picture. I am a democrat, I won't vote for Bush, but this movie didn't decide that for me. See it if you want, but don't let it decide your vote!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What GWB Fears The Most</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie last weekend and it is excellent. Yes, this is a Bush bashing movie with well supported evidence. From a political perspective, this movie will put the final nail on Bush's coffin for any chance of being re-elected. This movie is so powerful and detrimental to the Bush administration. For those of you who think that this movie will not pull Republicans to vote for John Kerry, I guess you are missing the point. Michael Moore is not after the die-hard Republican supporters like Bush's twin daughters changing their minds to vote for a Democrat, but those who are still indecisive. In the last election, Bush won by a narrow margin. If the Republicans and the Democrats each have 35% of core supporters, there are still 30% voters who can go either way. This movie will definitely help pulling most of the 30% toward voting for a Democrat or non-Republican party. I would agree that most MM's findings are well supported. For instance, on that (9/11) dreadful day, Bush was on his way to visit an elementary school in Florida. Even before he set his feet inside the school, he was informed that one of the twin towers was already being hit by a commercial airplane. In any case he still went through with the photo op as MM would call it. He was sitting there and reading along with the first graders. Shortly thereafter, one of his secret services told him the second tower was hit and yet for seven minutes, he just sat there probably stunned and continued reading "My Pet Goat". Ask yourself this question, is this a sign of a great leader to lead our country for another four years. Watching that scene pretty much spells out the leadership skills of G.W. Bush if there is any to begin with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Film That Ties Things Together for the Uninformed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although, I dislike the Bush administration immensely, I didn't think this was the most brilliant film ever. It's a good film (not completely brilliant or deep, and sometimes disingenuous, but good). Michael Moore tugs on the heartstrings nicely. He represents his point of view and conveys information in a sensational-enough way that it actually wakes some people from their brain-dead slumber. Apparently it takes a sledge-hammer to wake many people up.Facts are overstated and skewed (such as the implication that many of the Bin Laden relatives are encouraging Osama to commit terrorist acts against the US). He implies a number of things that aren't completely factual--often deceptively and manipulatively. At the same time, most of the "hard facts" he reports in the movie are taken from public sources such as government reports, newspapers, and investigative journalists. Things such as the amount that the Bushes make from their Saudi oil connections vs. the presidential pay are well documented. The movie is a mixture of exaggerated implications along with well-established facts. It can be a frustrating mixture since the sometimes misleading implications and character assassination will probably make some people doubt even the well-established facts. It becomes difficult for viewers to sort things out for themselves if they haven't been diligent in following the news for the past three years from an in-depth source. Hint: 30 minute newscasts with 8 minutes of ads are NOT in-depth (especially with all those dippy human-interest stories, along with sports and weather taking up half of those 22 minutes).Ultimately, the movie's problems are also its strengths at the box office. It's often simplistic, misleading and sensational, but demands attention through its insistence, humor, and shock value. Moore has correctly figured out that many people won't pay attention unless they're given something shocking, big and outrageous. He delivers something that is a product of its times and meets people on their level: simplified, entertaining, manipulative, emotional, gripping and incendiary. I don't like the "dumbing down" aspects of the movie--but it's really nothing new. Fox News and Rush Limbaugh have been using these exact same techniques for years. For instance, people such as Rush Limbaugh did things such as implying that Bill Clinton had one of his friends killed when it was well-established that the friend committed suicide because of intense pressures and depression. Some of the attacks on Bush are similarly unfounded and speculative. Moore has figured out the antics of the conservative propaganda machine and beat them at their own game. He's fighting fire with fire. It's unfortunate that many of these tactics aren't always particularly honest, are divisive, and encourage emotion, rhetoric, and speculation more than rational thought or responsibility.Perhaps for me the thing this movie does best is to summarize the very troubling aspects of the Bush administration for those who weren't bothering to pay any attention. Even despite the bias (or maybe because of it), this movie will probably wake some people up who were too busy rallying around the flag to pay any attention to what was actually happening. Even with the bias, Fahrenheit 9/11 will stir up issues and ensure that they're talked about rather than swept under the rug. Maybe this movie will even have a part in being sure that government and big business are held responsible for their acts or deception and irresponsibility if even some of the allegations it makes are shown to be true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth is out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary will spark two polar opposite kind of reviews. Republicans who dismiss it as all lies and propaganda (whether they've seen the movie or not), and Democrats who will say everything in it is fact and it exposes Bush for what he is (whether they've seen it or not).The biggest criticism is that Michael Moore has an agenda. Yeah he does, but that doesn't mean he's lying. An extreme example would be if someone made a documentary about Hitler that was very anti-Hitler. That doesn't mean the documentary filmmaker lied about the concentration camps.No matter what, one good thing that will come out of this movie is that it will open up debate, and people will hopefully open up their eyes and see the truth that is out there, not just what is told to them. I've always been like that, and I can't understand why everybody else isn't the same way. When Clinton said he didn't have sex with Lowinski, I was interview by CNN as a man on the street interview, and I said Clinton lied, and that there would be an impeachment hearing. Everyone thought I was crazy, and that's exactly what happened. Bush gives this really weak excuse as to why we're going to war with Iraq, weapons of mass destruction. Give me a break! I didn't believe it for a second! To anyone who did, I have a deed to the Brooklyn Bridge I'd like to sell to you.Oh yeah, and another criticism of Moore is that he's exploiting 9/11 to make money. What documentary or news show doesn't try to make money?One thing I think this documentary lacked was giving the reasons why these foreign countries hate us. You kind of got a feel for that when they show Iraqi people crying and yelling that their uncle's house just got blown up or the girl next door just got shot or whatever. The movie should have focused on the incompetent US foreign policy that led up to 9/11, and less time devoted to making Bush look like a clown (which apparently isn't difficult).No matter how this film is viewed, it is a landmark documentary. What other documentary is number one at the box office during the summer. Blair Witch doesn't count! :)Also, Moore could become a back to back winner of the Oscar for Best Documentary. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>message may be lost on many</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you saw this movie and came away with merely the notion that Bush stole the presidency and is an idiot - did you really need to see the movie? I'm confused with the backlash saying that the movie is untrue and shockingly full of deceit. The film doesn't really contain much information that we didn't already know (Cheney is an oil baron out for profit, Bush is an idiot who waged war with Iraq instead of the probably more guilty sects of Saudis) - it just weaves it into a coherent whole.I think the finest contribution seems to have been lost on many - if the chuckles and applause given by the audience viewing it with me is any indication. I felt the film to be very somber, sad, and made me feel very ashamed. I think that Moore's greatest accomplishment with this film is his overall message:Similar to Vietnam, many young, poor men and women without benefit of college education and the philosophical and intellectual "prowess" we feel we possess... "doers", not "thinkers"... are making the ultimate sacrifice to stand up and volunteer to fight a war against the people that their government, the people that are supposed to "think" on their behalf, tell them is to blame for a tragedy. While we in the affluent suburbs and ivory tower talk, talk, talk about how the war is unjust and so forth (and how the movie is or isn't biased), thousands of American youth who have been given next to nothing are giving us everything by going off to die when the president tells them there is a battle to be fought. Moore's central point is that when the president makes a mistake (honest or for profit) about this battle, then the bravery and 'stand-up' attitude of these soldiers is in vain, and that is a terribly disturbing thing.For those who feel Moore "exploited" a mother of a fallen soldier - would'nt it have been irresponsible to have turned a deaf ear to this woman? Her son was one of the "doers" who went off to fight the president's battle while you complain about his film-making. Shouldn't she have her opportunity to comment on that? Bush has yet to attend a funeral for his soldiers. Somebody needs to pay homage to the tremendous sacrifice they are making. To chalk this up to propaganda is to miss the point - these kids are brave heroes fighting for what they are told is an important battle, they deserve recognition and - if the war is against the wrong enemy as Moore suggests - an apology. I think that Moore did everything he could to recognize the real heart of the issue - the sacrifices made by America's youth in this war. To sit comfortably and talk about it being slanted or Anti-Bush, or to merely laugh at Bush's slips of the tongue, is to have missed out on an important message.Personally - I find it ironic that so many people are shocked at what the Bush administration has done... and am angered at the laughter they throw at Bush (would you laugh at Hitler if he mispronounced simple words?). What did you expect when an oil tycoon that had never held public office was running mate for the sun of a Bush who had only been Governor? The fact that the presidency was stolen is moot - it should've never been anywhere near that close. Now we've got a president out for vendetta and oil profits, and we laugh at him. Kind of got the cart before the horse, don't we?</fullReview>

I believe they were doing what they thought was right, but made tremendously bad decisions in the process. Does that excuse them for the damage they have caused? No, and in my opinion, it would be dangerous to re-elect someone who has made such obvious and disastrous mistakes. Whatever you believe, don't discount or embrace this film 100%.

		<fullReview>Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, there are two scenes that need to be seen in this film. No one need go further than the scene of the Iraqi woman cursing the U.S. after her uncle's house is destroyed to understand the depth of hatred that many in the Arab world hold toward the U.S. No one need go further than Mrs. Lipscomb's grief to understand the evil of war. Even if you're very conservative, isn't it a fair question to ask why so many of us are wondering why we haven't seen these scenes before?To dismiss this film as mindless propaganda has and will be done, as we can see in many reviews here. Moore makes a characteristic mistake when he depicts a carefree Iraq prior to the war. Mournful, tragic music accompanies the electoral house proceedings - there is no real attempt at objectivity here or in many other scenes in this movie. At times Moore definitely risks getting ponderous, as in his statement that abuse perpetrated on Iraqi prisoners is a direct result of the immorality of Bush's administration.Let's face it, there are a lot of people out there who feel the same Britney Spears. They will not be fazed by Moore's film. But be it marketing forces, mere curiosity, or some kind of mass psychological wish fulfillment on the part of a bunch of liberals, this movie's success at the box office is a good sign. It shows interest in an alternative opinion, suggests people are interested in politics. I feel it does raise valid questions that Bush can't ignore. As I walked out of the theater in predominantly Republican Utah and saw the long line of people I was grateful that we live in a country where divergent opinions can still be heard. Those who would silence Michael Moore or brand him a traitor and betrayer of "American values" should be ashamed of themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less Moore is Indeed Better in Fahrenheit 9/11</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a nod to Ray Bradbury, this is an intriguing title, Fahrenheit 9/11, by infamous documentarian Michael Moore (Bowling for Columbine) concerning the failures of and the misconceptions promoted by the President George Bush's current administration for potential power and profit at the cost of lives and trust. Winner of the Golden Palm in the Cannes Film Festival, it is also a film about raising fears in this country to create an environment to promote a larger agenda, namely to ratchet up the war machine. As suggested by George Orwell, the government can tell the masses that war is good for the economy and that any piece of propaganda is good for the people no matter how wrong. You've got to hand it to Moore-he is a man of conviction even though he was despised and ridiculed at last year's Oscar ceremonies for blasting President Bush's administration. At the time (as he admitted on a recent David Letterman show) he claimed that George Bush had put the country into a war for false reasons even though Moore himself had not real proof of that assertion. Fast-forward several months to Moore's thesis which now has him looking prescient. He starts the film with questionable election results that has key Bush supporters among the decision makers ruling on the election results. He methodically sets up the background that leads to the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the circumstances, which lead to the War in Iraq. The doc focuses heavily on the questionable financial relationships of President Bush and Saudi Arabia. It is astounding how much money the Saudis have invested in our economy. (See a suspense film from the 1980's called Rollover starring Jane Fonda for an interesting take on this very subject.) Since most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudis and the Saudi government dragged its heels after the Trade Center attack, you almost get the notion that everybody is in bed together in an unholy alliance.Moore does have a gift of irony and a talent for writing comedic material. In fact, he does have his moments at the expense of officials who are made to look foolish including President Bush. This is a film where Moore limits his actual onscreen participation for antics, which is a good thing. He still does have the last laugh towards the end by attempting to recruit members of congress to have their sons and daughters enlist for the War in Iraq. When America goes to war in Iraq, it seems to be a culmination of events that were predestined even though there was no actual proof of Iraq's connection to 9/11, but there is money in those oil fields. The war footage of victims and families is intense and the interviews with American soldiers are dumbfounding. The images of Christmas in Iraq as an American military unit goes on a mission to invade a local home as Christmas music plays are almost surrealistic.You know Moore's heart feels for his hometown of Flint, Michigan, where the devastating events as depicted in his earlier breakout hit, Roger and Me, are still being felt especially in the extremely high unemployment of its youth. To make matters worse, the only hope of salvation is to join the military, and recruiters are shown swooping down on prime pickings-Moore's point is that the ones who are the poorest and desperate are the ones who go fight and die and for reasons that may be falsehoods. Nowhere is this more evident than when a patriotic mother of a son fighting in the war learns through his letters of his bitterness about the reasons for being in Iraq. What's worse is that he dies and her sadness and idealism turn harsh and angry. It is a truly difficult sequence in the film. Bush-bashers will revel in this film and Bush-supporters will be incensed. The ones who are sitting on the fence will fall off and likely not the way George Bush would want. Moore has produced a searing indictment of the current president's family and top-level staff that is sure to weigh heavily in the upcoming elections. It is probably the most powerful propaganda film that was perfectly timed for November 2. Oliver Stone must be chuckling somewhere.Disney helped finance the film and decided not to release it so Moore quickly secured distribution from Lions Gate. Could it be because of Disney's family image or the fact that their tax favored status in Florida governed by Jeb Bush have anything to do with that? Moore will probably be recognized come Oscar time unless there is a plot to keep him from the stage this time. Yet, with this admittedly biased piece of bravura filmmaking, which is his best to date, and a growing groundswell of support, how can anyone stop this juggernaut?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore: Diva</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I went into the theater initially agreeing with Mr. Moore's point of view, his movie made me understand clearly why everybody hates liberals.While more than thirty minutes of the movie were dedicated to childish name-calling, describing why everyone in Europe, America, and the Bush Administration is stupid, the majority of the film attempted to be a touching and sincere. This, however, was made difficult by Moore's constantly-sarcastic narration, Kubrickian music selections, and hypocrisy (such as the making fun of the the troops during one segment, and then the total support of them in the next.)Moore claims that George Bush used the media to create an ever-present fear in America by exploiting Americans' ignorance. This, of course, is true, but when Moore uses similar tactics to woo his audience, he looks no better than Bush. I was personally offended that, when Moore discussed how the "willing coalition" of other countries had no armies, he used a clip from a certain famous film (Nosferatu, 1922, Germany) to make fun of ... Romania? Banking on the fact that few Americans would know the history of this film, Moore used a very famous movie for a cheap laugh ... something that his movie seems to be arguing against.Moore declined to mention or include the valid arguments against war made by the UN, especially Germany and France. Although, had he included them, he probably would have included xenophobic comments about those countries as well.The film, though discussing history, was very one sided, and any true historian knows that in order to prove one side superior, one must show why the other side is wrong. Moore did not achieve that, and I was left feeling that his "opinionated piece" was nothing more than a temper-tantrum to get back at those who did not appreciate his Oscar speech.6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A slightly less subjective documentary from Michael Moore finds the filmmaker's totally justifiable rage at Bush II being vented. Moore decided to back off on this one and let the subject speak for itself, although some of his own narration I think weakens the effort. The blaring gaffes of the Bush administration do not need any accompaniment to be utterly shocking. Nothing in the film was so "un-American" that it couldn't have been said in the pages of the New York Times, from the disillusionment of the troops in Iraq to the incestuous Halliburton-Cheney relationship. Moore does not overtly extrapolate the problems presented into any kind of class analysis, which I believe is absolutely essential in any critique of the oppression and exploitation which is exemplified here. However, there are a few guarded attempts to recognize the class issue, as when Moore stops back in his hometown and lets the oppressed, subordinated, and underprivileged people in Flint, Michigan question the rationale of fighting a war in Iraq when there is a very real war being waged on the poor of the United States. Also, there was the very powerful statement by a corporal who declared he would rather face prison time than to go back to Iraq to "kill more poor people." In this statement, all debate about the war is reasonably, succinctly settled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually, I tend to like documentaries. But I've never gone to see one in a theater until Farenheit 9/11.It made me laugh; it made me angry. But it also made me shake my head a bit with its liberal use of cheap shots, (pardon the pun). It was a bit too preachy, and it is clearly a movie that the bleeding hearts can rally around, especially those who continue to believe the poor black folk are still being trodden upon.Still, I liked it overall. It made a comment that needed to be made. And it made it quite effectively. After seeing this film, I don't know how anyone could vote to re-elect Bush. I voted for him in 2000; I won't make that mistake again.Micahel Moore knows how to get his points across. He uses humor, biting satire, and dramatic sequences. The worst part about the movie for me was that it had far too much maudlin footage of crying mothers who had lost a son in Iraq. Yeah, I know it's sad to have to bury a son or daughter, but I don't need to pay good money to sit in a seat at the theater and watch some lady bellow on and on about it.That said, I would highly recommend watching this film. It's a documentary everyone should see. I gave it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 is a cinematic bullet aimed at the administration of George W. Bush, and at the heart of the war in Iraq. By turns acidly funny, shocking and heart-wrenching, Moore's two hour op/ed piece challenges the legitimacy and qualifications of Bush, as well as the legitimacy and motivations behind America's most divisive conflict since Vietnam.Moore has an obvious agenda and vivid viewpoint. This movie is not a 'fair and balanced' look at its subject matter, and never claims to be. Its point is made as clearly as if it were shouted through a bullhorn: George W. Bush, a president of uncertain ability and dubious ties, led the United States into an unnecessary war against a foe that posed no real threat. 'Why did he do this?' the film asks. 'Why do the family and business associates of those in power benefit the most, financially and in terms of influence, from their connections to this struggle? How have these links been used to further a pro-war agenda? Who is being protected from public scrutiny and why? What dark secrets lie behind the administration's public face of clear-eyed resolve?'All these questions, and many more, are addressed in Moore's trademark style, mixing sarcastic smart aleck, zany comedian, clever investigator, muckraking gadfly, insightful humanist, and intense political firebrand.There are few new accusations here. Most of these same points have been raised separately and in lesser combination many times before on television, in the nation's op/ed pages, in political think-tank analyzes, in dozens of books on all sides of the debate, and in the digital halls of the Internet. But never before has one side of the debate brought so much of the evidence together into such a ferocious and powerful statement of purpose.'People of America,' the clear subtext shouts, 'you've been had! Ray Charles could have seen the underlying truth! You've been manipulated into supporting a war based on lies, half-truths and political expedience, with a generous helping of greed slathered on top!'The movie features hilarity and screwy humor aplenty (witness the montage of Bush taking off the entire month of August 2001: golfing, fishing, playing with his dog, barbecuing, and boating, all set to the backing track of The Go-Gos 'Vacation'). But there is also a deep and abiding anger, directed mostly at those who walk the highest halls of power. Knowing that it does not portray itself as journalistically objective reportage helps one keep perspective on the film strengths and shortcomings.Whatever those are, no one who sees this film will soon forget Lila Lipscomb. A working-class mother from a strongly military Michigan family, her son Ben is sent to Iraq as a Black Hawk helicopter crewman. She speaks to Moore in her kitchen about the worry of her eldest child being in such distant, hostile place, and how she 'always hated' anti-war protesters. This self-described 'conservative Democrat' tells of her patriotism and pride as she hangs the American flag on the front of her house (careful not to let it touch the ground), as she's done every day since her daughter served in Iraq during the first Gulf War. She talks movingly about the economic and social ills of such blighted towns as Flint, Michigan, where she runs an employment assistance center for the disadvantaged.But Lila's worried loyalty to her country is transformed to disenchanted, confused pain when she is informed that her son has died in an attack on his helicopter. Surrounded by her solemn family, she heart-breakingly recounts receiving the fateful phone call from the Army, and its terrible aftermath. She breaks down in sobs as she reads Ben's final letter home, received a week before his death. Her sorrow unearths questions that had before lain hidden, and she is driven by a need to understand why her son died, and on what altar he was sacrificed.Lila makes a pilgrimage to Washington to stand before the White House, the place where the decisions were made that led to her loss. As she speaks to a lone protester with a display of Iraq war images, a woman rushes into the frame. 'This is all staged,' she repeats with skepticism and ill-concealed contempt. Lila tells the woman that her son was killed in Iraq and the woman, unbelieving, challenges her. 'Where was he killed?' she asks. 'Where was he killed?' In a voice shaking with grief and suppressed fury, Lila answers 'In Karbala. On April 2nd.' The intruder simply stares, recognizing Lila's heartache, struck speechless by her passion and sincerity. The moment transcends the film's agenda, the terrible human cost to the families of the fallen eloquently overshadowing our national debate on Iraq.This window on a mother's mourning provides Fahrenheit 9/11's most compelling and poignant scenes. Lila Lipscomb's grief is gut-wrenching and her pain transfixes the heart. It lends the film undeniable tragic weight.Other sections are less successful. Much of Moore's tracing of links between President Bush's family, the terrorist-tolerating Saudi royals, and the bin Laden family comes off as a dry recitation of obscure connections and suspicious conjecture. While many of his uncomfortable questions deserve better answers than we've previously gotten, Moore consistently suggests a 'worst-case scenario' point of view. Perhaps some of the ties he makes are mere coincidence and happenstance, but realistically, can they all be?Moore sarcastically lists the 'Coalition of the Willing,' countries that supported our Iraq invasion, with hilariously appropriate film snippets ('Romania' is accompanied by a grainy shot of Nosferatu rising from his coffin; 'The Netherlands' rates footage of a young man taking a huge hit of dope; 'Iceland' is backed by the black and white images of Viking reavers). But the list tellingly omits Great Britain, Italy and Spain. He obviously thought including them would lend the coalition more legitimacy than he is willing to give it.Moore wisely stays off camera for the greatest part of the film, allowing his images, culled news footage, and cleverly chosen backing music to do much of the speaking for him. The grandstanding antics of his previous work are kept to a bare minimum here, and are all the more effective because of this. Armed with military recruiting brochures and enlistment forms, he stops Congressmen on the street, trying to get them to sign their own children up to serve in Iraq (according to Moore, only one of the hundreds of Congressional children are stationed there). One listens to him cordially while he makes his pitch; others either ignore him or actually flee. None of them sign the forms. Another gimmick finds him driving an ice cream truck around the legislature, reading the text of the Patriot Act through a loudspeaker. Representatives admit on camera that the labyrinthine bill was hurriedly proposed in the middle of the night and was voted in with little debate the next day, before most had the opportunity to actually read it. Many later regret their lockstep acceptance. This throws a stark spotlight on the old adage 'Legislate in haste, repent at leisure.'Moore engages in cheap shots at the expense of our leaders, some all the more effective because they are only partially unfair. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz looks particularly Gollum-like spit-combing his hair into place prior to a television appearance. Vice-president Cheney is portrayed as a zealot unconcerned with inconvenient facts. National Security Adviser Rice comes off as an intellectually dishonest apologist for the president's policies. John Ashcroft is painted as a political failure, rescued from deserved obscurity (after having lost a US Senate reelection bid to a dead man) when Bush appointed him as Attorney General.But the brunt of the ridicule is saved for the president himself. Bush goofily mugs at off-screen colleagues just seconds before announcing our invasion of Iraq to the nation. He painfully stumbles through extemporaneous remarks to the public. On a golf course, he speaks to the press about weighty matters, and then clashingly switches gears, telling them all 'Now watch this drive.' He gets all of the ball, but his good old boy hominess belies the seriousness of the subject matter.The president has made numerous ill-considered statements about Iraq, and Moore lets few of them go quietly. Bush, speaking to a very well-heeled crowd, calls them 'the haves and the have-mores. Some would call you the elite,' he smirks, 'I like to call you my base.' In the face of contrary evidence, he repeatedly ties Iraq to al Qaeda in speech after speech (to the effect that, in August of 2003, a full 70% of those polled falsely believed that Iraq was behind the September 11th attacks). He unwisely jokes on camera that running the country would be much easier if America were a dictatorship. In addresses to military personnel, Bush touts their courage and the nation's gratitude for their service, all the while (as Moore cannily points out) proposing cuts in their hazard pay, family assistance and veterans' services.Michael Moore's stated intent with Fahrenheit 9/11 is to affect the outcome of the presidential election in November. Whether he has succeeded remains to be seen, but in the meantime, he will have at least sparked further debate, inspired more pointed questions, and touched the souls of all but the most hardened. He may even, with this potent juggernaut, have changed some fence-sitting minds.There will be many who disagree with this movie and want it suppressed (the right-wing group Move America Forward has organized massive letter-writing campaigns and protests to discourage theaters from showing it; the White House Communications director ironically stated 'This is a film that doesn't require us to actually view it to know it's filled with factual inaccuracies.') Those Americans with less-pressing responsibilities will be well-advised to see Fahrenheit 9/11. Regardless of political leanings, it has much meaningful content to be considered.All the vitriol (and there is plenty to go around) aside, this is an important film that cannot simply be ignored and dismissed out of hand. Cut off from the social and political turmoil this war has spawned, it would not be nearly as effective (which is why this film is unlikely to age well as a cinematic work). But falling as it does at the very height of the Iraq war's increasingly polarized and decreasingly civil debate, it strikes with the power of lightning. And, as they leave the theater, it resonates like thunder in the hearts and minds of the audience. What filmmaker could ask for more?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too much new news in the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Fahrenheit 9/11, well, it was Michael Moore. Michael Moore being himself. Of showing things in a way that is synonymous with his movies - in a blunt, whimsical, unflattering, straight forward, viewed manner. At times being so powerful that you can't even hear a person breathe in the theater, to moments of satirical showing of characters, incidents that leads you to laugh at it's absurdity while also shaking your head at the truth of it also.To me, a regular follower of the news, nothing in the film was really of new news to me. The extent of the Bush, Saudi Arabian ties was more involved and more indepthly covered than what I knew, so that was a little more info learned and gained. Plus, Moore's angle of things post 9/11 of really being more for the sake of big money... sure that is and has always been said and accused of being a motive in all the crap that he and his administration were only doing the things in Afghanistan and Iraq... but, some part of you, or at least me, just really didn't want to believe that it was true, because of it's obvious blatant selfishness and the complete wrongness of it all. That people would honestly do all that they have done to just serve their and their close ties and friends bests interests. I never really wanted to go that far, and believe it. After watching the movie though, making me sadly question it as being so even more though. Just too many coincidences and circumstances where someone, somewhere in connection with the Bush family, or with Cheney, is somehow benefited from and helped from the actions taken. And that is more horrifying then to think about. That these few, to just fill their own coffers and scratch the backs of each other, led this country, it's people, as well as the world down the path that we are now on, just so they could reap the rewards of of war.... it chills one to the core. And makes me even more afraid of this administration than I already was of them. Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.Other than that, nothing else was new news that was already well known already. Though, I don't know how the hell I didn't know this - but was completely unaware of Bush's motorcade to his inauguration being egged and protested.. how the hell did I not know that that happened at all?! I am think because since I did not want him elected at all, and thought his being so was all completely wrong and unjust in the first place, that I naturally had no cause or care to see this loser officially become the leader of this country, and tuned that whole period out. But, seeing that egging and protest of a man who is just going to be officially announced and made President Of The United States - how clear signal of a sign that the next years ahead were not going to be good!?Another disheartening part of the movie, being our county's military going and seeking out only the poorest of the poor, those whose futures are limited, who live in the economic low end parts of this country's cities and communities, and promoting them to sign up for the military and to go over and fight in this country's unjust wars. Sugar coating and stretching the truth a very great deal to the point of breaking, in all that the military can do and help them to do and achieve. The military being the only getting out means available to them for possibly getting a college education, of potentially making something for themselves and their lives. Mr. Moore keenly insightful in his observation that those who receive and have the less in this country are always the ones to take up and fight for that system and country that is not there for them, but for only the haves (or the Have Mores - Bush's base).The most powerful moments of the film, being a couple minutes of blackness on the screen, where you just here the audio of the planes crashing into the World Trade Center Towers, and of people reacting to it. Just the sounds, you didn't need to see and revisit those images, they are forever ingrained in our memories, but, just hearing the sounds against the blackness of the screen, letting our own memories fill in the rest... choked one's heart again. Reminded me of the most powerfully felt moments of Moore's Bowling For Columbine, where you just have these visuals of security cameras in the school, and the audio of these 9/11 calls from the kids inside the school, these young kids, the horror in their young voices, what they were seeing, what was going on in front of their young eyes from one of their own... moments that don't need anything more....Another, is the woman Mrs. Lipscombe, the following of her from being a god fearing, America loving, flag waving American and proud mother of military service people, who used to be angered at those who protested the war.... following her story to the end, brought tears to my eyes, her genuine felt pain and loss of just this one woman, of the hundreds and thousands of other women and men who have paid because of all of the actions of this administration... your heart breaks and weeps. And the most powerful thing of the movie, is her own words at the end, when she goes to Washington DC, and is standing in front of 1600 Pennsyvania Avenue and she says that she says that it is a freeing thing to have come there, because now she has a place to place all her anger at and on - the White House. How compelling is that?! That even a die hard, proud to be American looks at the building that houses the leaders of this country and professes such strong ill feelings and hurt towards it and what it represents! Now think of the countless hundreds of thousands, millions around the world who feel that towards our country....One thing that has been with me even before Bush was elected, was that that man has got to be gotten out of office, have said and felt that for the past four years, and this film just, if was even possible, solidified that feeling and knowing even more. He has set this country and the world down a very dark and dangerous path, that we will all pay for in the generation to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore's film exploits the media, the government and the American citizen. He makes no effort to hide his agenda. Michael Moore is a raving liberal, and has made millions of dollars by being a loud, obnoxious, in-your-face bully. I have been, and always will be, a registered Republican... who just happened to be an absentee voter from Palm Beach County, Florida during the 2000 Presidential Election... and I felt compelled to drag myself to see Fahrenheit 9/11 opening weekend simply to enjoy the frenzy of political and emotional citizens, be it Democrat or Republican, stuck in a room together for a running time of 2 hours. I consider myself to be open minded, but opinionated when it comes to the current "State of the Nation." This movie is POWERFUL. This movie is THOUGHT PROVOKING. This movie is GRAPHIC, SHOCKING, and BLATANT. When the credits rolled at the end, and some audience members were giving their standing ovation (some because they loved it, some because it was finally over), I realized my hands were clammy and shaking, and I felt nauseous. I had been so intently watching the explosion of information that I had become physically affected by it. I have no personal agenda in writing these comments, but I would like to suggest to each and every American... even if you HATE everything about politics and what they stand for... please go see this film. This movie is going to change the future of our country, and it's important to be educated about what is going on with our leaders, citizens, allies and enemies. Michael Moore is out to make a point, so he presents information from his perspective. He is a biased and highly skilled at "double-speak." He knows how to manipulate information to try and trick his audience. He may even assume that the average viewer is uninformed, and wants them to agree with him in the end. I'm smart enough to know that... so I was able to view it from a relatively unbiased point of view. There are some very important TRUTHS to SOME of the content of this film. I noticed that any segment WITHOUT a voice over (narration) was extremely interesting and eye opening, even genuine. Moore works closely with a Michigan woman who's son was sent to Iraq. As the film progresses, this woman's life is torn to pieces, and she changes her tune. She began by being pro-war, pro-government, pro-welfare, pro-everything... and ends up crying hysterically at the gates of the White House because she is over come with grief about the senseless death of her first born son, when his Black Hawk chopper was shot down in Iraq. These are the moments that redeem this film. For every biased comment Moore makes... he does allow people to speak on their own. He uses quick editing to get his point across... and takes MANY things out of context. He even tries to convince the audience that every U.S. solider in Iraq is an ignorant, pre-pubscent, psychopathic murderer. So, if you can handle an intense viewing experience, I'd advise you to go ahead, watch the movie, give Moore his paycheck, but please make up your mind on your own. Debate it with your friends and family, do whatever you need to, but please make a decision based on how you feel afterwards. If it shakes you, then tell some one. If you love it, tell some one. Get the word out... because this is how American citizens can make a difference. Get involved, and cast your vote in the upcoming 2004 Presidential Election.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a movie for our time that all should see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The artistic value of this film has been acclaimed by the judges at Cannes and elsewhere, though I have read at least one commentary challenging the factual accuracy of the film. Even Moore says "It's just a movie." But a thought provoking film it is.Anyone willing to view the film with an open mind, regardless of his or her political leanings, cannot help but ask some serious questions. Given the plethora of books about the Bush administration, including a few from folks formerly part of the administration, we should all be asking some serious questions. Moore does so poignantly.The words of a wounded soldier who is switching his registration from Republican to Democrat because of the Iraq war. The tears of an Iraqi woman at the loss of family and friends. And the testimony of a patriotic Mom in Flint, Michigan, who lost her son in Iraq must touch even the hardest of hearts. The fact that the right has sought to prohibit to movie's release says something about its power.One may or may not respond to Moore in his grizzled beard and baseball cap, but there are enough questions raised that one at minimum will hopefully seek answers.Artistically, Moore does some marvelous things. For example, in his story of the tragedy of 9/11, the screen goes blank and we hear only the sounds of the tragedy. His focus of the President sitting reading about a goat after having been informed of the attacks in New York as the clock ticks is engaging.Few films that I have attended have generated applause at the end--even some of the greats like Star Wars movies. But this one did. And the difficulty getting tickets on opening night was a real surprise, as were the hordes of young people at the movie. This is, in my view, a movie for our time, and might net Moore another Oscar nomination for a documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider myself a political independent. I think its pathetic and narrow minded when people lean too far to either side, and anyone who gave this film a 10 or a 1 is probably an extremest. That being said, I felt this movie deserved an 8. The facts cant be denied, however I believe the conclusion is a bit far fetched. I do not approve of most of the decisions that the Bush administration had made, however, I don't think that they are evil people. I believe they were doing what they thought was right, but made tremendously bad decisions in the process. Does that excuse them for the damage they have caused? No, and in my opinion, it would be dangerous to re-elect someone who has made such obvious and disastrous mistakes. Whatever you believe, don't discount or embrace this film 100%. Do your own research and form your own opinions, don't simply follow the party line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, there are two scenes that need to be seen in this film. No one need go further than the scene of the Iraqi woman cursing the U.S. after her uncle's house is destroyed to understand the depth of hatred that many in the Arab world hold toward the U.S. No one need go further than Mrs. Lipscomb's grief to understand the evil of war. Even if you're very conservative, isn't it a fair question to ask why so many of us are wondering why we haven't seen these scenes before?To dismiss this film as mindless propaganda has and will be done, as we can see in many reviews here. Moore makes a characteristic mistake when he depicts a carefree Iraq prior to the war. Mournful, tragic music accompanies the electoral house proceedings - there is no real attempt at objectivity here or in many other scenes in this movie. At times Moore definitely risks getting ponderous, as in his statement that abuse perpetrated on Iraqi prisoners is a direct result of the immorality of Bush's administration.Let's face it, there are a lot of people out there who feel the same Britney Spears. They will not be fazed by Moore's film. But be it marketing forces, mere curiosity, or some kind of mass psychological wish fulfillment on the part of a bunch of liberals, this movie's success at the box office is a good sign. It shows interest in an alternative opinion, suggests people are interested in politics. I feel it does raise valid questions that Bush can't ignore. As I walked out of the theater in predominantly Republican Utah and saw the long line of people I was grateful that we live in a country where divergent opinions can still be heard. Those who would silence Michael Moore or brand him a traitor and betrayer of "American values" should be ashamed of themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But who cares? I don't. And neither should you.See it. With a friend. A group even. And tell others about it. Spread the word.This film/"documentary" should be required viewing in American schools. (and maybe even required viewing, with a test, before you are allowed to vote -- normally I'm not much for voting requirements past citizenship and timely registration, but things are getting more than a little out of control regards voting ability in this country -- I'm also thinking maybe it's time to vote if you want a tax return or "government aid" and such, as well -- and don't even get me started on required two-year government/military service after highschool for "true citizenship" (smile down on me R.A.H.))Although there were only a couple of items that were news to me, most people (99%+ of Americans) will be shocked with the facts and truths by which they are bombarded while watching "Fahrenheit 9/11". Very little of this information was presented in Prime Time TV News, CNN, Talk Radio, or the local or national newspapers. Seeing it presented from beginning to end in one felled swoop has an effect, too.I actually feel kind of sorry for people who see this film previously unaware, uninformed, misinformed, pseudo-informed, and the like. Talk about sensory overload. And especially so with this film and its rather heavy handed emotional content, which would just make it "worse".Although there were plenty of funny parts (I think), they seemed much fewer and farther between in this film, perhaps (?) because of the aforementioned high emotional content, which may, or may not, have been intentional on Moore's part. After awhile, after months of shooting and then editing, it must have been hard to see the forest for the trees, so to speak, or however that saying goes, and you would pretty much have to become increasingly hardened and numb to what we ended up seeing for the first time, somewhat rawly. (is that a word?) Or maybe Moore did it purposely.If anything, this film is an anti-war film, more than a political/anti-Bush film. Although they do go somewhat hand-in-hand. Not that I'm pro-war, especially this (non-)"war", but I suppose I wasn't expecting the film content to be so much antiwar. Moore slipped that one in on me. Or perhaps it was just the affect that part of the film had on me (and will probably have on others). Of course, it doesn't take much graphic and emotional "war" content to make something of an "impression" on a "normal", decent, caring, empathetic person.One thing I hope occurs with some (most) people is a heightened (finally achieved) ability to differentiate between "real violence" and "fictional violence", and understand that there really is a real, palpable (and important) difference. If what is in this film had been fictional storytelling, even with good special effects, it would have been "bad", but not anywhere near as bad as the real violence we see in "F-9/11". If you have ever had the unfortunate experience of hearing someone scream in real fear, or terror, or pain, or sorrow, or see real physical violence and its effects (via war or other), especially in person as opposed to on film/TV/video/radio, then you know there is a vast order in magnitude difference between that reality and fictionalized acting. The latter pales in comparison to the former, so much so that one should finally realize how truly insignificant fictionalized "violence" really is, especially in the scheme of things in the world today (or yesterday, or tomorrow).Is this film rampant with propaganda? Not any more than what anyone else says or does with their opinions and viewpoints and such. Does it contain untruths or overly skewed or colored facts? I don't think so. And anything that might come close to that is probably not conscious on Moore's part. I think it is fairly obvious to anyone who gives a crap that that is not how he operates (or tries to). Moore seeks The Truth. And comes closer to finding it than most. (most of whom aren't really even trying)With all of its weaknesses (?), this very watchable and enjoyable and important film/"documentary" will go down in history as a valuable contribution to the neverending "War on Errorism".One thing I found "interesting", was that Moore felt that he had to point out that people who are "anti-war" (for whatever reason(s)) are not "anti-troops". (as in a "Support Our Troops" rally call) Was that really necessary? Yes. Unfortunately. Based on people's comments over the last several years. Dear g0d people disgust me to no end. Like I always say, "I support our troops so much, I don't want them over there at all." The following paragraph will shed more light on the negative mindset that has caused the requirement of this inclusion in the film.Most nay-sayers will, as usual, be people who either don't like Moore, and/or his "politics". Which will generally be people most people would label as conservatives ("compassionate" or otherwise), republicans and their ilk. And particularly those certain and specific types of people who seem to revel in using events and (truly skewed/colored) truths and facts subjectively, for their own (usually hidden, or camouflaged) self-serving and self-interested agendas, rather than attempting the now-all-too-rare true, selfless, caring objectivity in a "what's best for everyone" mindset and behavior. "Those" types of people.All others pay cash. (and taxes)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore is no Wiseman and That's Okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw the film, and like all of Moore's films it is the work of a polemicist filmed in a documentary-like style. I'm not going to quibble over the veracity of all that Moore presents here. Just let it be noted that Moore is no Frederick Wiseman, and he's never presented himself as a Wiseman either. Moore doesn't do nine-hour, no voiceover films that allow the viewer to make up his or her own mind about the subject. And that's okay. One shouldn't go into a Moore film expecting that sort of technique. He goes in with a point-of-view and uses a mixture of factual footage, kooky gags, and pointed songs to put his point across. As a matter of fact, I happen to agree with his point-of-view in this film, but I can see why it riles so many people that he isn't a Wiseman, a Morris, or a Burns. But this is no reason to dismiss Moore. I think that in a cogent and decidedly speedy manner he does show up the Bush presidency for the farce it is. Some things Moore does can probably be called "cheap shots." Long takes of Bush and others getting made up for the camera are bound to make the subject look foolish. Sitting in a chair having a make-up person touching one up and a hair stylist subduing pesky locks of hair that won't stay put will make anyone look like an idiot. It is nearly impossible to maintain an air of detached and intelligent sang-froid while suffering the administrations of two or three people making sure that your nose doesn't shine. I've made my share of TV appearances and been subjected to the same attentions, so I'm sure there is footage of me out there somewhere of some woman powdering my nose and me looking stupid.If the film is biased, it is no more biased than the "commentary" that is on the Fox News channel 24/7. Moore has a right to make this kind of film. The public has the right to see this kind of film, and it is shameful how the right has tried to suppress this film. First, by putting pressure on Disney/Miramax not to distribute the film. Second, by right-wing groups putting pressure on theaters not to show the film. Third, by denying the film a PG-13 rating; I guess simulated violence is okay with that crowd, just don't show the consequences of the real thing. Also, the language is less graphic than any Farrelly brothers film. And, finally, by Citizens United attempting to stop advertisements for the film from being shown on TV by spuriously invoking the McCain-Feingold Act.What I really find repugnant are the "reviewers" on this site who proclaim Moore to be un-American and a traitor. If patriotism is having a love for one's country, then Moore is one of the most patriotic people around. He truly cares about this country and the path that this country is taking. For too long now, we've been letting the "Bushies" define patriotism as being "if you're not for us, you're against us." That sort of thinking is un-Americanism at its finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FINALLY!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being from Dallas, I got a bit of a head start seeing for myself what an idiot Bush is. Not enough people followed his time as Governor of Texas. Perhaps if they had he wouldn't be President of the United States.This movie is strong in every way. I am not a republican or democrat...just a girl who votes on who I think would do the best job. I'll let you in on a little secret. *whispers* It's not Bush!I was deeply moved by this movie. I really respect the way Moore handled 9/11 in the film. The screen went black and you heard the explosion of the first plane hitting the tower, then the aftermath and then the second plane hitting. You heard the screams and the explosions sounded like it happened 500 feet in front of you. It was more chilling to me than watching them hit again.There were parts that I couldn't hold back the tears at and there were parts that made me laugh uncontrollably, particularly when Ashcroft was singing. UNCLE already! UNCLE!!!!Seriously though, Moore stated the facts and they can't be denied or argued. I am overcome with resound shame that the American people have been so duped. I am overcome with rage that our somewhat good name as a country is tarnished. I am horrified that our leader is so incompetent. I am outraged that to disagree or even question Bush is to have my patriotism questioned. In Bush's words "Well, a dictatorship WOULD be easier" *shudder*A word for the active republicans out there, if you want to change the minds of all of the people who are going to vote against Bush this election, go see this movie. Check the facts. If you can debate those facts then do so. If not, you might have a better idea of who your president really is. *note* I say "your" president because I have great pride in my country and I refuse to recognize this power hungry wolf in sheep's business suit as anything but akin to the merchants that Jesus kicked out from the house of God in the bible. I suppose they think that because he sells it in a holy place then he too must be holy? Wake up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not much new for the informed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this, mainly because I'm already very anti-Bush. We'll just clear that up right now.And even though there were many aspects of this film I liked, on the whole I thought it was very shallow in its treatment. In short, there was really nothing new here for anyone who had bothered to read.On the web, one can find with a little bit of effort many documents and writings from well-known, well-connected, well-respected people who have worked in the government, the FBI, CIA, etc., many Republican in background or worked heavily under people like Reagan, who spell out the criticisms of Bush in much, MUCH more detail. Criticism of Bush and his three years in office is quite valid.But what Michael Moore does here for the most part is boil a lot of that stuff down into very simplistic explanations that don't nearly go into the depth that these officials explore. That, combined with a number of cheap shots as well as his own narrated dubious conclusions and rhetorical questions, makes for a film that I fear can be torn apart by conservatives because it doesn't explain *ENOUGH*. It leaves holes. And as anyone who watches partisan politics knows, the opposition will jump on a hole to discredit the argument outright -- they don't happily point to the fact that you left out explaining something in enough detail to make your point iron-clad and immune to criticism.The dangerous thing about half-truths is that they are often worse than lies.But the other bad thing about a half-truth is that one made in good faith or error is also a statement that then needs to be defended later when an up-front thorough explanation would have been beyond reproach. But at that point, you're on the defensive and the people who aren't convinced will be even harder to convince.The problem, of course, with using film to catalog the criticism of the Bush Administration and the Iraq War is that the medium itself does not lend itself to intensive, detailed discussion. I identified at least a dozen subjects he touched on that could have had whole two-hour movies to themselves. But Moore didn't want to put moveigoers to sleep, so he glossed over stuff with simplistic explanations and conclusions to make it more understandable and appealing to large audiences.My opinion? No matter what political stripe you are from, you should see this film. But then the follow up is to go and READ, READ, READ. Don't take Michael Moore's word for it. Go and consult the sources and get a view of the much bigger picture.And harden your heart, because it's a lot of depressing reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Moore's for years now and every time he makes a new film I am floored. Just blown away with what he reveals to the audience. If you go into this movie expecting the lightheartedness of his past features then you are mistaken. Although there are the occasional comic relief bits, this film is just gripping and emotional and heartbreaking. It is completely different from all his others since he doesn't put himself out in front of the camera too often like in "The Big One" or "Roger and Me". Take your friends and tell everyone you know about this movie because it is a must see for every American. Not everyone will agree with what he says and what he reveals, but they should not argue it's points without watching the film first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be afraid, lemmings, be very afraid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike some people posting and voting here, I have actually seen this film. There is no contradiction in saying that Bush is a lazy idiot and that "he" plotted and schemed for power. Obviously the part that required brain power came from his handlers. It might be fair to say that the film does perhaps unfairly focus on people getting make-up for TV and being "silly" while anticipating a serious address. It takes a certain frame of mind to get over the stress of being on TV, and what seems like disrespect for the gravity of the situation could be natural nerves. But that is a small part of the film. Being balanced would mean including everything we get shoved down our throats every day. I mean either they did have proof of WMD's in Iraq and just couldn't tell us for security reasons or they lied. And now we know the answer (even before this film). No need for "balance" there.People who find this movie offensive likely believe Oswald acted alone. This movie deserves to be seen. Even more than Spiderman 2, perhaps. Only the lemmings who confuse love of their flag with arbitrary love of whoever is in the white house should fear this film, and only if they have a vested interest in ignorance. No matter who is in office, hopefully this will move people to be more active and interested, so swindles like those of George and company won't be so easy in the future.This movie is vital and educational. It should be required viewing. But besides being moving and scary it is also naturally funny. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STUNNING PIECE OF WORK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, those of us with our eyes open have seen many of these ideas as they happen, and I hope that this film opens the eyes of other people as to what is really going on. This is truly the hardest film to watch I have ever seen. I am a movie buff, and have seen thousands, but knowing this is happening right now, in reality, to our country, sickens me. How sad to see the footage of the Iraqi children in pieces with their families in deep grief, how sad to see the mother of a dead soldier helpless in the street outside the white house, how sad to see the hospital for our American servicemen without legs or eyes or arms in so much pain they need constant morphene. You won't see this on Fox News, which Moore points out, Bush's cousin is news chief of. Or really any of the American news networks. We are being "protected" and by not showing us this footage, we believe Rumsfield when he says "Our precision weapons make for a very humane war."The scary part was the Psychiatrist, who pointed out really what we all know, that when people are in constant fear, they are easily controlled. This explains the constant threat levels going up and down, and warnings of attacks bigger than before, and notice how the level has never gone to blue or green, so we can breathe some relief. No weapons of mass destruction also surprises me, I would expect Bush to plant them there if he couldn't find them, although it's not yet election time, maybe that's his big pre-election surprise!It disgusts me to know that our health care is being cut, drug programs destroyed, environment being destroyed, people losing their jobs here, so that the wealthy can become wealthier, and at the expense of innocent lives and sovereign countries. While I am not totally impressed with Kerry's personality, I will surely cast my vote for him, and I would cast it for Bozo if it were necessary to get this mad-man defeated.Moore also points out a fact that I have strongly believed since 9/11, that we should have sent the same 200,000 troops into Afghan. and on their borders immediately and possibly we would have many more Al Queda and maybe even Osama. But many were able to escape because the number of troops we sent was less than the patrols in the city of New York. I have always thought this was a huge mistake, as well as taking many that were already there out to ship to Iraq!I was very much into Michael's Columbine documentary until he did the stunt with Charlton Heston, I thought that was totally wrong. But here, he has made a brilliant, if not the most important, documentary ever, and my hats off to him for helping to show those undecided voters, and maybe some decided, what is really happening. Anyone who contests things in this movie, cannot face the truth, because he shows proof of almost everything he says. Thank you Michael, you have done a great service to your country!</fullReview>

OK ANY one would look stupid like that) Now when you can oversee some of these little tricks (and everyone is capabile including the GOP who have in the past), and know that a few things can be taken out of context and put together in such a way, to make you think the wrong things. its been going on for years and will continue to do so. it is up to us to know and see around the illusions and mirror tricks. unfortunately most Americans are not, we are too much the sheep and we are just to reactionary and the phrase "i learned everything from watching the movie" comes to mind........ now the film very good showing connections between certain people. i knew of some long before and others i didn't. and some other weird connections like each person can bring up 4 packs of matches AND 2 lighters onto a plane despite the shoe bomber who forgot to bring one!!! why, people want to smoke after a flight, can't deny the tobacco lobby now can we. you know, we all know that GWB was a loon BEFORE he took office, and most know before this movie that his bro stole the election for him. for some reason the dem's didn't put up too much fuss fearing backlash due to probs with bill bubba clinton not being able to keep his pants on to support gore and his fight for the election feasco. hopefully due to USA need for quick knowledge and we get it from a movie, maybe we can get rid of this dolt. ..... AND before anyone starts calling me names, i will admit to being still a registered Repub, in my youth i was a junior reagonite. now after becoming educated , serving in the armed forces more than GW ever did, i have become more democrate, although the choice they give us isn't a great one either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rage Against the Media Monopolies: people are hungry for information</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just returned from seeing F911. Now although this is a film review, to talk about this film meaningfully, it is necessary to discuss the US cultural context that exists outside of the film itself. I got very interested in this film after buying a video on EBAY called "The Passion of Michael Moore." After purchasing this video, I have watched Moore defend his film on many American talk shows, news desks and discussion groups. The hosts of these interviewers seemed like they felt obligated to ask Moore tough questions in an aggressive, hostile manner. These are the same guys who gave Rumsfeld, Cheney and the rest of the Bush team a free ride when they wanted a war the rest of the world and a large part of the American public was against. It's no wonder F911 has become the most important political film of our time.People are lining up for this film because they are hungry for real information, unfiltered honesty and the feeling of validation that comes from seeing the "minority" public opinion that you've believed all along (but were afraid to express lest you be called un-American or a traitor) being celebrated front and center in shopping malls and town square cinemas. The film is filled with facts that have been buried in the back pages of the press or ignored completely by the mainstream media. This film does not pretend to be objective. The film clearly presents what is fact, humor and opinion. The lines are never blurred. It takes a point of view and argues it passionately. And why shouldn't it take a point of view, especially one that as been ignored and often misrepresented by the corporate media. It must be remembered that we live in a time when 5 or 6 corporations control all of the news, television, music and other media. These same companies also own other businesses that are connected to and profit from war. So, actually it is not surprising that these media outlets often act as little more than PR machines for the government. Living in a free, democracy, we tend to believe that our news is different from the propaganda of PRAVDA that we learned about during the cold war. That sadly is not the case. As Chomsky once pointed out, Fascist governments can control the population through force, in a democracy like our own, PR and media is the tool of choice to control and manipulate public opinion. I saw the film at a LOWES movie chain. I was thinking to myself, we are luckily that these mega media companies actually allowed the film to be shown. They could have easily have passed the way CLEAR CHANNEL has done its part to suppress political music , artists and entertainers on their many radio stations across the country. Ironically, this morning I heard the Carlye Corporation (yes, the same one the Bush and Bin Laden family along with a wide array of unsavory political characters run, as seen in the film) has collaborated with other investor groups to PURCHASE the LOWES theater chain! Do you think they would have shown F911 if they controlled the chain before the film was released? If media consolidation continues at its current place, films like F911 will not exist outside of underground venues and we will have no sources of info that are not "fair and balanced" FOX news channel style.I think it is foolish of Moore's critics to demand that he present a "balanced" documentary. Moore is not a journalist, he is an artist and activist, and his goal is help the public cut through the mass of info, PR, and spin presented through the mainstream media in order to illuminate and connect the dots to comprehend the wider signification of events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fact, not Propaganda. Impeach Bush.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the greatest horror movie of the year. As I watched the movie, I thought that there were so many facts, but so many more that could have been included. Were these random targets, or were alternative energy plans and/or an old vault on the 90th floor of the south tower of the Trade Center with many of the nuclear power plant plans of the United States being targeted? That space in the south tower was formerly rented by Haliburton, when they built power plants. Why were the military bases around New York City closed after 1993 in spite of the first bombing of the Trade Center, following planned closings of military bases that had been ordered by George Bush Senior? These are questions that Michael Moore did not even raise.Americans rally around each other in a time of crisis, and in 2001 and since, people have been very helpful to each other and supportive of the government. But, consider whether or not the government has been supportive of Americans and communities. Are all the shores being guarded the way they were guarded in World War II? An Oregon State Trooper says that the shores are not being guarded all the time because of budget cutbacks; and all the national guard and coast guard seems to be deployed overseas. Are matches and cigarette lighters being kept off of planes to prevent bombs? No, that would prevent travelers from lighting their cigarettes when they leave the planes. Are communities being helped with projects that keep jobs here so that terrorists do not recruit here? (Michael Moore did raise the question of poverty and our military recruitment, but he never went to the touchy issue of what might happen if poverty in America becomes greater here and people are recruited by the enemy.) Did Bush order the military to try to follow leads to find terrorists (after all, the World Trade Center had already been bombed in 1993)? No, he played golf for eight months of 2001. Did Bush act immediately to protect himself and order military jets deployed to protect cities on the morning of Sept. 11th? No, he read a story with a class of children. Who let the Binladen family out of the U.S. so that the F.B.I. could not interview them? This may be looked at as "old news," but the question raised is, and how would Bush lead us if any other horrible circumstance occurred? You might say, who cares if Bush's money comes from Saudi sources... after all, Thomas Jefferson owned slaves. I think, however, the question is, in a time of war, should there be close ties between our chief of state and those who may have attacked us? Consider the parallel: Bush was reading a book to a class of boys and girls; the Saudis funded the schools of hatred in Afganistan.In World War II, people continued to support the war effort because they still felt that their government cared about their problems, and would recruit the man-power to protect their shores. And things were terrifying then, and the government also kept people on alert all the time; my grandmother was an air-raid warden in New York City. People then gave up some of their rights, but there wasn't a sense that our leadership was inept to meet the challenges of war. The activities connecting Bush to the Saudis are certainly disturbing, but I would say that the neglect of duty, going on vacation all the time, not providing troops where needed, not properly training troops (and Michael Moore did not bring up the prison scandal at all) and then instead of working to get rid of terror there seemed more of an effort to cover it up, are grounds for impeachment of George W. Bush. Certainly more grounds than a stain on a dress.This film is a must-see. Could there be a rebuttal other than yelling "liar liar pants on fire" in the face of facts? I am most terrified that people will not research and find out the facts for themselves, including worse things that Michael Moore left out. I saw this film in the same theatre where I saw "The Passion of the Christ," and I was very glad that people were willing to express opinions and state facts in both cases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Canadian perspective...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Michael Moore. His films are funny and thought provoking. I saw the film Fahrenheit 9/11 on Saturday the 26th. For an American film and American subject matter the theater was nearly full (and for a matine showing) It was an excellent film, it was excellent in many ways. My only criticism was it seemed lack a little direction. It merely followed the progression of the past 4 years - never really drawing any conclusions. But maybe that was the point; maybe we were supposed to draw our own conclusions.I also like America and I take an interest in what goes on with my neighbor to the south. As a Canadian watching Fahrenheit 9/11 I felt I learned nothing more than I had already known . When Bush stole the election in 2000 I knew immediately that he was bad news. I was baffled why more objections weren't made about a presidential election being decided in the state where his brother is governor. That has to be the biggest conflict of interest in history. After that I couldn't take the man seriously - he didn't belong in office. Few Canadians respect this man; his idiocy is too prevalent to miss. Michael Moore is right, if someone kills 3000 people, you go after them - so what's up with Iraq? I have sat back scratching my head for the past 4 years wondering why more American's don't see what's happening to their country and way of life. Hopefully as many Americans as possible will see this film and open their eyes to the dishonor that's been occurring in your government.Fahrenheit on the surface appears to be one sided. But in reality a pro-Bush movie would be hard to make. His reasons for the invasion of Iraq were lofty at the time and now after the fact there is no valid reason for the war on the table as no weapons were found - and Iraq certainly had nothing to do with 9/11. The Patriot Act and erosion of American freedoms...well if all you have to hold on to is your internal belief that he's made America safer - you really need to reassess your values. See Fahrenheit 9/11. Democrats and Republicans alike. Even if you don't agree with everything Michael Moore is pointing out, at the very least one has to admit something is desperately wrong and a severe change in thinking is needed.</fullReview>

It just absolutely sickened me.I agree with the comment Joseph Pintar made about censorship and I hope more Americans will see this movie during the time it is in theaters. When I went to see this movie it was opening day and the movie was sold out. Most of the people in the audience, we guessed, were Bush-bashers.

		<shortDescription>A broader perspective on Moore's intent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just returned from seeing this film, and I've read through many of the user comments to see what others were saying. One thing I would like to add to the discussion, especially aimed at those who might be debating as to whether they want to see this film, is that it is not as partisan as it has been made out to be. That is not to say that it is not clearly condemning the current administration and its policies, but it is also quite critical of the Democratic leadership during the time from when Bush took office through the start of the war. [SPOILERS] Where was the senator brave enough to back up the black Congressmen and -women who protested Bush's installation? What were Daschle and Gephardt thinking when they rolled over for the Republican majority? Why did the majority of Democrats support the war and the PATRIOT Act? Why isn't *anyone* in Congress reading the bills they're signing or willing to consider the issue that only one amongst their ranks has a child serving in the armed forces?I do not believe the sole intent of Moore's film was to lambaste the Bushies. Instead, this is a heart-wrenching critique of what has gone wrong in this country, and who has done wrong by its people. One of the criticisms I've read many times (even within IMDb reviews) is that Moore does not have a cohesive argument - that the film rambles, or tries to make too many points, or fails to make any. The truth is, Moore's thesis is clear: he wonders at the end how it is that the people who get the worst treatment in this country are the ones who most often end up serving to protect it. This is a movie about CLASS. This is a movie about opportunity, power (and the abuse of power), and honor. I challenge anyone to walk away from this film not wondering how it is that those who are given every opportunity in life are so willing and able to act dishonorably without repercussion, while those who risk and sacrifice their lives, often out of necessity and lack of options, are the ones who act honorably, despite their injuries and deaths being hidden away from public view like a shameful secret.See this movie with an open mind, and take in what Moore is really trying to tell us. The system is broken. Some take advantage of the cracks more than others, but ultimately, this is a call to care for the honorable more than a polemic against those who claim honor on the backs of America's real heroes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STUNNING PIECE OF WORK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, those of us with our eyes open have seen many of these ideas as they happen, and I hope that this film opens the eyes of other people as to what is really going on. This is truly the hardest film to watch I have ever seen. I am a movie buff, and have seen thousands, but knowing this is happening right now, in reality, to our country, sickens me. How sad to see the footage of the Iraqi children in pieces with their families in deep grief, how sad to see the mother of a dead soldier helpless in the street outside the white house, how sad to see the hospital for our American servicemen without legs or eyes or arms in so much pain they need constant morphene. You won't see this on Fox News, which Moore points out, Bush's cousin is news chief of. Or really any of the American news networks. We are being "protected" and by not showing us this footage, we believe Rumsfield when he says "Our precision weapons make for a very humane war."The scary part was the Psychiatrist, who pointed out really what we all know, that when people are in constant fear, they are easily controlled. This explains the constant threat levels going up and down, and warnings of attacks bigger than before, and notice how the level has never gone to blue or green, so we can breathe some relief. No weapons of mass destruction also surprises me, I would expect Bush to plant them there if he couldn't find them, although it's not yet election time, maybe that's his big pre-election surprise!It disgusts me to know that our health care is being cut, drug programs destroyed, environment being destroyed, people losing their jobs here, so that the wealthy can become wealthier, and at the expense of innocent lives and sovereign countries. While I am not totally impressed with Kerry's personality, I will surely cast my vote for him, and I would cast it for Bozo if it were necessary to get this mad-man defeated.Moore also points out a fact that I have strongly believed since 9/11, that we should have sent the same 200,000 troops into Afghan. and on their borders immediately and possibly we would have many more Al Queda and maybe even Osama. But many were able to escape because the number of troops we sent was less than the patrols in the city of New York. I have always thought this was a huge mistake, as well as taking many that were already there out to ship to Iraq!I was very much into Michael's Columbine documentary until he did the stunt with Charlton Heston, I thought that was totally wrong. But here, he has made a brilliant, if not the most important, documentary ever, and my hats off to him for helping to show those undecided voters, and maybe some decided, what is really happening. Anyone who contests things in this movie, cannot face the truth, because he shows proof of almost everything he says. Thank you Michael, you have done a great service to your country!</fullReview>

We already know that the war with Iraq was all based on a lie--and now we know that the truth is far scarier than we thought. At this writing, 1400 people have given this film a 10/10, and 700 gave given it a 1/10. Okay, seriously, there is no possible explanation for someone giving a DOCUMENTARY a 1/10 unless a) the footage makes them feel stupid for thinking what they dob) they're scared the footage might shake up their beliefsc) they haven't seen it.I'll bet my paycheck that each and every one of those 700 haven't even seen the damn film.

		<shortDescription>No matter what you think of Moore or the issues...YOU NEED TO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SEE THIS FILM.If you are an American (especially but a variation on this applies to everyone else) and think that our freedoms and being proud to be an American is still important then you should see this film.Well, I have to say that I used to be a wholehearted supporter of Moore and then his decision to support klarke in the presidential race really soured my opinion of him. F/9-11 though and his actions since have however notably increased my opinion and renewed admiration for what he has accomplished.The film is a powerful indictment against the illegitimate bush administration, at times gut wrenchingly powerful and saddening and at others body-shakingly hilarious, it points out the ties of the administration to Saudi Arabia, corruption of the rest of the administration, and most importantly the toll that the (again) illegitimate Iraq war has had on U.S. soldiers and their families at home, and finally a powerful argument against ruinous war on the innocent civilians-PEOPLE of subjected target nations.If you value the continuation and progression of the human race and generations to come... If there is one film that you see this year this should be it.P.S. Of course I have to say to call this "documentary" really stretches the definition though what that really is many still argue. At first some scenes may almost may make you cringe with some "over-the-topness" I submit though -in my own experience- that perhaps this is the initial shock, once you have some time to digest the enormity and power of the film you will see its WORTH.P.P.S. For a AWESOME 10/10 documentary (much easier to see as one) I suggest the film, "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised," I can almost guarantee you will not be disappointed but I can't go that far ;).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i just got back from seeing the pix. good movie, entertaining, informative, decently put together. OK a bit skewed perhaps, sometimes implying wrong message (example: when getting ready for press conference and seeing other people doing stupid things then focusing on GWB looking stupid waiting for prompter to begin. OK ANY one would look stupid like that) Now when you can oversee some of these little tricks (and everyone is capabile including the GOP who have in the past), and know that a few things can be taken out of context and put together in such a way, to make you think the wrong things. its been going on for years and will continue to do so. it is up to us to know and see around the illusions and mirror tricks. unfortunately most Americans are not, we are too much the sheep and we are just to reactionary and the phrase "i learned everything from watching the movie" comes to mind........ now the film very good showing connections between certain people. i knew of some long before and others i didn't. and some other weird connections like each person can bring up 4 packs of matches AND 2 lighters onto a plane despite the shoe bomber who forgot to bring one!!! why, people want to smoke after a flight, can't deny the tobacco lobby now can we. you know, we all know that GWB was a loon BEFORE he took office, and most know before this movie that his bro stole the election for him. for some reason the dem's didn't put up too much fuss fearing backlash due to probs with bill bubba clinton not being able to keep his pants on to support gore and his fight for the election feasco. hopefully due to USA need for quick knowledge and we get it from a movie, maybe we can get rid of this dolt. ..... AND before anyone starts calling me names, i will admit to being still a registered Repub, in my youth i was a junior reagonite. now after becoming educated , serving in the armed forces more than GW ever did, i have become more democrate, although the choice they give us isn't a great one either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rage Against the Media Monopolies: people are hungry for information</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just returned from seeing F911. Now although this is a film review, to talk about this film meaningfully, it is necessary to discuss the US cultural context that exists outside of the film itself. I got very interested in this film after buying a video on EBAY called "The Passion of Michael Moore." After purchasing this video, I have watched Moore defend his film on many American talk shows, news desks and discussion groups. The hosts of these interviewers seemed like they felt obligated to ask Moore tough questions in an aggressive, hostile manner. These are the same guys who gave Rumsfeld, Cheney and the rest of the Bush team a free ride when they wanted a war the rest of the world and a large part of the American public was against. It's no wonder F911 has become the most important political film of our time.People are lining up for this film because they are hungry for real information, unfiltered honesty and the feeling of validation that comes from seeing the "minority" public opinion that you've believed all along (but were afraid to express lest you be called un-American or a traitor) being celebrated front and center in shopping malls and town square cinemas. The film is filled with facts that have been buried in the back pages of the press or ignored completely by the mainstream media. This film does not pretend to be objective. The film clearly presents what is fact, humor and opinion. The lines are never blurred. It takes a point of view and argues it passionately. And why shouldn't it take a point of view, especially one that as been ignored and often misrepresented by the corporate media. It must be remembered that we live in a time when 5 or 6 corporations control all of the news, television, music and other media. These same companies also own other businesses that are connected to and profit from war. So, actually it is not surprising that these media outlets often act as little more than PR machines for the government. Living in a free, democracy, we tend to believe that our news is different from the propaganda of PRAVDA that we learned about during the cold war. That sadly is not the case. As Chomsky once pointed out, Fascist governments can control the population through force, in a democracy like our own, PR and media is the tool of choice to control and manipulate public opinion. I saw the film at a LOWES movie chain. I was thinking to myself, we are luckily that these mega media companies actually allowed the film to be shown. They could have easily have passed the way CLEAR CHANNEL has done its part to suppress political music , artists and entertainers on their many radio stations across the country. Ironically, this morning I heard the Carlye Corporation (yes, the same one the Bush and Bin Laden family along with a wide array of unsavory political characters run, as seen in the film) has collaborated with other investor groups to PURCHASE the LOWES theater chain! Do you think they would have shown F911 if they controlled the chain before the film was released? If media consolidation continues at its current place, films like F911 will not exist outside of underground venues and we will have no sources of info that are not "fair and balanced" FOX news channel style.I think it is foolish of Moore's critics to demand that he present a "balanced" documentary. Moore is not a journalist, he is an artist and activist, and his goal is help the public cut through the mass of info, PR, and spin presented through the mainstream media in order to illuminate and connect the dots to comprehend the wider signification of events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fact, not Propaganda. Impeach Bush.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the greatest horror movie of the year. As I watched the movie, I thought that there were so many facts, but so many more that could have been included. Were these random targets, or were alternative energy plans and/or an old vault on the 90th floor of the south tower of the Trade Center with many of the nuclear power plant plans of the United States being targeted? That space in the south tower was formerly rented by Haliburton, when they built power plants. Why were the military bases around New York City closed after 1993 in spite of the first bombing of the Trade Center, following planned closings of military bases that had been ordered by George Bush Senior? These are questions that Michael Moore did not even raise.Americans rally around each other in a time of crisis, and in 2001 and since, people have been very helpful to each other and supportive of the government. But, consider whether or not the government has been supportive of Americans and communities. Are all the shores being guarded the way they were guarded in World War II? An Oregon State Trooper says that the shores are not being guarded all the time because of budget cutbacks; and all the national guard and coast guard seems to be deployed overseas. Are matches and cigarette lighters being kept off of planes to prevent bombs? No, that would prevent travelers from lighting their cigarettes when they leave the planes. Are communities being helped with projects that keep jobs here so that terrorists do not recruit here? (Michael Moore did raise the question of poverty and our military recruitment, but he never went to the touchy issue of what might happen if poverty in America becomes greater here and people are recruited by the enemy.) Did Bush order the military to try to follow leads to find terrorists (after all, the World Trade Center had already been bombed in 1993)? No, he played golf for eight months of 2001. Did Bush act immediately to protect himself and order military jets deployed to protect cities on the morning of Sept. 11th? No, he read a story with a class of children. Who let the Binladen family out of the U.S. so that the F.B.I. could not interview them? This may be looked at as "old news," but the question raised is, and how would Bush lead us if any other horrible circumstance occurred? You might say, who cares if Bush's money comes from Saudi sources... after all, Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.

		<fullReview>Unlike Mr. Moore's academy award winning documentary "Bowling For Columbine," in which the film-maker struggled with a question with no simple or easy answers (why is the U.S. such a violent society?), and looked at the issue from various points of view, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is a decidedly polemical film in which Mr. Moore carries a red-hot flaming chip on his shoulder. That this chip is composed of moral outrage, offended patriotism, and grieved compassion will make it cathartic for those who share Mr. Moore's views. The film is a loosely structured indictment that tries to present enough issues &amp; accusations to populate at least 3 or 4 episodes of PBS' 'Frontline.' As someone who regards George W. Bush as the worst U.S. President in my lifetime (of 40+ years), I tried to assess Mr. Moore's methods with an eye on how fair I would find them if he was a right-wing film-maker attacking an administration I genuinely respected: by that criterion, I think he often crosses a line into almost adolescent denunciation of his targets, and such moments are unworthy of the substantive and compelling scenes, questions, and arguments that make much of this film so powerful and worthwhile. Despite its flaws, this film contains so much that is pertinent, revelatory and reprehensibly under-reported by the mainstream U.S. media that it makes a valuable and important contribution to this critical moment in our national discourse. It is also funny, heart-breaking, infuriating, and entertaining. Definitely recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read somewhere that going into the film, if people hated George Bush, they would continue to do so once they saw it, but if they loved him, they would continue to love him. I continue to hate him and support everything that would get him out of office. Everyone should see this film because it is a documentary of politics today. After seeing it, you will think twice about the people who are running the country. I thought that the cinematic journey was brilliant in the way he illustrated the truth. Bush indeed had no real experience before he became President, or rather he stole the presidency. It will make you feel for the soldiers who have to fight the second Vietnam and it will make you see the lies that have been told to the American people, and the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore Whacks one Over the Fence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As parked next to a car with a sign in the window that read "It's a fortunate thing for governments that people don't think. -A. Hitler", I knew I was in for it. Little did I know, I was underestimating the experience.Moore steps back a pace in 9/11, declines to be heavy handed, and largely lets his story tell itself. And tell itself, it does. From W's vaccuous stare in a FL classroom as he is advised that the second tower had been hit, to former FBI Director Thomas Pickard testifying that just prior to 9/11, John Ashcroft told him "not to mention bin Laden to him again", to a soldier in Iraq telling the movie audience, 'If Donald Rumsfeld was here, I'd ask for his resignation', the drumbeat is relentless. Moore wryly narrates, but seldom intrudes. He doesn't have to.It looks bad for Bush and his posse. Real bad. So much so, I came away with a couple of notions. Firstly, I actually found myself thinking that Moore probably could have come down a whole lot harder than he did. Secondly, as a direct result of the first, I couldn't shake the feeling that there's sooooooo much more the world needs to know. And if we only knew . .. .Moore doesn't exactly give equal time to the Demo's, but they don't come away without a scratch, either. He makes sure you know that not a single member of the (1/2 Democratic) Senate lifted a finger to help the heart-wrenching army of disenfranchised blacks testifying one after the next at W's confirmation hearing, and makes sure you sit and watch footage of Democratic Captains happily rubber-stamping Bush's Iraqi fiasco.Tears will flow, and heads will shake in aghast disbelief. Heartstrings will likely not remain unplucked. If you support the guy, there isn't a lot of joy for you. Moore's got his facts down pretty solidly. You might try to call it 'bad cinema', but it's simply not - actually, it's riveting. You might shoot spitballs at this minor point or that, but taken as a whole, well, Fahrenheit 9/11 is an indefensible juggernaut, factually and emotionally.If you hate the guy, you'll be real glad Moore is on your side. The Neocons in a free America (sic?) can certainly screen their alternative version, but good luck. This time, Moore is the age-old 'hard act to follow', and they'll certainly need it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i sincerely wish someone else's name was above the title - because moore's name puts off a lot of people who really should go and see the movie because their votes can make a difference in november. and i can tell you - every American should see this movie. if for nothing else,just to have a chance to make one's own opinion, as opposed to be told what to think by our politicians or/and the media. but enough of that: as a movie, F 9-11 is the most disciplined, inteligent and powerful movie MM has ever made... although it is still more of a personal essay than a documentary. if there is something i could wish for, it would perhaps be better if the director/writer would stick to one issue instead of trying to point out all things that have gone terribly wrong in the last four years; moore should have focused more on how bush and his people handled 9-11, and used it to justify a war which American people would never support if they were not mislead about iraq's connection with al-quaida. still, it is a great piece of work, almost free of MM's (in)famous wisecracking jokes and the presence of the man himself. most of it is really not funny at all: it's as bitter and harrowing as a movie about war and dying can get (forget the sanitized TV coverage). and is guaranteed to get you angry, no matter what your politics. but in this case angry is good: if only 1% of those people who left their theater as upset and shocked and moved as I was will do something about it, maybe there is still a chance things will be set right again in the home of the brave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore is a Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a child, my parents &amp; teachers (&amp; especially, Sunday School teachers) told me it was very important to stand up for what is right, no matter what anybody said. I wonder how many instructors of the young are still telling their children that? Michael Moore is an example for all of us of a person who dares to stand up for the values of honesty, responsibility &amp; fairness. The most important point he is making in this movie is the immorality of using the children of poor people to fight a war for the benefit of the rich. If all the young people who see this movie understand how unfair this is &amp; get registered to vote, George W. Bush can be defeated in November.One additional note: the image of GWB that continually haunts me is his mockery of the young woman who converted to Christianity while on death row in Texas, became a model prison citizen, and pleaded with him for her life. It was not enough that he sent her to her death, but his making fun of her desperation continues to characterize him as totally lacking in empathy and compassion. I'm sure, if he ever sees this movie, he will find the bereft mother in Flint MI equally amusing, but I think she is the strongest character in the film.</fullReview>

No new information was revealed in the movie; rather he has digested the facts and packaged them in a coherent order so that we learn that Bush, his friends, and his Saudi benefactors are the true beneficiaries of the terrorist strike of September 11, 2001.It played to a sold-out audience. I had never heard of such a crowd at a documentary. Nearly all clapped and cheered for the film.It is a shame that this site already has so many comments from right-wingers and Bush supporters who have not seen the film.

		<fullReview>Good movie overall, my standards were satisfied. Micheal Moore seemed to take a back seat to the subject matter with this one. A masterfully edited collection of footage of George W. Bush acting like an idiot combined with grim war footage, occasional Micheal Moore moments, terrorist and foreign news footage. Occasionally funny, often sad, very aggravating information was woven together to deliver a tough punch to the Bush team. This one's for the liberals, the democrats, the other Americans who feel that they're not accounted for by this White House, and ALL OF EUROPE, too! Can't forget THE REST OF THE WORLD! Anyway, good movie, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE was better and hard to live up to, but F9/11 should act as a wake-up call to America to do something about these terrorists of our Government, these money-hungry billionaires who care for nothing but their fat wallets! I love America, I am Jason, a film maker from Mass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore obviously takes great liberties with the information he obtains. He stretches the facts he finds to create an image of a person or situation that is usually one-dimensional and oversimplified. He never lies outright however, and the depth and breadth of his fact findings are impressive. He obtained Bush's military records uncensored in 2000 years before it became an issue. The same with inhumane treatment of Iraqi's by American forces in Iraq. His details of the extent of Bush family's ties to the Saudi's and the private weapons manufacturers are impressive.There are blatant manipulations of emotions in the movie as well. The pictures of smiling Iraqis flying kites and peacefully eating in cafes before the U.S. invasion is manipulative and masks the nature of living under someone as ruthless as Saddam Hussein. At the very least, it does not show the entire picture.However, all of the distortion and stretching does not change the core themes of the movie that are true. The amazingly close and special relationship between the Bushes and the Saudis. The conflict of interest in using government contacts to make money through the Carlyle Group, Haliburton, and other companies. The truly horrific and chaotic and brutal concept of committing a country to war. The fact that their is no clean-cut, finely tuned, accurate war that only harms the bad guys in Iraq and largely leaves the "good" Iraqis free from all but the most minimal collateral damage. This is an illusion propagated by some in the administration. (i.e. Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz). The movie contains powerful and moving images of people affected on both sides of the war. It also mocks and in some cases humiliates members of the administration. The most damning part of the movie for me was when Bush was told about the second plane flying into the World Trade Center as he read to school children in Florida, and he just stupidly sits there for seven precious minutes and looks indecisive, scared, and unsure.This movie is obviously a highly partisan attempt to get Bush out of office. In many respects, it is misleading. However it is no more misleading then the bombardment of information we have been getting out of Washington for the past four years. The real central fact is that it shows how desperate America wants an oppositional press. Most of the clips from Michael Moore's movie has been pulled from mainstream media news. The mere fact that mainstream media does not provide the type of critical, and oppositional role to the government is distressing. The American people wants a media that challenges the government, not one that vacillates between blind drum-beating regurgitation of the government line and hyperventilation over scandals.The American people are so desperate for an oppositional press that challenges the government instead of bows to it that they are willing to take time out of their day, and money out of their wallets, to get it in a movie theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is going to win another Oscar. It was well done, showing evidence that is tangible and researchable. It showed footage of men and women in Iraq fighting, talking about what has been happening and their opinions of the war. It showed the connectable links between the Bush family and the Bin Laden family, in a thorough and direct way. There was not a dry tear in the room during multiple scenes. Everyone stood and clapped at the end of the film. A memorable scene was when a congressman was talking about how he had a toll free number people could call him at, and since he never released it, Michael Moore put his office number on screen.Keep your eyes open as you read people's opinions, badmouthing the movie. They may say it is Anti-American, they may say it is full of lies, but no comment earlier than mine has actually seen the movie. The ranking for this film is 6.4, because you can see that over 30 percent of the votes went to a 1 out of ten. Almost every other vote went to 10. I am not saying this film was a ten out of ten, I am displaying the corrupt attempts to judge this film, BEFORE IT WAS EVEN AVAILABLE to the general public. Watch this film and see for yourself the opinion and proof of the War on Terror.8 and a half out of 10.High points: Correct and verifiable information, attempting truth and hard boiled investigative reporting. Low points: Got tiresome near the middle, a large amount of information to digest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore once again offers his two sense on world issues, this time at the Bush administration's bungled handling of 9/11 and the 'war on terror.' Fahrenheit is a bit more serious than his prior film, Bowling for Columbine, but retains the occasional humor, in the form of unintentionally humorous clips for politicians on camera, that makes his films enjoyable. Like all of Moore's work, it must be taken with a fine pinch of salt. However, Moore provides solid arguments and presents many questions for viewers to discuss after they've vacated the theater (a movie that makes you think? - the pain!). Many of Moore's critics will claim that the film is full of 'lies' but will have neither the information, nor the gumption to back up their claims with facts that would prove Moore wrong -- see it for yourself and make your own decisions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read somewhere that going into the film, if people hated George Bush, they would continue to do so once they saw it, but if they loved him, they would continue to love him. I continue to hate him and support everything that would get him out of office. Everyone should see this film because it is a documentary of politics today. After seeing it, you will think twice about the people who are running the country. I thought that the cinematic journey was brilliant in the way he illustrated the truth. Bush indeed had no real experience before he became President, or rather he stole the presidency. It will make you feel for the soldiers who have to fight the second Vietnam and it will make you see the lies that have been told to the American people, and the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore Whacks one Over the Fence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As parked next to a car with a sign in the window that read "It's a fortunate thing for governments that people don't think. -A. Hitler", I knew I was in for it. Little did I know, I was underestimating the experience.Moore steps back a pace in 9/11, declines to be heavy handed, and largely lets his story tell itself. And tell itself, it does. From W's vaccuous stare in a FL classroom as he is advised that the second tower had been hit, to former FBI Director Thomas Pickard testifying that just prior to 9/11, John Ashcroft told him "not to mention bin Laden to him again", to a soldier in Iraq telling the movie audience, 'If Donald Rumsfeld was here, I'd ask for his resignation', the drumbeat is relentless. Moore wryly narrates, but seldom intrudes. He doesn't have to.It looks bad for Bush and his posse. Real bad. So much so, I came away with a couple of notions. Firstly, I actually found myself thinking that Moore probably could have come down a whole lot harder than he did. Secondly, as a direct result of the first, I couldn't shake the feeling that there's sooooooo much more the world needs to know. And if we only knew . .. .Moore doesn't exactly give equal time to the Demo's, but they don't come away without a scratch, either. He makes sure you know that not a single member of the (1/2 Democratic) Senate lifted a finger to help the heart-wrenching army of disenfranchised blacks testifying one after the next at W's confirmation hearing, and makes sure you sit and watch footage of Democratic Captains happily rubber-stamping Bush's Iraqi fiasco.Tears will flow, and heads will shake in aghast disbelief. Heartstrings will likely not remain unplucked. If you support the guy, there isn't a lot of joy for you. Moore's got his facts down pretty solidly. You might try to call it 'bad cinema', but it's simply not - actually, it's riveting. You might shoot spitballs at this minor point or that, but taken as a whole, well, Fahrenheit 9/11 is an indefensible juggernaut, factually and emotionally.If you hate the guy, you'll be real glad Moore is on your side. The Neocons in a free America (sic?) can certainly screen their alternative version, but good luck. This time, Moore is the age-old 'hard act to follow', and they'll certainly need it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i sincerely wish someone else's name was above the title - because moore's name puts off a lot of people who really should go and see the movie because their votes can make a difference in november. and i can tell you - every American should see this movie. if for nothing else,just to have a chance to make one's own opinion, as opposed to be told what to think by our politicians or/and the media. but enough of that: as a movie, F 9-11 is the most disciplined, inteligent and powerful movie MM has ever made... although it is still more of a personal essay than a documentary. if there is something i could wish for, it would perhaps be better if the director/writer would stick to one issue instead of trying to point out all things that have gone terribly wrong in the last four years; moore should have focused more on how bush and his people handled 9-11, and used it to justify a war which American people would never support if they were not mislead about iraq's connection with al-quaida. still, it is a great piece of work, almost free of MM's (in)famous wisecracking jokes and the presence of the man himself. most of it is really not funny at all: it's as bitter and harrowing as a movie about war and dying can get (forget the sanitized TV coverage). and is guaranteed to get you angry, no matter what your politics. but in this case angry is good: if only 1% of those people who left their theater as upset and shocked and moved as I was will do something about it, maybe there is still a chance things will be set right again in the home of the brave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore is a Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a child, my parents &amp; teachers (&amp; especially, Sunday School teachers) told me it was very important to stand up for what is right, no matter what anybody said. I wonder how many instructors of the young are still telling their children that? Michael Moore is an example for all of us of a person who dares to stand up for the values of honesty, responsibility &amp; fairness. The most important point he is making in this movie is the immorality of using the children of poor people to fight a war for the benefit of the rich. If all the young people who see this movie understand how unfair this is &amp; get registered to vote, George W. Bush can be defeated in November.One additional note: the image of GWB that continually haunts me is his mockery of the young woman who converted to Christianity while on death row in Texas, became a model prison citizen, and pleaded with him for her life. It was not enough that he sent her to her death, but his making fun of her desperation continues to characterize him as totally lacking in empathy and compassion. I'm sure, if he ever sees this movie, he will find the bereft mother in Flint MI equally amusing, but I think she is the strongest character in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore has created a work of art. No new information was revealed in the movie; rather he has digested the facts and packaged them in a coherent order so that we learn that Bush, his friends, and his Saudi benefactors are the true beneficiaries of the terrorist strike of September 11, 2001.It played to a sold-out audience. I had never heard of such a crowd at a documentary. Nearly all clapped and cheered for the film.It is a shame that this site already has so many comments from right-wingers and Bush supporters who have not seen the film. They just want discourage people from learning and understanding the truth! By the way, a documentary by definition is supposed to be persuasive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good movie overall, my standards were satisfied. Micheal Moore seemed to take a back seat to the subject matter with this one. A masterfully edited collection of footage of George W. Bush acting like an idiot combined with grim war footage, occasional Micheal Moore moments, terrorist and foreign news footage. Occasionally funny, often sad, very aggravating information was woven together to deliver a tough punch to the Bush team. This one's for the liberals, the democrats, the other Americans who feel that they're not accounted for by this White House, and ALL OF EUROPE, too! Can't forget THE REST OF THE WORLD! Anyway, good movie, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE was better and hard to live up to, but F9/11 should act as a wake-up call to America to do something about these terrorists of our Government, these money-hungry billionaires who care for nothing but their fat wallets! I love America, I am Jason, a film maker from Mass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore obviously takes great liberties with the information he obtains. He stretches the facts he finds to create an image of a person or situation that is usually one-dimensional and oversimplified. He never lies outright however, and the depth and breadth of his fact findings are impressive. He obtained Bush's military records uncensored in 2000 years before it became an issue. The same with inhumane treatment of Iraqi's by American forces in Iraq. His details of the extent of Bush family's ties to the Saudi's and the private weapons manufacturers are impressive.There are blatant manipulations of emotions in the movie as well. The pictures of smiling Iraqis flying kites and peacefully eating in cafes before the U.S. invasion is manipulative and masks the nature of living under someone as ruthless as Saddam Hussein. At the very least, it does not show the entire picture.However, all of the distortion and stretching does not change the core themes of the movie that are true. The amazingly close and special relationship between the Bushes and the Saudis. The conflict of interest in using government contacts to make money through the Carlyle Group, Haliburton, and other companies. The truly horrific and chaotic and brutal concept of committing a country to war. The fact that their is no clean-cut, finely tuned, accurate war that only harms the bad guys in Iraq and largely leaves the "good" Iraqis free from all but the most minimal collateral damage. This is an illusion propagated by some in the administration. (i.e. Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz). The movie contains powerful and moving images of people affected on both sides of the war. It also mocks and in some cases humiliates members of the administration. The most damning part of the movie for me was when Bush was told about the second plane flying into the World Trade Center as he read to school children in Florida, and he just stupidly sits there for seven precious minutes and looks indecisive, scared, and unsure.This movie is obviously a highly partisan attempt to get Bush out of office. In many respects, it is misleading. However it is no more misleading then the bombardment of information we have been getting out of Washington for the past four years. The real central fact is that it shows how desperate America wants an oppositional press. Most of the clips from Michael Moore's movie has been pulled from mainstream media news. The mere fact that mainstream media does not provide the type of critical, and oppositional role to the government is distressing. The American people wants a media that challenges the government, not one that vacillates between blind drum-beating regurgitation of the government line and hyperventilation over scandals.The American people are so desperate for an oppositional press that challenges the government instead of bows to it that they are willing to take time out of their day, and money out of their wallets, to get it in a movie theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is going to win another Oscar. It was well done, showing evidence that is tangible and researchable. It showed footage of men and women in Iraq fighting, talking about what has been happening and their opinions of the war. It showed the connectable links between the Bush family and the Bin Laden family, in a thorough and direct way. There was not a dry tear in the room during multiple scenes. Everyone stood and clapped at the end of the film. A memorable scene was when a congressman was talking about how he had a toll free number people could call him at, and since he never released it, Michael Moore put his office number on screen.Keep your eyes open as you read people's opinions, badmouthing the movie. They may say it is Anti-American, they may say it is full of lies, but no comment earlier than mine has actually seen the movie. The ranking for this film is 6.4, because you can see that over 30 percent of the votes went to a 1 out of ten. Almost every other vote went to 10. I am not saying this film was a ten out of ten, I am displaying the corrupt attempts to judge this film, BEFORE IT WAS EVEN AVAILABLE to the general public. Watch this film and see for yourself the opinion and proof of the War on Terror.8 and a half out of 10.High points: Correct and verifiable information, attempting truth and hard boiled investigative reporting. Low points: Got tiresome near the middle, a large amount of information to digest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore once again offers his two sense on world issues, this time at the Bush administration's bungled handling of 9/11 and the 'war on terror.' Fahrenheit is a bit more serious than his prior film, Bowling for Columbine, but retains the occasional humor, in the form of unintentionally humorous clips for politicians on camera, that makes his films enjoyable. Like all of Moore's work, it must be taken with a fine pinch of salt. However, Moore provides solid arguments and presents many questions for viewers to discuss after they've vacated the theater (a movie that makes you think? - the pain!). Many of Moore's critics will claim that the film is full of 'lies' but will have neither the information, nor the gumption to back up their claims with facts that would prove Moore wrong -- see it for yourself and make your own decisions.</fullReview>

He makes sure you know that not a single member of the (1/2 Democratic) Senate lifted a finger to help the heart-wrenching army of disenfranchised blacks testifying one after the next at W's confirmation hearing, and makes sure you sit and watch footage of Democratic Captains happily rubber-stamping Bush's Iraqi fiasco.Tears will flow, and heads will shake in aghast disbelief. Heartstrings will likely not remain unplucked. If you support the guy, there isn't a lot of joy for you. Moore's got his facts down pretty solidly. You might try to call it 'bad cinema', but it's simply not - actually, it's riveting. You might shoot spitballs at this minor point or that, but taken as a whole, well, Fahrenheit 9/11 is an indefensible juggernaut, factually and emotionally.If you hate the guy, you'll be real glad Moore is on your side. The Neocons in a free America (sic?) can certainly screen their alternative version, but good luck. This time, Moore is the age-old 'hard act to follow', and they'll certainly need it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THINK - it's patriotic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i sincerely wish someone else's name was above the title - because moore's name puts off a lot of people who really should go and see the movie because their votes can make a difference in november. and i can tell you - every American should see this movie. if for nothing else,just to have a chance to make one's own opinion, as opposed to be told what to think by our politicians or/and the media. but enough of that: as a movie, F 9-11 is the most disciplined, inteligent and powerful movie MM has ever made... although it is still more of a personal essay than a documentary. if there is something i could wish for, it would perhaps be better if the director/writer would stick to one issue instead of trying to point out all things that have gone terribly wrong in the last four years; moore should have focused more on how bush and his people handled 9-11, and used it to justify a war which American people would never support if they were not mislead about iraq's connection with al-quaida. still, it is a great piece of work, almost free of MM's (in)famous wisecracking jokes and the presence of the man himself. most of it is really not funny at all: it's as bitter and harrowing as a movie about war and dying can get (forget the sanitized TV coverage). and is guaranteed to get you angry, no matter what your politics. but in this case angry is good: if only 1% of those people who left their theater as upset and shocked and moved as I was will do something about it, maybe there is still a chance things will be set right again in the home of the brave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore is a Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a child, my parents &amp; teachers (&amp; especially, Sunday School teachers) told me it was very important to stand up for what is right, no matter what anybody said. I wonder how many instructors of the young are still telling their children that? Michael Moore is an example for all of us of a person who dares to stand up for the values of honesty, responsibility &amp; fairness. The most important point he is making in this movie is the immorality of using the children of poor people to fight a war for the benefit of the rich. If all the young people who see this movie understand how unfair this is &amp; get registered to vote, George W. Bush can be defeated in November.One additional note: the image of GWB that continually haunts me is his mockery of the young woman who converted to Christianity while on death row in Texas, became a model prison citizen, and pleaded with him for her life. It was not enough that he sent her to her death, but his making fun of her desperation continues to characterize him as totally lacking in empathy and compassion. I'm sure, if he ever sees this movie, he will find the bereft mother in Flint MI equally amusing, but I think she is the strongest character in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore has created a work of art. No new information was revealed in the movie; rather he has digested the facts and packaged them in a coherent order so that we learn that Bush, his friends, and his Saudi benefactors are the true beneficiaries of the terrorist strike of September 11, 2001.It played to a sold-out audience. I had never heard of such a crowd at a documentary. Nearly all clapped and cheered for the film.It is a shame that this site already has so many comments from right-wingers and Bush supporters who have not seen the film.

		<fullReview>Good movie overall, my standards were satisfied. Micheal Moore seemed to take a back seat to the subject matter with this one. A masterfully edited collection of footage of George W. Bush acting like an idiot combined with grim war footage, occasional Micheal Moore moments, terrorist and foreign news footage. Occasionally funny, often sad, very aggravating information was woven together to deliver a tough punch to the Bush team. This one's for the liberals, the democrats, the other Americans who feel that they're not accounted for by this White House, and ALL OF EUROPE, too! Can't forget THE REST OF THE WORLD! Anyway, good movie, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE was better and hard to live up to, but F9/11 should act as a wake-up call to America to do something about these terrorists of our Government, these money-hungry billionaires who care for nothing but their fat wallets! I love America, I am Jason, a film maker from Mass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore obviously takes great liberties with the information he obtains. He stretches the facts he finds to create an image of a person or situation that is usually one-dimensional and oversimplified. He never lies outright however, and the depth and breadth of his fact findings are impressive. He obtained Bush's military records uncensored in 2000 years before it became an issue. The same with inhumane treatment of Iraqi's by American forces in Iraq. His details of the extent of Bush family's ties to the Saudi's and the private weapons manufacturers are impressive.There are blatant manipulations of emotions in the movie as well. The pictures of smiling Iraqis flying kites and peacefully eating in cafes before the U.S. invasion is manipulative and masks the nature of living under someone as ruthless as Saddam Hussein. At the very least, it does not show the entire picture.However, all of the distortion and stretching does not change the core themes of the movie that are true. The amazingly close and special relationship between the Bushes and the Saudis. The conflict of interest in using government contacts to make money through the Carlyle Group, Haliburton, and other companies. The truly horrific and chaotic and brutal concept of committing a country to war. The fact that their is no clean-cut, finely tuned, accurate war that only harms the bad guys in Iraq and largely leaves the "good" Iraqis free from all but the most minimal collateral damage. This is an illusion propagated by some in the administration. (i.e. Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz). The movie contains powerful and moving images of people affected on both sides of the war. It also mocks and in some cases humiliates members of the administration. The most damning part of the movie for me was when Bush was told about the second plane flying into the World Trade Center as he read to school children in Florida, and he just stupidly sits there for seven precious minutes and looks indecisive, scared, and unsure.This movie is obviously a highly partisan attempt to get Bush out of office. In many respects, it is misleading. However it is no more misleading then the bombardment of information we have been getting out of Washington for the past four years. The real central fact is that it shows how desperate America wants an oppositional press. Most of the clips from Michael Moore's movie has been pulled from mainstream media news. The mere fact that mainstream media does not provide the type of critical, and oppositional role to the government is distressing. The American people wants a media that challenges the government, not one that vacillates between blind drum-beating regurgitation of the government line and hyperventilation over scandals.The American people are so desperate for an oppositional press that challenges the government instead of bows to it that they are willing to take time out of their day, and money out of their wallets, to get it in a movie theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is going to win another Oscar. It was well done, showing evidence that is tangible and researchable. It showed footage of men and women in Iraq fighting, talking about what has been happening and their opinions of the war. It showed the connectable links between the Bush family and the Bin Laden family, in a thorough and direct way. There was not a dry tear in the room during multiple scenes. Everyone stood and clapped at the end of the film. A memorable scene was when a congressman was talking about how he had a toll free number people could call him at, and since he never released it, Michael Moore put his office number on screen.Keep your eyes open as you read people's opinions, badmouthing the movie. They may say it is Anti-American, they may say it is full of lies, but no comment earlier than mine has actually seen the movie. The ranking for this film is 6.4, because you can see that over 30 percent of the votes went to a 1 out of ten. Almost every other vote went to 10. I am not saying this film was a ten out of ten, I am displaying the corrupt attempts to judge this film, BEFORE IT WAS EVEN AVAILABLE to the general public. Watch this film and see for yourself the opinion and proof of the War on Terror.8 and a half out of 10.High points: Correct and verifiable information, attempting truth and hard boiled investigative reporting. Low points: Got tiresome near the middle, a large amount of information to digest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and Captivating Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore once again offers his two sense on world issues, this time at the Bush administration's bungled handling of 9/11 and the 'war on terror.' Fahrenheit is a bit more serious than his prior film, Bowling for Columbine, but retains the occasional humor, in the form of unintentionally humorous clips for politicians on camera, that makes his films enjoyable. Like all of Moore's work, it must be taken with a fine pinch of salt. However, Moore provides solid arguments and presents many questions for viewers to discuss after they've vacated the theater (a movie that makes you think? - the pain!). Many of Moore's critics will claim that the film is full of 'lies' but will have neither the information, nor the gumption to back up their claims with facts that would prove Moore wrong -- see it for yourself and make your own decisions.</fullReview>

Do NOT listen to ANYONE'S well-meaning review, ill-meaning put-down, or worst yet - uninformed dismissal. You truly owe it to yourself to experience this film on your own. If you like Bush, you certainly will not agree with much of the material focusing explicitly on him, but there is so much more than this to experience and learn from. There's been so much quibbling here and there about whether one point or another is factually accurate - usually the case about Saudis being allowed to fly out of the country after 9/11. But bear in mind, so much of this film is simply eye-witness footage of actual events. Like Groucho said "Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?"

		<shortDescription>Just what this country needed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter what your political point of view is, this movie will stir something up inside the audience that for once will get people motivated and not scared. A great point was made in this movie about how the people in power keep us afraid and go to war to make sure that the structure of society stays in place. And for too long we, as a nation, have been told to be afraid and to not ask questions about the policy in America (because that would be un-American). This movie will cause more people to think for themselves. No matter what the political outcome in this movie is, the fact that people can now be empowered to go and make up their own mind about what is happening to our country, rather than taking what is being force feed to them on national news. Another great aspect of this movie's fallout will be that it can, and will, be a topic of debate which will spread even more ideas that what has already been expressed in this movie. Even more so, people will realize that what they hear and what they thought was true, just is not. Debate and free expression is what made this country what it is, and this movie is the perfect way to spark even more discussions and allowing people to not be afraid to speak their mind and say "You know, I don't like what my country is doing, and here's why...". That point of view isn't expressed enough today in our open media, and I hope that this film will start that again. No matter what your political view is, go see this movie, if not to just be more informed. I applaud Michael Moore for having made this film at this time, right when American needed it. For too long there has been a plethora of propaganda for George Bush and his crew. It's about time that there was equal propaganda against George Bush and it was presented in such a way that all America is aware of it and can judge it for themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Just An Attack on Bush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having actually seen "Fahrenheit 9/11," I can say that there is more to Michael Moore's film than meets the eye. Sure it's an attack on Bush and his foreign policy, but what resonates the most about this film is the human stories about the men and women that have fought in Iraq.The fact remains that the mass media doesn't seem particularly interested in showing what it is like for the average American soldier fighting in Iraq. When was the last time that you saw a news piece on a specific soldier that was killed and effect that the soldier's death has on a family?Another thing that really struck me about this film is the hypocrisy of Members of Congress who voted for war, but whose children are noticeablely absent from the battlefields. According to the film, only one Congressman has a child fighting in Iraq. This is not merely a partisan attack, but one that crosses all party lines. Of course who is the war being fought by? The poor and unemployed. This is made particularly clear when Moore follows two recruiters in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. With an official unemployment rate of 17%, the military offers one of the few opportunities for the town's young people to find gainful employment. It's a sad commentary.Overall, "Fahrenheit 9/11" will not sway highly partisan voters one way or another. However, it may get a few people to examine U.S. foreign policy more closely and our treatment of veterans in general, which is definitely a good thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike many "reviews" here placed by our fellow Bush worshippers, this one is real. Written by a guy who saw the movie on opening day (June 23rd) in New York City.It's hard to give an unbiased critique of this film, because there's nothing unbiased about it. But I'll try.If you hate Bush, this is going to be just more fodder and there's nothing here you don't already know. If you love Bush, all of Moore's manipulations, scenes taken out of context and half-explained conspiracy theories won't lean you out of the right.This movie is directed to the undecided. The young girl or guy who think politics don't affect their lives and don't really matter. The suburban, middle-America mallrat who wouldn't watch five minutes of CNN or Fox News if it meant their lives. To those, this movie is where it will hit hard. No wonder someone (maybe unintentionally) is trying to stop these kids from watching it with an R rating.Moore's message is clear: Get Bush out of the White House. If these people I'm talking about watch it, it may fulfill its purpose. Not without the help of Mr. Dubya himself, who Moore intelligently uses as the film's comic relief. I believe no comedian can play a Dubya as goofy as the man himself. This is the movie's more persuasive vehicle, because after a while of watching how his policies are shafting the poor American working class, you don't find anything funny about his goofiness.Unfortunately, Fahrenheit is not perfect. Moore dumbs down a lot of theories and uses cheap manipulation to reach a broader audience. It makes the movie more accessible, but also more likely to be a target of ridicule by his detractors. Spoiler: (One of his many manipulative scenes show Iraqi children playing happy and free days before the war. Although it's true, it's only a half-true given to make a point).Despite what right wingers say, one thing that I sensed during the whole film is Moore's patriotism. I believe there's nothing more American than championing the little guy. That's what Moore does.His portrayal of politicians and the media being cowards, cheerleading Bush just out of fear of being intimidated by bullies who also swarm this Web site with faux reviews, faux votes and faux patriotism is very accurate.Finally someone has the courage to stand up to these bullies. It's time for the little guy to fight back. This movie made me proud of being an American. I should make you proud too.</fullReview>

Perhaps a film can sneak out truth when the media is completely owned by the power machine.May this film end up being an inverse Triumph Of The Will - a creatively expressed exposure of the greed-will of this regime, and wake up the masses before it is too late.</fullReview>

At times it isn't completely fair, but it is unfair in these cases in the service of entertainment rather than politics.I realize that a lot of Bush supporters are criticizing this movie, mostly without having seen it.

		<shortDescription>Powerful, provocative, patriotic, prescient -- a must see for ALL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" is a powerful and sobering documentary that takes dead aim at the current occupant of the White House, using savage satire and unrefutable facts heretofore ignored by the mainstream American media. Wait till you see revealing footage that the media left on the cutting room floor -- footage of Rice and Powell in 2001, of Wolfowitz during the opening credits(!) and of a smirking president on camera, seconds before he announces the start of attacks on Iraq on March 19, 2003.Moore leaves no stone unturned and his moving, disturbing, humorous, incisive and deeply thought-provoking exploration of an America hijacked not once (by 19 Saudis on 9/11) but twice (by a Bush Administration bent on war, fear and lies) will leave even the most die-hard conservatives dumb-founded.There are many subjects covered aside from Iraq, the Patriot Act, Abu Ghraib tortures, the 2000 presidential election theft, Bush-Bin Laden connections and the painful, heartwrenching story of a Flint, Michigan native whose son fights in Iraq. The film also shows the despairing ignorance of some of our own fellow Americans, in one particularly anguished scene.There's lots more. You must see this film. When you do, you will see why those opposed to Moore's politics are trying to stop this film from seeing the light of day.This film isn't about Moore. It's about the truth that we here in the United States have had hidden from us from a compliant and intimidated mainstream media. Instead of trying to stifle "Fahrenheit 9/11" those opposed should make a pro-Bush film. If those who don't like Moore claim to be flag-waving patriots, perhaps they should remember that exercising free-speech is a patriotic and constitutional right. Stifling speech is un-American and un-patriotic.</fullReview>

The German people approved what the regime did and their fantasy of a 1000 year reign lasted less than a decade. Bad things happen to bad regimes, and it is happening to us. I would hope that most Americans who see the "Left" as a problem would read about the history of "the left" and compare the deeds of the "RIGHT WING" dictatorships of world history to hopefully make an intelligent connection. What is happening here in America, to those of us who saw the 3rd Reich come to power and control all aspects of German life, especially the judiciary, and the destruction they created, is very similar. An old saying says, "The truth shall set you free." But in contrast to today's media controlled rhetoric, it should be "The ACCEPTANCE of truth shall set you free." Of course, one assumes we are learned enough to know the difference.We, as free Americans, need to have more "leftist propaganda", as Fahrenheit 9/11, if for no other reason than to check the "Neo-Cons" attempt at controlling American hearts and minds and to give us ALL a chance to DEBATE, not be dictated to, which direction we want OUR country to move.God Bless the True American FREE Spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Just Another 9/11 Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the more insightful and purposeful 9/11 documentaries. Although it's being promoted as "shocking" and "revelatory" it's unlikely that anyone over the age of 15 will be surprised to find out that presidents lie and war is all about corporate profiteering. Of course it's intentionally "controversial" and skewed in its presentation, it is extremely well done and fascinating in many ways. Isuspect the people who voted it a 1/10 probably haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHY?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I HAVE seen this movie! If I had the money, ties, ability and resources, I certainly would be making similar films along with Mr. Moore. I seriously question the previous gentleman's ability to really, logically consider any other views other than those he sees with blinders on. Just for once, I would like to see a person, who maybe disagrees with the other's general views, just take a moment and think ? hm, I wonder if -- -??and do some checking ? you know? That would be refreshing. I do it! Why can't you?I do agree with him on his last quote 'The world is in trouble and if we don't face facts and make positive changes soon, game over.'Now, back to logic?.. If Michael Moore was in this 'business' to be on 60 minutes or any show for that matter, for fame and fortune as his real motive, wouldn't you 'logically' think it would be easier, less of a tap dance, or risk of being rejected for major distribution - to make films similar to those of - say - Spielberg? Or a cute little Pixar? I am not making a joke there ? think about it?..ask ? I wonder if?......Antics? &lt;burst of laughter&gt; Whatever it takes. Michael Moore handles himself as well as can be expected when dealing with what he does - - more change in his [Moore's] pockets means more eye opening films though - - ? that IS his agenda. Moore is the one that goes around the room and slaps everybody that is sleeping. I am one of the few Americans that I witness everyday that asks why, when, where?.no matter what, not only because part of my salary pays Bush's salary, but I want to know what he's up to. The Gross National Product still comes from my hard work as well as yours.This film is a breath of fresh air! I can't wait to see it again!What real gain is Michael Moore getting from releasing a film exposing a sitting President? (who, by the way, we have all seemed to have forgotten his and Jebb Bush's "Enron-ish" S&amp;L scandal back in the 80's when Daddy was Pres ? (I think Martha Stuart was beginning to build a nice empire around that time, but was unfortunately not reading the newspapers)What Mr. Moore is gaining is: 1. the attention that is very difficult to get out of this entertainment obsessed generation, 2. the same attention 'The Passion' received?..with its 'scandalous, controversial content' - - - in spite of what Mickey Mouse thinks.AND?..he is by far setting a truly patriotic example for the rest of us.Please?..on the tired subject of Clinton - - a public sex scandal is a very human error in judgment perhaps, but [back to Jebb and George W.] a large, pre-calculated, illegal, financial scandal is riddled with evil intention without regard to anyone human. Getting away with it is even worse. Unjustified war using innocent men and women seeking college tuition assistance, to propel that war, is NOT human. So many times lately I have heard President Bush's caprice behavior being weighed against something Clinton did in the oval office with an intern. Yes, Clinton did point his finger at the camera and flat out lie, - - - - - - - - - - but people ? &amp; Rush ? you too! there is NO excuse for such a lame comparison WHATSOEVER. I mean, it's really not even very funny anymore. Let's get out of the 'high school' thought processing.What Michael Moore is doing with all of the films he has released is something I should be doing, YOU should be doing. I need to be writing more of these letters, You should be too. He is doing his part, with the talents and resources he has, Moore and more people need to be doing this - to wrestle awake the people who are turning a blind eye, or who just aren't paying attention. This film is education for a country that is quickly losing its claim to the Bill of Rights and its original Constitution, and the people driving this bus are the ones WE are paying. There are so few ways to really get American's attention anymore. We are glued to the couch watching some form of tragedy unfold on the 6' O clock news. This is just a guess, but I would imagine only 1 out of about 50,000 tune in to C-SPAN??.they would rather watch 'Friends' than watch Congress slide a very dangerous Patriot Act across their tables during some quiet afternoon session in DC.Yes, both "Democrats and Republicans" have contributed, however Bush HAS exploited 9/11 and has used its incredible staying power to accelerate whatever agenda is being played out in front of us.Michael Moore caught this when it happened. I did too! But I didn't forget about it or ignore it. I sat up and said - -whooa!!!! He IS saying something about it, DOING something about it, CREATING a new awareness. I hear NOTHING being said OUTLOUD - no protesting, No LOUD, VERBAL, screaming or boycotting about the inexcusable increase in the nation's gas prices over the past few months - have we all been conditioned to just ACCEPT things like this? I haven't. But I also don't complain to the attendant and leave and forget about it ? he/she doesn't care and can't do anything about it! My congressman hears about it EVERYDAY that the price moves upward. I seriously doubt that President Bush has physically filled a car with a tank of gas in about 20 years -- if that. He is out of touch with humanity. I swear he is! I certainly hope that Michael's next documentary touches on this a little more!! Do you have any pictures of George W or Mrs. Bush at an Exxon station at the pump chit-chatting with the other 'Soccer Mom's' Michael?So in closing, my final gesture with this very outspoken commentary is:Before one starts calling the other a liar or a publicity seeker, for having the courage in this country to come out with something with controversial - visual impact and try his hardest to make it PUBLIC...... please examine in your own heart and soul (I mean it seriously), based on the current trends and events, where you see the state of this poor country in 5 years. Because this IS YOUR country too, and if YOU personally don't do anything to defend it here on our soil, it won't be yours to defend very very soon. It will belong to someone, but not you or me.Thanks - - and have a good day.... 'The end result of TRYING?.is HAVING TRIED?..'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timely and powerful masterpiece of political documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time this film is actually released on June 25th, there will probably be thousands of misleading reviews and comments about Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" posted on IMDb by people who have not even seen the movie. As I write this, there are already nearly 1,000 votes posted even though the film's premier at the Cannes Film Festival was less than a month ago, and the first U.S. screenings occurred two nights ago in Los Angeles.Mr. Moore's film delves bravely and surprisingly cautiously into the battle for truth in America politics. In one of the most insightful scenes in Mr. Moore's film, an anonymous woman approaches Moore's crew as they film the mother of a recently deceased American soldier talking and sympathizing with an elderly Iraqi war protester outside of the White House. "This is all a set-up, don't believe it," she announces to the audience. The grieving mother confronts the accuser and tearfully argues, "My son is dead. MY son. Why?""Fahrenheit 9/11" asks many questions like these, but the fact that no concrete answers are suggested is a testament to Mr. Moore's newfound restraint. The arguments and evidence presented in the film are, for the most part, not new; they are can be found in print and television journalism, recent investigative books like "Plan of Attack" (which the White House unbelievably recommended on its website when it was released last month) and "Ghost Wars," from public statements by the Bush administration itself, and from other sources like the incredible speech delivered by Al Gore for moveon.org in May. A great deal of the most effective footage, like the tragic footage of numerous African American members of Congress protesting the Supreme Court's decision to stop the Florida recounts, which they argue constituted nothing less than the disenfranchisement of hundreds of mostly African- American voters, was probably shown to a tiny audience on C-SPAN and never seen since. Moore's film is the only place where all such relevant material can be found in the same place, and an honest, critical documentary like this is badly needed if only because the incredible secrecy of the Bush administration seems to have silenced many of its potential critics. Most of the reviewers who have posted negative comments of this film complain that it is political propaganda, and there is no denying that Moore advances a very specific political agenda. What these single-minded critics fail to recognize that if anything Mr. Moore says is true, and almost all of it seems to be, there is a great deal more at stake than everyday politics in the upcoming presidential election. This is a film everyone should see, period. It will likely prove to be the most widely-seen, most controversial, and most politically influential documentary feature ever released. It is also incredibly moving, incredibly funny, and incredibly entertaining. If it gets an R rating, parents should be aware that it earned this rating for the same footage of atrocities and war violence that can be seen on the TV news.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing..there are over 600 comments already. I know there is no way to enforce it, but comments should only be added once you have actually SEEN the movie. It is just like Moore's Bowling for Columbine. So many have never seen it yet assume they know what it is about. It is NOT a political movie, and it is NOT about gun control. And, it (except for a VERY small part) is NOT about that terrible event. It is about our propensity in this country, like no other country, for violence, for which guns are just one tool. He does explore why Americans are so afraid and feel the need to have a gun, and how events in our history led to that. Please, rent that movie. It is not what you think. Then, refute or argue what he presents as facts or opinions, not about his political leanings. I.e., don't attack the messenger for that or this new movie. Please see the movies, then argue the facts or opinions, not the messenger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a series of Moore lies. The author is an obvious Bush basher. OK Bash Bush, but tell the truth not innuendos and half truths. This was the communist approach when criticizing the US during the cold war. A film maker can make anyone look bad when their speeches are butchered. Let that up to the late night comedians. All of the presidents have taken a terrible beating from the press and media in general. Why would anyone want to run for public office ? This writer wouldn't, I don't have the courage.Moore did a good job of filming and editing when he produced the movie, Roger and me. For this he had my admiration. When he commented on a number of interviews on television shows I felt that he held his own. He was able to make a point of the selfishness and disregard of GM tycoons that were very inconsiderate of the workers, who made General Motors, when they moved some of their factories out of the US.</fullReview>

It is unflinchingly real even though I know there will be a lot of mindless vitriolic denials. That's still a river in Egypt and this film could be the first step in a twelve step program for recovery. The Palm d'Or is not a French award -- it's an international film festival and the most prestigious in the world. There was only one French judge on the panel.

		<fullReview>i do not like our current president, nor his administration. I believe that our country, and ultimately the world, could benefit from giving his job and other top jobs in government to people with a purely fresh perspective. I believe these things because i watch the news, daily. i have been since 9/11. According to "actual" reviews i've read right here, this movie is a fishing trip through all the news i've heard concerning my countries current administration. only this is the uncensored version. i guess that means that this movie goes over why other countries hate America so much. Why can't Americans just embrace an alternative source of truth. Michael Moore's main point in his last movie, his award-winning record breaking last movie, is that America is a country engulfed in fear. Millions and millions of Americans are rapidly turning to drugs that treat depression and anxiety because of how uptight the next American is making them. most skeptics I know are becoming bitter and old and trying desperately not to care anymore. Michael moore's movies, much like quentin Tarantino's movies, really inspire me and make me think that if i had more confidence in my intelligence and in my art that maybe i can make a difference. That's how art has survived anyhow, and to simply choose not to see this movie on the grounds that you are a non-liberal republican....well, that's a sad sad sad example and if you're on this movie-website reading this then my heart goes out to you. because i know you need it. Chris Rock, our countries' smartest comedian, said recently "anyone who makes up there mind before actually tackling the issue is an idiot. The movie begins on september 11th. All flights are cancelled. The only people in the air after 12p.m. that day we're the navy and . . .people with the last name bin laden. Then, Michael Moore plays in the can of worms like only he can. He's an artist at it. He finds a relationship between the bushes and the bin ladens, a relationship that ultimately brought our tallest, and border-lined poorly constructed, skyscrapers down. Then, he dives into how our greediest corporations needed this and that to happen just for oil's sake. Then he goes into how the patriot act was signed and put into effect even before most people knew what it was. Then, he shows us footage of our troops in iraq on their best and worst behavior. And, of course, tieing flint michigan to everything. Moore gets to know some of the proud parents of "kids" overseas. In an incredibly sad moment, you see a 180 in perspective as a saddened mother of a dead soldier reads the last line of her last letter from him in which he claims that he believes that there isn't a viable reason that he's over there and that he's mad at mr. bush because of it. Famous last words, huh? Then, Michael Moore goes up and down capitol hill talking to whomever he can about what's going on. The famous filmmaker Jean-luc Goddard made the comment that Micheal is half intelligent and, in regards to this movie, doesn't know what he's doing. I don't believe anybody would know what there doing. Speilberg wouldn't know, nor kurasawa, nor scorsese, nor fellini, maybe not even god. This might end up being the most important mark that a movie has ever made - removing an ignorant president out of power. maybe, through michael, the apocalypse will be delayed. It's nice to see things you believe in coming in full circle. Hopefully, this movie will inspire me to actually vote this year. I never have, and once upon a time i thought i never would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The unfortunate thing about Michael Moore, is that he is so clearly an opportunist and a sensationalist. The even more unfortunate thing, is that this is becoming increasingly fashionable.I don't resent the fact that he has the liberty to say the things he does, to the contrary. i do resent the fact, however, that he doesn't have the common sense not to publicise them.His talent and intellect have often been put into question, for anyone who has read 'stupid white men,' i need say no more. This is what leads me to believe that he can only be after the limelight so rarely accorded a middle-aged, moderately talented film-maker... he became a middle-aged, moderately talented extremist making agit-prop - and there came the limelight. he's a little like picasso... there was considerable artistic talent there, but it became the servant of public opinion and money. he manipulated the fashion-bent art world just as Moore manipulates the scandal-bent masses.And with such a crucial election approaching for the United States' safety and international stature, he becomes more than a fool: he becomes a large-scale fool.Let's hope that the public can see past the media-hype, past perhaps even some of the Administration's admitted failures, and look towards a stronger future with a President who knows how to lead his country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First about the movie : Interesting... I'm pretty sure Michael Moore didn't just imagine everything he shows. I do support the content, but I'm not sure it's always brought up the good way...he holds out the stick to get beaten up. What I appreciated is the way he avoided to bring up the sensational and emotional part of 9/11. Concerning the Presidential Election and the relations between the Bush Family and the Saudi-Arabians, he stays more than correct and just reveals facts, no judgment. What I disliked is how he followed one family involved in the War in Irak with the loss of their son. I also found shocking the way the Sergeants in charge of recruitment proceed... it's like a game for them... and high five we have a new victim. No Comment. By the way, did you know that out of all the congressmen who supported the War decision, just one has a son fighting there. The others are not willing to comment or they give the 'family' excuse... to bad our 2 Sergeants thought that was a good reason to apply !! None the less, I would recommend this movie to everybody. Not just for the anti-Bush who's opinion will just be reinforced, but for all the others... don't be stubborn open your mind, stick to the facts and make your own opinion.Then about the Palme d'Or Award and the nasty french : Having had the chance to see a large part of the movies in competition in Cannes, I have to say F9/11 was one of the best. In the middle of 2 animation, one french and a bunch quite violent and dark movies... it's not such a bad choice. Wouldn't have been my choice, but I don't get to decide. There is most definitely in Tarentino's choice a will to make the polemic grow... mission accomplished. And don't bring up the argument (like I've already seen) about the bad french people wanting to make an example and teach you whatever... patin couffin (french expression)... there was just one french jury, and the rest of the country doesn't make the decision ! As for the tension between our 2 nations... check your personal background to make your own judgment and don't stick to what the media may be telling you. We don't hate you... as I'm pretty sure you don't really hate us either. Our opinions are just often different, but be sure we don't always agree with what our president says.</fullReview>

Whether you agree with Moore's political leanings or not, you should see this documentary in it's unedited entirety, if only to see a point of view that hasn't been politically disinfected and glossed up for Bush supporting media such as Fox News. It's not only worth seeing - it's essential viewing. If you view this documentary and dispute or disagree with the points raised in it, that's fine - however, I do worry that previous posters on this section of IMDb.com have dismissed Fahrenheit 911, some with anti-Moore venom, and later went on to admit they haven't actually viewed it. And that, surely, is something Michael Moore himself would be amused by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks a complete, coherent argument and ordinary production qualities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much of the criticism leveled at Fahrenheit 9/11 is about lies and misrepresentations. As far as I was concerned, the film's main problem is that it failed to deliver complete and singular line of thinking and came off as fairly incoherent.We are shown that all flights were grounded, but special treatment was given to the Bin Laden family to leave the US. It's implied that the George W or related federal government influences made this happen. So what do we take away from this? Well it seems that this open to interpretation and the nature of the relationship is not explained. Seems there's some sort on convoluted relationship, though what's the significance or point of it all? Sometimes I wondered whether more was implying some kind of larger conspiracy, but he doesn't! Though it's hard to pinpoint exactly what Moore is driving at by giving us all these facts, that are somewhat 'floating in space.' Similarly, George Bush didn't react quickly to news of the 9/11 attacks and allowed the children to read a story about a goat. This is seemingly significant, but why exactly??? Is Moore suggesting that Bush doesn't care? That he knew in advance? That he's an idiot? That he doesn't care about Americans? The US sent troops into the Middle East, but Bush didn't send enough and didn't send them fast enough and the terrorists all got away, but at the same time, it's terrible that the US military is even in there in the first place. Hmm... So is it a good or bad thing that terrorists were pursued?Recruitment for the military is directed at poor youngsters and African Americans. The people who have so little are always the first to take to arms in service of their country, Moore contends. It's a rightful and poignant point to make. Yet there's some kind of racism and overtones of lower-class inferiority in a capitalist society, which seem misplaced in the context of the film. The woeful and shallow-minded "Congress should send their children to fight in the war too" part seemed to open up a contradiction, as it seems to advocate sending more troops to war while also denouncing the war. It's all very... muddled. And constipated. It was like that classic mistake you made when writing essays in high school: you list a pile of facts that are relevant, but fail to use them to make a coherent argument and work to completely tie it all together. Combine this with the fact that the production qualities were poor. The handycam look interspersed with grainy news clips and and rigid editing gave it a cheap and 'college-level' feel. There's no doubt that this did not deserve the Palm D'or. While Tarantino assured Mike Moore that Fahrenheit 9/11 got the award for the film and not the politics, it's impossible to see how the judges felt that way and they clearly overlooked that this film/documentary is actually quite poor, regardless of the facts and politics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little theatrical but incredibly important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were wondering whether Michale Moore was a liberal or not 1. You're not very perceptive, and 2. This film will put all your speculation to rest. Fahrenheit 9/11 is Moore's documentary about the tragic events of September 11th, 2001 and how those events forever changed the United States of America. He examines the George W. Bush administration and how miserably they handled 9/11. He chronicles events leading up to the tragedy and the long unfortunate chain of events that followed. It's a film that completely backs the citizens of the United States and especially the soldiers who fought in Iraq, and also pulls every punch it can at the administration. It's a brutally honest film that is disturbingly shocking and tearfully sincere.I have the utmost respect for Michael Moore and what he does in his documentaries. He is great at putting together pieces of a puzzle and then explaining that puzzle to you. Granted, it's a little in your face and feels a bit preachy at times, but everything he says is what he means, and he doesn't hold back. Fahrenheit 9/11 can certainly be overzealous and a little too theatrical at times, but the essence of what this documentary is about is excellent and it accumulates some incredibly important information. This is an incredibly important film that is put together in such a clear and concise way that even the most skeptical viewer can walk away with something.There's a lot of anger and frustration built up in Moore that is evident throughout the film. This makes for a film that is fueled by a lot of pathos, but is truly driven by a logical breakdown of the actions of the Bush administration that threw this country into such unnecessary peril. Moore uses sarcasm constantly to exemplify his utter ferocity towards the administration and he ironically uses an uncomfortably lighthearted tone in the film to parallel with the gravity of what he is talking about. Sometimes this subtle anger undermines the logical points Moore wants to get across, but all in all it makes sense and comes together as something incredibly important and an argument well worth listening to.Fahrenheit 9/11 is a film that will you make you sad, angry, and disappointed, but it's all completely necessary. It's frustrating to see the things in this film come to light so clearly, and it exemplifies just how well Moore can get his point across. This is a must see documentary. Even if you don't love the way it is presented, the facts of Fahrenheit 9/11 are gravely important, and should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sordid spectacle rather than documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regardless of public opinion, there are interests beyond the surface of events, and with the rise of the media in the last century, especially television, the public has been intoxicated with information in such a degree, that even confronted with TRUE(Truth being just a concept, a matter of point of view)information, there remains much room for speculation, if one can recognize true from false information, in the first place. It must be clear to anybody past a certain age that there's a hierarchy in society(since the beginning of human society), and politics governs all human relations. In fact politics is the way humans interact with each other instinctively, it's a communication skill that can be taught and refined, and ultimately it's meant to manipulate. Everybody does it. Today there is a web of players and interests so complex, that even themselves cannot cover the entire picture at first glance. To pin the invasion of Irak on the Bush administration alone, as if their economic interests are the only ones that dictate world politics is childish, at best. Michael Moore takes recent traumatic events in American, Afghan, Iraqi and global history, exploits them in a simplistic, and partisan way("criticizing" the powers that be-thus gratifying the general public's need to find the sole?!? culprit for recent events), making a MTV-like, against establishment propaganda-video about events that unfold right in front of our eyes, and are not state secrets, but most of all using a comic undertone, taking things out of context and creating a hollow travesty(for example presenting the story of a young American casualty of war, pushing the camera into his grieving parents faces, getting the tears money-shot, and then making comic comments on their naivety and the "true" economic reasons behind invading Irak-while loud hard rock music is playing).You will not find crucial information(some of it has been willingly distorted in order to fit the big picture) or be shocked by lies uncovered, because this garbage is not meant to raise awareness but to entertain and capitalize. You will find yourself fed with Moores prefabricated conclusions, who just doesn't trust or want you to let you draw your own.I spit on this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I planned to see this movie, I didn't know what to expect. But this movie turned out to be so much more then I thought.It gives an insight on Bush and his first four years as president. It shows the many consequences that America had to face when Bush got elected. This movie is so revealing and mind-blowing, that it's unbelievable. It gives you an insight on how important politic really is, and how your vote can change everything. About how the choices we make, can effect us much more then we may realize. The hard-hitting truth. I believe that if every American saw this movie, then America would face a revolution. Because you realize the importance of your vote, and how you can change everything, if you want, by voting.No matter if you are interested in politics or not, or if you like Moore or not, or Bush, you have to see this movie. I can strongly recommend this movie to everybody and I hope that everyone will find it as surprisingly good as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very eye opening and revealing movie to make you think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been raised as a die hard republican. My cousin is even the governor of my state and was one of George W. Bush's friends and was also very involved in the Republican party in DC for many years. So I had been putting off watching this movie. I finally watched it on December 2, 2005. This movie has changed my view of the Bush leadership. When the movie showed about when Bush was at the elementary school and did not respond to the messages of the World Trade Center attacks, that really made me start to think what kind of president we really have. I have been hearing that he has taken a lot of vacations and time off while in office, but when I heard 42%, that made me irritated. I understand like George W. Bush stated that he doesn't have to be in the Oval Office to work but the times he spent on the golf course, at his ranch, and even on his yacht could have been spent better serving the American people that have put trust in him. As a proud American I would like to say that this is a movie that you NEED to see. All Americans owe it to themselves to watch this movie. I am not really how much of it is biased but it makes you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not as good as Bowling for Columbine!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his newest film Michael Moore criticized the politics of George W. Bush, the connections between the Bushes and the Bin Ladens and George W. Bush himself.The title Fahrenheit 9/11 is a dependence on the film Fahrenheit 451. This film deals with a police-state in which reading is forbidden and one firefighter is against this regime. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature when paper begins to burn. Fahrenheit 451 is a Science-Fiction film which was made in the United Kingdom in 1966.First Moore showed some scenes from the election campaign 2001 and that first every TV-channel said that Gore won in Florida. They said that when Gore won in Florida he would be President. CNN and CBS already declared that Al Gore won in Florida. However, FOX Channel claimed that Bush won in Florida and is President of the United States of America. Every TV-channel followed this statement, because it was a statement of FOX. The other TV-channels didn't do their own research. They just followed the FOX-statements, because it was FOX. The person in responsible for this statement was John Ellis, George W. Bush's cousin. Of course, many people and many independent people did research and after the recount Gore should won, but finally the highest court of justice decided that Bush won (Friends of George Bush senior voted.). Gore accepted this decision and so everyone has to accept that Bush was going to be the 43. President of the United States of America.Then Moore showed the inauguration. It's tradition that the President walks the 100 last meters before his speech, but Bush was the first President who went in the car. Many people demonstrated and they threw eggs on Bushes car.Then Mr. Moore presented that Bush couldn't deal with his new job and so he just went on vacation. He played golf and such stuff. Bush thinks that he does not have to sit in Washington to work. He can do this with telephone and fax. In another interview he said that he has to decide and work on something very important, but he couldn't say what it was. He just answered the interviewer:" You will see!" Well, then Moore shows President Bush in a school where he read out of a book together with the children. After some time the chief of staff came in and said:" Our land was attacked!" OK, you can't say if that is true, but Moore said it in his film. What did George do now? Nothing. He just sat in the school and didn't know what to do without his bodyguards and without his counselors. Well, that's how Moore described it. I think that when Bush would jump up, Moore would say:" What President is this? He has to relax and think before he does something! Please George: Think first and act later!" So, you can see this from both sides. On September 11 2001, 3000 people died because of these terrorists. After these attacks all flights were cancelled. Some people had to stay at the airports, even a superstar like Ricky Martin. However, after September 13, 2001, family members of the Bin Ladens and some other Saudis were allowed to get out of the States. Why that? 7 to 8 percent of the USA belong to the Saudis. They are important for the economy. Maybe they were allowed to "fly" because of this fact. It would have fatal reasons if they wanted all their money back. So, Bush said that it was Saddam's fault. Some experts say that the attack on Iraq was planned before the attacks on 9/11, but now Bush and his administration had a reason. Of course, they had to send soldiers to Afghanistan, because it would be dubious if they didn't. I think they sent just 10.000 or 11.000 soldiers to Afghanistan and I think that there are as many policemen in Manhattan. So, that's not much for one country. Moore shows very clever how often Bush brought Saddam and Al Kaida together in one sentence. He cut that very smart and after these cuts he shows a picture where Rumsfeld and Saddam met in 1983. That's bizarre. Step by step Moore came to Iraq War. He shows families who lost their children. That's very dramatic, so, Moore also asked some members of the Congress if they wouldn't send their children first into Iraq, but most of them didn't even listen to Moore. Then Michael Moore presented two soldiers who wanted to fascinate young people for the Army, but most of these youngsters didn't join the Army, because they are that patriotic. The didn't joined the army, because they think war is good. No, they joined the Army, because they need money. Who cut the money for most of the people except for the rich ones? Exactly, that was George W. Bush. In one speech Bush said to these rich ones:" Some call you the elite, I call you my basis!" Strong words by the President.Moore already made some statements about his film. He said that it's more important for him that Bush isn't reelected than getting an Oscar. He said that he wanted to see his film on television before the elections. If a film is already nine month (or before) in television after it was shown in the cinemas, it can't be nominated for the Oscar. However, that rule is just for documentaries. Moore meant that his film could be nominated as best film instead of best documentary. Some people believe that his film isn't a documentary anyway.I think FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is a good film, but I do not like it as much as BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. Maybe I just like it better, because after BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE I knew Moore's film style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is entertaining. How much of it is true? Well, define "true". Like other documentaries and too often news programmes the footage has been edited to give Michael Moore's version of the truth. In this he is no different to his opponents and peers.As with any such work you should not watch it in isolation if you are looking for truth rather than entertainment.There are some poignant scenes which make some thoughtful points. Not least regarding the US military recruitment process.I'd recommend the film to anyone. Very entertaining. Just take it with a pinch of salt as you would any news or documentary programme.

Best regards to M Moore but i wonder ,who paid him to do this documentary? Most likely the only "evil" people that were not brought to the stage ( or should i say backstage ) of war =the jews.Why isn't anyone showing the reality which concerns this matter ,that the jews rally have an influence on global funding and everything that has money in it??

		<fullReview>Normally I'm not the kind of guy that likes to watch documentaries but I made an exception for Fahrenheit 9/11. Michael Moore writes, produces,directs Fahrenheit 9/11 also directed Bowling for Culumbine. The documentary was made to expose the mistakes of the bush administration and all those involved. Also it shows where he was during the plane crashes in 2001 turns out he was reading to kids and stayed there for minutes.The film takes countless point of views whether it is on the front line on Capital Hill in front of a building or somewhere in the heartland of America. It was a true stroke of genius and a well thought out plot. The film can only give two things the truth of bush and the countless deaths over in Iraq from our soldiers. Tjis film is true and inspirational in ways. Such as standing up for the truth, and getting every answer possible. My ratings 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good documentary. I've heard many comments like "Ugh, it's not a documentary, it's lies", but quite frankly, there is little in here which was reported overseas at the times. "Documentary" to some people - particularly when they dislike what's been said, seems to imply it has to offer two sides of a story. This documentary is there to offer the side which most of the American media - particularly in my experience of living in the US - tries to ignore, and shouldn't.More than just the issue of Bush's validity as President - which in itself has been long documented as dubious by many sources - it really puts the war into the face of the viewer. The documentary - and the governments of the coalition know that war is a nasty thing, and the best way to retain public support is not to show them the nasty bits, the things you don't want to imagine happening to the innocents and our troops. But to justify a war you have to see all those elements, it may not be politically expedient, but it's ethically necessary that one doesn't blinker yourself to the real nastiness of what's happening.Freedom is a worthy outcome of any campaign, but when kids are being sent to die by their country, they and their parents need to be able to believe their sacrifice is for the right reason. That the blood and pain they will personally have to deal with is in the right course. When there are issues of business incentives, family grudges to resolve and international stability to consider as well, one has to look and ask whether these kids are being sent in for the right reasons. A soldier obeys without question, it just has to assume it's administration's reasons are beyond approach, that it is honouring it's country.These questions are the sort that I think will be foremost in the mind of anyone having watching this film, beyond the political issue of Bush.Yes, this is a journalistic. When the commentary says Bush wasn't in office much prior to 9/11, it offers amusing and silly images of Bush with so complementary music. So yes, in that respect one might say it's one sided in it's approach, but don't let that delude you from thinking the underline themes and facts are anything but accurate or close to the truth.A film which keeps the attention and both disturbs and opens your eyes. I know people refuse to watch it, but what does that prove? One shouldn't be scared of ideas even if you disagree with them. This isn't Moore spouting him beliefs on a podium, it's real images and factual evidence (which as I said, you'd find in the international media for years, it's nothing new in that respect. You don't have to like Moore to watch it, you just have to watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After the 2004 Election, Now the Film Serves as a Satirical Documentary that Chronicles These Four Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the director Michael Moore made Fahrenheit 9/11 as a political propaganda to have George W. Bush lose in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, regardless of its result, the main role of the film is over once the election was done. Though Bush won and the film's objective was unfulfilled, it had certainly produced notable effects during the election campaign; many on both sides must have learned about Bush's history from the film. Hats off to Moore, for that matter.Now after the election, what values does the film have? , Moore's almost primitive techniques of manipulation, mostly on editing, which might be installed to make the best impact on the U.S. entire population, could be an obstacle for the film to be an objectively documented masterpiece. In the future, the film may be likely viewed as a satirical or even cartoonish documentary that chronicles these bizarre four years under the Bush administration, from Bush's tricky victory in the 2000 election to 9/11 to the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Convincing argument, Moore's best work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a fan of Michael Moore. He's obnoxious, overbearing, and gets in the way of his own arguments by interjecting hypotheses that have no basis in fact. I hated Bowling for Columbine precisely because of this; Moore ranted without a coherent plot, point, or trajectory to his diatribe.That said, Fahrenheit 9/11 is by far Moore's best work. Granted, he has a lot of material to work with, and he still gets in the way of himself too often (i.e. why does he have to hypothesize what Bush is thinking as he sits in a Florida classroom the morning of 9/11? The shot itself conveys the point). However, he really does pull together many obscure and little-known facts--about the Bush family's relationship with the Saudis, about war profiteering, about recruitment of poor and minority individuals, about the U.S.'s involvement in a place where it had no business being--to make a coherent story that paints a frightening picture of our far-too-casual-in-the-face-of-war president. The movie is often gruesome, showing how the impact of the Iraq war goes beyond the unnecessary death toll--it's also reflected in the wounded citizens and military personnel--thousands upon thousands--whose lives are forever ruined, and in the perpetual state of fear it has put the country in when it was ostensibly supposed to do the opposite. Some scenes are simply stomach-turning.I am a borderline Republican with an open mind, and this film really opened my eyes. It may not have been done in the most pleasant or tactful way, but it introduces facts about Bush and Iraq that many people wouldn't otherwise know about, in a convenient, entertaining, emotionally-wrenching 2 hours. Recommended to anybody, Democrat or Republican, with an open mind. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How often do you get to see a film that transcends what we normally think of as a film? This "alternate reality" version of what happened during Bush's 1st term is bombastic &amp; provocative, yes, but many forget just how entertaining this film is. Skillfully put together and edited (with footage never seen before publicly) this rabble-rouser caused such an impact it's hard to believe this is "only" a film. There's humorous footage shown during the 1st half and some eye-opening material (Gore having to shut down the senators who were protesting the election, an ironic state of events; Bush reading My Pet Goat to the children, etc.) Then the 2nd half takes on a dead serious tone, raising questions about the reasons for going to war. This has the most powerful anti-war message since Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good piece of Investigative Journalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Story:The documentary has been built around the 9/11 attacks and what happened after. Moore blatantly charges the Bush Administration of being hand in glove with Saudi Oil businessmen and being incompetent to run a nation.It begins with Gore's defeat and Bush's victory in the US Presidential Elections 2000and Moore attempts to show that Bush was allegedly involved in manipulating the elections at Florida. The movie continues with a lot of such allegations that seem to have arisen from investigative journalism of Moore.The story also highlights the plight of those soldiers who have been living bad lives after being deputed to the war on Iraq. Moore however tries to justify that the entire war was a hoax and that Saddam was merely a scapegoat with the so-called WMD.Moore also demonstrates realism in which he asks Congressmen and Senators to ask their children to join the military and be sent to Iraq. Moore has captured their negative reactions on Camera!!Comment:Moore's work is a great piece of investigative journalism wherein he has attempted to show evidence against the most powerful man on earth. In an age where the fourth estate is stifled by even the most menial of the politicians, Moore's work is a star. This obviously speaks volumes about the writer's credibility.The documentary's narrative for the first half is filled with facts that have shades of humour. You wouldn't help laughing your heart out at Bush. An Indian viewer would suddenly feel proud that there are scientists and intellectuals at the helm of our country.The story of course has its negatives. The story of an Iraq veteran's mother has been stretched beyond tolerable limits (in fact, it at least covers 30-40% of the film). Moore's view would have been to portray one family in such vivid detail that the viewer would himself visualize the plight of the rest of the families. However, this idea seems to fall flat.Since the movie has a pure American focus, a non-American viewer like me might not have been able to appreciate the documentary in its full spirit. But, nevertheless, Moore's great work would definitely entertain you and you wouldn't complain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is just unbelievable to see so many people giving bad comments about this movie, especially Americans. It shows how patriotism and lack of information can sometimes blind supposedly the most civilized and free society.Although most the facts mentioned by Moore is arguable both ways, the fact remains that the war in Iraq NOW is about oil and money regardless of the reason why it started. There has never been a country in this new era which has helped other countries without evaluating the sacrifices and benefits involved. NO COUNTRY WOULD SACRIFICE ITS PEOPLE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ANOTHER COUNTRY. People need to understand that United States is no exception. This is no shame to the Americans. There simply cannot be any such country, developed or under developed. Having said that, I don't find anything wrong in Moore putting the whole blame on George Bush. He is the President of the nation. He is responsible for the action. If he is not to blame, who else should he blame? He doesn't need to blame the people for electing him because that is quite implied.In fact, the people are not to be blamed much since an ordinary citizen has got his own worries. He doesn't have time to think about big problems of nations including his own. That is why we call him an ordinary citizen. Moreover he never sees or is never allowed to see the big picture. All he does is quickly process the information he picks up from news papers, magazines, friends etc and come up with a view which he finds comfortable. He never bothers to critically analyze the information and ask questions. As time goes by, these views get more and more concrete simply because the information that he picks up later on would be the ones that strengthen his existing beliefs. He rejects all other information just because they do not really matter to him. They do not matter to him as long as it starts affecting his life and his feelings he holds dear. In a developed country like America this is particularly true because most people have what they basically need and are not really concerned about how others live. It is not their fault; it is plain simple human psychology. As long as the government supplies the ordinary citizen what he basically needs, it can be sure that he will not bother to ask unnecessary questions about why his government interferes in Iraq or other Middle East nations.But in all nations, there are not-so-ordinary citizens or intellectuals, who live for certain ideologies. These ideologies can be good or bad. Although what is good and bad is a debatable issue, it is good enough to assume that the principle of 'live and let live' is good and anything that does not follow that rule is bad. When these category of people break the rhythm of an ordinary citizen by providing him with information that is contrary to his belief it is quite natural to find repercussions. When someone loses their dear ones for a cause and if they pick up any information which suggests that the cause was unjust, it is quite ordinary to see what we saw in the movie. In this case, Moore broke people's rhythm by providing information that they otherwise would not like to hear.This movie is a very good eye opener to an ordinary American citizen. He needs to be more critical in what he picks up from CNN, MSNBC and BBC. He needs to understand that he has the right to get the right information. He needs to understand that what he sees may not be the full picture. He needs to understand that the other countries will judge him by the actions of his government. He needs to understand that American must not be built by oil from Iraq or Saudi Arabia, it must be built by Americans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that Fahrenheit 9/11 really struck a chord with me, and was, in my opinion, even better than most of the critics had claimed it was (and quite a few thought it was brilliant). I honestly don't get why so many people seem to hate Michael Moore when I don't think he has anything to gain by going against this Presidency. I mean, I didn't even think he was a Democrat, he was just a man, a citizen of this country, who decided to make a documentary about the negative side of President Bush and his politics that so many of the mainstream television stations never aired on their "news" programs. Sorry if people don't like an opposing view point, but unless the U.S. turns into a dictatorship, we are allowed to have differing opinions than you. People just assume that what we see on the news on television is accurate, or what we read in a magazine or newspaper are all the facts. Something like 6 different companies/corporations control all of the channels in the U.S., and it's a wonder that there are biases? The Sinclair Group plans on forcing it's channels to air an anti-Kerry slander campaign (propaganda is more like it) the day before the election. In a totally free, impartial society, a company wouldn't be allowed to force it's political views on us. I don't care how people vote because I can't control what other people do, but I can't comprehend why people won't at least give this film a chance and watch it. You don't have to agree with me that Fahrenheit 9/11 is an amazing film that shows the complexities of our nation and the world that we have impacted, a side that is often brushed under the carpet so that we can hear more of the same. That's it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't impressed at all by Moore's Oscar-winning Bowling for Columbine, for the next 3 reasons: - Fact too easily was mixed with fiction. - The idea and conclusion of the 'documentary' were unclear. - Michael Moore is an annoying brat.Now, although it is impossible to deny Moore still is that annoying and self-indulgent brat, Fahrenheit 9/11 makes sense, is clear in it's opinion and conclusion and is a work of some good journalism. Heck, I'd even call it a real documentary.Moore makes no mistake about this one: he hates Bush. He hates everything he stands for. He hates the fact Bush is America's first representative. So he hates everything the guy does, whether he's just to do so or not.So Moore uncovers some facts about the relationship between the Bin Ladens and the Bushes, makes clear a lot of people in office are there just because they're friends or partners of Double-Ya and finally concludes his story about the unjust war the coalition troops are fighting in Iraq.Sometimes Moore overplays his hand. Like when Bush is hearing the news of the attack while sitting in a classroom, reading to little kids. We see him ponder what just happens, there's a glimpse of disbelief in his eyes... but then, who wasn't in shock and disbelief that morning (or afternoon in these parts). I can't see why *that* would make him a bad president.Or the meeting Bush has a couple of days after the attacks, with the Saudi ambassador... it seems to me that would be an intelligent thing to do, to keep the Saudi's close and to make sure to get their help when trying to hunt down Bin Laden.But otherwise, Moore has learned his lesson from 'Columbine' and for most of the time sticks with the facts. Now, although I would love to hear him explain how he thinks Iraq, or for that matter, the world would look like if Saddam was still in charge, I understand it's just his job to uncover some of the lies the Bush administration have told the citizens of America. And in some ways, he's getting that job done.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crowning achievement for Moore...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the brink of war, documentary director Michael Moore, a man whose become synonymous with many labels depending on which political party you belong to, creates his next outrageous documentary/ expose which leans towards the left and garnered many a controversy.Exposing the motives behind the Iraq-American war from the United States, Moore manages to give a disturbing and rather intriguing look at the intentions behind the war, the intentions we were told, and what really happened while showing the things the news never shows, the suffering of the families of the soldiers, how Iraq is suffering just as much and maybe more than we are during this senseless conflict.I've never been much of a fan of Moore; he's an manipulative opportunist and "Bowling for Columbine" was a documentary with much potential that trailed into different topics, but Moore hits the mark with "Fahrenheit 9/11". Yes, you may suspect what my political leanings are by this review, and you may be right or wrong, but I won't tell straight out, because I don't want it to cloud my feelings for this movie. Whether or not this is a good documentary will not come into play. Whether or not this is a good movie depends on whether you support Bush or not.Now first off, there were just so many scenes during this that I felt were so strategically placed and out of context to prove Moore's point including some scenes involving Bush and some badly timed comments and jokes that, while not funny, seem to be put to make him come out in a less than positive light to the audience and it made me feel manipulated to buy what Moore was selling. Also, Moore continues in his least subtle more outrageous method of getting to his points by walking Capitol Hill and Washington asking senators to enlist their children to the military and by renting an Ice Cream truck reading the homeland security guidebook. Moore can get his points across in less outlandish ways, but then it wouldn't be a Michael Moore documentary if he didn't commit those acts, would it?Moore, who remained extra careful this time around hiring lawyers and a large team of fact checkers paints a portrait of a man who wasn't fit for presidency taking us to war because A) his family has ties to the Bin Laden's so we went to war with the easy target Iraq, and B) because he was an under-achiever attempting to live up to his father's career. It's safe to assume Bush does not come off well here depicted as a trigger happy cowboy, back stabbing worm, and a man incapable of running an organization let alone a country running three oil countries to the ground yet still remained an executive because of his connections.Moore shows the footage right at the beginning of the documentary of 9/11 where Bush was at a classroom reading with the students, he's told of the attack, and he sits for seven minutes with a grim expression. Moore meanwhile attempts to discover what was going through his head which looks a lot like horror, confusion and shock that his job just became serious. Moore manages to bring across an electric theme of tragedy, conspiracy and satire through funny mock commercials, witty narration (Moore only appears here in four short segments), and subtitles that undermine what a politician might point out.Meanwhile, he brings to the audience some insight on the government and their ties to other corporations and the obvious tampering of the polls to elect Bush to office, the government's dismissal of minorities who insist Bush wasn't elected honestly, not to mention he points out the government's method in instilling fear into American citizens in order to control them and their tampering of documents and taking away of our civil liberties in order to "protect us" from the bad terrorist men. Protection doesn't come through control, it comes through cooperation, something Moore states that the government is unwilling to abide by. Moore shows a government that wants to control the country and used the war as a stepping stone in doing so.Moore gives some really brisk film-making while explaining many points of the underlying themes of racism through recruiting as in cornering people in low class neighborhoods less like recruiters and more like car salesmen and we watch two recruiters joking and laughing at minorities as they pass them and declare them as marks giving them every reason why they should join even telling one person that the marines could help with their music career. Regardless of which political party you belong to, watch this documentary and become enlightened before you bash it or praise it.Moore doesn't only criticize our government's sketchy handling of 9/11 but he also manages to point out how insanely paranoid we are with one deputy in a small town sending a spy to infiltrate a small peace group. They weren't extremist hippies, just people like you and I who ate cookies and discussed politics, not to mention Moore exposes a government that's lost its priorities and bases its affairs more financially than what's important to its citizens.We've become a nation of people who fear and worry based on ridiculous routines such as the color coded bar which is basically useless. Moore does manage to reveal some interesting and astute points that, if you've followed politics intensely, will ring true. Now, as for his statement that the press is behind the government, I'd say they're more like that kid in the school yard that follows anyone as long as it means he'll be popular, they lean anywhere because it's all about the ratings.We also get to witness the suffering of people who really matter: families of the soldiers who went to Iraq, and families from Iraq who suffer everyday. We witness soldiers who were painted a pretty picture of war and some whom approach the war like a video game in some rather disturbing images, and realize they're really there for nothing and want to go home. Moore paints a portrait of many layers as we watch a mother suffering with the death of her son and appears at Washington to make peace and cry but is greeted with ignorance from witnesses. We see the usual shock footage Moore shows to bring across his point with most recent videos of Iraqi horror and we have to wonder if the violence was already there or did we just tempt them into aggression? Though, the ending gives no clear answer, it will bring about some sense of enlightenment hopefully and this is one of Moore's better more insightful documentaries in his career. The really good part of the DVD features despite the contents that hilariously spoof the utter senseless terrorist color meter, is the special ten minute segment profiling Arab comedians who have their very own tour mocking the misery they've encountered post 9/11. Though their misery during the last two years regarding name calling and being profiled as terrorist threats are horrible, they manage to make light of it with some very funny comedy, and that makes them real survivors.(***half out of ****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People often wonder why citizens of others nations don't like America. They think that we are envious or selfish or not understanding or simply prone to hatred. They say that we should hold ourselves fortunate because they saved us from the Germans. Not from the Nazis, though, since a few studies show how private interests (such as the Bush family's, among others) were pretty friendly with the bad guys in those times. But what went wrong with the Germans, after all? Look at them now, there are pretty decent guys in fact. What went wrong is that they happened to find themselves in such a political and social crisis, that when a loony with a lot of 'good ideas' took over the power, they just followed. His ideas were great. Hitler fought unemployment, he created housing and wealth, build amazing Autostrasse, offered free education to the youth? And in order to boost the economy, he went into massive colonialist war. 80 million smart people followed him, without a second thought. Sixty years later, beyond the Atlantic ocean, we have a very similar settings. A loony is promising jobs and wealth, advocating the virtues of Christianity, and even promising that he'll take care of our retarded kids. The price to pay is the same: massive colonialist pseudo- righteous wars. 300 millions people follow without a second thought? It is not about the Americans. We've got nothing against them. They're pretty decent guys after all.Freedom a speech is a wonderful liberty, but is there much more than half a dozen guys that make proper and decent use of it? Michael Moore does, as well as Mike, Mikey, Mickey and a couples clone of M.Moore. Anybody else has got something to say? Speak louder, please, we can't hear you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I received an urgent email from a republican friend who was sufficiently disappointed with Mr. Bush to insist that we see this film. I think Mr. Moore has shot a reputable documentary, and I did not feel that he was trying to change any determination a viewer had already made - my friend's recommendation speaks for itself. But what I really want to say is this: I believe the politician who was put on the line most urgently that day was actually Rudy Giuliani. The cafeteria food fight "red" and "blue" Americans are having over this film's portrayal of that day's most secondary Mr. Bush is getting in the way of intelligent discourse about the underlying problems that we must all address if we want to prevent our country from being besieged from without - and from within.

		<shortDescription>Moore masters the medium of cinema on his second major outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?Fahrenheit 9/11' is the most effecting cinematic experience of the year. It is super-liberal, far-left, borderline propaganda at times, from an exuberant film maker and personality who himself has some hypocrisies to answer for but the film's quality cannot be overlooked.The opening 10/15 minutes sums up the basis of Moore's book ?Stupid White Men' in which he claims Bush rigged the 2000 election in which he gained power, the way in which the election is shown and the protests in the Senate are played out is genuinely upsetting and shows his side of an argument he has mastered arguing for the past four years at its most passionate.That is the best way to look at the film, not to judge it on right or wrong or constantly considering the other side of the argument, save that for afterwards at the pub with the usual alcohol-inspired debate team. This is Michael Moore's argument and rarely has a side to a debate been so fantastically put across. Moore masters the medium of cinema on his second major outing after 2002's Oscar-winning ?Bowling for Columbine'. After a wonderful title sequence Bush is ridiculed, his every move as a president quashed from all sides, Moore brings out all the evidence to prove the incompetence of Bush Jr. but the film hits its most impactual moment when the title-date arrives. The screen goes entirely black and all we are left with is the haunting sounds of planes crashing into the Twin Towers and the chaos that ensues ? a perfect example of what you can't see being far worse than what you can, the image is not only unnecessary as we have seen them so much we are almost de-sensitised but it is far more impacting without it.Moore brings out the tear jerker moments again when he shows a staunch war supporter proud of her son in Iraq before the war then her change of feeling after he has died. Mixed in with this are moments where the audience collectively shakes their head in disbelief as the web of deceit and corruption inside American is shown for all to see alongside moments of hilarity as Moore shows Bush at his most repulsively idiotic.Overall ?Fahrenheit 9/11' is the most audacious presentation of Michael Moore's one-sided argument, it is not a fair review of George W. Bush and his government but its' not supposed to be. As long as you realise this and accept it you will find here a superb piece of documentary film making which thoroughly deserves its Palme d'Or. It transcends its most obvious themes of Bush, Iraq to make a fair greater and more haunting damnation on capitalism as a whole ? its super left-wing; it's an idealistic liberal viewpoint but its one hell of an argument. This should be seen by everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one can be lukewarm about this movie. Depending on their political affiliations, people will either love it or hate it. I thought it was powerful, shocking, and accurate. Although some people have criticized the movie for being biased, I find it closely follows information that has been available since 9/11 in books, newspapers, magazine articles, and news programs. In other words, the bias in this documentary comes from people in the Bush administration, not Michael Moore. They have condemned themselves with their own careless words and actions. He has merely documented it for all to see. Michael Moore has done us all a service for conflating a massive amount of information into a coherent account of what, after all, is the truth. I was stunned by some of the information that hasn't been shown us by the media; for example, the egg throwing and demonstration against George W. Bush in his limousine on the way to his inauguration. I'm beginning now to believe what I've heard about the media being supressed or biased in its reporting. A great documentary which I can't praise highly enough, and I have been phoning everyone I know to go and see it.</fullReview>

I applaud Michael Moore for something rather frightening when it comes down to it... simply exercising his right as an American to freedom of speech. This film beautifully blends the facts, along with Michael Moore's humour, and comedy by George W. that tops a lot of the stand up acts touring these days. It is a great feeling that in a time that ideas are suppressed in the sake of security from terror, that such a voice can continue a tradition of free speech. I can only hope aspiring filmmakers and voices out there will continue on with the tradition and provoke free ideas and speech beyond just one voice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an average documentary with deep and powerful moments. Thought, the few funny moments are, I think, more efficients. But, at the end, this one-sided documentary falls into the worst melo-drama instead of really proving something. Yes, of course, War is terrible. It's not what I call a Breaking discovery or a hidden truth, it's a fact. I think the intentions of the filmmaker were honest but I had the impression to only watch, a 2 hours commercial for the democratic party. Let's say it's a film of good willing who want what's best for the general interest. Like dictatures do.Does this film deserved the "Palme d'or" ? Truly not. It never should have been in competition in the first place : Tarantino (Jury president) and Moore having the same producer ! I think someone should do a documentary about the marketing of this, so-called censured, film in the states and, especially, overseas.As for the general quality of the work, I regulary watch documentaries on BBC or elsewhere who are masterpieces comparing to this. Farenheit is theorizing on how Bush administration put asleep the American people, but the film is acting with the same mechanic ! Always going on one exclusive direction. It's not even cynical. It's just a thick demonstration for people already convinced.</fullReview>

Why does another country own 7% of ours? A revolution is needed but the sheep are asleep in the field. Pacified by pseudo-reality TV. All of the news organizations are owned by those same men so how can they possibly be impartial. For a change this film is not just entertainment it is an education.

		<shortDescription>You can't (or at least, shouldn't) disbelieve real interviews with real people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who haven't see the film, I beg of you - don't comment on it until you do. I have read countless "critiques" of the film, written by people who haven't even seen it, that call Moore a liar and manipulator - but you can only fairly say that if you have actually viewed it and interpreted it for yourself.For those who have seen the film and who call it all lies or exaggerations, I have one question for you - how exactly are the real interviews with real people in the film "lies"? To me, the most powerful part of the film were the interviews with US troops and Iraqi civilians. It is hard to call the entire film inaccurate and wildly spun when you consider the troops who repeatedly stated to Moore that the situation in Iraq was nothing like what the government told them it would be and that they hoped the American people would not re-elect Bush. In the film, more than one soldier asks, "Why are we here?" Before you criticize Moore's film, I encourage you to actually see it (don't worry, he donates proceeds to 9/11 victims' and soldiers' families) and view the interviews with real people that has so many Americans saying thank god that someone has finally given us the ability to evaluate the war for ourselves, rather than through government and media censors. When you strain out Moore's commentary (which I admit is certainly over the top throughout the film), you are left with real interviews with real people who are seriously questioning Bush's "war on terror" - and those comments simply aren't a lie. Maybe we should all consider a little more seriously the comments from the soldiers who are fighting and dying for this war and and the comments from the Iraqi people whom we are supposedly protecting. None of us are out there dying in support of Bush and his war on terror, so how can we say without any doubt that it is a cause so worthy and right that it is worth someone's else life?A little food for thought: If conservatives are upset at Moore's film because it is so inaccurate, why aren't they making a film or putting out literature that portrays the "truth" of the "war on terror"? Makes you wonder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsDocumentary maker Michael Moore exposes the truth about George Bush's reign in the White House,from his obviously fixed inaugartion in 2000 in which a number of Florida votes were discarded,through to his handling of the September 11th crisis,his dodgy links to the Bin Laden family,and the final-nail-in-the-coffin debacle of the Iraq/Afghanistan invasion.When this film had finished and I was ready to leave the auditorium,I noticed a man sitting in the row in front of me starting to clap.A short while later,a whole group of people a few rows down from me rose from their feet and clapped in unison.It didn't take me long to figure that,roughly 18 months ago,these same people were probably marching through Centenary Squaire on an Anti-War protest march,trying to get Tony Blair to change his mind about backing George Dubya in his plan to invade Iraq.And they were cheering because the film's maker,Michael Moore,obviously doesn't like the president much either,and has exposed truths that needed to be heard.There seemed to be a lot of laughter coming from the audience too,including from me.And it is in these two qualities that the film succeeds so well.I'll cheerfully admit that there were moments in this film that made me laugh out loud and heartily.And it managed to do this with it's underlying sly,patronizing tone regarding Bush and his competency throughout his reign as the American people's president,which people with deeply cynical hearts will be unable to help but raise a chuckle at.But the film does carefully balance out and establish a happy medium with all the hilarious instances of Bush's flawed administration of America with a darker,harder-hitting tone in parts,as the devastating results of the Iraqi war,on the battlefield and back home,are played out for all and sundry to see.Admittently,it's all rather one-sided and it does meander on somewhat toward the end,but overall,Moore has crafted a film that is,for the most part,deeply absorbing and is easily on a par with his previous effort Bowling for Columbine.****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore's latest film Fahrenheit 9/11</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to an advance screening today (would've had to wait two more weeks to see it otherwise) the theatre was about 2/5 full, and I had the misfortune to sit next to the two noiseist people in the cinema, a middle aged couple where the woman was sighing or 'tut'-ing at every opportunity and constantly making asides to her husband. Only after I got back home did I realise that I hadn't been assertive, I should have just "felt the guilt but do it anyway" and told them to keep the noise levels down. But the film I was trying to concentrate on was what I'd been waiting to see these past few weeks, Fahrenheit 9/11. I was a Michael Moore fan before his films, for whatever reason, have had every man and his dog in the US talking about them and attracting attention elsewhere.I wasn't there as a "gee that Bush sucks" kind of moviegoer like about a third of the audience was, I just wanted to see Michael Moore's much-discussed work. Overall (ignoring the dozens of articles about Moore and F911 I came across on the internet and rabid forum discussions), it was just a Michael Moore film, although with a different flavour given the bigger issue that was being addressed here. Dead soldiers, war and a grief-stricken Mum are never going to be as light as topics like gun control or corporate criminals.So I've seen Fahrenheit 9/11, noticed that other people trying to discredit Moore and his film focussed on inane things like September 11 footage being blacked out (it felt like you were there in New York) or Moore cutting to Bush at a coincidental moment. I can't believe people were going into paragraphs about the oil pipeline thing. I didn't realise the end was the end until the credits started rolling, I kind of thought "Good film. People were giving 15 minute standing ovations at this point?". Distraction may have factored in here so I'll have to see it again on DVD to see if I perhaps didn't miss something due to lack of concentration.Frankly I can't see what the fuss is about, sections of the population in the US must be quite uninformed if this is all news to them. Flying into rages and wishing Moore would step into their houses so they could shoot him is a world away from where I am. The destruction one part of US society has caused (the republican/wealthy elite/bible belt alliance) speaks for itself. He (Bush) got in the first time, if he gets in the second time around there will be something seriously wrong with humankind in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Franklin once said "Those that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety." I think this quote does a great job of summing up a lot of our nation's problems these days. After the terrorist attack of September 11th, the United States as a whole was scared. What resulted was the giving up of freedoms so that we would feel safe from these evil terrorists.Michael Moore looks at how the Bush Administration, in his eyes, has used fear to push its agenda forward. Now while this is a very topical issue and this film is a must-see, there is a problem. Much of America won't see this film based on principle. Conservatives don't want to go see the Republican President and his polices bashed for two hours. I in no way want to take sides in this argument or talk down at either side of the political spectrum, but there is a point.People need to stop being so narrow-minded. This is a very important film about the leaders of our country, whether you agree with Mr. Moore (a lot of people don't) or you are a huge Bush supporter (a lot of people aren't). This film should be viewed by everyone, no matter where you are on the political spectrum because it is so important to know what the people you trust to lead your country are doing."Fahrenheit 9/11" combines news clips, stock footage and new stuff shot by Moore to bring his monster to life. The film is very entertaining and very thought provoking, to say the least.Michael Moore's view is obviously skewed and this is something he doesn't deny. If he had it his way Bush would be out of office already, or better yet wouldn't have been in office at all. But what he does here, much like "Bowling for Columbine" is bring up important issues and present the facts that go along with them. Some will argue that these facts aren't too factual, and sure Moore will try to make things sound better for his perspective, but Mr. Moore is a good film maker and also a very good investigator.This is a film that should be seen by everyone, the sad thing is that this is a film that won't be seen by everyone. Whether you like Moore or you hate him, I recommend you at least watch the movie and then draw your own conclusions. At least have an open mind and see what people have to say, that's what this country was built on.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore as Paul Revere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a rabble-rouser, and usually I find him a little annoying. However, I was very impressed by Fahrenheit 911. It's very good. I think it will win the Best Feature Documentary Oscar next year. I've been trying to figure out where Michael Moore might be lying in this movie, and I can't find anyplace. As you can tell from the title of this Web site, the facts do matter to me. Now, there are one or two places where he doesn't say something he should have (the pipeline thing, for example, which is still in limbo, or that Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Iraq were and are all dictatorships). But I really couldn't catch him on much. From a movie-making point of view, he's constructed a pretty tight film that makes all the right points. A few scenes run on a little long, but the editing is generally pretty good. I only had a couple of problems with it.* While he doesn't hesitate to show badly injured Iraqis (and, at least once, an American soldier), he made a point of not showing anything of the towers coming down - only dust and paper - or any injured Americans. As a result, Fahrenheit 911 has a funny National Geographic feel - we can show the awful physical suffering of "natives" but not Americans - it would be too offensive. The movie should have been a little less graphic, because a few of the scenes of injured Iraqis are quite horrific. That said, he doesn't talk specifically about the prisoner abuse scandal, but does show some Americans playing with a corpse and having their pictures taken with captured, hooded Iraqis.* At one point, an injured soldier does say that the war changed him from a Republican to a Democrat. However, Moore then fails to say that it's not just poor people who wind up joining the Army - it's the politically disenfranchised. A shocking number of people do not vote.What Michael Moore does particularly well is "connecting the dots." I don't think I learned anything new from Fahrenheit 911, I was reminded of many things that I'd forgotten. He's also grown as a filmmaker - as he makes more complicated movies, he takes himself out of the movie. He only shows up in about five shots during the whole thing, and he really doesn't narrate as much of the film as you might expect. Instead, he lets the interviewees make most of the points.When I got back to the Internet after the movie, one of the first things I saw was this:U.S. Mulling How to Delay Nov Vote in Case of Attack*sigh* Michael Moore is sounding more like Paul Revere all the time.

		<fullReview>Sad promotional television that in no way comes near Bowling For Columbine but wait first lets put this straight.* I don't like Bush. * I just loved Bowling for Columbine. But still this movie doesn't satisfy me. Sure there were some facts that are even too hilarious to use in a stand-up comedy show. But the big thing that I really missed in this movie is its clear and distinct barrier between facts and the personal opinion of the movie maker(s).After a half hour of naming big American companies the movie turned into what I call emo-television. Soldiers that make statements, crying parents that stay behind and shocking television of wounded/death and/or executed people. Things that you and I can see on every (foreign?) news channel.I don't understand how this movie won a price on the Film Festival in Cannes. I have a tradition of buying all the movies on DVD that win a price on that festival but I think that I will skip a year. Shame on Quentin... :(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this movie partisan? Yes, of course it is. However slanted Mr. Moore's views may be though, the vast majority of data given in this movie can be corroborated simply by reading the paper every day. I read the NY Times every afternoon, and I was well aware of most of the information given in this movie prior to watching it. While I agreed with the general message given in Bowling for Columbine, much of it was stretched a bit thin. However, fact checkers will have a hard time disproving information in F9/11. This information has always been out there-- if you don't keep up with the news everyday (not the bogus local news, of course), you should check out this movie... It might be quite enlightening!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exercise of freedom of speech</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw the movie last night and I got out with an immense feeling of sadness. I had the same feeling the day US attacked Iraq out of Bush's personal agenda, even though UN inspectors said that there were no WMD in there.I am not quite sure why some people hate this movie so much. For me, it is just an exercise of freedom of speech. Most of the stuff that is in the movie was in the media at one point or another, though this government tried to play so much the card "If you're not with us, you're against us" that not even media dared to criticize Bush after 9/11. It's a pity that there are not that many media people like Moore. And about taking things out of context by cut and paste: I think that what Moore did was put things into context! As we could see in the beginning of the movie, letting everybody see the uncut version of the "Leader of the World"'s response to a crisis situation does not do him any good! I actually think that it's much more to be said about Bush's lame performance as a president...I think it was pretty smart for Moore that he took a second place in the movie and tried to present the change of mind regarding the war in Iraq through the story of Lila Lipscomb from Flint, MI. Even though some people were bothered by that: that's what war is about! And it's even worse when you realize that people die for lies.</fullReview>

Yet halfway in that battle, we start another war on bulls@#+ intel and greed. I'm glad that Saddam is out of power, but the Riddler is not the Joker. I'll admit, I was fooled into believing Iraq had a hand in 9/11. But now my eyes are wide open. And this Election Day, Bush will not get my vote.

		<shortDescription>Excellent, moving documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore makes a very strong point in this, his third documentary. The news footage, and archival footage, especially from Baghdad is powerful, a frightening image of the controversy surrounding 9/11 that Moore conveys extremely well. Going around the Capitol and asking pro-war members of Congress to enlist their children, in my opinion, was a stroke of brilliance. This may seem a bit tongue in cheek to almost solicit around Capitol Hill, but it certainly proved a point. Another very moving part of Fahrenheit 9/11 was the woman in Flint who had lost her son in the war, and who went to Washington. Her reading the last letter her son sent her was extremely moving, almost tear-jerking for some in the theatre, and again, helped Mr Moore to prove his point. Fahrenheit 9/11 was all in all better than Bowling for Columbine. An amazing movie, and this is coming from a Canadian. ****/*****</fullReview>

Moore rubs our noses in it for122 uncomfortable minutes.If a movie is judged on how well it makes its point, I should havegiven Moore's masterpiece a "10." I didn't; maybe I should re-vote."Fahrenheit 9/11" may not make Democrats out of thinkingConservatives, but one has to be blindly on the far right not torealize that we have elected an unworthy occupant of the WhiteHouse, to put it mildly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that the comments made about this movie are permeated by the insatiable human need to critique. It has been said that those who can do, while those who cannot criticize. The anomaly, Michael Moore, does by criticizing. Criticism has a function in the right hands. Fahrenheit 9/11 shows this.The diversity of perception by viewers is apparent in the love and hate generated by the different scenes and by the film its self. Some think the part about Lila was effective, others think it weakened the structure or manipulated the audience. The talk about whether this is a documentary, op ed piece, propaganda, etc. is typical of the human instinct to classify. It is a useless discussion. View the film as a challenge to the senses and sensibilities. It has a function that is to vote Bush out. Effective sequencing shows the cruelty of life of man, the corruption of Bush of government and the pain inflicted. From the earliest civilizations to now men have sought to enrich themselves on the weakened backs of their subordinates. But greed for money and power is quantitative and men legislate it to different degrees of perversity. The current administration is a particularly greedy cabal, and it uses effective techniques of persuasion and manipulation to control and extend its reign. Our beloved reactionary conservatives share the advertising industry's method of screaming the message continually until the desired result is obtained. The result in this case being the duping of the populace. The democrats are generally a less corrupt option, but our system of concentrated wealth and power is invariably unfair. Only future generations of education, concerned action and eventual enlightenment will complete the equality of man. Fahrenheit 9/11 and the positive reaction to it is one step forward in the march of humanity. 10 out of 10 on the strength of entertainment, content and humanistic intent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reviews had indicated that this was good, but not worthy of the Cannes top honour, so I went prepared to be somewhat disappointed -- not so! From start to finish, this riveting, astoundingly informative film absolutely took my breath away. This is a film every adult should see, regardless of whether you're American or not; but Americans, most definitely, need to be educated as to what is (and has) taken place at the most powerful &amp; trusted level of government. Moore, as usual, manages to temper the hard facts with an edge of humour at times; which in itself seems an incredible task given the serious subject matter. Absolutely the best documentary (and one of the very best movies) I've ever seen; the kind of film that one wants to call everyone you know and tell them "you HAVE TO go see THIS!!!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 was a breath of fresh air for the conservatively-dominated media, as it finally told a more accurate story of what is going on in the white house, and in politics today. Many critics of the movie, however, claim that Moore's movie is biased, so it should not even considered by the general public. This quote, by Paul Krugman, sums it all up in my eyes:"There has been much tut-tutting by pundits who complain that [Fahrenheit 9/11], though it has yet to be caught in any major factual errors, uses association and innuendo to create false impressions. Many of these same pundits consider it bad form to make a big fuss about the Bush administration's use of association and innuendo to link the Iraq war to 9/11. Why hold a self-proclaimed polemicist to a higher standard than you hold the president of the United States?" Paul Krugman</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read a large number of user reviews for this movie and am astounded by how many people seem to believe they know "the truth". I may not be the smartest man in the world, but I can tell you that anyone who believes he or she knows the truth, is deluding himself/herself.This movie is just one more piece of information that should be taken with a grain of salt along with all the other information that we use to inform ourselves. Whether you believe it or not, the fact is, no source of information is unbiased. The news media are all biased to one degree or another. News media outlets have owners, editors, and, yes, even reporters who align themselves with political viewpoints and may have political agendas. Reporters also have deadlines for stories and if a key piece of information is not uncovered before deadline, it is left out of the story. Editors may also cut out key pieces of information because they only have 90 seconds of air time or 60 lines of text.We are too busy to take the time to research things ourselves, so we rely on the media to educate us. It is our responsibility to question all the information we receive from every source. Question the information from the networks, question newspaper columnists and editors, question investigative journalists, question Michael Moore, question your congressman, question yourself and your own beliefs. Why do you believe what you believe?Nobody will ever really know the truth, but we can all try to seek it by holding our information sources accountable for the information they release, broadcast and publish.If we blindly trust the news media, why should we not trust Michael Moore? Why question one but not the other? Each source presents us with information, it is up to us as individuals to develop informed opinions about that information. The key word is "informed" -- how many of us truly take the time to become informed?As a documentary: 6 out of 10As a movie: 6.5 out of 10As a credible information source: 5 out of 10As something to provoke thought and further research: 10 out of 10</fullReview>

But I felt tremendous relief to see that somebody is actually combining the available information about how our lawmakers/leaders have been dealing with the aftermath. Many of the *revelations* had been available from the media, but only in tiny bytes and never with enough discussion. Michael Moore put it all together and gave us a film that raises questions about motives, abilities, and priorities that have been directing our country's actions since 9/11. It is said that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. *Fahrenheit 9/11* is on the side of vigilance. Excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether you are liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican, Bush hater or Bush lover, go see the film. Michael Moore presents enough stimulating information to encourage critical thinking. And left out plenty that could have been said. If you doubt the information, go home and research it to see if it's true or not. The internet (which you must have if you are reading this) is full of information on all the controversies in this film. The best aspect of this film is that it makes people think. As a nation, I feel that we are too complacent. And that is dangerous. As Hitler once said, "What good fortune for those in power that people do not think." Too bad we can't ask G.W.'s granddaddy Preston about that...after all, he financed the Nazi party until the US government made him stop. And so the legacy continues.See the film. THINK.

		<fullReview>---Why do the Nations Rage, and the peoples plot in vain?---- Psalm 2:1--Vanity of vanities, all is Vanity- Ecclesiastes 1:2The Psalmist's, biblical poets, did not grow up in 21st century. They didn't see growth of the war machine. They would have probably asked why were fighting over oil. They never witnessed 9/11. Yet they understood that every generation has been through the Horrors of war. In that situation I think they asked some of the same questions, that Michael Moore did in his new Documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. Of course the psalmist left us with a little more hope, 'Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling?Blessed are all who take refuge in him.' Whether you accept that, at least the thought of taking refuge in a sovereign God is more comforting then what Moore, on the other hand, leaves us with. Wallowing in despair, unable to move. I've seen the movie and while I think it brilliant I'm at a loss from what I should gleam from it.In late 2000 it seems the election was stolen away from Al Gore by the Fox News Channel. It also seems the Democratic Party did nothing about it. Millions of voters, and local representatives were upset. But no senator's would lend their aid to the disenfranchised voters of Florida. Bush became president, he went on vacation, the economy went to crap and then while the world was viscously attacked, our country bumpkin leader sat with a bunch of kindergarten children and read a book about a happy goat.I sum up Moore's early moments with much sarcasm. Because I consider myself a moderate republican. I think Clinton was corrupt, just like Reagan was corrupt, like Carter was corrupt, and so on. I like George Bush as a president; I even for the most part understand the war in Iraq. Do I think it was necessary? Well no. But I do understand that before 9/11 every Democrat would hold Iraq over the Republican Party as the unfinished war. I remember countless arguments with friends saying 'how come we didn't get Saddam out of power?' Do I also think that in the long run, 20 years from now Iraq will be a in better place? Yes. Do I have my problems with the Bush administration? Absolutely, yes! After all those questions I guess your probably asking? Did you like the movie? I whole heartily did. Just like I liked Bowling for Columbine, Roger and Me, and even The Big One. Fahrenheit 9/11 is moving, brilliantly cut together, and Moore's narration is sharp. No matter what anybody has to say about this film, you can't argue that this movie is compelling. Even if it's one giant fabrication, or a giant piece of propaganda, which I myself am not about to agree with or disagree with. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a well made, powerfully moving film, and does what every documentary strives do, it gets people talking. The movie makes you laugh, It horrifies you, it makes you cry, and it stirs a sense of social justice that I think is vital in this day and age. Sure, I could probably write a book about the holes in Moore's logic (I'm still convinced some speech or debate class in high school should look at everyone of his movies and count the number of argumentative fallacy's he breaks) but on the merits of a movie, you can't argue with how well made it is.Michael Moore has always had a keen sense of social justice that I loved. He tries to look out for the little guy. Many of the people he talks to are composites of you and me. I loved the little old lady who talks about Halliburton near the middle of the film. That little old women is the voice of the masses I think. She doesn't have that many facts, but she sure is passionate with the scraps of knowledge she's gleamed from CNN or Katie Couric.My qualms with the film are three- fold. The biggest is Moore's shaky creditability. Lets face it, the guy has been making things up since Roger and Me. Every one of his films has walked the line from creative retelling to outright lie. It taints every idea in the film. It makes a moderate voice like mine very skeptical. Unfortunately I haven't done the research to oppose his ideas, but at least I can distance myself from them while I watch.My other problem is that Moore lays things on a bit too thick as the film progresses. Things go from bleak to worse, as an American I was grasping for something. Near the end of the film I just wanted a solution, a suggestion, even a small iota of hope. Moore presents us with such a bleak picture. He asks probing questions, but you're left feeling like 'what the heck can I do.' Except succumb to the fact that Michael Moore is better person that I am. This is why I like what Solomon wrote and the second quote above. In the end it's all vanity. It all passes away. One day were fighting Iraq, the next there are allies in our ongoing war with some other country that ticks us off. People are fallen and evil at their core. It's why we don't get along. It why we cheat and steal, and the greatest man can be the world our biggest enemy.Thirdly, was the way Moore portrayed Muslims. It seems the best way to get his point across that the Saudi's are bad is by placing ominous music over pictures of Bush and his father in photo-ops with men in turbins. He also uses silly silent movie clips to make the point that the coalition of nations is made up of the US and small inconsequatil countries with backwards ideas. While their may be truth in the comments, using broad stereotypes was not the smartest idea.All in all Michael Moore's Farenheit 9/11 is brilliant and bold. But will it sway voters? Probably not. This is a movie for those who agree with Moore, I don't think I will swing to many others. I would recommend anyone give it a try. You might just leave with a few ideas in your head and that's never a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have viewed the film/documentary with an open mind and without bias, yet, did it ever move me. Reeling 2 years of misery for the people of the Middle East and Americans into the bloodied hands of an American President in under 2 hours was no easy feat. Facts upon facts were presented in a masterfully made documentary had more credence to truth and justice then the 8 year's America suffered under the yoke of a false president. A man that has brought fallacy and dishonour to the American people. A powerful, very thought provoking documentary. Michael Moore's master stroke is in nurturing throughout the film a sense of hope. For the American dream beats steady in the hearts of every American, that the idea of 'the land of the free' is ever more alive in its people. I too share that dream, I believe, it is a common right to all people of this fair earth even in this most dreary of times.I have to disagree to certain opinions that the film was a personal attack to discredit the current President, to be dismissed as a rash political propaganda featurette. Ask oneself what is Michael to gain if he was hell bend to do so? This documentary in my humble opinion is the act of a man that has seen both sides of the story, and through personal strive concluded that as a man of principles and wisdom, could only be pushed too far. The facts could not be swept under the carpets anymore, let the people of America decide what is best for America; to fall from grace in the hands of a false president OR wrest freedom, democracy back to make it their own and share peace and not war for all mankind.I guess Americans that flock to the cinemas for this documentary and made it no#1 in the box office had made a choice. and Guess what? to vote for a credible president in America cost less that the admission ticket! Its free!I give it 9/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Folks, I come from deep Bush country, that is to say my family and most of our friends growing up were all Republican. Not because of any particular belief or pride in what Republicans as a group strive for. My only memory of what my family said about being a proud Republican was because of the money. Our family always did very well by Reagan and Bush, trickle down was openly blessed at the dinner table. We were Republicans because of our money, our memberships at the Clubhouse and the perks that come with insider information on where to invest next, who will be getting a hand up because of Republican leadership. That being said, I sat in the Fahrenheit 9/11 BURNING with anger. I have never felt so disconnected from my family in all my life. I have a "problem" you see, I ask too many questions. And the answers have always led to lies and greed as far as the Republicans that made up my surroundings were concerned. I have argued till I was blue in the face that Reagan-omics were killing mom-ad- pop business's only to be met with "who cares, we made a bundle on investing in the company that bought them out". Trying to get my family and friends to see this film is like trying to get someone to eat glass, it would kill them, if only because Michael Moore has served up a heaping plate of undeniable facts. There is a scene when an obviously Republican woman runs up to the lady who has lost her family in Iraq and calls the protesting lady "an actor" and that she was just lying, when the republican lady is stopped in her tracks with proof about another ladies son who got killed the look on the Republicans face was "so what". It pains me to say that my family believes in just that, no amount of proof will ever change their minds because they are making too much money and saving too much money on taxes because of Bush to care. America is overwhelmingly polarized right now on these issues. Half of us want what is right for humanity and all Americans, the other wants what is right for them personally and their right to drive a Mercedes and tee off and noon. Just who is being unAmerican here? The country was created for all mankind seeking freedom and the chance to prosper, but had we all been as selfish as the Republican party is today we never would have gotten this country off the ground. We need to pull together again, vote and change this country for the betterment of all of it's citizens, not just the greedy. Of course, if you're like my family, you aren't going to listen to facts, will cry "propaganda" and will call all those families who lost children in Iraq "actors" trying to unseat Bush to push some dangerous god-hating liberal nonsense (Christian right wing propaganda at work folks- the kind laden with fear).No attempt to pull their heads out of their collective a**es will ever work....unless you make it financially appealing to them. God help America. vote people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is "Fahrenheit 911" a fair and balanced documentary? Fair -I think so. After all, Michael Moore represents 'we the people', not the media conglomerates or politicians with an agenda. Those who have seen his former TV series "The Awful Truth" will remember that he skewered the policies of the Clinton administration as often as he did Republicans. What he does is bring up facts that are posed as questions. Why wasn't the Bin Laden family given a full interrogation before being flown out of the country? Certainly, the families of those who'd personally attacked our country wouldn't have been allowed to leave without proper interrogation, unless of course, they also had direct ties to Saudi oil. And why is it that congressmen don't send their sons and daughters to war, but ask ours to? Moore does an amazing job in this, as well as his other documentaries, at looking at all the ramifications of the issue at hand. Most people don't stop to think that as America sends more and more jobs to other countries, that leaves more of our poorer young people having no choice but to join the army. Who needs the draft? Just promise the working class kids a free college education if they join up. Of course, it isn't totally free. You may have to give up an arm or a leg or your life. The sad thing is that like me, they'd fight in a minute to stop terrorism. They just don't want to go to some country where our presence is hated more and more every day, to fight and maybe die for oil and defense contractors. What we should be doing is signing these working class kids up for national security at home. Hey, why not send a few hundred young men and women from Flint Michigan to the coast of Oregon to guard our homefront? Unfortunately, it's never going to happen, unless someone strikes oil there.As for balanced... some people have accused this film of not being a 'real' documentary. Most of us have been brought up watching those dry documentaries at school and believe that that's what documentaries ought to be. It's too bad cause most of the best movies being made in the past few years have been documentaries, and they are as entertaining as they are informative. Every documentary has some agenda, including those dry old documentaries we saw at school that talked about how kind we were to the 'Indians', and left out little things like Roosevelt's internment camps for the Japanese-Americans. Lets just say that 'F911' is as balanced as Fox News is, which is to say that 'F911' definitely isn't balanced! The fact is though, is that if the news media in this country WAS fair and balanced, then Michael Moore could retire and become a couch potato like he always says he wants to be. However, a good American can't just sit around and watch their country get deeper and deeper into trouble, risking an even greater threat of terrorism. So Moore has taken it upon himself to report what the TV media doesn't (he gets his facts from the print media from here and from Britain). Call him a documentarian or not, what he provides us with is food for thought and great guerrilla theater. Riding around in an ice cream van in front of the Congress building while reciting the patriot act was a particularly amusing an inspiring idea. Here's this one little guy in front of this looming establishment creating his own filibuster, and representing 'we the people'. He's "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" for the new millennium!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth was told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Fahrenheit 9/11 and found it to be a real movie about what most people turn a blind eye to. Moore told it like it is from the view of people who are educated. Many people think Moore is an evil greedy man, but when you compare Moore to the Bush administration, Bush is the greedy person willing to send young men and women out so him and his dads friends can make a few million. Moore showed things that did not get shown or was kept under the table. Fahrenheit 9/11 was a movie to teach America how low the President will go make millions. Everything said in the movie is true. People who say this movie is a load of bull are people who are narrow minded and has not been effected by 9/11 or the war in Iraq or Afghanistan. They have not lost a friend or family member in battle and will never understand how stupid they sound when there opinions are the same ones used by Bush and CEOs' of companies who kids are safe at home. Moore did a wonderful job teaching America about how low people will go for money. "Greed is the root of all evil"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Courageous Peek At Our Own WMD-George W. Bush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took someone like Michael Moore to finally come out in all his blazing audacity to present to the American people how they have been burying their heads in the sand about our glorious leader. I recently wrote criticizing Reagan (Reagan Tributes-Enough Already! June 13th, 2004) and said that even with Reagan's blighted record, I would still rather have him than 'Herr Bush'.'Fahrenheit 9/11' ventures into territory only suggested or hinted at by the other media. No one had the balls to say it like it really is. In fact, I thought Moore's film had in fact been somewhat kind to 'Der Fuhrer' when considering the damage he has done to America and it's image around the world. There is hardly a country on the planet where Bush is not despised, laughed at, or held in awe that such an obvious asshole could be the president of the mightiest land in the world. And let us not forget his blessed cabinet, Cheney, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld, Rice and the worst choice of all, John Ashcroft. Each one of these gems could be fodder for another film by themselves. Anyway, don't get me started.Moore's film is perhaps the wakeup call America needs in these chaotic times. Of course, I could criticize the mechanics of the film such as the editing, directing, etc., but I will not. The film makes a powerful statement on how things are and that I will not sully. The people who saw the movie laughed, they cried, they fumed, and they cheered for what the man was trying to communicate and that should be enough said by itself. It took a lot of courage to defy the wrath of the ridiculous right by presenting Bush and his gang of thieves as they really are without whitewashing them Hollywood style.This could be the 'shot heard 'round the world' and indeed it has been setting all sorts of box office records for a documentary film. It is something that really needed to be said and said right now. The press has been remarkably silent and ignoring Bush's betrayal of his country, his incessant lying, and his ineptness in office. The special interests Bush has been serving, such as 'Big Oil' and the Bin Laden family has finally been given the exposure they have so richly deserved. It is now up to the American people to shout "I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore.' (Made famous in the old movie 'Network' in 1976).I have heard criticism from other reviewers that the film presents certain matters as though they are true without any support in fact. Obviously, the reviewer either has not really seen the film or is so taken in by the propaganda that they cannot or will not believe that such a blatant abuse of power could exist in this country. Well I have news for you. It can exist and it does exist and you better get aboard and do something about it.The power has always been in the people; however, when they choose not to use it, the 'evil empire' will fill the void with its own special interests and take the rights and freedoms that were earned by the people away from them again. I sincerely hope we heed this wakeup call and not go back to complacency and apathy. We each have the power vote this fall, get rid of this idiot in the White House, and have a real 'Regime Change' for the better. Outstanding Mr. Michael Moore!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One need not agree with all of Moore's perspectives in "Fahrenheit 9/11" to be shocked and awed by the footage in the film that the supposedly liberal media have not shown us. The mainstream media have done the American people a great disservice in these times. It has been left to a gadfly to deliver to the public images and information that counterbalance the myopic view offered by the administration and the corporate media conglomerates. Some scenes are heartbreaking as we are exposed to the effects that this war has had on the lives of both Iraqis and Americans alike. Other scenes reveal character flaws and odd behavior in our current leadership by using material normally cut out of the evening news. This film is as much an indictment of the mainstream media as of George W. Bush.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, you're either going to love this movie, or you're going to hate it. Personally, I love it. Those who hate it are supporters of King George, who believe this "fictitious war" really has merit, that believe G.W. Bush is doing everything he can to end terrorism with his War on Terror, which, like the War on Drugs, it will never end.Besides shedding light on the 9/11 and the war in Iraq, the film contains everything American cinema-goers love: comedy (at Bush's expense), violence (at Iraq and the U.S.'s expense), and drama (at the world's expense).This film documents the the events leading up to 9/11, and the sudden urge of our fearful leader to attack a nation that has never even been a threat to this great land. It puts the Bush administration into true light -- showing the absolute (yes, even if it is bias) truth.There's a new documentary coming out called "Michael Moore Hates America," if you see this movie, you'll see that is false, that Michael probably loves this country more than any other American.If you really love this country, the good IL' U.S. Of A., see this movie, even if your politics differ from that of Michael Moore's. It's always good to see all perspectives of those events the chronicle our history and our society. Even if you leave the theater hating Michael Moore, at least you learned something, even if it doesn't echo your own sentiments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole world.......literally the WHOLE WORLD hates BUSH. And FINALLY, somebody, Michael Moore in this case, answers why. He uses his celebrity status to get the message into the mainstream which is extremely important at this point...I CANNOT deal with another 4 years of having the Bush administration in office. I cannot deal with people who, in their ignorance, support an administration that's screwing the world over for its own selfish interests. The film shows the realities of war. More importantly, it shows that the war is unjust and was done for OIL........all these people are dying for nothing!! THINK about it. When there was conflict and genocide in Rwanda, the US did absolutely NOTHING about it...Rwanda has nothing to offer, but Iraq does; OIL. There are countless other examples. I knew most of what the film said, cause I don't trust American media in any way. But watching Fahrenheit 9/11 opened up my eyes even more, since I actually saw on screen the reality of the situation. Take my word for it: SEE THIS MOVIE!! And register to vote in this important election; the US and the world cannot afford to have Bush serve another term. Once is more than enough..it's too much! Anyway, see this film..it got a huge applaud at the end and touched everyone.</fullReview>

Bush tied everything except the weather to Al Qaeda and if anyone questioned it he branded them unpatriotic. We are headed down the path to ruin with this administration. Wake up America!!!

		<shortDescription>The movie was good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was an overall OK movie experience just like the one I had with Passions of the Christ although, if one is religious, the caption of "A Mel Gibson Movie" at the end of that movie just killed any emotional drive you had during the movie- guess that is a good thing- so not too many people will have heart attacks. Well anyways, at first, in Fahrenheit 911 Michael Moore just seemed to be exploiting Bush's oratorical foul-ups that trips up on him at times when he speaks. I'm the same way. I guess we both have an deficiency in that area of communication. Areas of communication that Bush is good at though is action. By sending troops on premises that even his own regime cannot back up tells just what kind of a leader he is. Of course, that is stuff that the general public already knew or has an opinion of beforehand. But all that stuff that Michael Moore, leads us through, in insinuating that Bush might be connected with Osama Bin Laden cooperatively needs to be researched by one's self for validity. His message was very clear. To me it is very clear. I agree with him, but am only one person typing on this post. I think he wants a collective showing at the polls to combat Bush's reelection or, um . . . actually I don't know what he wants. He brings up good issues and seems that he will be satisfied with the most obvious result of the influence of his documentaries, but he seems beguiling, like a man who wants something more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a time when the media delivers news based on sensation, as opposed to accuracy, Michael Moore brings us his new expose on the Bush Administration, `Fahrenheit 9/11.' Like such news organizations, Moore's film is biased. However, Moore's film actually substantiates its arguments with accurate information that Moore, himself, cites throughout the film. It is one of the most compelling and utterly shocking films that I ever seen. The debate as to whether or not the Bush Administration was incompetent prior to and after September 11, 2001 has more or less been answered. The real question is whether or not the viewers of the film will believe it-in the end, this film's truth or fallacy will be a choice of the viewer. `Fahrenheit 9/11' opens on the problems with the 2000 election. Moore cites that Al Gore won the popular and the electoral vote, however, as Fox News was the first to report Bush won the election due to the Florida vote. At this point, Moore points out that many minority votes were miscounted or misrepresented in many other states. Moore then points out that Bush spent over 40% of his first year in office on vacation. Then September 11 happened. Moore sensitively portrays the events by not showing pictures, but by darkening the screen and allowing simply the sounds of the event play out. Moore shows the human reaction-people's faces and their responses. It is at this point that revelations begin about the Bush Administration: from allowing the Bin Laden family the ability to leave the country when all planes in the U.S. were grounded to the slow response of going after Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, allowing him time to flee.Moore feels that the greatest flub of this administration was that of the Iraq war. He cites that the Bush Administration was hell-bent on going after Saddam Hussein, not so much to liberate Iraq from the clutches of a vile dictator or for weapons of mass destruction which simply were not there, but for oil. Moore points this out by showing videos from various meetings of oil companies and their enthusiasm over future ventures in Iraq. What's more is that Moore draws the parallels between rich Saudi Arabian oil billionaires and the former and present Bush Administration. It is Moore's feeling that this whole war, like most in modern history, was about generating profits. Moore spends a good portion of the film exploring the U.S. military and the events they witnessed and took part in Iraq. Moore points out that much of the military is made up of young men and women from lower income districts of the country, making known that the military is one of the only options for these people to escape poverty. Indeed it is a good move, Moore would agree, if the military was not fighting what he feels is in unjustified war. Moore points out the heavy budget cuts to veterans that the Bush Administration has allowed to occur. Furthermore, Moore takes the step of actually approaching Congressmen and Senators in Washington, D.C. and asking them if they support the war, and if so, would they consider encouraging their own children to join the military and fight in Iraq. Most of the officials simply look at Moore as if he were crazy to ask-after all, why should the rich and powerful send their children to fight when the poor can for them? It is undeniable that Moore takes a few cheap shots at Bush himself in the film-how can anyone not, G.W. is an easy target. However, it cannot be denied that Moore has done his homework here and delivered the American people a documentary that criticizes its leaders with accurate information concerning their own failures in running the United States. Moore is an American and deeply proud of his country-that is why he has made this film. He cares about the future of this country and he will not stand down to what he feels is wrong. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having gone through changes in personal outlook on politics and the world over the past few years from trusting, to disillusioned, to uncaring, to trusting again and yet disillusioned again, I've become quite a skeptical person when it comes to anything politics in the media.Moore's /opinion/ on the events leading to the infamous day in early September and the aftermath leading to the Iraq War are, as many have already said, very one-sided in his stance against the Bush administration (while he also does take shots at the Democratic party a couple times). And considering how Moore is documented to distort facts in his other movies ("Bowling for Columbine" "Roger and Me") and books ("Dude, Where's My Country?", "Stupid White Men" ...keeping in mind that was written by a white guy), I could not really watch F9/11 believing everything he said.Yet, I found the way Moore portrayed Bush and his associates rather humorous at many instances and Moore did a good job with how footage was molded, edited and pasted together as a movie (though the pacing of the movie was slow in a couple points). Aside from these, there also is one thing I cannot deny is how the movie will bring out reactions from its viewers. I often heard "Oh, god..." being murmured by a man behind me in the crowd and the tougher scenes in the second half of the movie that relate to Iraq got me misty-eyed, as well as sobbing from others in the theater. It also got me to reflect on the times, which I think it might have done for many people who have seen it.While I do not trust Moore's artistic integrity, I do respect his ability as a film maker to draw out emotions and make...well, a pretty darn interesting movie. 7/10</fullReview>

Also I'd like to comment on the remark made by Tarantino as judge of the Cannes film festival, when asked about the movie, he said that they didn't reward it because of the politics but because it was a good movie, cinematographically speaking, which I personally think is a lame excuse, this movie isn't a masterwork in that sense, but it is a great eyeopener therefore positive in more than one way, and it deserves recognition for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What's so funny about peace, love and understanding?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing "Fahrenheit 9/11" the first time, on the way out I remarked to my mom "Boy, that was depressing." "But true," she pointed out. "Yeah," I replied, "that's why it was depressing." The Fourth of July weekend seems an apt time to post something about a movie whose protagonist, President George W. Bush, doesn't just wear "patriotism" on his sleeve, it's his entire wardrobe; were he deprived of it, it would seem pretty clear that this "emperor has no clothes." I deliberately waited until after I'd seen it again to see if it would survive the initial "rush" of the choir being preached to. It does. My only quibble with it now is the same as before, i.e. that there's so much stuff that Moore didn't even use, e.g. Abu Ghraib (although one sequence hints at that). But he needed to restrict it to feature-film length and not drown mainstream viewers in a Niagara Falls of material. For those wanting to delve further, there's the website mentioned at the end of the credits, plus books that are well worth reading, such as Craig Unger's "House of Bush House of Saud" (mentioned in the film), "Against All Enemies" by Richard Clarke (who's also in the film) and "Bushwhacked" by Molly Ivins, which latter reminds us that even aside from Iraq and the Patriot Act, there are plenty of other reasons to want to see Bush Jr follow in Bush Sr's one-term footsteps.Some may ask, is this a "documentary" or "propaganda"? Offhand I can't think of a documentary ever made that didn't have at least some kind of slant to it. (Even Jacques Cousteau didn't just want to show us fish, he wanted us to save the oceans.) Michael Moore leaves no doubt which is his side of the political fence. But how can anyone accuse him of making stuff up? Other than the hilarious "Bonanza" spoof, it's all archive footage. How it's presented, of course, is the art of any filmmaker. Those who disagree with him are of course welcome to do so, which is partly why, as Moore correctly says in the movie, "this really is a great country." But the ad hominem attacks on him from various sources are extremely irksome to yours truly, such as Ann Coulter slagging him as a "college dropout." As a college dropout myself, I don't think that makes me or Moore a less worthy individual than Connecticut blue-blood WASPs like Coulter (three of whose books I've read by the way), or the Bush family for that matter. Moore is an even-handed annoyer, targeting Democrats as well as Republicans---sure, taking less time with it, but then which party has been in power the last few years? Democrat fecklessness seems a matter of sorrow for Moore as opposed to the outrage engendered by the other side. He also jabs the media, and boy do they deserve it, nor do they react kindly to getting jabbed; they're like the comic-book shop owner on "The Simpsons," preferring to dispense the insults rather than absorb them. If I have a favorite sequence in "Fahrenheit 9/11," it's the one with all the news mannequins sucking up to the military in almost erotic terms.That brings me to, I think, the worthiest aspect of this flick: that we actually get to SEE these uniformed guys (and gals). The Bush crew only want us to see military personnel in carefully staged photo ops or glossy TV recruiting ads. They sure don't want us to see them dead, or missing arms or legs or parts of the face, or with nerve damage or psychological trauma, nor (I'm sure) do they want us to see them in the field expressing their honest feelings, even when being "gung ho" with the music playing in their helmets as they're blasting things. Probably for the rest of my life I'll associate Iraq with that snatch of the Bloodhound Gang's "...burn, motherf---er, burn." (It's a kind of relief to learn that infantry guys still use the F-word, as they did in my day, and probably back to the Continental army under Washington.) (Nor, of course, does this Administration want us to be reminded of their policies of cutting vets' benefits, dragooning Reserve forces into duty that Regulars should do, calling back those who were already discharged, etc. But of course we won't have the draft back ....until the second Bush term, anyway.) Everything those troops said struck home for me, especially the guy who quietly stated "I hate this country." They should hate it, because they've been put in a no-win situation. The infantry has one mission: to "engage and destroy the enemy through fire and maneuver." They're supposed to go in, do that, and go home. But our Commander in Chief has them mired in all this "nation-building" crap. The military sequence that bothered me the most was not what probably bothered most viewers, all the gore and pain and distress, but rather the Christmas Eve raid on the Iraqi home--once again, by the way, Moore held back there, not mentioning that our troops have been accused of robbing Iraqi civilians on these raids; so much for "winning hearts and minds." That sequence reminded me exactly of an episode of TV's "COPS," and it was NOT for stuff like that that our guys and gals signed up. It wasn't why I signed up, many moons ago. Of course anyone who sees "Fahrenheit 9/11" will bring his or her own baggage along with it; I don't expect it to change a huge number of minds; the pro-Bush lot will probably be like the woman in the scene with the mother of the dead soldier in Washington DC: "This is staged," the woman declares, and upon learning of the mother's loss: "A lot of people had that." At some point in my second viewing, I heard somebody in the audience yawning while the war mother was expressing her anguish. That was stunning to me, but as Strother Martin eloquently put it in "Cool Hand Luke," "Some men you just can't reach." (Some women, too.) They'll go out and vote for Bush in November no matter what---assuming there's actually an election of course, but "let's not go there" for now. But for the anti-Bush lot, the movie will be a kind of rallying point---I'll probably go see it every week as long as it's running---and for those as yet undecided, if even one viewer is swayed the way Moore (and I) would like them to be, then it was worth doing. Clearly I've failed at doing a "non-partisan" review here, but I'm sure others could do that better, if that even needs to be done. A few final points: for those younger viewers who heard the Orwell reference at the end and wouldn't know him from Adam (or Adam from Adam): READ GEORGE ORWELL. He saw all this coming decades ago. Also: it's been reported that Moore had a filmed interview with the late Nick Berg, the young pro-war contractor who was decapitated on video recently. Moore chose not to use that footage out of respect for the family, which is more restraint than Fox News (for instance) would have shown, so those who think he's some kind of salacious hyena can go *** off. I haven't even seen Moore's other movies but one thing's clear: he does this because he gives a crap, &amp; God bless him for that.A sad kind of coda: in June two 19-year-old Marines pleaded guilty to administering electric shocks to an Iraqi prisoner at a temporary detention center south of Baghdad in April---long after the supposedly "isolated" events at Abu Ghraib. The Marines pleaded guilty to assault, cruelty and maltreatment, dereliction of duty, false official statement, violating a lawful order and conspiracy to assault; one got eight months in the brig, the other a year, plus reduction of rank, forfeiture of pay and a bad conduct discharge. This breaks my heart. Shame on them for what they did, but even more shame on those who let this situation come about in the first place, starting with our illustrious Commander in Chief who of course was never in combat himself or anything, but sure does look snappy in a flight suit...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raising The Public Consciousness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is likely that most of those who go to see this movie will be people who already don't like Bush, given the pre-release publicity. It is also likely some who see it some who will never see it will call director Moore names like "anti-American" and "America-Hater". But, really Independents and Republicans are the ones who should see this movie. There are those who would pick at details about historical accuracy but the main thrust of this movie is perspective, not history. The film is not just about Bush bashing. It is about perspective on our relationships with despotic governments we do business with and the military conflicts we have with them. It is the film maker's perspective. Moore lays out the way he sees our decades old cozy relationships with dictators and theocracies in the Middle East that feed our oil interests. These are regimes that habitually and systematically trample on human rights. This is serious perspective bound to inflame some people, especially those who tout themselves as promoters of "American Values". Moore expresses his perspective in a hilarious way, however. For the most part the film allows Bush to reveal himself. The many film clips of Bush saying the dumbest things is just laugh-out-loud funny. The film mixes extremely serious and disturbing subject matter with an outrageously comical presentation. Moore uses images in the American popular culture past and present to make his point and express his humor. This is the essence of Moore's comic genius.Michael Moore creates movies designed to elevate the consciousness of the public. He does so because he loves America and wants to make America a better place by exposing the institutional corruption in the system. There is nothing anti-American about it. The film is anti-stupidity. Moore's detractors will say he is "out of the mainstream", but those figures in history who elevate public consciousness are never in the mainstream. Those who disagree with Michael Moore should tell us why they disagree. They need to tell us why they believe it was a good idea for Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush to arm Islamic militants in Afghanistan in the 1980's who later formed the Taliban. They need to tell us why they believe arming the Dictator, Saddam Hussein in the 1980's who later invaded Kuwait was a good thing. They need to tell us why they think it's OK to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia and other oil producing countries. But most of all they need to tell us why they believe GW Bush turning the Dictatorial State of Iraq in to a destabilized Terrorist State was a good thing. They need to tell us how they can justify chicken hawks like the Bush administration sending everyone else's kids to die in Iraq but not their own. You can pick at the details in this movie but the facts remain about how the right wing corrupts our great democracy and uses our kids for cannon fodder to fight in wars resulting from our past support of despotism. This movie is an eye opener and no one who sees it can walk out of that theater without being affected. The truth is a powerful thing and those who are exposed to it can deny it for a time but they can never remove it from their subconscious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure propaganda, but that was the point.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WAR AIN'T NO SUNSHINEBy Salah AhmedIn Ray Bradbury's 1953 story, 'Fahrenheit 451,' the lead character, Guy Montag, a fireman, questions his job - which is burning down houses found to have books - after observing some people's willingness to go down in flames rather than live without their books. Filmmaker Michael Moore is hoping to get Americans asking questions, too, about their patriotism and about what it means to be patriotic in the first place. His new film, 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' follows hits like 'Roger &amp; Me' in 1989, about how General Motors' downsizing brought his hometown of Flint, Michigan to its knees, and his 2002 release, 'Bowling for Columbine,' which asked, 'Are we a nation of gun nuts, or are we just nuts?'In his newest work, Moore tries to make one thing clear: If anyone is really nuts, it is President George W. Bush. He does that through footage of the commander-in-chief that most Americans would otherwise never have seen. The film, produced in part by Miramax Films (whose parent, The Walt Disney Company, is still seething at what it got itself into), itself barely made it to mainstream theaters. One telling scene on a golfcourse shows Bush, after answering an unseen reporter's question concerning terrorism, abruptly switching gears: 'Now, watch this golf swing.' One scene after another depicts the president as a bumbling fool, unable to answer questions clearly or with any genuine seriousness. The film is propaganda, something the filmmaker isn't shy about admitting. In interviews he calls 'Fahrenheit 9/11' an opinion piece, an effort to help the crucial task of getting Bush out of the White House before he does more damage to a world that sees the United States in increasingly hostile and morbid terms.That isn't to say all the world, however.Moore's film suggests that no other country enjoys chummier relations with the United States than Saudi Arabia, whose native son, Osama bin Laden, the U.S. government accuses of having masterminded the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.The film argues that among the president's favorite people - if only because they own a sizable chunk of the United States - are the bin Ladens themselves.Propaganda can amount to so much rumor, but it can also refer to accurate information presented in a way that is meant to damage a person, an institution or a cause. All three find themselves in Moore's cross-hairs, with Bush playing himself, starring Big Business as the institution, and both coming together to achieve the cause of keeping enough Americans poor and in the dark about their government.Moore again directs his camera at Flint, a once-bustling city, following around a mother who gets teary-eyed with pride when talking about her son in the military, and angry at those who protest U.S. military involvement overseas. The scene foreshadows a later interview Moore has with the same woman when things don't turn out as planned. The filmmaker also tails two white military recruiters, decked out in shiny, blue uniforms, their buttons gleaming in the sunlight, as they prowl a Flint shopping area's parking lot in search of their next prey.But, Moore points out, they don't go to the nice mall in the suburbs, going instead to the one where poor, mostly Black, shoppers are.One of their prospects tells them he'd rather go into the music business.'I'm sure you know who Shaggy is, right?' one of the recruiters tells the man, referring to the Jamaican-born singer. 'How about a former Marine?'The film shows a lot of footage of Flint, its boarded-up houses and abandoned structures. At night, the streets are dark and depressing. But even during the day, with the sun shining down on these mostly Black youth, there is the sense that their poverty-driven considerations about joining the military - to escape circumstances brought on them by the decisions of faraway CEOs - won't make things any better. After all, they live in neighborhoods resembling post-war Iraq's, and statistics show their chances of living very long are slimmer than most. If they go to Iraq, they might come back in bodybags whose return we won't even be able to witness. The sun might be shining on these men today, but ain't no sunshine when they're gone - one way or the other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A polemic, but skillfully done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you either criticize this movie or praise it, you ought to go see it. While this movie has been billed as a documentary, it would be more accurate to describe it as a polemic. Director Michael Moore has a clear political viewpoint, and a selective approach to material. That said, he has made good use of the Freedom of Information Law, archival file footage, and interviews to assemble compelling material. The movie presents a simplistic but effective portrayal of the last four years, from the 2000 election through September 11 to the Iraq War, as having been very different for George Bush and a well-connected elite of American and Saudi officials and business executives than it has for low-income Americans enlisting in the U.S. armed forces to escape poverty, for their families, and for Iraqi civilians.How one views portions of the movie may perhaps depend on one's own background. Watching, or perhaps I should say listening, to the movie's September 11 sequences was not easy for me. Some years ago, I worked for a time in the World Trade Center. I still remember the views out the windows.The organization I work for had people in One World Trade Center, the south tower, on September 11. Most got out alive, but three did not. One of them, whom I knew slightly, left behind a wife, a six year old son and a three year old daughter. I ended up testifying before the Victims' Compenstion Fund in a hearing on their benefits. Listening to his wife testify involved some of the hardest moments of my career. People who know families that have lost someone in Iraq might feel something similar about the movie's repeated interviews with one soldier's mother.Some of the people who have commented on this movie seem to think that Michael Moore is a traitor; others, that he is a genius. I don't agree with either of those perspectives. He has made a thought-provoking movie, though. It seems to be something like a Rohrshach ink-blot test. Some of the things that people see in it are things they bring into the theater with them, that may not be visible on the surface of the film. Whether those things are inside the people, or inside the film, or both, is something I will leave for you to figure out when you see the movie for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked out of Fahrenheit 9/11 fully prepared to punch the first person who talked to me in the head. I should explain that. I will not be voting for either Bush or Kerry, they're both bad candidates, but I do feel that Bush has betrayed this country with his position. I also feel that Micheal Moore has betrayed this country with his position.Bowling for Columbine was a 'documentary' about a problem with the American mentality. It tried to find the root of the problem, and didn't focus on the source. If it had been two hours about how stupid Eric and Dylan were, I wouldn't have liked it.Thats what Fahrenheit is. It's an entire movie attacking one man. One weak, untrustworthy man, true. Towards the end Micheal Moore started to touch on the problem, with the footage of company executives discussing how to profit from the war, and his quote from Orwell. But I think he failed to point out that George is no more than an easily manipulated corporate puppet. The president has always catered to big business. The problem is that big business is now catering to the president.Still, I think every American should see this movie. It may not be objective, but it is still important. I wish there were a hundred Micheal Moore's out there so that we could get more perspectives on the issue.The movie made me furious, but I think I'll go see it again.The movie made me furious, but it made me think.Feel free to e-mail me on this topic, I'm anxious to hear what people think of my comment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant but ultimately irrelevant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of Moore's finest work here, in that he lets the images and interviewees tell the story, and skillfully edits the result. The message is powerful and impossible to ignore.However, it won't matter. Moore is probably hoping to influence the coming election, but:First, the election is several months away and Americans have notoriously short attention spans. Plus they shut out things they don't want to hear, which is of course how Bush managed to win Florida in the first place;Second, the people who really need to see this film, the Bush supporters, won't. Or if they do, they nit pick and dismiss the whole thing.Just look at the voting and the user comments. I have never seen such polarity. The votes are either tens or ones. The comments from the people who hated the film are from people who had already decided they were going to hate it.For example, a Republican friend of mine has vowed never to see a Moore film because he doesn't want to give "that guy" any money. He won't open his mind for a minute to let a new idea creep in.Another example -- in my town, only one theater out of a dozen is showing this movie. It was pulled from another one. What do they fear? This theater is doing great business showing this film, and people were laughing, crying, and cheering throughout.Yes Moore is making a lot of money from this. Yes it is an opinion piece. Yes he may be off on a fact or two. Who cares? There are more than enough facts here to bury Bush if anyone wants to listen.The truly frightening part is, this was all public information. Moore just brought it out. Why is anyone shocked about it now? Why is Bush still a popular president?Answer: the media reports what we and the government wants to hear. Fox is a Republican mouthpiece. CNN is better, but not much.PS: this film is not against America, or the troops in Iraq. They are doing a terrific job in a terrible situation. The whole point of the film is, why are they there in the first place? Not the Bush rhetoric... the real reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's Film an Overall Success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An eye-opener, to be sure. As a moderate conservative, I tried to view this film with as much objectivity as possible. I've grown weary of the back-and-forth flame wars that go on between ultra-conservatives and ultra-liberals in the DC area, and as such, I've tried to expand my horizons to include liberal points of view, as well.I never really liked George Bush. I didn't feel that he had the salt it took to run this country. I voted for John McCain in the 2000 primary, and I voted for Al Gore in the general election. Needless to say, this film re-affirmed everything I mistrusted about our President; from his grotesquely unethical ties to the Saudi royal family to his deafening silence on the morning of September 11 after he learned of the second airplane strike.I don't particularly care for the film maker, Michael Moore, either. I think that, beyond the facts he presented, his flagrant attacks on the President were unnecessary and infantile (although at times, raucously funny).Overall, I was impressed with the depth and detail of the facts pointed against the President. The most calming element was that the video clips of George W. Bush spoke for themselves and needed no interpretation to grasp what was really going on.I walked into that film a moderate Republican, and I think I walked out a moderate Democrat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore loves America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fahrenheit 9/11" is,indeed, a propaganda film. All documentaries are propaganda. Filmmakers can not prevent having a point of view. However, this film is by no means a deceitful and vicious attack on the United States of America. Instead, it is an expose of the deceit that characterized the Bush administration from the very beginning. As Moore has frequently stated, he wants to rid America of this administration in order to make the nation a better place.The film begins with the 2000 U.S. presidential elections and Moore shows how Bush and his cronies stole the election. In fact, 1.9 million Americans cast ballots that were "spoiled" (i.e. thrown out). About a million of those votes were cast by African-Americans. Florida's Gadsen County has the highest percentage of black voter in the state, and it has the highest rate of ballots that were thrown out. One in eight votes cast there in 2000 was never counted. Many voters in that county wrote in "Al Gore." Optical reading machines rejected these ballots because the word "Al" was counted as a "stray mark."In contrast, in Tallahassee, there were almost no ballots that were thrown out. In Tallahassee's white-majority county, voters placed their ballots directly into optical scanners. If they added a stray mark, they received another ballot with instructions to correct it."Fahrenheit 911" has been criticized for showing Bush and his staff having makeup applied. This is shown during the opening credits. I feel that the purpose of this is to show the players in this con that has been perpetrated by this incredibly corrupt administration. In other words, "Here are the faces you see on television all the time. This film will show you what's behind those faces."With regards to the war in Iraq, Moore does NOT portray American soldiers as bloodthirsty killers and does NOT imply that U.S. troops intentionally kill innocent men, women and children. Instead, he questions why these brave young men and women are being sent to fight an unjust war.Moore shows a former associate of Bush's named James Bath who had become the money manager for the bin Laden family, saying, "James Bath himself in turn invested in George W. Bush." The implication is that Bath invested the bin Laden family's money in Bush's failed energy company, Arbusto. While Moore doesn't mention that Bath has said that he had invested his own money, not the bin Ladens', in Bush's company, anyone with a brain in his head must ask, "Where would the money manager for the bin Laden's get his money?" Do you suppose it could have come from the bin Laden's, perhaps? Isn't that where Bath's money would have come from?The bin Laden family was quickly shuttled away after 9/11, back to Saudi Arabia. Richard Clarke, Bush's former counterterrorism adviser and holdover from the Clinton administration is shown testifying in the film that he was the one who allowed their departure. It is especially important that this film be seen by Americans while our nation is involved in an unnecessary war against a nation that has NEVER attacked us. How many Americans were killed by Iraqis prior to this war? I believe that would be NONE. During World War II, Hollywood supported America and the cause of freedom. The difference was that America had been ATTACKED by Japan.Hopefully, this film will help rid America of the disease that IS George W. Bush. Our nation will be all the better for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, journalism Canadian-style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw the movie with a friend this evening. One word - AWESOME! Sure Moore takes liberty with some of the video editing to create greater emotional responses but the facts he lays out are truly damning for the Bush administration. What's truly funny is that it takes a movie on the truth to tell Americans and the world what's happening behind the scenes. We actually had to pay $10 to get the truth. Wow. Free enterprise right down to the last drop. :-) What's funny is that we get this kind of truth everyday in our news here in Canada. Our journalists make it their mission to expose everything the government is doing WRONG - it keeps them in check. It seems a shame that the US news outlets seem so pre-occupied with the mighty advertising dollar that they dare not challenge anything the government pushes out or keeps under wraps. I do hope this movie is an amazing US success - maybe the $100's of millions of revenue from the movie will once and for all prove to the networks that indeed there's money in being investigative vs. only propaganda amplifiers. I think the other great service Moore does for the US is that it separates the supposed culprits from the regular American citizens. This helps remove the spotlight of Anti-Americanism away from the innocent citizen and focuses it on the source of the problem. It helps to remind us all that we are indeed all the same in the world but a few bad apples tend to spoil the barrel.This movie is a classic movie of our time. It reminds everyone and especially Americans that it's your right and your duty to ask questions and demand accountability. Good for you Michael Moore. Bravo!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where are the WMD? Did the CIA and Reagan back Saddam in the 80s?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moore relentlessly presents his own take on Iraq, a conflict that in his eyes is born of fear, deception and confusion and realized in blood, death and tears, diminishing the American dream it purported to defend. Moore pointedly questions the premises, goals and "selling" of the war, its relevance to 9/11 and, most of all, its fearsome costs both in national resources and human lives. The film isn't objective, nor does it ever pretend to be. Moore keeps mockingly overstepping the boundaries while imagining what Bush is thinking, playing up the president's humor (both conscious and unconscious) and, at one point, superimposing Bush into the "Bonanza" TV title scene, along with fellow "Cartwrights" Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Tony Blair.This is a movie often much closer to David Letterman, "Saturday Night Live" or "Dr. Strangelove"--or a Rush Limbaugh satiric tirade--than to Ken Burns or "60 Minutes." There's a human voice behind every scene: joking or occasionally--as in the scenes with bereaved war mother Lila Lipscomb or Moore's moving paean to America's preponderantly working-class fighting forces--rising to unexpected heights of grief and eloquence.Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>or is he? I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 today along with me 70+-year-old mother. The first surprise was that it was even showing in her city and the second surprise was that there were a lot of elderly people in those theater seats! According to polls and statistics, a majority of Florida's senior citizens are pro-Bush and plan to vote for him in November. There were no "boos", a few laughs, a few jeers, and clapping at the end. So who are these subversives anyway? The majority of folks here are World War II veterans. Hard working, no nonsense, church-going, decent patriotic people. They are concerned for fate the of their grandchildren as well as the issues that they are personally dealing with on a daily basis. They know that they are breaking American laws when they buy medications from Canadian pharmacies but they still do it.As for Moore's documentary, it disturbed me greatly even though I had already heard and fact checked many of Moore's statements and found them to be true. I have spent the greater part of my day, checking out allegations from his movie and cannot dispute them without revising history.While Moore has told the truth, he has not always told the whole truth, but then, the documentary would have lasted days rather than hours. Brevity was of course on the side of the author in this presentation.Moore never claimed that it was unbiased, nor has he lied about wanting Bush out of the White House. Fahrenheit 9/11 tells the ugly truth about the connections between the Bush and Bin Laden families and excuses none from the fray, including Congress. Fahrenheit 9/11 speaks loudly for those Americans like my mother that have no other voice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important message from an imperfect filmmaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly the best film Michael Moore has made, Fahrenheit 9/11 appears to take some of its style and structure from Errol Morris documentaries. Moore could emulate worse.Moore has a lot to work with and it shows in the abbreviated attention he pays to some aspects of the events between 2000 - 2003. He is even more abbreviated in covering GW Bush's activities before his inauguration. And, I feel Moore spends too much time on the Bush/House of Saud connections -- something of a non-sequitur.Most people who make documentaries do so because they have a point of view. Moore's point of view is no secret. He uses a mix of vintage movie clips, well-chosen pop music and some musical themes that sound vaguely like Philip Glass (the Errol Morris influence again, I guess) all to good effect. Technically, there are a couple of errors and in a few cases, facts left out to make a point. Neither are entirely forgivable, especially since Moore was publicly spanked for the 'free rifle' setup in "Bowling for Columbine" but I think Moore probably lacks the perfectionism necessary to make a -- pardon the expression -- bulletproof film.Fahrenheit 9/11 is a powerful film because of what it says and shows, Moore gets the credit for stepping up and tackling the job. In future, maybe a more 'serious' filmmaker will tackle the same subject matter and make a 7 hour film. Moore gets the credit for keeping F911 engaging and powerful with moments of levity and a lot of real tragedy.It's sad that so much of this film is going to be a surprise to voters. There's very little new and nothing made up here. But having all of these facts in one place means this film has the power to change the outcome of a Presidential election if it is seen by enough people. And that puts it in the top rank of documentaries -- ever.9/10</fullReview>

I knew everything that was in the movie, there were no factual surprises, but what hit me the hardest was seeing the soldier writhing around on the ground with the very large wound in his leg. Realizing that what I was watching was real, not special effects or makeup or anything like that, hit me like a gut punch. Like the Bowie song goes, "It's No Game."I will say this here and now: this should have been rated PG-13. The biggest obscenities of this movie have nothing to do with the MF word, and besides, by the time I was in 4th grade we talked dirtier than that anyway. No, the biggest obscenities are the actions of a small cabal of people who have hijacked the country I love. The jerk with his movie "Michael Moore Hates America" is totally, completely wrong. Michael Moore LOVES America. And ultimately F 9/11 is his love letter to his country and mine. If you love your country, you will go see this movie with an open mind, without prejudice. And you will take your children too. By children I mean Middle School or High Schoolers, not Elementary School children. Elementary School-age kids are a bit too young for this. But the thing is that military recruiters are cruising Middle Schools in barrio and ghetto neighborhoods all over the US looking for children. You can "jine up" as early as Middle School now...it's called "Delayed Recruitment." I have a neighbor whose daughter will be going into the Navy after she graduates High School. I wish I could take her to see this movie. But I suppose we should be glad that this movie IS being seen here in America now, considering the current chilly climate for individual rights and liberties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers*I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11 the Sunday after it opened fully expecting to see Bush get trashed for 122 minutes. I am a registered Democrat so it's fair to say that I was looking forward to it as I don't care for Bush or his politics. What I wasn't expecting was a film of great cinematic quality see as it is a documentary. After briefly going over the unpleasantness of the 2000 election in Florida with all his usual sarcasm and wit, Moore then moves on to the tragedy of 9/11. Here is where his cinematic genius begins to show.Rather than bombard you with images of the planes hitting the twin towers or the pentagon he chooses to keep the screen blank for about a full minute while he plays a mixture of audio from the event. You hear the sounds of the first plane crashing and the reactions of people on the ground witnessing this. The second plane hits and you continue to see only a blank screen as you listen to the sounds of people reacting. The screen finally begins to show the faces of people looking up at the destruction; some are crying and shouting but most are stunned as most of us were watching at home. Finally the scene ends with the dust clouds and thousands of pages of paper floating in an almost beautiful but eerie way. Throughout this segment Moore never once shows the actual buildings being struck or falling and, as any one who was in the U.S. watching TV that day knows that was virtually ALL that you saw for about a week.I, like most of us that day, was going about my usual business. I wasn't really sure what had happened that day until I got home from my college classes at about 10:30 am EST and had only really heard that there had a couple of plane crashes. I thought that perhaps this was some computer error or something like that and it wasn't until I saw that BOTH towers and the Pentagon had been hit that I realized that these had been intentional. There is a mild sorrow that you feel upon hearing about a tragic loss of life. You don't know any of the people personally but you feel sorry for the loss and the suffering that their families must be feeling. When I saw the totality of the destruction I went from the feeling I have just described to a kind of dizzy numbness. It was that feeling where you can't really believe that what you are seeing is real, like it's a nightmare that you are almost sure that you will wake up from at any moment. The idea that someone could have such raw hatred and disregard for all life that they could do such a thing was not something that I could immediately wrap my mind around.I know that I have gone somewhat off of the subject here but I felt it was necessary to put my feelings from and about that day into words when commenting on this film.Moore then goes on to expose the actions in the administration that contributed to the tragedy, the contradictions, mistakes, and lies of the administration in their rush to go to war wit Iraq, and the outright lack of respect for human life that went into the initial bombing and the current subjugation of the Iraqi people.For me there are two scenes that resonate strongly. The first is the reaction of the Iraqi people to the deaths caused by the U.S. military's bombing of their cities. The second is a scene where Moore is filming a mother of a soldier who had been killed in Iraq Speaking to an Iraqi woman one the street in DC who has also lost family in her home land. As the two of them are speaking a woman walks up and begins hollering that this is staged (obviously thinking that the camera is for a news crew) and that they are lying. The Mother of the deceased soldier states that her son is dead and the woman ask her skeptically "Oh yeah? Where did he die?" the mother tells her Carbala. The skeptic then brushes it off as if she doesn't care if it's true or not.Regardless of how you feel about Bush the cinematic beauty and the raw human emotion of this film make it a must see if only for the sake of satisfying your curiosity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much has been written about this movie - with the Right reviling it because it "lies" and the rest of the country glad to see some of this stuff for the first time, and presented in some semblance of continuity.There is one almost invisible notation that MM makes that is maybe the most important. I don't remember the exact factoid (I think it was about the Afghan Pipeline), but MM commented that the specific subject was not published in any newspaper in the U.S. - but the Brits had it.I found out (due to links posted in an email) even before we attacked Afghanistan that the BBC and The Guardian were VERY good sources of info on all of this. At first, I didn't know if I could trust the facts being presented, but some checking proved to me that I could. As time went on, I pretty much stopped reading the one-sided pablum that passes for news in the U.S., and I stayed the course with the British papers online. The facts are presented objectively, they will call out their own PM when he deserves it, they don't pull their punches, and when they say "in-depth interview", by God, they mean tough questions and staying on the interviewee and don't let him dodge it. Are they wrong sometimes in their assessments? Certainly! But it is possible to get more than one side of a story.In comparison, U.S. news media is all a bunch of cheerleading, too scared to p*** off the Administration for fear of not getting access the next time around, and known far and wide as "puff" interviewers.Moore, evidently was able to find the same info that HAS BEEN OUT THERE SINCE BEFORE AFGHANISTAN WAS INVADED.Some news people have said, "But he doesn't present anything new." Right, not new to them, but a lot of what they knew they didn't think it was important to tell the U.S. citizenry. So, a lot of people are getting exposed to this for the first time - by a moviemaker.What does that tell you about the U.S. news media.Yes, shame on Bush, Ashcroft, Cheney, Powell (a good man sucked into a black hole), Rice, et al.But shame on the Congress for abdicating their responsibilities to be a check on the Emperor.And shame on the Fourth Estate for cowtowing to liars, cheats and frauds - and now killers of people in an innocent country.Yes, Iraq is innocent of 9/11. Bush now is telling everybody, "But I never said that they were in cahoots with al Quaeda!" But he did, as did all his top sycophants. That is why we invaded Iraq and killed its people, and pout American boys in harm's way. Because he told us they were one and the same.WMDs was just his lies to convince us there was a continuing threat.MM tells what we should have been hearing all along - the other side of the story - the one you had to read British papers to find out.Shame on the U.S. news media.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thanks to Michael Moore I have awaken after a long nap ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I WAS SLEEPING FOR A WHILE ... WHAT DID I MISS? I understand the anger that we as Americans feel after the WTC was crashed into by hijacked airliners killing a few thousand people. I understand the pain and fear that we all felt and still feel because of it (although, I of course cannot fathom what it felt like to lose a loved one in that tragedy). I, as much as I am against war, understand wanting to get the people responsible for it and bringing them to justice. I do not understand how going over to Afghanistan and reducing thousands of innocent people to ash accomplishes that, especially when it was mostly Saudi Arabians involved in the crashes. I do not see how sending Americans over there to die did anything beneficial. After all, the man who we are told is responsible is and was nowhere to be found along with most of his organization and I truly feel that this administration did not expect to find him in the first place. I haven't seen Osama smoked out of any holes but they did conveniently find Saddam in a hole. I understand even less where Iraq plays into this. Is Saddam Hussein the only madman in the world? Did he pose a direct threat to the United States? Explain to me how it is that Kennedy could present satellite photos of a missile in Cuba in the 60's and we could not obtain one photo of the dreaded WMD's in Iraq, in this era of supreme technology we live in. What is the real reason we are over there Mr. Bush? Could it be OIL? Could it be GREED? Of course not. Shame on me for thinking our leaders in this great corporate country would have such motivations. That's just plain "unpatriotic" and "anti-american." Keep buying it America. Keep letting these people who could care less about the average person what is and what is not patriotic and American. Because Bush and his administration love each and every one of us. Excuse me, I think I need to vomit now. I'm sure we can find a whole bunch of maniacal leaders throughout the world who hate the United States. There aren't a whole hell of a lot of countries in the world that like us because of our wonderful leaders' magnificent foreign policies and dealings. Some of them say they do, because they are afraid that we will massacre them if they don't, and others just enjoy the revenue they receive from business dealings with us. So, here we are, murdering thousands of Iraqis and sacrificing the lives of our own troops for the sake of what? We were told that a big part of this was to give Iraq a democracy. Gee, I thought that people vote in a democracy. I would think that appointing a leader without an election would be the opposite, but what do I know. Then again, we live in a democracy, and our presidential election is somewhat fictional at times. We were also supposed to be there to uncover these WMD's that Bush spoke so confidently about having knowledge of. Well, Georgie boy, WHERE ARE THEY? Then again, if they had them, it would probably be because we funded Mr. Hussein in the first place. Oh yeah, didn't our CIA train Bin Laden and the Taliban and provide him with a windfall of money as well? Of course, I will be called anti-American for saying the things I say, but nothing could be further from the truth. Being against a greedy Corporate run Government that stops at nothing to build profits is not the same thing as being anti-American. Not in my America. I care about my fellow citizens who share this land with me. I care about our rights and freedom. I also care that we are being pumped with fear in order to allow the government to take away the rights that we have. I care that imaginary terrorist threats are being fabricated and "taken care of" in order to keep us afraid and believe that our leaders are keeping us safe. I care that our government developed something they call the USA "Patriot" Act to combat "Terrorism" that gives the government the right to keep track of your every move with no reason or valid suspicion of wrong doing. Unless everyone is suspected of being a terrorist, that doesn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense now does it? Remember those privacy forms you filled out at the doctor's office? Well, that was a crock. The "Patriot" Act allows them to go through your medical records along with anything else at their leisure. Sounds real patriotic, doesn't it. About as patriotic as wiping your backside with a copy of the US Constitution. Damn them for using the word Patriot in this Unconstitutional nonsense. If being patriotic means supporting a War that has no merit than I want no part of it. If it means upholding the constitution than I am all for it. I am patriotic towards my fellow human being, not towards a bunch of greedy warmongers hellbent on power! I am not against the troops that are so valiantly putting their lives on the line because they believe that they are really fighting for our "freedom." I salute them for their bravery and feel horrible that the establishment was able to convince them of that lie. It's a shame that they send our soldiers out risking their lives, with false intentions. The Corporate government and media have certainly done a wonderful job of turning lies into truth. A lot of people will not go see the revealing, and powerful, Fahrenheit 9/11 by Michael Moore (because they were told by the New York Post, Newsday, etc. that he is lying) without even bothering to look into it for themselves. People trust these wonderful corporate news sources. They trust them way too much. There were actually things that I read in a Post review of Fahrenheit 9/11 that were blatant lies claiming that Moore said things in the film that he did not even say. Other things were disputed in that and other news sources, that Moore obtained from government documents. "Oh say can you see..." that the media is not entirely honest with us. Could it be that the same corporations that are running the media are running our country? I have always been one to question authority, but I have never in my life felt more justified in that distrust than I do right now. I feel like I should have been paying more attention to what was going on a long time ago but regret is an ugly word that I choose not to define. With the whirlwind of lies that we have all been pasted with and all of the confusion that has come with it, none of us can be blamed for being complacent. We're misinformed and misled. I think we should shock the system and show them that we know how to fight (without violence and bloodshed) and turn out in record numbers this year to the voting booth to begin to take our country back. I admit with shame that I have not voted in a long time myself (I had given up on all of these dishonest politicians and it was much more relaxing not to fight it), but that is all going to change from now on. All keeping it in does is force your frustrations out on others as you misdirect your emotions. If we all can convince others to do so as well, we may not be able to change things in a day, but a little at a time is all we can hope for. Send letters to our Congressmen when we have something to say or a question to be answered and let our voices be heard whenever possible. We need to let the establishment know that we are not just going to sit in silence as our rights are being incinerated. What we can do for now is vote, encourage others to vote, and otherwise just be heard. We have to stop grabbing our ankles and taking one for the team. Vote for whoever you want (just not GW ... ah hem ... just an opinion). Seriously, just vote and speak your mind ... I think there's a little bit of the first amendment there ... somewhere ... I think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Fahrenheit 9/11" - the temperature where freedom burns and...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... Suddenly takes a backseat to a larger, questionable agenda to the powers-that-be in Washington, D.C. I don't know about the rest of Americans, but I enjoy the rights granted to me by the Constitution, and I'm not giving them up for any reason, even if it is to capture terrorists, which our government obviously cannot do. Jolly populist filmmaker Michael Moore pulls no punches with his latest documentary, the wickedly titled "Fahrenheit 9/11," an obvious play on Ray Bradbury's classic novel "Fahrenheit 451."I don't think that Moore has the slightest clue what really happened on Sept. 11, 2001 when four planes were hijacked by terrorists and two crashed into the World Trade Center, one at the Pentagon, and the last in Pennsylvania. In the troubling times since that fateful day, I've not heard a single convincing defense of the Bush Administration's claims that the 9/11 attacks were in any way, not preventable, and that the reasons for going to war in the Middle East are highly suspect as well.Moore seems to believe that there was a lot more to the official story that Osama Bin Laden and his terrorist camp al-Qaeda are always plotting against us, that they may be the least of our worries, and that our own President George W. Bush stole the 2000 election and is using our fear of terrorism to help carry out sinister business transactions in the Middle East. The film goes to great lengths to condemn our president, to make him look like a fool (and in many ways succeeds), to prove Bush family links to Saudi Arabia, and that he deliberately misled the country into the Iraq conflict.I had never heard of Michael Moore before his Oscar-Winning documentary "Bowling For Columbine" but after seeing that riveting masterpiece, I now see a lot of his work as required viewing by the American public. Whether this film will succeed in its intended goal of ousting Bush from the White House come this November, remains to be seen. I am now of legal voting age and I aim to take full advantage of this opportunity to exercise this God-given right.Moore briefly explored Bush's reign of terror as the U.S. president to some degree in his winning account of gun violence in our country. But he did not go real deep into that subject matter and here, he takes every chance to bash the hell out of him whenever he is on screen."Fahrenheit 9/11" is the most emotional and powerful documentary I've ever seen; it is also downright hilarious in some spots, and brutally graphic in others. Gathering up footage from the Senate and actual war footage of the conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, it makes for a funny and disturbing experience. Beware though, this film's "R" rating is there for a reason, and the realistic war footage is what earns it; if there's one thing that the nay-sayers got right, it was the "Restricted" warning.If you haven't guessed it, I'm obviously on the side that everyone hates, which is Moore's side. I don't like Bush, and I feel that our country could not survive another four years under his reckless and dangerous leadership. Moore goes to the extreme sometimes with "Fahrenheit 9/11" in painting a portrait of Bush as not far from the people he is so eagerly pursuing with our military. In the film, Bush is seen as being quite incompetent - totally unprepared to run our country.I hope that Michael Moore continues doing what he is doing, being that he may be one of the few, brave American filmmakers left in this country that is willing to fight for what he thinks matters most ? our freedom; for some reason, this very right is being challenged by a great many people in the George Bush America of current times.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very engaging and eye-opening....a must-see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW**The approach I always have about movies like this is, if 1/4 of the stuff in it is true, it did it's job. Of what's presented in Fahrenheit 9/11, I've read about most of it in other books and such. It's nice to see someone put it altogether visually in such an engaging way. Bowling for Columbine was an EXCELLENT documentary, and Moore's Fahrenheit is right up there. A LOT of questions are raised, and a lot is exposed of Bush's devilish campaign as US President. It's kind of hard to dispute what's presented here, because what Moore showed really happened; real news bites, real people; everything is there in writing somewhere and has been proven....from the rigged election to the current ill-advised 'war on terror'. The news piece he showed with the guy advertising his 'invention' of a portable parachute was brilliant, because it showed just how LUDICROUS everything that's going on really is. The piece on Lydia, the super-patriotic woman bragging about having a military family--turned anti-patriot mom who loses a son in the war, was CLASSIC. That whole segment could've stood alone and the point would've been taken and understood perfectly. I think that's when all of what Moore shows &amp; talks about in Fahrenheit 9/11 REALLY hits home....and it's all presented and executed flawlessly. Michael Moore has done it again...this is a very important film you would NOT want to miss. Wonderful.**** out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given that we know Michael Moore has a certain point of view, I went to see the film with an open mind, to see what I could verify as "fact" apart from his agenda.Even given cutting, editing, positioning, juxtaposition, etc. there are some very damning words right out of Bush's own mouth, which are clearly revealing of his character (or rather lack of it) his ineptitude, his greed and his tragic lack of leadership.

		<fullReview>I don't wish to quibble with those who support the current foreign relations policy; likewise, I won't contend that the so-called "liberal" response is without oversights and inconsistencies. Rather, I'd like to suggest that the nature of the public response to this film reveals the deep misconceptions many Americans maintain regarding the place of the U.S. in the world. Moore's film seems to be designed to raise questions and SUGGEST an answer, not to offer conclusive proof. The final analysis is left to us.Critics who deride the film seem to have got at least three things wrong from a rhetorical point of view:1. Attacking the minutiae of one party's position is a poor way to support a contrary view. For example, merely pointing out that Richard Clarke gave the final OK for the bin Laden exodus flight doesn't prove that the Bush Administration should not be responsible for its acts or omissions. For the purposes of evaluating the decision, show me who, other than the President, was responsible for the decision at various levels and why a major decision implicating foreign relations was not taken by the President.2. Documentarians are entitled to present biased films; there is no presumption that all non-fiction films, especially of the fiction variety, are calculated to be objective factual presentations. Show me one time in history when the media generally were not biased. In fact, show me one media outlet in America that is honestly not biased. No, folks, the spouting of flippant anti-foreign views on Fox News doesn't really suggest unbiased reporting to me. Note that the film did include a number of independently verifiable facts. Don't like the *message* of Moore's film? Disagree on the facts? Make your own documentary spinning the facts according to your own message.3. Prior inconsistent positions taken by the proponent of an argument don't affect the validity of the proponent's argument here and now. The proposition that the Bushist agenda is focused only on bringing down Saddam (and potentially similar leaders) isn't weakened by Moore's prior views regarding the so-called "war" on terror. Moore clearly believes that the military response in Afghanistan and subsequent development of the (in)security regime were designed to lead to war with Iraq. Even if his previous positions were inconsistent with the present argument, so what? Can't he refine or change his views?Substantively, I thought that the film effectively tied together a number of controversial suggestions regarding the true motives of the Bush administration. I can even sympathize, as I have little confidence in the neo-Wilsonian vision of the President and his team. In an age when the nation is captivated for years by such insignificant issues as the bloody Lacey Peterson case, I am not surprised that many Americans would be prepared not to question the motives of a world leader who cries "freedom, at all costs." A foreign relations policy based on broad-based moral claims is attractive to Americans, because we assume that any reasonable foreigner ought to understand our pure motives. Yet, the foreigners don't, and neither do I. Bush has done what Wilson could not, i.e. commit to using all means necessary to bring about sweeping political changes. Moore doesn't really suggest that Saddam's Iraq was a paradise; rather, Moore suggests that Iraqis are worse off in some ways as a result of the war, which didn't actually achieve any of the security objectives. Against this framework, Moore's primary contention is that Bush has erred in the execution of the freedom plan, i.e. "might makes right." Did Bush's crack team of Cold Warriors obfuscate the various goals in order to justify invading Iraq? Did Bush use the war mentality and the war itself to increase his chances in 2004? Is obliterating a sovereign nation under the guise of an arguably lawful armed conflict a good substitute for a more focused attempt to eliminate a leader who poses a *regional* threat? Is the US justified in projecting its power in order to achieve its own security goals? Did we dishonestly use the Wilsonian doctrine in order to justify the pursuit of our own security goals?Perhaps we all need to turn off E! and think more about the tougher questions. Moore would agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This work of art, compiled masterfully by Michael Moore, should be seen by all in the U.S.. Whether or not they have interest in politics, a movie like this opens the eyes of America. Someone who has always blindly voted for their leader should see this movie and see just how much they have not been seeing. There is a method to madness, which is why the government is run just like a corporation, to make profits for the upper members. There are some graphic images in this movie, but they are for the better. I do not like how the media is so censored and biased. Not to say that this movie is not biased against our president, the sheer volume of facts that Moore has makes it worth the while to watch. This isn't the kind of movie that one will go see, laugh at, and forget it the next day. This movie will affect the way you think for the rest of your life for the better, opening your eyes to a whole new line of thinking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see how the opposition could attack some of his weaker points, and say that there is creative editing. However, I think the basis of the film is strong, there are obvious contradictions and ignorance in the Bush administration. For example, they gave a location as to where the "weapons of mass destruction" were in Iraq. Um, yeah, never there. Also very compelling was the letter of the deceased son of the woman in Flint, Michigan. It was heartwrenching, but also informative. He did not believe that we should have ever gone to Iraq and was set against Bush after that. Also, the Colonel that said he'd rather go to jail than back to Iraq. Some of it is difficult to watch, but I would recommend that everyone with a mind see this, for this upcoming election will determine our country's fate.</fullReview>

To those folks especially, I hope you do not make a habit of posting criticisms of movies you haven't been to see. Whether you agree with Michael Moore's tactics or appreciate his film-making techniques, anyone who has followed the news will appreciate that Moore has done his research. The most powerful message of the film is that the USA cannot function without freedom of the press. This country is lost if we do not demand responsible, tenacious, thorough reporting of possible conflicts of interest in high places. This movie started out light and then broke my heart. It is a plea for pulling America from ignorance; it argues against squandering the lives of our fighting men and women.Michael Moore may be heavy-handed and sophomoric at times, but his message is critical to the survival of our nation.Consider yourself a patriot? Pull your head out of the sand, turn off your FOX news, and go see the film.</fullReview>

Vacationing in Florida with his brother.Huh? 3000 people died on 9-11. could Mickey mouse take the place of those 3000 people? ask any mother who lost a child! My tax dollars are going to the goofiest Presidential terrorist group I had ever imagined. The Bush administration. Only one person had a son or daughter from a member of congress that was actually in Iraq. Where's Georgie boy? hunting big game or playing golf on my tax dollars. Are any of George's relatives in Iraq? No! Ask any poor mother who sends her son or daughter to the military if they could have afford a college education instead of sending their loved one to war to watch Bush play golf? I would choose to work my ass off to know that I would see my child the next day. If you are a Bush puppet keep believing him or do a little research on your own.

		<fullReview>I don't wish to quibble with those who support the current foreign relations policy; likewise, I won't contend that the so-called "liberal" response is without oversights and inconsistencies. Rather, I'd like to suggest that the nature of the public response to this film reveals the deep misconceptions many Americans maintain regarding the place of the U.S. in the world. Moore's film seems to be designed to raise questions and SUGGEST an answer, not to offer conclusive proof. The final analysis is left to us.Critics who deride the film seem to have got at least three things wrong from a rhetorical point of view:1. Attacking the minutiae of one party's position is a poor way to support a contrary view. For example, merely pointing out that Richard Clarke gave the final OK for the bin Laden exodus flight doesn't prove that the Bush Administration should not be responsible for its acts or omissions. For the purposes of evaluating the decision, show me who, other than the President, was responsible for the decision at various levels and why a major decision implicating foreign relations was not taken by the President.2. Documentarians are entitled to present biased films; there is no presumption that all non-fiction films, especially of the fiction variety, are calculated to be objective factual presentations. Show me one time in history when the media generally were not biased. In fact, show me one media outlet in America that is honestly not biased. No, folks, the spouting of flippant anti-foreign views on Fox News doesn't really suggest unbiased reporting to me. Note that the film did include a number of independently verifiable facts. Don't like the *message* of Moore's film? Disagree on the facts? Make your own documentary spinning the facts according to your own message.3. Prior inconsistent positions taken by the proponent of an argument don't affect the validity of the proponent's argument here and now. The proposition that the Bushist agenda is focused only on bringing down Saddam (and potentially similar leaders) isn't weakened by Moore's prior views regarding the so-called "war" on terror. Moore clearly believes that the military response in Afghanistan and subsequent development of the (in)security regime were designed to lead to war with Iraq. Even if his previous positions were inconsistent with the present argument, so what? Can't he refine or change his views?Substantively, I thought that the film effectively tied together a number of controversial suggestions regarding the true motives of the Bush administration. I can even sympathize, as I have little confidence in the neo-Wilsonian vision of the President and his team. In an age when the nation is captivated for years by such insignificant issues as the bloody Lacey Peterson case, I am not surprised that many Americans would be prepared not to question the motives of a world leader who cries "freedom, at all costs." A foreign relations policy based on broad-based moral claims is attractive to Americans, because we assume that any reasonable foreigner ought to understand our pure motives. Yet, the foreigners don't, and neither do I. Bush has done what Wilson could not, i.e. commit to using all means necessary to bring about sweeping political changes. Moore doesn't really suggest that Saddam's Iraq was a paradise; rather, Moore suggests that Iraqis are worse off in some ways as a result of the war, which didn't actually achieve any of the security objectives. Against this framework, Moore's primary contention is that Bush has erred in the execution of the freedom plan, i.e. "might makes right." Did Bush's crack team of Cold Warriors obfuscate the various goals in order to justify invading Iraq? Did Bush use the war mentality and the war itself to increase his chances in 2004? Is obliterating a sovereign nation under the guise of an arguably lawful armed conflict a good substitute for a more focused attempt to eliminate a leader who poses a *regional* threat? Is the US justified in projecting its power in order to achieve its own security goals? Did we dishonestly use the Wilsonian doctrine in order to justify the pursuit of our own security goals?Perhaps we all need to turn off E! and think more about the tougher questions. Moore would agree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beautifully done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This work of art, compiled masterfully by Michael Moore, should be seen by all in the U.S.. Whether or not they have interest in politics, a movie like this opens the eyes of America. Someone who has always blindly voted for their leader should see this movie and see just how much they have not been seeing. There is a method to madness, which is why the government is run just like a corporation, to make profits for the upper members. There are some graphic images in this movie, but they are for the better. I do not like how the media is so censored and biased. Not to say that this movie is not biased against our president, the sheer volume of facts that Moore has makes it worth the while to watch. This isn't the kind of movie that one will go see, laugh at, and forget it the next day. This movie will affect the way you think for the rest of your life for the better, opening your eyes to a whole new line of thinking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see how the opposition could attack some of his weaker points, and say that there is creative editing. However, I think the basis of the film is strong, there are obvious contradictions and ignorance in the Bush administration. For example, they gave a location as to where the "weapons of mass destruction" were in Iraq. Um, yeah, never there. Also very compelling was the letter of the deceased son of the woman in Flint, Michigan. It was heartwrenching, but also informative. He did not believe that we should have ever gone to Iraq and was set against Bush after that. Also, the Colonel that said he'd rather go to jail than back to Iraq. Some of it is difficult to watch, but I would recommend that everyone with a mind see this, for this upcoming election will determine our country's fate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1st Half Brilliant, 2nd Half Drags But Is Nessesary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of Michael Moore's anti-Bush documentary is brilliant--funny, incisive, and educational. It is full of embarrassing facts about those in the Bush regime that have been virtually ignored by mainstream US media. It is also full of Moore's personal questions about and conclusions drawn from those facts. Bush fans can certainly argue Moore's conclusions, but the facts?.well, they's the facts, sir. Moore lays out in fascinating detail the connections between the Bush family and friends involved in the 2000 presidential election debacle as well as the cozy business connections between the Bush family, the Saudis and the Bin Ladin family. All this is very interesting and it is good to finally see it put out into a public forum that the powers that be have failed to crush (though the film did have to be released by a Canadian company, Lion's Gate). You can choose to put the facts together to come up with a different conclusion, but it is Moore's intention to sell you on his conclusions of their meaning. And I don't mean that as a negative--it is what the US government has been doing since 9/11, presenting us with their version of what the facts mean, and turnabout is fair play. They've had over two years to give us their version, Moore now has his two hours.The second half of the film concentrates for the most part on the War in Iraq itself, with lots of footage of servicemen's daily life as well as graphic depictions of gruesome war casualties, both physical and mental. One woman's family is particularly focused on in a way that is at times touching, at times maudlin bordering on gratuitous, though I won't spoil it for you by going into further detail. This half of the film drags--lots of talking head interviews in-between the gory military footage bits. It actually gets pretty dull, with many fewer ideas being presented and much, much less humor (of course). But the war footage Moore presents, though repetitive, is necessary. It is necessary only because it is the side of the conflict that the government and its media lackeys have refused to show us . They want us to believe this is a clean war with only bad guys getting killed, along with a few of our brave boys as well. All the human suffering has been reduced to jingoistic rah rah from awed reporters and cold numbers on a screen. Well, any soldier who's seen action in a conflict can tell you that is bullshit. Moore is only showing us what the big boys have been trying to hide from us for so long. Now if there had been honest reporting all along, the good as well as the bad and the ugly, then much of Moore's Iraq war footage would indeed be redundant, unnecessary, reduced considerably in power. But the fact is that the government has previously either banned the use of this kind of footage outright (remember the administration edict banning photos of the flag-draped coffins of our dead soldiers?), or has gone out of its way to brand media outlets that didn't tow the party line as "unpatriotic." Moore is only reminding us of something we used to know--war in general is not pretty, and this war is no exception. That's pretty simple.But, man, if you go into the movie with your head already out of your ass on that count, most of the second half of the film gets pretty damn dull.One last point, the friend I went to the movie with said that she was surprised it was so "anti-military." I told her that I didn't think it was anti-military and she said "then you were watching a different movie than I was!" We talked about it, I tried to win her over to my way of seeing things--that Moore was not criticizing the soldiers themselves, but rather the motivations of the rich, privileged men who sent our men and women in uniform to die in an unnecessary, ill-planned, and downright dumb war. I pretty much only succeeded in talking myself out of getting laid, however, because she was not won over by my logic and arguments. But that's the beauty of America (the freedom of thought and expression part, not the "not getting laid" part). People can think and say what they want, and even when we can agree on the facts, we are free to interpret them according to our own way of thinking. And that is how Moore's film should be seen--as a presentation of repressed facts as well as his personal interpretation of those facts. And I think the average American, if he or she can pull his or her head out of his or her party politic ass for a couple of hours, is smart enough to differentiate between the two.For all it polemic qualities, the film inarguably presents us with an array of facts that have been kept under the covers for way too long."Fahrenheit 9/11" is pretty good movie--but more importantly, it is a desperately necessary one.</fullReview>

Then the world will see "Great Leader" Bush again and he will get the sympathy vote or get a chance to steal more votes this year in the predictable confusion. Still, at least it gives Michael Moore a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my two cents - why not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading through the comments and seeing this red-letter film, I am compelled to say a few things. First, to all those of you who comment out of your totally misplaced rage at Michael Moore and spew about the lack of facts - tell me then, where are your facts that negate, or contradict the telling of a sad story about a President who's not only good at bankrupting companies, but bankrupting a nation? If you haven't any facts yourself, then shut the pie hole about facts. Just because something makes you uncomfortable, does not make it untrue.Second, this is a movie, which is a story. History being told, is story. Story, like history books, is someone else's retelling of events. Like any piece of history, told from any source, particularly FOX news, this is subject to both inaccuracies and bias slants. So, get over it. Finally, something that can expose information and events, that few people ever care to acknowledge or think about. Third, being a movie, and a story, this was intended to entertain, much as it was intended to stir controversy, make money, and of course, educate. Calling Michael Moore a liar who was after his own political gain, as one critic did, is both misinformed and absurd. To lay claim that this is why America is beside itself, is also, incredibly ignorant to the world around you. The world is not beside itself because of this, it is in disagreement because of the lack of information and facts we are actually ever provided from Big Brother. So, I say, get out a little more and experience the world around you and criticize less.Lastly, sure, editing is instrumental in the re-telling of a story, to drill home the point you are making. And yes, MM is making a point, that Bush is not a very competent president with the people of this country's best interest in his decision making...the the extent that anything he even says or does is truly his own thinking. But the pictures, interviews and genuine frustrations of the people who's voice was finally heard, speak volumes about the direction this nation is moving if people like Moore are not allowed to express their experiences and opinions...which ironically is precisely the direction we are heading. Freedom is a beautiful thing. To dismiss the beauty of the film for it's heroic expression is to trample on the aspect of this country that allows you to write your angry and hostile critiques of the movie in the first place.One last thing...to those who would call Moore anti-American...Patrotism is idolatry and lunacy. My country right or wrong, my president right or wrong, is stupidity. Listen to people's reasons and judge for yourself. And thankfully we live in a country where opinions and reason's can be expressed. If for no other reason, see this movie as an expression of the freedom granted to you as a citizen in this country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very important for everyone to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that most people do want to know the truth. And so many of us were not aware of the truth, because it was not made readily available to us via most of our media. American Idol was pushed into our homes, and realities that we needed to be aware of were left out. Finally, thanks to this film, we all have the chance to understand what has happened to our world in the last few years, and why. Some people may not want to see this movie because of the violence of war that is depicted in it. And some people really cannot tolerate viewing violence. Those who can, should watch it. After all, the victims of war hardly have the choice whether to participate or not. And it does drive home the reality of what has happened in the few last years. Those who choose not to view it and those who feel that some of the facts may be incorrect, should consider reading "House of Bush / House of Saud" by Craig Unger, which has much of the same information and is very well footnoted. It is most important for us to educate ourselves. History books will not forgive us for following blindly.</fullReview>

I have told several people at work to see the film and if they are not blown away, I've told them that I would buy them lunch.

Michael Moore elicits the secretive, closed-door deals of George W.

		<shortDescription>Sometimes, The Truth Hurts...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F911 is a revelation. But for different reasons than what most would think.I knew that the Bush Administration was wanting to invade Iraq since they took office because I had read the book on Paul O'Neill, the former Bush Treasury Secretary, and life-long Republican, called "The Price of Loyalty".I knew the Bush Administration completely ignored terrorism warnings prior to 9/11, because I read the book by Bush's Anti-Terrorism Director, Richard Clarke (another life-long Republican), "Against All Enemies." I knew that Bush lied about WMD, because we have never found any in Iraq. And I have detected the Administration's use of the phrase "The War on Terror" when referring to Iraq, trying to merge the two (Iraq and 9/11) in the public's conscienceness, in hopes the public would be confused just enough to see some kind of justification for the war. But what I never realized, and what F911 showed, was the following, and they are damning: 1) the President's family has such close ties to the Saudis in general, and the Bin Laden's in particular 2) former President Bush (41) is the only ex-president who elects to receive daily CIA briefings, and he continues to meet with the Saudi royal family. 3) the Bushes, Cheneys, and their companies have received $1.4 billion in Saudi funding over the last 30 years. That's billion, with a "b." 4) the Bushes profit handsomely through the Carlyle Group and defense contracts.This is appalling!!! But I was so happy, too, to see Moore take the mainstream press to task. After endless reports in the media about the phantom illicit Whitewater dealings of Clinton, and Kenneth Starr, and the Travel Office, and Lewinski, and on and on and on, all of which were, after all, rather trivial in comparison (and not true, except for Lewinski, as the press eventually learned, but which we knew all along).... here we have a president and administration that bungled national security resulting in 3,000 lost lives, then cynically used the horrific event to manipulate the public into supporting an unjust war in Iraq, costing another 1,000 American lives, and further eroding security as well as our basic rights as Americans through the "Patriot" Act. And for what? All mostly to line their own pockets. And we get nothing from the vaunted Fourth Estate. It takes an eccentric film-maker from Michigan to hold our collective face up to the stinking, odious truth. CBS, ABC, NBC, and CNN, you ought to be ashamed. (FoxNews is an arm of the GOP, as anyone with a brain can tell).I've voted for 3 Republican and 3 Democratic presidents. I call on my Republican friends to take back your party from the neo-conservative idealogues who are now in charge. Read. Think. Listen. Listen to John McCain, if you won't listen to Michael Moore. God Bless America, and God Bless Michael Moore. I laughed, I cried, and I began to think for myself. Let's throw Bush and his gang of thieves out of office and take back our country!

The chain of events are so fluent, that they cannot be coincidental. Osama created an attack that diverted the attention and feelings of the world away from what Bush really wanted to do (invade Iraq, because no president involved in a war has ever lost reelection), and Bush covered Osama's ass because of his ties to the Bin Ladin family from whom he received much capitol in his previous business "adventures". The facts are there and for anyone to contest them, they would be impossible to misprove. Great movie, want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An eye-opening look back at the last 4 years of Bush's reign</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Michael Moore's strongest movie to date. He wisely chooses to remain off camera for the majority of it, letting the audience gather its own impression. Mr. Moore presents us with the accounts of soldiers and citizens, as well as media footage from 2000 through the present to help us connect the dots. True, he portrays Dubya and the Republican Party in a very harsh light, but it isn't unjustified. And the Democratic leaders aren't shown as saints, either. I urge everyone to see this immediately. Take what you will away from it. Hopefully Americans will stop being so apathetic and self-absorbed.SPOILERS AHEAD!!! While I really appreciated Mr. Moore's film, I wish he had delved a little bit more into the roles of other countries (such as vocal war opponents France and Germany) in "helping" Afghanistan and Iraq, and the Clinton administration's plan of action prior to the 9/11 attacks. Also, he could have done more to point out the duplicity of Saudi Arabia, a country clearly playing both sides. He barely scratched the surface on Saudi Arabia's culpability and hypocrisy. Characteristic of his earlier work, there are some very uncomfortable and graphic moments in the film, but the public needs to see it. The US media is too complacent and/or stifled. Moore shows us what the media is afraid or unable to. The American public has chosen to sleep rather than being alert and better informed. This film is a wakeup call to American citizens, a rallying cry for change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The expected and the unexpected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into the movie with the worst of expectations. While the previews were very honest about film's intentions and tactics, my impressions were different than I had initially anticipated. I didn't like Bowling for Columbine-I don't particularly like Michael Moore. However, this movie made me think. I am well aware that many people will come out of this movie convinced one way or the other. I'm not entirely sure what I think of the president at this point, judging by all of the facts that were laid out in front of me. But I think to myself, "are there any facts similar to these pertaining to Democrats?" Truth is, this movie is too much of a battle between Democrats and Republicans, with the Democrats getting a lot more "explaining time." This movie should not be about Democrats and Republicans. It should be about Americans. 60% of Americans supported the war at its outset. Why? Moore suggests that it is fear. If the war is unjust and illegal, where were all the Democrats when it was still up for "debate?" I think America needs to stop thinking so narrowly and realize who is really the cheater, and who is really the liar. 60% of Americans aren't afraid of Iraq. Heck, America destroyed the Iraqi army 13 years ago. 60% of Americans don't care all that much about the Iraqi people (what about other oppressed people?) So, what is it that got 60% of Americans so excited? Did everyone really believe that Osama Bin Laden's thugs are operating out of there?Anyway, back to my movie commentary. I think Michael Moore is too much all-over-the-place. I liked the segment about the military being comprised of so many people from poverty-stricken inner cities and neighborhoods, and it was very powerful when coupled with the segment with Moore asking Cogressmen if they would like their sons enlisted in the army. I just don't see the connection. NO ONE WANTS THEIR CHILDREN TO BE IN A WAR. We know that Lila Lipscomb went from being a pro-war, pro-Bush, "conservative Democrat" to being anti-war, and anti-Bush. We know why. The question is, why was she supportive of the war in the beginning? I think the point that Moore fails to make is that Americans just don't understand/care. The American people didn't support the war because they were fooled by the president. Americans supported the war because they just didn't care. We, as Americans, need to take a good look at ourselves and realize that we do not live on this planet alone. It shouldn't take your son's death (God forbid) for you to realize that something is right or wrong. Yes, it is painful for a mother to lose her son, and no one should take away from her pain, but why does it take something so terrible for you to think about the war's terrible consequences? Americans need to be more actively involved in the political process. They need to be informed. I don't think those same 60% were informed. I don't think they care to be informed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is going to spark heated debate for a long time, and it's going to be at least a marginal reference point in political history, so you should see it. It's not an Oliver Stone conspiracy theory - it just clearly depicts the powers and motivations that actually control this country, and it's an important film to see for education's sake. Regardless of your party affiliation, after this movie you won't see the government the same way. I personally found it emotionally powerful - no one in the theater could resist tears at Lila's grief - and though I was strongly opposed to the war in Iraq and to Bush before seeing the movie, the raw and brutal footage of the carnage was an awakening. My complaint with the film is Moore's smug voice-over. Had his tone not been so wry and smug, and potentially off-putting to undecided voters, I'd be more confident in the movie's potential to affect the vote in November. The Republican party also seems to be trying to suppress it - you should go see it before they make it illegal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film, But I Still Hate Moore...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Moore's films, but the man is annoying as hell. He's always so smug and self-congratulatory in his interviews...and he's hardly a documentation. Filmmaker, yes. documentation, no. I found a lot of flaws in this film, but the main flaw I witnessed was coming out the theater. I overheard so many people (mostly of the younger, college freshman, I'm-so-intelligent, coffeehouse drinking, I-get-my-knowledge-of-politics-from-the-Daily Show, variety) spouting off to their significant others about how "THIS is what I'm taking about! It's about time America sees the TRUTH! We were duped! This is what I've been saying all along!!" I felt like reaching over and patting them on the head. There, there little ones. Don't freak out. To accept this film as the absolute truth, is basically putting your faith in the hands of Michael Moore...one man's editorial piece. And while the movie itself has many valid points and laughs thrown in...to accept it as absolute truth reflects the same argument he's against, which is don't believe everything you read or see. I think the film would have been improved upon had Moore included a more even "documentary". Instead of being so one-sided and blatantly showing his bias for Bush on his sleeve, the film would have been more effective if he also included "the other" viewpoints &amp; perspectives. I would have liked to see interviews with Tony Blair or Iraqi-Americans who first celebrated when the statues of Saddam were toppled. Any mention of the thousands of tortured/killed/missing people under Saddam's regime...just a little something to balance things out.I like Moore's films because they do make me laugh. I laughed at the segment where the Marines are recruiting the poor neighborhoods, but certainly I was not shocked by any revelations. Moore acts like he's blowing the lid off a huge scandal. Anyone who knows anything about war and politics can tell you that the poor and disenfranchised has always been the victim of being recruited to do jobs that middle/upper class folks would prefer not to. It's not right and it's certainly a horrible truth, but I don't see that changing...ever. Moore is highly idealistic which I suppose is the beauty of his films...but realistically, this is hardly a shocker. I also noticed that the minorities in the audience were hardly surprised at this revelation either. Mostly I heard white folks gasping in shock, "what!? That's terrible!" Welcome to Planet Earth folks.Well, that's my comments for now. Enjoy! I may vote for Bush in Nov JUST to spite Moore and his damn smugness. hee hee</fullReview>

The movie makes its point with humor but never fails to drive its points home. If the news media did its job, we wouldn't need Michael Moore. As it doesn't, we most definitely do.It's hard to imagine how Moore got hold of some of the more damaging footage. The post-election scene in Congress is hard to believe. The footage of Iraqi civilian and US military casualties is graphic. I found myself asking again and again - "Why do I have to go to the movies to see all this - why is it not on the nightly news?"No matter how much you think you know about the last four years, I guarantee there will be surprises here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The truth about the complot against the American people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true enemy shown in Fahrenheit 911 is not Bin Laden or the Iraqis or Hussein, but the greedy corporations that created a huge lie about what really happened in pursuit of business.Of course was the very corrupt media who created the illusion and the fear. The same media that complained about inaccuracy on the facts shown in this movie with the only intention of discourage viewers. Probably a couple of dates are wrong, but Moore real target is the plot of the corrupted government (both Democrats and Republicans) and corporations to generate business on the Arabs countries of Afghanistan and Iraq with the insignificant cost of thousand of human lives.That the movie portraits Bush as a joke, is only a reaffirmation of something you realized after hearing him for two minutes. But for those still believers on the sanctity of the war, just go and see this document to understand that, the same way as in many Third World countries, low income and cultural impaired people are used and annihilated to serve the business of the ruling class.See the movie (before the elections) and get your own opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The expected and the unexpected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into the movie with the worst of expectations. While the previews were very honest about film's intentions and tactics, my impressions were different than I had initially anticipated. I didn't like Bowling for Columbine-I don't particularly like Michael Moore. However, this movie made me think. I am well aware that many people will come out of this movie convinced one way or the other. I'm not entirely sure what I think of the president at this point, judging by all of the facts that were laid out in front of me. But I think to myself, "are there any facts similar to these pertaining to Democrats?" Truth is, this movie is too much of a battle between Democrats and Republicans, with the Democrats getting a lot more "explaining time." This movie should not be about Democrats and Republicans. It should be about Americans. 60% of Americans supported the war at its outset. Why? Moore suggests that it is fear. If the war is unjust and illegal, where were all the Democrats when it was still up for "debate?" I think America needs to stop thinking so narrowly and realize who is really the cheater, and who is really the liar. 60% of Americans aren't afraid of Iraq. Heck, America destroyed the Iraqi army 13 years ago. 60% of Americans don't care all that much about the Iraqi people (what about other oppressed people?) So, what is it that got 60% of Americans so excited? Did everyone really believe that Osama Bin Laden's thugs are operating out of there?Anyway, back to my movie commentary. I think Michael Moore is too much all-over-the-place. I liked the segment about the military being comprised of so many people from poverty-stricken inner cities and neighborhoods, and it was very powerful when coupled with the segment with Moore asking Cogressmen if they would like their sons enlisted in the army. I just don't see the connection. NO ONE WANTS THEIR CHILDREN TO BE IN A WAR. We know that Lila Lipscomb went from being a pro-war, pro-Bush, "conservative Democrat" to being anti-war, and anti-Bush. We know why. The question is, why was she supportive of the war in the beginning? I think the point that Moore fails to make is that Americans just don't understand/care. The American people didn't support the war because they were fooled by the president. Americans supported the war because they just didn't care. We, as Americans, need to take a good look at ourselves and realize that we do not live on this planet alone. It shouldn't take your son's death (God forbid) for you to realize that something is right or wrong. Yes, it is painful for a mother to lose her son, and no one should take away from her pain, but why does it take something so terrible for you to think about the war's terrible consequences? Americans need to be more actively involved in the political process. They need to be informed. I don't think those same 60% were informed. I don't think they care to be informed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew most of the facts this movie presents before going into the theatre. I still couldn't help but be stricken by the case Moore makes regarding the close ties between the Bush family and the al-Saud family, and the relationship both have with the bin Laden family.I hope that people see this film, and that they then seek verification of the facts it presents. Bush and his contingency may not be traitors, but they are certainly not acting in the best interest of our country. Truth is relative, and Moore's version of the truth proves how 'relative' it really is.To all of you who accuse Moore of being a traitor - note that he's merely reporting what he sees, he's not setting and executing policy that impacts world stability and American safety and prosperity. The Bushis are, and we as Americans have a right and a duty to be critical in our examination of their impact. Agree with him or not, you must recognize that Moore is a patriot BECAUSE he steps up to this difficult duty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long overdue masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 911 was exactly what this country needed. In a nation where the "Patriot" Act scares people into keeping their mouths shut, we needed a man as brave and talented as Michael Moore to release a film of this nature. It brilliantly portrays the darker side of the Bush administration, which is the side that other parts of the media are afraid to mention. It masterfully shows the atrocities committed by the current government, starting with the sneaking and lying used to obtain their power right down to the dishonesty used to get blind support of an unjustified war. This movie was heart-wrenching, thought-provoking, and wonderfully informative. Moore gets a 10/10 for this gem. Thank you, Mike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a genius. The construction of the movie is tight and to the point. From Bush's selection by his Daddy's friends on the Supreme Court, through his connections to Carlyle and the Bin Ladens, and finally, to his stunted state of development, as evidenced by his inane facial expressions, both just after the attacks of 9/11 and as he waits to speak to the nation.And the Democrats? Barely worth mentioning, except for the Senate's inability to rouse one senator to protest the sham that chose this so-called president. Moore's write-off of Daschle, giving him a brief cameo stating he will endorse Bush waging war on Iraq, is priceless, just priceless.The heart-rending recording of a mother's grief, with the ultimate question:"Why?", followed by the piece on Haliburton is neat and clean, and harks back to Dylan's "Masters of War". And the startled reactions of members of Congress, when asked for the enlistment of their children, is as graphic a presentation of the hypocrisy of it all as one could desire.A jewel of a movie, a mega-bomb of truth.The Old Hag Detroit, Michigan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit short of expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seemed pretty obvious to me when watching the film that Moore's primary target audience was the Average Joe. And keeping that in mind, he did an excellent job. This movie used a bit of every of the filmmaker's signature tactics to put together a movie that will finally send people doing something about it. However, i guess i was expecting something new or more. All the facts related in the movie are known stuff to people with any interest in news and politics in general. Seems we needed someone to put this all together and facilitate the connections between all of those or maybe Average Joe doesn't have access to news or no interest in getting them in the 1st place (hint for Average Joe: The BBC has a website...oh and Fox has The Simpsons..not news)Of course, now that Iraq had been proven a total fiasco, facts opposing the war are not so easily dismissed and digging dirt on Bush seems like an amusing pastime for so many people at the moment that all of these first overseen facts will finally reach the people that didn't both listening the first time around.Moore also relies more on the "get your Kleenex" scenes than usual which is kind of sad. I believe he uses humor so much more successfully than tears and scenes like that in a documentary always feel kinda manipulative.Moore's detractors will definitely classify this work as lefty propaganda. I'm not objecting. Of course it's propaganda. If there's one thing the republicans easily proved during their time in charge is that progagandha DO work. Why not fight them on their own ground?While Fahrenheit 9/11 could potentially be more important and initiate more changes and actions, I enjoyed his previous works a bit more. Also, most of the issues related in this film is covered more deeply in either Stupid White Men or Dude, Where's My Country. Anyone who enjoyed the movie should dig these books if they want more. I also recommend reading some other works on the subjects just to get a different point of view. (Another hint for Average Joe: a lot of the footnotes in books can be tracked on the web when you doubt a quote had been taken out of context)So while F911 is definitely a must-see, I still give my vote for doc of the year to The Corporation</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the movie and I loved it. I am neither a republican nor a democrat. I choose to be a person who votes based on the position the candidates have. I do have to say that I do have a strong distaste for President Bush. I do not believe that he truly has the country's best interest at heart, I think he has his own agenda. But that is beside the point. I do not want to preach my vote to anyone just as I do not want someone to preach their vote to me. If anything I would like to preach peace. I have read several reviews of this movie and I have found that many people think that Michael Moore has no respect for the troops. I have no idea what movie they saw but I thought he had a hell of a lot of respect for the men and women fighting for our country. Just because he doesn't agree with the war doesn't mean he doesn't support the troops. I think what we all forget is that those men and women are fighting so that we can have our separate views. They fight so that you and I can disagree. Most Americans find pride in the fact that we are the land of the free, then we criticize those with opinions that are different than ours. "Yeah I love America, we're the land of the free unless you have a different opinion than me, in that case get the hell out of my country." So I think that we should take a minute to think about how lucky we are to be able to disagree on a topic and not be persecuted for it. That is what this great nation is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore Moore's editorializing and listen to the people he interviews...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not much of a Moore fan, but I'm not against him either. He usually gets in his own way and trips over his own opinion in his movies, and it becomes Just Another Moore Vehicle. This movie, by contrast, does a really good visual job, and tells a two pronged story. Whether you believe his story or not, he puts together a non-fictional, yet not documentary, version of the Bush administration's reaction to 9/11.He starts off with his opinion concerning the 2000 election, which didn't seem quite apropos to me, but it does set the style of editing. It also gets the audience full bore into the flippant monologue which is Moore's chosen way to editorialize. Then he focuses on Bush's attendance record for a while, before truly coming down to the point of the movie. It seems vendetta-ish for a while, but when you look at the movie as a whole you see how Moore is setting up a theme of "how Bush acts on his responsibilities," which feeds the rest of the film.As a New Yorker, I cried bitterly with my memories when he turned focus to the terrorist attack on 9/11. However, I was extremely impressed at how he portrayed it. The editing and choices of footage are surprising and emotional without being too exploitative, ending in a beautiful yet desolate metaphor of lost lives. From there the audience is taken to the much-reviewed "7-minute" scene, which would have been better if Moore hadn't continued with his very flippant remarks over the top of it. It is still shocking and sad to watch, though, and while Moore undermines his own work by mocking speculation of "what the President is thinking," there is no denying that Bush made a huge mistake at that time. From here onward, Moore weaves his film around the string of mistakes, miscalculations, and manipulations surrounding the War on Terror that have plagued the Bush administration. I admit to being politically bored with the Bush/Saudi connection. It was interesting detective work, and it was intriguing to know that the people he placed in power had those corporate connections, but I didn't think it was the terrible thing Moore did. If Moore didn't think corporate nepotism was alive and well in American politics on both sides of the fence, that was a bit naive ;) I was even further annoyed at his "Coalition of the Willing" montage - I found it unconscionable that he portrayed the countries in such an arrogant, patronizing light (corresponding Iceland with a movie clip showing Vikings, and Palau with hula dancers), and neglected to add more active countries such as England, Poland, and Japan. On the other hand, once he's gone to footage of the Iraq war, he does a marvelous job showing the wide and diverse range of opinions in our own Armed Forces, from deeply inhumane to profoundly introspective and touching. He also does well when showing the transformation of opinion that happens to some soldiers and their families. When Moore stops editorializing and he just films these people talking, or adds news/media footage from hearings, press conferences, and other public events, there's an amazing sense of power to the content. Scenes of soldiers in physical rehabilitation, or scenes of policemen and state troopers expressing frustration, or scenes of congressmen on both sides expressing dissenting views - that's where this movie shines. I don't think I'll ever see any actor express anything as powerful as the face of the corporal as he makes his stance known. I also think that these scenes outstrip anything that could be done in a true documentary, because you can see with great clarity that this is a present-tense problem and people are still struggling with the ramifications of the decisions they've made.People who tend to agree with Moore's stances will, of course, adore this movie. But to anyone who is a fence-sitter, I beg that you go, ignore Moore's flippant and arrogant editorializing, and just listen to the people he interviews. Don't let Moore put a wall of resentment up between you and the voices of the people in his scenes. If you listen, you will learn things, you will cringe, and you will come away with something more than what you had when you walked into the theater.</fullReview>

It belies how corrupt and immoral George Bush is and what a tangled web of lies the neo-conservatives in this country wove in order to convince the American public of the legitimacy of committing the terrible sinful act of invading Iraq without provocation. This is a wonderful country and I celebrate the privilege of living the wonderful life I live, here, like everyone else.

		<fullReview>The movie has been sold out all over Dallas all weekend. Finally saw it this afternoon. Before the movie began a guy was screaming that you can't vote out a president when you are in the middle of the war.This man didn't have anything to say at the end of the movie. I never cry in movies yet I cried in this one. My husband never cries yet this movie made him cry. The man on the other side of me, a complete stranger, cried.This is not a movie to see only once.

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a genius. The construction of the movie is tight and to the point. From Bush's selection by his Daddy's friends on the Supreme Court, through his connections to Carlyle and the Bin Ladens, and finally, to his stunted state of development, as evidenced by his inane facial expressions, both just after the attacks of 9/11 and as he waits to speak to the nation.And the Democrats? Barely worth mentioning, except for the Senate's inability to rouse one senator to protest the sham that chose this so-called president. Moore's write-off of Daschle, giving him a brief cameo stating he will endorse Bush waging war on Iraq, is priceless, just priceless.The heart-rending recording of a mother's grief, with the ultimate question:"Why?", followed by the piece on Haliburton is neat and clean, and harks back to Dylan's "Masters of War". And the startled reactions of members of Congress, when asked for the enlistment of their children, is as graphic a presentation of the hypocrisy of it all as one could desire.A jewel of a movie, a mega-bomb of truth.The Old Hag Detroit, Michigan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Down with Apathy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to say, I think it's really cool that a movie could stir up so much emotion and controversy that the boards are flooded with chatter about politics. Down with apathy!I appreciate Michael Moore. I think that it's only right that if there is a Rush Limbaugh, there should be a Michael Moore. It just makes sense. For every bleeding heart hippie liberal there should be a cold-blooded, crusty Republican to be a counterpart. That's probably why our elections always run so close.Just to be fair, I'll admit I tend to agree with Michael Moore. He is pretty extreme, but I think a lot of people already know that, and are capable of sorting out the entertaining, over-the-top stuff from the deeper points he's making. As any movie reviewer will mention right away, Michael Moore is not trying to be fair or balanced. His documentaries don't pretend to be objective (not that complete objectivity in a documentary is attainable).I don't think it's necessary to argue our own personal credentials in order to have an opinion about the president, the film, or whatever. If you are a citizen, you can believe what you want and vote how you want. If you're not a citizen, you can still express your opinion. You don't need a college degree or a service record or powerful connections to have a voice.Regarding the president, there are a lot of people with degrees and military service records who are not necessarily bright, moral, or capable people. Bush can barely put a sentence together, and that's not really a secret. It is true he may prefer an "informal" speaking environment but I'm inclined to think the leader of the Free World should be able to communicate effectively, in public. This impediment does not make him a bad president...the things that *do* are reserved for another message.Peace!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 is a mix of political satire, witty comedy, and documentary all rolled up into one. It is Michael Moore's love child; a living testament to his hatred of the Bush administration. It opens with Gore's victory celebration on the evening of November 4th, 2000. You see Ben Affleck and "that taxi driver guy" as a background to a jubilant Al Gore and a somewhat vacant Tipper. Then, suddenly you hear a voice over, Moore of course, asking you whether this is all a dream. He proceeds to tell the tragedy that unfolded on that fateful night and the following weeks and months of clashing news reporters and weighted, somewhat suspicious court decisions. He tells of the folly of the Florida debacle and the terrifying actions and effects of the Bush administration.Now this was a great film. It was emotional, it was well written, it was sprinkled with intelligent humor and terrifying pictures of war. It is a masterpiece of cinema. But it is not your standard documentary. Things that are presented as facts are sometimes opinions and half truths. Moore has done a brilliant job of splicing together facts that support his views and leaving out all the rest. There is a point where he shows clips of Baghdad before the war. There are children frolicking in the streets, weddings happening, old men laughing in a restaurant. But where are the torture scenes? Where are the effects of Hussein's oppressive rule? I mean, I know Iraq wasn't full of shiny, happy people. Saddam Hussein is a bad guy, and he was oppressive. There is another point where Moore makes fun of the "Coalition of the Willing" (which is laughable), but he conveniently leaves out the larger more respectable countries, like England and Spain. Moore has created a great piece of film and a great piece of propaganda, but it's not the whole truth.I totally agree with everything this film stands for. I am a far left democrat and I believe that Bush is one of the worst leaders in the history of this or any other country. But I will admit that this is not everything that is out there. Everything said in the film is correct. It's all the truth, with opinions here and there. But it is not the WHOLE truth. So it should be taken with a grain of salt.Overall, this was a brilliant film. It was well made and it won the hearts of the audience (except for those who didn't agree with the film), and it even won the Palm D'or, the highest honor at the Cannes Film Festival. I highly recommend it. I give the film a 92 out of 100.Well, go out and see it. Please. And educate yourself about the surrounding issues, too</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an important film, not only in the history of film making but in the history of the USA. Its implications may very well sway the course of the next election. Moore's intelligent and sensitive case against Bush Jr. and the Big Business of War vs. the human face of his action's realities will move any person with an ounce of heart and an iota of brain. It's a deftly crafted film, finally giving the people a chance to see the humanity attached to the actions taken by our government in the past several years; faces that have been hidden from view and voices that have been silenced. Thanks so much to Disney for trying to crush its release. In doing so, they've helped to promote a film that may ultimately lead to the demise of the Bush regime. Congratulations to Michael Moore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a brilliant expose of the incompetence and deceit of the present American administration. Redneck detractors heap abuse on Moore and the film, but the fact remains that this is a documentary, and images of Bush and his stooges lying and playing while the world burns, are accurate.The images and examples of the shocking incompetence, inhumanity, and greed of Bush and company are too numerous to list here. However, one scene must be mentioned as an illustration of Bush's incompetence...... When the first plane hit the WTC, Bush was about to visit a public school in Florida and participate in a photo-op showing him reading with the children. Instead of canceling this blatant political show upon hearing about the tragic event, he went ahead and visited the school. It's pitiful to watch this stupid clueless man carrying on the charade at the school at the same time that thousands of Americans were being incinerated or jumping to their deaths in the most serious attack on the USA in 60 years. And then, an aide comes into the classroom where Bush is perched uncomfortably on a chair, and whispers in his ear that the second plane has hit the tower. Incredibly, Bush still carries on the his photo-op and shows no visible reaction to the news, other than a dazed, nervous, shifty-eyed expression. Here is the leader of the free world, paralyzed with indecision because his stooges are not there to tell him what to do. God help us if anyone launches a full scale attack on the USA during Bush's sleepwalking watch.See this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I SAW THIS FILM TODAY IN NYC AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I posted yesterday, prior to seeing Fahrenheit 911, that I had many issues with everyone's bickering about Mr. Moore's film. Enough is enough... if you bash this film you are being anti-American. Are we not living in a democracy where we believe in the right to freedom of speech? Do we not believe in challenging our government (which plenty of people did when Clinton was in office)? So why is Michael Moore's film such a big deal? Now I have seen it (even though it was so hard to get tickets for it since all the shows were sold out). So here are my feelings about the film. I feel the same way that I did when I saw Roger &amp; Me and Bowling For Columbine. Wait, before you read this, promise to continue after this next sentence. Fahrenheit 911 is absolutely brilliant. Moore's film should be taken as more of a dissertation on the Bush Administration's reaction to the horrific events of September 11th, rather than what one would refer to as cinema verite (if you want that, go seeControlRoom). While the arguments that Moore makes are just as convincing as they were with Bowling For Columbine, I have always had a special appreciation for thequestions that Mr. Moore asks. Personally, I my current MAJOR qualm with Bush is his reasons behind going to "war" with Iraq. According to Mr. Moore, Americans should be asking a few questions: why do we have so many more soldiers in Iraq than we do in Afghanistan? Why is there, in fact, a connection between both of the Bush presidents and Saudi leaders that deals with money? Why did Bush decide to sit in a classroom for 15 minutes (after already knowing about the attacks on both the Twin Towers and the Pentagon) and read a children's book with a bunch of elementary school students?And (this is not the last thing to think about) why didn't we hear about any of these WMD prior to 2001? Why aren't we getting answers that justify these actions and why does everyone feel the need to hide information that would answer some of these questions?AND since so many people (not just fanatics like Mr. Moore, but ex-FBI agents, current politicians, and American soldiers) have made pretty well thought out claims, why aren't we AT LEAST discussing these issues? As Americans, true patriotic Americans, shouldn't we all ask what the hell is going on here? For those of you who want people like Michael Moore to shut up, I would argue that his being silenced (which was definitely attempted) would be EXTREMELY unpatriotic. It would. So don't be hypocritical. That's just what I think. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, should go and see this movie. Honestly, don't go and see it if you don't want to, but don't bash it until you do. This film might not do anything for you, but it may make you ask a few more questions. Why are people so afraid to be learn about what's going on in the world? One last note: The interviews with parents of dead soldiers (including one with a mother who was, at one point, a Bush supporter) are particularly poignant, and are worth seeing by all individuals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On of the rights our country is based on is freedom of speech. This includes expressing disagreement for how our country is run. Although I don't agree with all of Michael Moore's opinions, he does make some very good points in this movie. For the people who say that this film is "anti-american" and call the ones who view it "traitors", I'd like to say that freedom of speech and differing opinions are the American way. It seems to me that when one tries to silence that way by wrapping themselves in the flag and calling others who disagree "traitors", they become guilty of their own accusation.I recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, searing, heartfelt-all those things which Michael Moore movies are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't know how I missed this when it came out....probably something to do with school or being in a podunk town from which I have to drive 90 minutes to see any sort of movie which is made without the dirty money of Hollywood. Anyway, having seen Bowling for Columbine which is also a scabrous, large-hearted, piercing indictment of the peculiar obsession of Americans for guns, and more recently, Sicko I knew that I had to see the last of the three tours de force he has released over the last six years.I believe that what drives conservatives batty about Michael Moore is that he doesn't read from the Democratic insiders' line on how to frame his points. He doesn't care if you don't like him. He realizes that the truth is funny, incisive, and it doesn't kowtow to the supposed sensitivities of those who might not agree with him politically. Michael Moore is real. He might be a bit coarse or he might be a bit scabrous, but he's giving you the truth, straight no chaser. This movie sticks to his formula, featuring some sharp juxtapositions of images and sound which comment quite acidly on one another along with his willingness to tell a joke which might not be funny in a light Tom-n-Jerry way, but which you have to laugh at or you will cry. Flint, MI features prominently and serves as a representative of Anytown, USA quite aptly. Moore realizes the emotional heft of using his unglamorous, blue-collar town as opposed to focusing on those in a metropolis on the left or right coasts. Many in the middle of the country do not get a lot of attention from the media and Moore gives them a voice.......and there are many many people in between the coasts who are often less wealthy and less educated than those living in the media-attractive markets on either coast. Flint, MI stands in for Anytown, USA-affected by layoffs, outsourcing, national political corruption, and insufficient local civic resources. Moore focuses in his laser-like attention on the inconsistencies and misinformation fed to the American public and the world and how this was sold.....and how....when called on it, the Bush cabal further misled and dissembled, and how this has led us into almost unfathomable horror and death-and the fact that-as he and a brave soldier make clear late in the movie, the moneyed and Washington insiders do not see their children going off to war. He focuses on the hypocrisy of American foreign policy and how it has aided the Taliban, how we helped Saddam Hussein in order to fight Iran which we had no sympathy for owing to the hostages which Iran took in 1979. This does not in any way justify what happened on 9/11/01, but some history usually enriches our understanding of events by putting them in the larger context of the swath of history. Some conservatives like to attempt to suppress dissent by suggesting that offering context is a means of justifying the unjustifiable. That is not true. It is, as I said, simply a means of understanding that things do not happen in a vacuum and as much can be said for the acts of those whose acts might well be unfathomable.Anyway, the movie itself is a tour de force, one that one could hardly imagine if it were not true. Foreign intrigue, double-dealing, inhumanity....but Moore's use of personal narratives in order to thrust the story forward and ground such unimaginable cruelty and the broad sweep of macro-events. Moore's sharp wit does not spare anyone who accedes to the Bush administration's double-dealing with regard to Iraq regardless of political party, and the fact that more of the crooks at this time are Republicans is not an indictment of Mr. Moore's focus as a film-maker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that most USA citizens curse the attacks to twin towers and the others but mistreated people related to this disaster are not just them, also Iraq people, also the whole people all around the world. After this disaster, middle-east never have found the peace. Primarily innocent USA citizens around the disaster had suffered, after Afghanistan, after Iraq and now the most serious one is the chaos in Middle-East. For example, Lebanon chaos between Israel in 2006, the corruption of united structure of the Iraq and the terrorist attacks against Turkey leaking from North Iraq borders.After giving the messages, let me tell about the messages of Michael Moore in F 9/11. Moore tells us the reality with some simple ways which contain senators', soldiers', Iraq citizens', soldier's relatives' and lots of different people's speeches. Split's timings for explaining are suitable. This documentary made me learn lots of things about 9/11 and Bush. Bush's connections with Ladin and Saudi Kingdom family got me amazed and a scene that I had seen it in South Park is remarkable. According to this scene, black and suburbians would go to fight with Saddam's soldiers.Finally, forget yesterday, save tomorrow. What do I mean? It's very clear: There is no mass-destruction weapon in Iran. If USA doesn't take into consideration the warnings that is made by UN and other countries, the end of it won't be as it was in Iraq.Bush already confess this reality at the end of the film clearly: If you fool me only one time, shame on you...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's shames the Bush administration and highlights the irrevocable, costly and painful effects and consequences of war. 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004)I won't talk about how good this is; it isn't how you should look at it. '9/11' is a powerful expose of the relentless mistakes, greedy miscalculated decisions of a propaganda generating government led by a fool. While this film shouldn't come as a great shock to any person with some intellectuality and common sense, it should be an eye opener for ignorant people. Some will deny what they see, others will brand it as propaganda and many will be outraged by the irrevocable yet unnecessary damages of the Iraq war on the people of Iraq and the soldiers and their families. No Weapons of Mass Destruction have been found, no free democratic Iraq exists (even if you say it happened, the country is in total ruins and has become a brutal warzone for freedom fighters (or terrorists pick one)). However you look at it, Iraq was in more order when Hussein was in power. Oh, but he was a dictator, a mass murderer. Well so is Bush; he's orders have killed thousands of innocent civilians, create chaos and inflame the terrorists anger towards America. Let us pause for one second. One single moment. Imagine you are one of the people in Iraq or Afghanistan, whose wife and children have been turned into ashes by American bombs; why would you give a sh*t if you inflict harm on another nation. Your anger, your fury at a man's actions sitting on a comfortable custom-made leather chair 8,000 miles away ordering bombings supposedly for the good of the people. You think, you stare at the empty desert; what have I got in this world. I want the Americans to pay for what they did to me. That is the view of some so called terrorists that we protect ourselves against. Perhaps if the USA left all the countries alone, countries that the President couldn't show you, even if you brought him a kid's map, this problem with terrorism would calm down. Back to Fahrenheit 9/11 - Moore shows us how the government targets the poorest, most deprived, degenerated areas of the country to lure hopeless young minds with no futures into a supposedly fruitful career in the marines. Little do many of these youngsters know that they are being taken into a hell; into a demoralising, dehumanising zone of fighting, a place where they could be killed instantly. The Iraq War cost the American people 600 billion dollars; 600 million million dollars; such money could have halved the country's poverty and reduced crime rates and improved education; but then again those oil fields in Iraq, those beautiful reserves are just too good for Texas Oil Barons and large greedy corporations; the oil is money!According to Moore, from the 500 Congress members, only 1 has enlisted his son in the army. Funny how the power hungry politicians don't send their children into the Middle Eastern Inferno that is Iraq; hmm? Of course the president would enlist his sons, but unfortunately he doesn't have any; oops, well his daughters are too fine to join the marines. After all War is only for poor folk; the people who are less supported by the government are sent to be sacrificed in a pointless, aimless, endless war. We look at these so called dictators that rule some nations and we curse their existence. When we look at W. Bush, we may disagree with his policies; the most we do is call him an idiot(justifiably), but when you think about it, he is a mass murderer really isn't he? Maybe not, am I being too cold here. I guess Americans need to preserve their freedom to invade a country 12,000 km away; take down a dictator who was provided with weapons by the American government, so they can restore peace; well guess what: Simply and poetically; The result is a that the Americans got stuck in a pile of big horse sh*t with a mere cost of a few billion a year, money enough to develop a West African country or supply food to millions of struggling families in America. The term 'Evil' can only be judged personally; Hitler killed millions; Stalin terminated 25 million lives. W has invaded a country, well two if you really want to count Afghanistan and send the world in a global panic that has resulted in us waiting hours at an airport and having been asked to seal our toothpaste or deodorant. Funny how this terrorism age only really kicked in in the year 2001, same year that W was elected. Anyway you may disagree, but ultimately you know I am right and you know that this documentary is solid truth that you and I cringe when we see it. Severed arms, legless people, mothers crying for their lost sons whether in Asia or in America, a world growing more unstable by the minute and that damn search for those Weapons of Mass Destruction, while the man from Texas cracks jokes with other greasy politicians who really don't give a sh*t , just as long as their paycheck arrives on time. More like a vigilant attack on the war, anyway this documentary is a shocking account of the events that we see on the news every day; the news that we are so tired of hearing... Another 2 soldiers have died today, and you see two fresh faced 20 year olds picture on the news... But do you really care anymore, with all the problems that the world has. While we plunge into the Global Warming era, pollute and destroy our Earth; a world where you only really care about yourself, what are we really fighting for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent documentary. Moore preaches to the base. An anti-bush bashing. A must watch no matter what political spectrum your with.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fahrenheit 9/11" really is without a doubt one of the better documentaries made, even though political and touchy it's interesting, educational and emotionally charged. Michael Moore a known and die hard liberal does it again he really goes after the right wing and republicans with fangs and claws. Really George W. Bush is portrayed as greedy, stupid, and corrupt in this film. From the beginning with Moore giving his take that Bush stole the 2000 election in the Florida recount by the influence of FOX News and saying that George Sr. had an impact on the supreme courts decision. Though Moore's main message is to show that the Iraq war rose due to greed and was fought due to the Bush family ties to the Bin Laden's oil royalties. Moore gives a strong opinion that 911 and Iraq in no way were connected, that this is simply a war for profit and that everything is tied to oil companies and contracts. The footage is thought provoking and blended with spoof humor with music to fit what's being told. And the interviews are revealing and it's blended well with Moore's use of satire and humor. The pros and cons of the patriot act are shown, the most touching moment was the emotional interview with Lila Lipscomb a mother from Moore's Flint, Michigan hometown who lost a son in the Iraq battle, as she breaks down in tears and travels to the white house in search of answers as to why are we fighting this war. Moore ends on a good and funny note by going up to Congress people asking them to enroll their kids in service to go fight, now that will be the day! Really a great political doc to watch no matter what your take on the war is, or regardless of your political leanings you have to hand it to Michael Moore this was well done material. Judge for yourself if you believe it or not.</fullReview>

Farenheit 9/11 is not so much anti-Bush, as it is disagreeing with Bush administration politics. Moore is a skilled filmmaker as evidenced by the fact this is the highest-grossing summer released documentary and one that was banned, too. It's definitely not a family movie. Personally I found some parts dragging, but by the time it got to the segments on Iraq, it becomes very engaging, especially the segment on "terror alerts". What did these Iraq citizens do to deserve this? And what was the connection to 9/11? People have made up their minds about this move based on their beliefs, and really that's politics right there. The Bush administration has already written its legacy and you can see it in Farenheit 9/11.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humans can take about 2 hours of a film, then need a break. Attempting to cover every detail of a government's abuse of her citizens confiscated tax dollars in those 2 hours is impossible. Therefore, producers et al must simply alert the viewer that there is a problem to consider and then offer tangents for exploration.If a viewer accepts the ideas of a film as truth, the viewer may run into problems in reality later as ideas in film *by their nature* can only be superficially examined. The viewer must digest the ideas and research in depth in order to gain an understanding of "what's going' on", not simply rely on entertainers to provide conclusions.I cried passionately and openly as I watched the military mom transition from "rah rah military" to "my son, reimbursed with confiscated tax dollars in return for his death, is gone forever".Thanks Moore for another upbeat look into my culture.</fullReview>

Also, I don't have anything against Mr. Moore, but I think he rushes his films to get his point across.....maybe to make a buck while it is a hot topic? If you look at Bowling for Columbine, that was released very close after the tragedy.Just bit of a warning, this film is very negative and one sided towards Mr. Bush, and may be offensive to some individuals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a documentary, this film is supposed to shed more light and inform the general public about a certain event or situation. And 9/11 is certainly an event,I think, everyone would like to know more about. After seeing this film, even if it's biased material, I have learned more about this great tragedy of our time. And also after watching this film, i had a sick feeling in the my stomach. As part of the American public, I"m used to being like too. But, the agendas shown here go far beyond that. To know that the Saud Arabians provide nearly 7% of our economy was frightening. To watch our President's dumbfounded look and ten minute rest after he was informed of the 2nd plane hitting was shocking. And to know that Bush Sr. was meeting with a member of the Bin Laden family that morning, and that two days later, 124 Saudi's, including members of the Bin Laden family were flown out of the US, without being questioned of Al-Queida involvement was appalling. Many people i've told about this film disregard it, saying it's meaningless propaganda, as if brainwashed. I'm objective enough to watch this film and also watch a Bush speech and judge them both on their own merit. But many others I've talked to are not that open-minded. If even half of this film's discoveries are the rock-hard truth, we need to vote Bush out of office because with him will go Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, Cheney, and the ties and money the Bin Ladens have with our Presidential seat. Even if John Kerry was brain dead, he would prove to be a more rational and level-headed president than Bush. I highly recommend this film to any man or woman who will be voting this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FAHRENHEIT 9/11 Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: Dolby DigitalReleased during an election year with the specific intention of toppling President George W. Bush from power, Michael Moore's vivid documentary rails against the Republican administration's incompetence, arrogance and (alleged) corruption, though it ends up merely preaching to the converted. Those viewers who SHOULD see the film will have been deterred by the director's growing reputation as a left-wing firebrand, and those who ARE persuaded to attend screenings (other than those who agree with Moore's point of view) will question the film's lack of balance: Moore levels a range of charges against the Bush presidency, yet pointedly fails to offer a single dissenting voice, one that tries to answer the various accusations made against them.And what accusations! Using documentary footage and TV news clips, Moore outlines the links between Bush's family and the various business interests who have profited from his presidency; the way in which Bush was initially viewed as a 'lame duck' president, until his fortunes were revived by the appalling events of September 2001; the exaggerated 'terror threat' which led to an American-led conflict in Afghanistan and a second war against Iraq, during which the aforementioned 'business interests' circled like vultures, awaiting the inevitable (and hugely profitable) outcome; the deliberate targeting of poor communities by military recruitment officers; and the hundreds of soldiers killed in post-war Iraq, encouraged by a Senate in which only ONE Congressman has a family member on active duty in the war zone. Stunts such as the one in which Moore doorsteps politicians and asks them to consider 'volunteering' their children for conflict - intercut with images of disaffected soldiers questioning the entire basis for the war, along with images of death and suffering on all sides - amount to little more than sideshow padding, though the point is well taken.To date, the film is the most successful documentary feature in cinema history, but it failed to dislodge Bush from office (in fact, he emerged from the 2004 elections in an even stronger position than before, and Moore has been blamed in some quarters for helping to turn the tide in Bush's favor). To those who dislike him, Bush comes across as a drawling, ineffectual goof, and Moore uses edited fragments to highlight the man's awkwardness and apparent lack of intelligence. But given Moore's refusal to provide some kind of comeback from those he seeks to impugn - even if their response did nothing more than confirm their arrogance and corruption - many viewers will find themselves at odds with the director's approach, no matter how much they agree with his reasoning. FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is an articulate, compassionate film, but it raises more questions than it seeks to answer about the forces which govern our daily lives, and those people in positions of authority who seek to impose their own particular view of 'freedom' and 'democracy' on an international scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bowling match of one player ... Michael Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I finally decided to watch Fahrenheit 9/11, I was already well informed about the events, including its present consequences on recent history, put forward and cleverly weaved by Michael Moore. I didn't take part of the frenzy debate about it ... but I read almost everything posted on these boards about it. Having just seen the 'pome of discord', I felt as if I had seen a bowling match of one player ... Michael Moore. And I must reckon, he can knock those pins managing primal filming techniques with great ease and accuracy. Basically he steps forward, takes aim while planning the best path and force to achieve a strike. In fact, Michael Moore, by means of indisputable fact footage, personal testimonies and whatever else he lays his hands on, heavily bases his personal points of views on the very same video and film footage he uses on his work. So, what I'm saying is that his films, most specially Fahrenheit 9/11, give me the impression of having been built around the basic material being gathered ... and not the other way around as most Moore detractors liked to argue. Michael presents us the conclusions he achieved with the footage he painstakingly collected. Many of the things he inserted on his final work has never been seen by the American citizen. Yes, we knew about it ... but most have never seen it in its fullness ... including me. For some strange reason I also had the impression that his original project must've been a close glimpse of events from short-past to near-future consequences and the on going electoral process in the US of A 'til the Presidential Investiture. Apparently Moore preferred to politically engage Fahrenheit 9/11 as part of the electoral process. Linking it as part of the on going anti-Bush campaign he immobilized and dated his final work. But it was his decision ... and in spite of this, I strongly believe he should have waited for the poll results, the Presidential Investiture, pack it with recent events, include it in the final work and then release it as a two sided DVD ( F 1 and F 2). In my understanding, Moore ended up missing the on going historical process ... the re-election of GWB in spite of everything put forward during the last Presidential campaign. But maybe he achieved what left him with a sense of engagement and the belief that his work could really help shape and influence the public opinion ... during a long period of the electoral process, the debate about Fahrenheit 9/11 overshadowed the very elections. Some folks argue that Moore manipulates facts ... but such premise can't be sustained without falling under all kinds of philosophical fallacies devised by human kind.Michael Moore is basically trying to show to the American public the Hamletish nature of recent events and our responsibility upon them ... apparently most of us don't even want to listen ... afraid of felling compelled to changing personal and ingrained political points of view. He sends a straight forward message to the American public that unfortunately is only being willingly heard by foreign hearts and minds.One last thing I must say to anyone thinking on watching Fahrenheit 9/11. Every now and then the film 'per se' set me into bursts of spontaneous laughter ... which would quickly turn into sadness, despair and shame about the still pulsing events concerning internal affairs and the path of war taken by the USA. As the credits came up, a film came popping in my mind ... Woody Allen's BANANAS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate George W. Bush, I hate the ideals of the Republican party, I hate the fact that so many innocent people are dying in vain in Iraq. I saw this movie the first time thinking that I knew a lot of Bush's regime and the state of the US, while watching it I realized, I had a lot more to learn. This film is anti-bush, and I was and still am, and therefore the film was biased yet a lot of modern political documentaries are. If you like bush you will hate this film if you are indifferent, it depends on which side you lean towards more, if you are democratic or independent, you will like this film. The way this film is played out is: Topic-Sub Topics-Examples, normally through individuals-Different topic, this repeats itself but in such a way that in the end it all wraps up strongly, leaving a lot of people (for lack of a better term) stunned. It gets under your skin by showing the inhumane attitude of desensitized soldiers, how gullible the average American is, and how sneaky the government truly is and how well they guard their secrets. The music and montages drive this film forward and at the end, the quote from George Orwell's "1984" Fits well with the theme of a doomed future, the music it accompanies drives the point in a hypnotic way and by the time the ending credits roll, you feel ready to actually do something. And though at times it seems that he exploits Lila Lipscomb, it is still a film that no one should miss, if you care for the state of the US or the world (lets face it the US thinks it owns the world) watch it.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember exactly where I was when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and George Bush (Sr., that is) took on Saddam. I was a Freshman in high school studying for a U.S. History exam. Unfortunately, I can't remember what part of history the test covered. I would like to believe it was manifest destiny or something ironic.I came downstairs for a break and my dad told me a war was on. Despite larger TVs, he and my mom were huddled around the small one in the kitchen. It didn't feel real. It was on television. CNN had live feeds. Wasn't this all a show? It was to this mindset that Michael Moore has made his newest film, Fahrenheit 911. Moore takes on President George W. Bush in a way that cannot be cataloged as criticism, rather an out and out attack. Moore links Bush to the Saudi's, Saddam Hussein, and the Fox News channel of all places. Some of these links admittedly seem shaky and it went by so fast an average viewer would need notes and a family tree in some cases to truly figure it all out. However, as with Bowling for Columbine, Roger and Me, The Big One, and his television shows, it is the broad strokes with which we should adhere.Much of Moore's "evidence" is at best circumstantial and is reported only to back his own opinions. I read an article written by Brittany Craigo, reportedly a seventeen year old Bush supporter, posted on moorelies.com. She makes good points but believes F911 is "a new form of Leni Riefenstahl-like propaganda." This is clearly over the top. Comparing Moore to the Nazi advertising machine is unfair since Moore makes it clear in this and all of his other films that these are his opinions. The tone for his films is a satirical, tongue-in-cheek playfulness that entertains first and informs second.The attacks on his film remind me of the surge of criticism Oliver Stone endured while releasing JFK. Why is it so "dangerous" and "harmful" for films like these to be released? Do I sit in the theater and blindly stare at the screen and drool in my popcorn believing everything Michael Moore is telling me? Of course not. Just as I did not hang on every word of Craigo's article.The problem is that leftists will show up to the film in droves and love it, right-wingers will debunk everything, even when there is nothing to debunk. Moore wants the rest of us to watch. The majority of America is moderate. In the current climate of media-fueled stories and shallow political attacks, it is difficult to take anything seriously.The public is flanked from all sides with reasons to vote for this person or that person; this cause or that one. Moore boils it all down into two helpful servings: 1) This is your president as I see him; 2) Despite the partisan, childish attacks and eye-rolling political ads, this is all important. Take it seriously. ***.5 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-meaning and patchily brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, the heathen who alleges that Moore stole his title from a Truffaut film is profoundly mistaken. Fahrenheit 451 was a novel by the great Ray Bradbury before it was a film by Truffaut. Moreover, adapting the title of a famous book or film, often to humorous effect, is a common and perfectly legitimate way of naming a film. It is blatantly obvious that Moore did not mean Fahrenheir 9/11 to mean the same as Fahrenheit 451, and it mystifies me that someone could think he did. The reviewer seems to believe that he has made a great discovery by pointing out that Moore's title is not entirely original. Sorry to dampen your party, but that is manifest nonsense- Moore has made the source of his title public. Think about it, and you'd find that Fahrenheit 9/11 is an effective title because it is an adaptation of a famous one.On the film, I believe it started brilliantly. The sections on Bush's handling of Iraq (especially the evil humour of the school scene) were wonderful. Moore lacks a sense of proportion on certain issues, such as the treatment of the bin Laden family. The later sections on Iraq were dragging and repetitive. Overall, I thought it well-intentioned, but I feel that Moore was a little too generous with the editing, resulting in a patchy and inconsistent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't say that i was shocked to see this movie. I mean I have always had these conspiracy theories in my mind but I never believed that those could be true. This movie just put it all together.. I mean it clearly exhibits how a nation was fooled by its own leaders.. Anyone who claims that the facts presented in the movie were in fact fabricated, should at least come up with a few specifics.. I mean i cant forget the look on Mr. Bush's face when he was informed about the terrorist strikes on 9/11. The guy had no clue as to what had happened to him. That was surely the best part of the movie.The funnier part though, is that the same guy was re elected for another four years by hi "fellow Citizens"... I mean com'on... how can a person so clueless can be the president of the most powerful and civilized nation...I just hope that Mr. Moore continues his excellent work and in Mr. Bush's next term, give us at least another one his mater pieces...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore Turns up the Heat and Shows All That You Were Meant to See, and Some Things You Were Never Meant to See.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!]It all began on the eve of the 2000 presidential election. All of America awaits to hear who will be the next president of the United States of America? Al Gore or George W. Bush? The votes were all counted and TV news stations all over the country name Al Gore the winner. However, soon after, someone at Fox News reports that due to a recent re-count, George W. Bush won by just ONE vote. So all the other news channels retracted their earlier statements. Apparently one another reason Bush won was because he had some inside friends. Well, Bush is inaugurated in 2001 and the precession was anything but traditional. And he spent the first several months of his presidency on vacation. Was this all a dream? I'm afraid not. George Bush's presidency did not get off to a good start, and many of the people thought Al Gore was cheated. Several members of congress tried to address Gore on the matter, but he had to act like a jerk and state that unless the report submitted followed proper procedure, he was not interested. And interestingly enough, the folks trying to address him were African American. Well from January to August, 2001, not a whole lot happened, but one morning on September 11, 2001, the world was in for the biggest tragedy as well as the biggest national disaster in history. For a plane hijacked by terrorists crashed into one of the World Trade Center buildings in New York City. Panic and chaos was everywhere. The tower fell! Meanwhile, George Bush was in Florida at that moment about to visit an Elementary School. As soon as the second WTC tower fell, someone came in the school to inform Bush what had happened. He was told we were under attack. Well, not having a clue what to do, Bush just continued reading My Pet Goat to the kids. But even if he had a clue, what could he have done? I remember where I was when the towers fell. It was 7:00 AM where I live so I was asleep. It wasn't until my mom woke me up and told me what had happened. And since I live close to the airport, it was the first time in probably ever that I heard no planes taking off. Roughly 3,000 people lost their lives on September 11, 2001. Among them, brave firemen who, thinking nothing of themselves but for the safety of those trapped in the towers, rushed in and didn't come out. Who was responsible for this chaos? Afghan terrorist Osama bin Laden, that's who. Bush had been told a month prior that bin Laden had been planning an attack on the U.S., but Bush paid it no mind. Now you're not gonna believe this, but the Bush family are actually business partners with the bin Laden family! Saudi Prince Bandar, or Bandar Bush as they call him at the White House, and he's got an account in the sum of over $800 billion! So on September 13, 2001 when flights were still being restricted, the bin Laden family all got to fly home on private jets!! The family of the man responsible for 9-11 and nobody was questioned! Bush immediately sent troops into Afghanistan to get Osama bin Laden. But they came home with nada. And as time went on, people were being hassled just for saying things about Bush or bin Laden or Afghanistan in public, and even small neighborhood peace organizations were infiltrated. And the airport security was no help to anybody. Apparently Bush and his team wanted to induce enough fear of terrorism into everyone so that they would support him. As for the situation in Afghanistan, Bush said he wasn't really spending that much time on it. To quote Michael Moore, just what kind of president is he? Well, the state of Oregon only had a total of 8 police troopers on duty, thanks to budget cuts. But worse was yet to come. Since he couldn't find bin Laden, Bush decided to finish what his father started and catch Sadaam Hussein in Iraq. Until now, the Iraqis had never attacked America or ever threatened to or even killed one American citizen. Iraq was a very friendly and peaceful country. But then the bombs fell, and many people?including women and children, fell victim. And so began a huge war in Iraq where over 800 American soldiers lost their lives. George Bush's initial plan was to just go in, take over Iraq and bring freedom to the country. But soon, Iraq struck back! Even more bodies pile up. Several soldiers are interviewed. Some think it's all a game while others feel it isn't a gloriful experience. We go on to see horrific and macabre pictures of innocent people who fell victim to the bombings. We can also see both sides to this whole matter so we know the Iraqis posted no immediate threat at the time. As you know, of late 2003, they finally captured Sadaam Hussein and he is currently in prison. But what was his crime? He didn't hate Americans. He hated his own people. For a long time Bush and his administration had been telling us that Sadaam had weapons of mass destruction, but we soon discover he never did. What low blow! With the rising number of casualties in Iraq, they needed more troops. Now the unfortunate thing is that people who have no money and can't get a job enlist in the service which pays you a hefty sum for school. But that isn't good when there's a war going on and guess who's gonna go fight in it? You. They're tried to recruit more and more people, and fortunately did not start the draft. Because then people like you and me would have to go and fight whether we liked it or not. One such woman, Lila Lipscomb, was deeply saddened over the loss of her son who was killed in Iraq. She was so upset she went all the way to Washington D.C. to give Bush a piece of her mind, but could not get into the White House. Well, the war effort in Iraq raged on. In war, there are no real winners.Well what can I say about Fahrenheit 9/11? GREAT FILM! Michael Moore is brilliant. I take back every negative thing I ever said about him and his films. I used to think he was just a self-promoter wanting to cash in on all the tragedies of our country. Boy was I wrong! He did a very good job with this movie. He got ALL the facts. It shows a real dark side to George W. Bush. I never would have guessed that the president of the United States of all people, was in league, so to speak, with the family of a terrorist! The terrorist responsible for September 11! You HAVE to check out this film today. Republican or democrat, either one, this is a movie for YOU. It will really make you consider who to vote for in November. You can vote for whoever you like, but I really recommend you don't vote for Bush, because if we get this meatball for 2004-2008, the war in Iraq will continue and a lot more people could get hurt and die. We don't want that. So heed the words of Michael Moore. A lot of this documentary is really unbelievable and it will really grab you. For all you people who think George W. Bush is a great president like his father before him, WATCH THIS MOVIE and then reconsider that notion. See it today, but brace yourself for some disturbing images. No more graphic than what's on the news?That's probably because it was on the news. I recommend Fahrenheit 9/11. -</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many issues?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just watched the latest documentary of Michael Moore and must say, that I'm not impressed. Obviously Mr. Moore is no great fan of Mr. Bush, but to ridicule Mr. Bush does not add to the credibility of Mr. Moore and that is - in my opinion - one of the things that is wrong with the film.Furthermore Mr. Moore raises a number of rather interesting questions during the film witch any world citizen, US citizen or not, could have an interest to know the answers for. But the questions are too many and too mixed. What is it Mr. Moore is trying to uncover? The Bush-family relations to the bin Ladins?, G.W. Bush's incompetence?, the justification for the war?, election frauds?, minorities killed in the US Army during the campaign?, what is war good for?, did money or the urge for freedom start the war?, where are the Weapon of Mass Destruction?, what happened in Afghanistan?, was the war just a way of making money?. The issues are many and interesting, but in my view too many. Mr. Moore should have focused on fewer issues and gone in deeper on those few. As it is, the documentary leaves me rather unsatisfied and the only thing completely uncovered during the film is that Mr. Moore takes little liking in the Bush administration. Quite a few of the reviews on this site comments on the truthfulness of Mr. Moore and the documentary as such, the patriotism of Mr. Moore, for or against Mr. Bush and much more. This debate I will not nor cannot enter (being a non-US citizen), but what I can say is that Mr. Moore with his documentary actually has done what a documentary is supposed to do - it has created debate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blazing Heat from the brilliant Michael Moore and his next great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore. Director and Writer of Bowling for Columbine. Micheal Moore. Now director and writer of Fahrenheit 9/11. This truly is the best documentary of all-time in so many ways, whether you're talking about Box Office Gross to opinions. This is Michael Moore's way of making film for all of us in audiences all over. This movie may get very gory and gruesome. Remember, this is real life gore, not Hollywood so parents, beware. There is also another problem however and you don't have to see the film to know it, one word: "Propaganda".Michael Moore constructs a brilliant film on the terror attacks of September 11, 2004. Much like Bowling for Columbine, you will enjoy it and understand it in a way that when you finish watching the movie, you will say to yourself that you actually learned something. Fahrenheit 9/11 really delivers and Moore gives solid direction as we see him learn more information on the subject. Just the 15-minute prologue will get you hooked with it's unexplainable atmosphere of terror but logic and the idea of actually being interested while watching a documentary.Overall, This is an amazing film. Definitely one of the best of 2004. This movie should be shown to classes all over. Even, my nephew saw it with me and said that his History teacher will show it to their Grade 9 class when the DVD comes out. F 9/11 truly is a masterpiece by Moore and we will continue to watch Moore's accomplishments as this movie heads into the 2005 Oscars and with Moore's already announced 2005 release, Sicko talking about our Canadian Health Care System. Then, I'm sure Moore will please us again with Fahrenheit 9/11 1/2 in 2007. Moore will bring you the heat again with Fahrenheit 9/11.My Rating: 8/10Eliason A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Would Thomas Paine Say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bravo to Michael Moore for releasing a film that does what a good film should do--make people talk, debate, argue, question, and THINK! For his obnoxiously outspoken bravado in asserting his anti-Bush POVs, he deserves the Palme d'Or.We really need someone like Moore--his aggressive opinions reinforce the democratic ideals of our US founders, like Thomas Paine. Paine argued that agovernment should be protective while respecting the personal liberty of its citizens. Prior to the release of "Farenheit", our country was in the throes of a twisted, repressive crusade by the Bush administration to intimidate Americans into silence. At times to question the authority and judgment of our federal government seemed tantamount to treason. It seems that our current administration doesn't subscribe to the belief that a democratic society should question the actions of its leaders. I suspect that, for them, questioning authority would best be construed as a traitorous act. A professor of mine at Columbia University received many death threats because he expressed satisfaction in seeing the US fight a losing war in Iraq with heavy casualties on both sides. For him the senseless loss of so many lives reinforces the senselessness, purposeless, and inherent greed in the Bush administration's decision to go to war with Iraq. Instead of recognizing this, his comments were interpreted by jingoists as treacherous. How do we call ourselves a free and democratic society if we do not allow every American to honestly speak his or her mind no matter how controversial?"Farenheit 9/11" has given Americans a little breathing room and, in my opinion, almost single-handedly pushed back the culture of silence that characterized the early days of the war with Iraq. "Farenheit" gave Americans permission to express our opposition to the war with Iraq without being called "traitors". Mr. Moore's aggressive opposition to the Bush administration has given moderate Americans comfortable space to express our dissenting points of view. Thanks for letting us exhale, Michael!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this "movie", I did my own research and now know the OTHER side of the story (so to speak). Again, as in the past, Moore has produced a substandard quality mockumentary that is filled with only partial fact and much misrepresentation. I've wasted a lot of time seeing his previous "junk" and this "movie" has convinced me to put all future M. Moore attempts on my DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME list. As a movie &amp; TV producer, I am appalled at the lack of quality in this and all of Moore's previous attempts at what he chooses to call film making. Besides the facts being skewed, the photos being altered and the gross omission of true data, this turns out to be nothing more than a poorly presented "student film". More than being a film maker, Moore is a wannabe that is very angry and has no outlet for his overly active imagination. If he ever resolves his inner personal issues, he might become aware that he doesn't belong in the business. But who cares...this is a real easy way for Moore to acquire a lot of money and he's laughing at us all on his way to the bank.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In general this documentary good. But what saddens me is that Michael Moore can't underline the things he's saying. Some of the things he states aren't true and that's a bit annoying. It would be a better documentary if it was totally based on true facts, instead of suggestions or twisted statements. It's bad because he says a lot, but he doesn't prove. You just have to believe. The weak part of the documentary is the woman who has lost her son in the Iraq war. In the beginning she's braggin' about how she pushed her children in the army and that her family is part of backbone of this nation. When she learned that her son died in the war, she blames the president! It really made no point. But the feeling in this documentary is really good. It was shocking to hear the soldiers talk about 'killing the enemy' and what their favourite songs were. They sounded like robots programmed to kill. It made clear that this war is not justified. If Michael Moore had stayed with one aspect and took a more in-depth look, it would've given a better documentary, instead of trying to make numerous points without proving.

		<fullReview>I sat through the entire thing, with a sick feeling in my stomach. I was one of those who supported the need for 'something to be done about Iraq'. However, in the time since the war began - I would read bits and pieces from media (not controlled by corporate interests) and started to question some of the claims made by the coalition. This documentary consolidated all those facts into a coherent and devastating journey, following the greed of a few and apathy of many. Since the middle of last year - I've come to the sickening conclusion that I was manipulated by the rhetoric and fear espoused by those with a vested interest in seeing profits in death and destruction - what made it so much worse was that I was complicit in this ruse.I thought this doco represented a fair and accurate summation of what should be viewed by the whole world as a tragedy for and travesty against humanity.Michael Moore and many of the people who were interviewed deserve the highest praise for speaking out - Courage is seeing wrong and speaking out against it, cowardice is staying silent or apathetic.I thoroughly recommend this documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore, he not exactly subtle but at least he's out there putting out a message we can take or leave.Fahrenheit 9/11 isn't exactly the extreme implausible banter that's be published by pro-republicans, but it is a film that should not be watched by anyone who can sit back and believe EVERYthing on screen. That said, it's damn good: a tighter film that Moore's previous, even though it lurches from one topic to another. It's essentially Moore's criticisms of Bush and the presidency since he took office. Of all the points made, the most shocking (especially to a Brit) is the news coverage and advertisements in the USA, it seems in line with the TV footage in Paul Verhoven's Starship Troopers, and that is honestly more shocking than what we are shown of Bush's career and links to Osama. Even though Moore doesn't go so far he almost, and he really stands back but putting 2 and 2 together Moore puts Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Osama, Sept 11 next to each other and although we are not given any big answers, we are given that statement that it's "Uncomfortable".I'm not a Bush hater, even though I lean left, I don't why hating someone you don't actually know is just. If going in you've not political opinion (you probably will), Bush will either come across as a failure with the right friends, or a charismatic fella in the wrong job. Oh and even though Moore plays it for laughs, Bush's Discovery of the second plane is no laughing matter, personally it's one of the most iconic moments of this century.8/10 for the fact it exists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Documentary film making is on the rise bringing in both audiences an quality to the cinemas, TOUCHING THE VOID, CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS or the Oscar winner BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE were huge hits commercially and received prizes all over the world. Michael Moore has built himself a reputation in this genre systematically attacking one of the great lies of our generation THE American DREAM. Films, TV shows, books and even WEST END shows sell by the million saying outloud what people want to hear... THE AWFUL TRUTH. I was expecting this movie with mixed emotions though, in one hand I admire Moore's ability to stir things up in a society that doesn't swallow criticisms particularly well, on the other I walked in with a lot of concern wondering if this was really ground breaking film making to score the PALM DO'R or has CANNES gone political? The fact is that Moree's style is not even guerrilla is pedestrian at best and he balances his lack of skills with strong subjects. The only interesting visual technique happens early on when he builds a movie in an event he doesn't show directly, the old COCTEU thing "never state what you can imply" and that worked so well for Tarantino when he was making real movies. The rest of the film feels very sloppy without continuity or order, is more interesting what he is saying that the way is said. The power of the film lies in the shocking revelations though, after playing endless nights of SIX DEGREES OF KEVIN BACON you know you can connect anyone you want but BUSH and the BIN LADEN's? oh boy we didn't got that on news night review, neither we got the wreck of the 2000 elections or the real horror of war... There is a couple of details that bothered me, first the voice over, he spends little time in front of the camera but talks behind it too much, unnecessary begin the BUSH administration a cross between "1984" super big brother and the ultimate "confederacy of dunces" that really speak for themselves. Second the coalition allies montage, the Dutch are dope smokers, the Romanians are vampires... using strong sterotypes to ridicule the small allies but then he clearly manipulates when he doesn't mention the strong ones, UK, JAPAN, Australia... then BLAIR goes untouched. A nightmare production in the land of the "free speech", MEL Gibson production company drop the project in progress for begin too hot, MIRAMAX got involved but Disney censored the film denying distribution ignoring that when you ban something people tend to put a lot of effort in seeing it so at least they should cashed in as everybody is going to see it anyway. Shocking and a big laugh but this the PALME DO'R it aint, where are the times when APOCALYPSE NOW won as a "work in progress".... the horror, THE HORROR. ***</fullReview>

It reminds instantly an old advertisement against famine in Africa where starving children are filmed in a dry sandy parcel, searching the ground for grains to eat, while funny music is being played over the pictures? then a catchphrase pops up in the middle of the screen, saying: 'Are you shocked by this music choice? Well you shouldn't! It's the image you should look at!'.Amazing how people can change history... or maybe not? But at least one man edited one of the most important periods of history, an important documentary that will be produced later on DVD and assist/help humanity, giving the chance to all generations in the USA and the whole word (present and future time) to reveal the other side of what they might call "real history". At least the future generation will be able to decide if Michael Moore was right or not about his thoughts! This is a movie that will probably be a unique reference to students, historians, politicians, NGO's, anyone! This reference will have more impact in 10 years (wait and see). This cinematographic work is more than a simple documentary made with archives and images: it carries Moore's personal point of view, a lot of people opinions and a convincing intelligent analysis evaluating all images and news we 'swallow' everyday on TV!What if?What if all what Moore said was wrong? Well for only being a valuable 'movie' (more than a simple documentary), Fahrenheit 9/11 deserves the 2004 Cannes Film Festival Golden Palm!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary exposes the George W. Bush administration for the Evil, though incompetent, Empire that it truly is. From Dick Cheney's Haliburton cronyism to the Bush family's close ties to the Bin Laden family and to the Saudis in general. The film starts with the Republican theft of the 2000 presidential election and follows with the tragic events of September 11, 2001 and President Bush's actions (or lack thereof) in the aftermath of the terrorist attack. The film is presented in large part in a rather lighthearted fashion, but becomes rather intense at times. There is film/video footage from the streets of war-torn Iraq, for example. In addition, the up-close interviews with a woman who lost her son to the Iraq conflict are quite moving and at one point, shows her doubling over at the grief she feels. This woman is a typical patriotic American, who believed in the necessity for military action and trusted the President as a leader to take all necessary precautions to ensure troops safety and not endanger them needlessly. This trust was, of course, hopelessly misplaced. I saw the film in Humble, Texas, a very conservative suburban community near Houston, but immediately after the film, the crowd burst into spontaneous applause. I doubt very seriously that anybody seeing this documentary will be filled with confidence in the Bush administration, nor will they feel a burning desire to reelect George W. Bush. I have heard that in some cities groups have lined the exitways coming from the theaters and offered voter registration cards to any who wanted them. Michael Moore, who also did the marvelous documentary "Roger and me" about the disinterest and lack of compassion of corporate executives for the everyday people (and their jobs) whom their decisions affect. Moore also made the much acclaimed "Bowling for Columbine". I heartily recommend this film to persons of any and all political leanings as informative, entertaining, and moving and believe that it will provide a much better understanding of the mechanics of government, or at least of THIS administration. Though there is an unmistakable message to the film, there is limited editorializing, with the film preferring to let the film/video clips of actual events and interviews speak for themselves. I believe that this film should be required viewing for every registered voter in America. The message one is left with is one that resounds with most Americans at this point I think, one of being unsure of John Kerry and what solution he represents, but of being quite certain that George W. Bush and his administration have got to go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore does an incredible job at developing a convincing case against President Bush. While the extreme right keeps pointing to some errors in it (and yes, I read the Christopher Hitchens' essay), it is not enough to derail the overall message of this movie.If you haven't seen this movie yet, go. And if you can, take a Republican friend with you. I can only hope that when this gets its video release in October before the election, all of those that didn't want to spend movie theater prices will be willing to watch it when it's only $3. God help us if Bush gets re-elected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Englishman's comment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The White House has taken Osama Bin Laden off the "Ten Most Wanted" list. They have put on Michael Moore instead. Moore's film which smashed its way through a cordon of corporate censorship is an astonishing work of film journalism. The job which a good journalist or an honest politician (hah!) ought to be doing is being done by a TV comic and done brilliantly. Understandably the establishment has pulled out all the stops to rubbish Michael Moore but the facts in the film speak for themselves and the Republicans have failed to address a single one of those facts.The links between Bush and the Saudi Royal Family - undisputed.The assistance given to the Bin Laden family to flee America - undisputed. The pressure on the intelligence services to "prove" Iraq the villain of the piece and exonerate Saudi Arabia - undisputed. There are two points in the film where anyone not made out of stone (or New Labour!) would be moved to tears. They both show mothers crying out in anguish against the war...one Iraqi and the other a patriotic right-wing democrat from Moore's home town of Flint. Another memorable figure is the army corporal who said "he would not go back to Iraq to kill other poor people" on behalf of the corporations who are then shown gloating about the wealth which they can reap from Iraq. In a priceless sequence Moore approaches US politicians to see how many of them will sign up their sons to go and fight in Iraq......guess how many takers he gets..... Go and see the film. Take the family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank Goddess for Michael Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I am not quite as rabid as Moore is, my anger has been building ever since Bush took office. I have been told for three years that because I don't support Bush or his atrocities, I am "anti-American." It doesn't matter that this nation is my home, nor that I love the land I live in. I have been belittled into being silenced. But thanks to Michael Moore's film, I've discovered that there are thousands-- if not millions-- of people out there as angry as I am, who are sick of watching our nation be destroyed by the man who was supposedly elected to lead us. We will be silenced no longer.Moore's film is extremely biased, but no more so than the "news" we've been fed for the last three years. If even a tenth of what he discusses is true, it is damning. Everyone, regardless of political leanings, needs to see this film. Even if you hate Michael Moore, watch it to get the other viewpoint that we've desperately needed for a national dialogue since September 11th. It's time to start talking about what Moore has raised-- because only with discussion (rather than the belittling) can we repair this great nation and move forward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a must see movie if, you want the truth on the Bush Administration and what's been done behind your back. Michael Moore exposes Bush for what he really is, An incompetent idiot that thought he could fool us all. He's a warmonger and wants to be a dictator, as long as it's him. He says it would be easier.???Michaela Moore has Bush's war record before it was blacked out by Bush, he got it in 2000 when no one was questioning it. Much more you never new. No spin has been put on this movie like the right wing media does, Don't be fooled by Bush again. See the movie, then vote. We've all be had for money and power. Both Bush's are running the white house and, this country is still in a mess. That's probably why Bush SR. was never voted back in...I've seen it twice, Both times people were yelling at Bush in the audience, both times there was a standing ovation after the movie. Probably the most important film of this century. This is the most secretive white house ever, Now it's not. Watch how Bush cared about September 11th. He did nothing but read a book. My Pet Goat and worried if we were going to find out that he was in bed with OBL. Watch the 2 month head start he gave OBL so we couldn't catch him. Hear that he was after Iraq before he stole the presidency. Not for WMD as we were told and none were ever found. Watch how Baghdad was before we invaded and then after. You'll be surprised. People left crying. A+++ Movie. Hats off to Michael Moore for having the guts to take on Bush and open our eyes. I will not vote for him again, even though he didn't win to begin with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Bowling For Columbine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary was a short time coming. You could just tell that Michael Moore was itching to make it as soon as possible. Even some parts in Bowling For Columbine stray to attack Bush. Even when Moore won an Oscar for best documentary, what does he do? Make some comment about gun safety? Dedicate it to the lives lost at Columbine? No, he bad mouths Bush. We all remember his little "fictitious times" speech. Well, now we have Fahrenheit 9/11, a full-fledged attack on Bush and his war in Iraq. I like this movie better than Bowling For Columbine for sure. It's much more focused. BFC raised all sorts of questions that Moore either couldn't answer, or answered sloppily. This time around it's clear that the main message is that he, and many others, are against American President George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. Oh, and another thing I liked was that Moore appeared on-screen less. Thank God.This is a terrific sort of time capsule of the last 4 years. As always, I suspected that not all Moore's facts were straight. But then again, I'm sure Oliver Stone likely didn't get all the facts straight about Richard Nixon when he did a movie about him. By now, I think Moore expects people to realize that this film is less of a hard-fact documentary, and more of a commentary. Besides, the most important things in the movie are not fake. You can't fake the fact that Bush won the presidency under mysterious circumstances, you can't fake the attack on the world trade center, and you can't fake the war taking place right now in Iraq. It's a typical Moore film. He makes all the same mistakes as he does in Bowling For Columbine. For the most part it keeps your attention, but certain parts just drone on and on, and in the last half hour it gets so sickeningly sappy and manipulative that you just don't care anymore. The very last line of the film is a riot, though. A true Bush classic. It's worth seeing just for that, and as I said, Fahrenheit 9/11 is better than Bowling For Columbine. Just slightly better, though. It's not great, but it is good. Good enough that I think it's important for everyone to see it now, while its playing in theatres. Don't wait for video. My rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fahrenheit 9/11" is worth the effort to see. It is one of Michael Moore's more political films. It is well done, and leaves a powerful impact. Of course, Mr. Moore slants the presentation toward his own personal viewpoint. However, despite that fact, it still has information organized in a logical way that is quite convincing. This is an election year. And the timing of the release of this movie is unique to the upcoming vote for President of the United States. I can only venture to guess that the DVD will be released in September or October, even closer to the actual election. After seeing this film, one can understand why it has been such a very great financial success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film only for open-minded people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film raises a lot of concerns and questions. I would like to warn everyone not to take what Moore has to offer as facts, but rather opinions of his own (since nothing is really proved)Possibly Moore will bring up lots of debates (as I've already seen with the comments offered by IMDb reviewers) from both sides. So far I've only seen a few that's really neutral in his/her standing. I myself rather took this film as the other side of the coin and watched it without accepting everything it showed.It is not hard to show the bad side of the politicians, since that's the impression they give to most people. But what's really important is what they're really hiding from us. If what Moore shows and speculate is partially true, then I can never trust politicians again (not that I ever did). Moore tries to tell Americans how these money infested tax-earners are ignorant and destroying the country piece by piece, and he did a good job illustrating it (such as the Patriotic Act).I really liked how Moore has a "hand's on" approach in his films. He does a lot of things that takes courage and guts to do (or stupid/shameless to do) in his films. These things make people Moore a "hate me or love me" person.Remember in bowling for columbine (slight spoiler to follow) how he confronted K-mart and the president of NRA? expect more in an interesting fashion in Fahrenheit 9/11.I think if you understand this movie's principles and morals, it's a great film. Otherwise, one would only think of it as a one-sided, biased film. After all, who's going to show us the other side of the story if noone is willing to stand up for it? You'll only realize what's hidden from you once you've walked a mile in someone else's shoes, and you'll only start walking that mile after you've woken up from your slumber. And this movie is that alarm you're looking for, if you're ready to view this film critically.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was admittedly with some trepidation that I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11, the new film by outspoken activist Michael Moore. I found his last film Bowling For Columbine to be somewhat simplistic and strident in tone in a way that immediately polarized people. Moore's latest, however, is a sprawling but focused documentary that makes its points effectively without being overbearing and, after the first fifteen minutes, becomes a powerful and moving cinematic experience. It is also a highly entertaining film, filled with comic touches and genuine human emotions that may make you laugh one minute and cry the next but is guaranteed to make you think.Moore starts off on shaky ground, providing a superficial take on the election of 2000. Calling the Supreme Court's decision a gift from Bush's cronies, he ignores the fact that the Court based its decision on the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment, taking into account the fact that there were no uniform standards in Florida to discern the intent of the voter on unintelligible paper ballots. Moore also takes a few cheap shots at President Bush, inferring bewilderment from his lack of immediate reaction after the attack on September 11th and showing the President repeatedly golfing, hunting, or fishing, the kind of activities that every President from the beginning of the Republic has done to relieve the stress of office. The film becomes more convincing when it strips away Bush's common-man persona and illustrates the connections of the Bush family to Texas oil and the influence of Saudi billionaires. While the Bush, Saudi, Oil connection has been well documented in the past, this sequence makes the elitist nature of the current government much more real to a large number of people.Moore makes us feel the tragedy of 9/11 very deeply by showing a blank screen filled with the sounds of tragedy, leaving the horror to our imagination. After the initial shock of 9/11, awareness opened and people came together, yet, in the words of Tim Robbins, "the media and the government worked overtime to close it and reinforce the usual trance with mindless fear and insatiable material greed". Moore relates how perpetuating the fear of terrorism allowed the government, through the Patriot Act, to trample on civil liberties. Using a loudspeaker, he drives through Washington DC to read provisions of the Act which apparently few legislators read before voting it into law. Moore ratchets up the anti-Bush rhetoric but wisely shows the deeper issues involved in American society, issues that did not begin with and will not end with the removal of President Bush. Showing boarded-up homes and poverty-stricken neighborhoods in his hometown of Flint, Michigan, he dramatizes how the poor and unemployed are used by the system to feed war profits. Moore follows two Marine recruiters as they target young blacks at a shopping mall in a depressed neighborhood, cynically promising them careers in music and sports. The most powerful sequence deals with Iraq. Here Moore shows scenes of devastation that we have never seen on television, not only the slaughter of innocent Iraqi's but also the severed limbs and torn bodies of U.S. soldiers. Moore questions the reasons we invaded a sovereign country that was no threat to us, providing a moving sequence with a patriotic mother who turned against the war after one of her sons was killed. The mother, Lila Lipscombe, tells Moore how she hung the American flag outside of her home daily and how her daughter served in the Gulf War but now questions our government's veracity in the light of the Iraq War. In the film's emotional highlight, she reads a letter from her son written weeks before his death, criticizing the leadership of President Bush and our reasons for being in Iraq. Moore concludes with the words of George Orwell: 'The war is not meant to be won, but it is meant to be continuous... the war is waged by the ruling group against its own subjects, and its object is not victory...but to keep the very structure of society intact.' In his superb film, Moore raises issues that are rarely talked about in the mass media, opening our minds to previously inaccessible facts and images. The ending is a powerful reminder that fundamental change is needed to end the military mentality and corporate elitism that has dominated our government, change that goes beyond Bush, perhaps even beyond politics toward a reinvigoration of the human imagination and consciousness. Mr. Moore has stated that his intention in making the film is to influence the outcome of the next election. If the fact that three million people saw the film in its first weekend is any gauge, the film may prove once again that one person with courage and conviction can truly make a difference.</fullReview>

If you've heard your liberal friends speak of it then you've probably heard the standard "lot's of good info that needs to come out" arguement. I just saw the movie and watched with an open mind fully expecting to be subject to lots of mis-information and what did I find? It didn't really provide any new information for me. However, I'm a Bush-watch person and keep up with his actions and in-actions. Everything I saw was basically the same things I've been trying to tell people for a year now....things people are either shocked to hear and incredulous or things they're not willing to hear because they don't want to believe it. It's probably NOT going to change your mind about anything, but you need to come to any arguement with your guns loaded....see this movie or be out gunned. There are things within your government that just look wrong, ethically and morally, this movie will provide you a starting point for understanding those things if you're not that well informed.Love Bush or hate the man, see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preaching to the choir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies out this year. I have been very frustrated with films that do not challenge me and fail to keep my attention, but Fahrenheit 9/11 was definitely different.Michael Moore created this movie as a response to the negative backlash that came from his Oscar acceptance speech for Bowling for Columbine. In an attempt to justify his words, he came up with a masterpiece. While many of the facts might be already known to the viewer, the way it is put together and presented sheds a whole new light on current politics. Not only is the filming and the reporting shocking, Michael Moore has great comic timing. The whole audience was laughing hysterically (although perhaps sometimes a bit uncomfortably) at the unbelievable revelations (notably the senator who explains that Congress reads very few of the bills they pass).As I was walking out of the movie feeling really happy thinking that Americans would be getting the wake up call they need, I happened to overhear another man saying that Michale Moore was simply preaching to the choir. This statement is so true. The vast majority of the people seeing this are decidedly against Bush already. One scene in which a woman is standing outside of the White House mourning the loss of her son in Iraq seems to be a brilliant and very appropriate metaphor to the kind of reactions this movie will be getting. The lady is looking at a sign showing pictures of the destructive power of war when another approaches her and starts saying that what they are looking at is all staged and fake. We are living in a country where we are either blind and unwilling to accept the truth or are living it too closely to feel comfortable. Either way, neither side is willing to consider the merits of the other and the two will never be reconciled.Congratulations Michael for another inspired and poignant documentary.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Kinder and Gentler Michael Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's magnificent Fahrenheit 9/11 treats President Bush and the Bush administration with great gentility and undue deference. Although excoriated on the right and left for Anti-Americanism and even hatred of the American war effort in Irak, Michael Moore patriotically without compensation took to the streets to inveigh with US Congressmen to enlist their sons and daughters in the US ARMY. I can't imagine a higher service Mr Moore could do for the war effort.Throughout this war there has not been the credibility gap of the Vietnam era but a reality gap. Our Establishment Press reports that wounded servicemen are screaming to be allowed to return to Irak to finish the job. When interviewed by Michael Moore, these invalids do plenty of screaming but curiously did not mention any requests to return to combat duties. Michael Moore employs a certain confrontational style in his form of journalism that is a refreshing break from the politically correct nonsense that appears in print.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What happened to the post war dream?"(possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I'm going to be getting a lot or criticism about this movie; at least I think I am, so here we go. First of all, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is a documentary. Now I know some people are going to be saying, "Documentary!?!?! What are you nuts?!?!? This movie is very bias and one sided!" Ah yes, that's true. This movie is very one sided. However, aren't most documentaries one sided? THE KID STAYS IN THE PICTURE (a great documentary) discusses what a great man Robert Evans was for Hollywood. THE FOG OF WAR, McNamara's view of the Bay of Pigs and Vietnam War. SUPER SIZE ME, the American consumption of fast food is damaging our health. These three films are all considered documentaries, and they all take one side of the issue. The only recent documentary that I can think of that stays in the middle of an issue and gives the facts, is the excellent ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER. But FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is indeed quite a movie to see because Michael Moore does bring up questions about our "War on Terror." The beginning of the film was very satirical with the results of the 2000 election with Al Gore announced as the winner and stating "Was this really a dream?" Then the first eight months of what Bush did in office by going on vacation a lot (which I do remember, Bush was usually on vacation). Then the very tragic day of September 11th 2001. Moore does a great job with this film by not actually showing the iconic images of 9/11 with the planes hitting the World Trade Center towers. Instead he just shows a pitch-black screen with the audio noises of 9/11. I've been talking to quite a few people about this scene and I've received a lot of interpretations of this. "We've seen the images so much that it is in our memories forever." "Giving us the feel of what it must have been like for the people who were in the WTC towers, with chaos and confusion." Then Moore shows us the horror and look on the people's faces as they look up towards the sky, bawling at what they were witnessing. Moore then shifts focus with the Bush family and their connections to the Bin Laden family. Now quite a few people will be denying that the Bush family had anything to do with the Bin Laden's, but Moore does discuss business deals and partnerships that were shown with photos and clippings from newspapers that do give pretty good support of his argument (I've taken a university argumentation class last spring and Moore does give evidence and warrants for his claims). Plus seeing a video footage of Rumsfield shaking hands with Hussein in 1983 does make the viewer question the Bush Administration's past. Moore does explain other issues including the infamous, going to war on terror, by going to war on Iraq issue. It is interesting to see a different side on the War in Iraq compared to major news networks repetitive footage of U.S. soldiers in Iraq, with the troops standing around like police officers, or seeing a tank roll by. Moore shows the viewer footage of some of the U.S. soldiers excitement of power and control. Such as the scene where a solider discusses blasting a heavy metal song that has the lyric "the roof is on fire." While other scenes show other U.S. soldier who question why the Iraqis don't seem pleased that the U.S. troops are over there. Then when footage is shown of children killed and houses destroyed, you begin to wonder yourself. FAHRENHEIT 9/11 does have some very emotional scenes, such as Lila Lipscomb's story, a Flint, Michigan resident whose son was killed in Iraq. One can't help but feel emotional and supportive of Mrs. Lipscomb. Then when Mrs. Lipscomb arrives at the White House in tears, only to have a Bush/Iraq supporter harass Lipscomb by saying "this is all staged!" A viewer can't help but to show pain and anger at the same time. Or shock and anger when a Taliban official was visiting the White House in early 2001, and a female reporter comments how horrible the women in Afghanistan. Only to have the Taliban official make a comment, "I feel sorry for you husband with what he has to go though with you." Or the scene with President Bush sitting in the Florida classroom for an extra 7 minutes reading along with the class "My Pet Goat" as Moore gives commentary with "what was Bush thinking at the time?" FAHRENHEIT also has some very hysterical scenes, Paul Wolfowitz footage before getting ready for a TV interview by placing the teeth of a comb in his mouth to pat his hair down, then licking his hand to pat the hair down again. Some of the footage of the comments that Bush makes including the comment "you are my home base." John Ashcroft singing the very hysterical song "Let the Eagle Soar." And my personal favorite, Britney Spears smacking her gum and giving allegiance to G.W. After watching FAHRENHEIT 9/11, I put on my copy of the Pink Floyd (or mostly Roger Waters) album THE FINAL CUT. FINAL CUT is a concept album about the scarred memories of wars from the past and the continuation of war right now. the album was released in 1983, and it's disturbing how the message still stands 21 years later. THE FINAL CUT is an excellent companion piece to listen to after viewing FAHRENHEIT 9/11. Although FAHRENHEIT is not as humorous or entertaining as Moore's BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. Yet, FAHRENHEIT, I feel is a better and more important picture than COLUMBINE. FAHRENHEIT deals with our leaders, the people who control the free world. Yet do our leaders deserve the creditability they get from the media? (especially the Fox News Network). Legendary filmmaker Jean Luc-Godard said, "The way to criticize a film is to make another film." So if Conservatives are upset with FAHRENHEIT 9/11, why don't they make a movie supporting Bush and the war in Iraq earlier? Now that FAHRENHEIT was #1 at the box office, the Republican Party is making a Bush documentary. I am willing to see the film, however, I am curious to see how well they use their warrants and evidence with the claims they make on how great a President G.W. is. Michael Moore has said on numerous interviews that he only had one objective with FAHRENHEIT 9/11, to get people to vote in this November's election. Now whether you support Moore or not, no one can't deny that because of this film, people are ready to go out and vote this November. Too bad this movie wasn't released in October. But if pro-Moore and pro-Bush supporters are registering and ready to vote this November because of FAHRENHEIT 9/11, then THAT is where this movie has succeeded! If you are an anti-Bush person, then you should see this film. If you are a pro-Bush person, you should still see this movie. The only way to win an argument is to listen to what the opposing side has to say, which most Bush supporters I know are not doing, that is why most of the claims of their arguments aren't valid. And even if you don't support Moore of Bush, still see this movie. If you don't agree with what Moore is saying, then discuss and investigate his claims. That way you are at least informed with what is going on in our government and world. Again, that is where Moore and FAHRENHEIT succeed. DON'T MISS THIS MOVIE! ***** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half Punditry - Half Genuine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knowing Moore, there is definitely an agenda to his films. He wants to show how screwed up our country is by showing irony with humour. In this case, he shows Bush and other principles in the most unflattering way - satellite feeds before live broadcast, Ashcroft singing, Bush muttering and goofing off. The story given has a fair amount of facts, but disregards the circumstances occasionally. Based on the buzz coming from the critics and other screenings, there was the impression that there was devastating footage that rivets you. About half of this film does that, but other times it's talking heads and not entirely relevant anecdotes. The endless shots of Saudi dignitaries shaking hands of George H Bush and James Baker are not "smoking gun" images. Yes, the Saudies are quite different from us, but we generally do have a good relationship with them (remember, Osama Bin Laden is against the Saudi ruling family as much as he is against the United Sates.). However, the important aspects of what is soooo wrong with George W Bush is covered well, and indeed many other slimey aspects of his presidency are left out. In reality, the film would have to be about 4 hours long in order to go over everything bad about Bush. As much as this film originally was titled and created to expose the Bush-Bin Laden connection, there is actually very little about the other scandalous behaviour that was explored in depth during the 9/11 commission hearings. Instead, it is the impact of the war in Iraq that gains most of the film's attention. Yes, one cannot help but be moved when seeing amputees and grieving families. It is these scenes that are important for all Americans to see, since our Media refuses to cover it. We must all be shaken awake to the fact that the Iraq war is not a video game (as described by US soldiers in Iraq), but human lives being destroyed. For that, this film gets a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

SEE THIS MOVIE! Whether you are aware of the facts presented in this movie prior to seeing it or are going to use it an an educational tool, see this movie. When Bush receives the news of the terrorist bombings, is there a look of genuine terror on his face? Not the kind of terror that results from fear of ones own safety, but rather the fear that comes from having absolutely no idea what to do, what to say, or how to react because no one is there to tell him what to do or say.The appalling connection between Bush, his holdings, his friends and the Saudi government is worth the price of admission.Corporal Abdul Henderson's story, Lila, who lost her son in the war.

		<shortDescription>the moral: don't ignore your government.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie may be an attack on Bush, but I think there is a deeper meaning there. The entire issue of the 2000 election could have been handled if PEOPLE DID SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR GOVERNMENT. A recurring theme in this movie is that the US government did things for its own selfish reasons, or that they were manipulating the public somehow. If the government has truly become as manipulative as this movie portrays, it's because we let it.I say this is not the time to blame our government, it's the time to work with it. Our country MUST serve the people. The PEOPLE are the majority in this country, not the government. I hope everyone who sees this film is inspired to learn how to contact their congressman, to register to vote, to find out what they believe in. If you can help accomplish this, Mr. Moore, you are my hero.</fullReview>

SEE THIS MOVIE! Whether you are aware of the facts presented in this movie prior to seeing it or are going to use it an an educational tool, see this movie. When Bush receives the news of the terrorist bombings, is there a look of genuine terror on his face? Not the kind of terror that results from fear of ones own safety, but rather the fear that comes from having absolutely no idea what to do, what to say, or how to react because no one is there to tell him what to do or say.The appalling connection between Bush, his holdings, his friends and the Saudi government is worth the price of admission.Corporal Abdul Henderson's story, Lila, who lost her son in the war.

		<shortDescription>THE Movie of the Moment - See it for YOURSELF, but see it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. Outside of the Science Fiction Film Marathon I can't remember the last time I was so anxious to go to a movie theater. And, I'm not alone. SOLD OUT Shows (on a Monday?! For a DOCUMENTARY??!). Lines down the block. People buzzing, jittery, excited (maybe it was the Marathon after all! :) The Movie. FAHRENHEIT 911. As a "Movie" - it's not great. It's not even the best thing Michael Moore's done. Moore actually harms his own cause with some of his snarky asides and commentary. Let the images, the clips, the soundbites and Moore's own film-making knack do the talking once in a while. Yes, sometimes less is "Moore". Beyond that, Moore is sloppy in his construction - cutting back and forth in time and in context, so that those without an already solid knowledge of the facts can easily get confused or have important details go by without registering that they ARE important.All this is to say that the film lacks focus. What it does not lack is PASSION. This passion carries the film across the line. The details may get blurred, but there is no mistaking the impact and the force of the main argument - We went to war for the wrong reasons following a wrongheaded mis-Leader. The most damning info surrounds the circle of business associates surrounding the Bush family (many of them Saudis actually NAMED "Bin Laden"!). People really must ask themselves whether it is wise to re-elect a President and VP who are so beholden to Oil interests. Isn't it an odd coincidence that of the 100's of countries on this planet (not to mention the dozens of conflicts, large and small), that the two President Bushes have only invaded 3 countries in nearly 8 years in office? And, all 3 happen to not only be rich in Oil, but sworn enemies of the Bin Laden family and the Saudis in general).See the film for yourself. Do not let others tell you what to think of it (including me, natch). Oh, and never ask Paul Wolfowitz to borrow his comb!!</fullReview>

The film is so choppy , the time-line is impossible to follow. I have to admit I hated.I know Moore is making a part 2, and I'm sure he'll fill that with more lies and distortions. Its sad that he feels he can poke fun and make lies at our government when he isn't even a citizen.I hear he is going after the Democrats in Part II, for their lies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Canada, like the U.S., is owned not by the people, but by private bankers and big business. I suspect that the lives of most of us peons are worth nothing to our disgustingly wealthy owners except that we might be so financially desperate as to go to war for them so we can use the meager pay to feed our families. Michael Moore tells it like it is. Only an administration gone mad with power would be BORROWING $1.64 BILLION a day (over $5 a day for every man, woman and child in the U.S.) to finance a war to kill other human beings in a foreign country while economic development at home, in cities like Flint, Michigan, remains stagnant. But, war is 'good business', isn't it? It translates to tons of revenue for the already disgustingly wealthy who finance these wars.Civilization really hasn't progressed very far, has it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael More, a living legend in provoking documentary have made a enjoyable, remarkable film about George W. Bush's election, the war in Iraq, the 9/11 disaster, The Taleban, The oil, The Saudi's influence in USA's Politics and about love. Love to your own country, love to your God, love to each and everyone. Because love seems to flooding out of this man. His love for his own political ideas shines throughout the entire movie. And even though this is meant to be the point (a critical view on George W. Bush's wars) it's also the weakness of this movie. If you don't care that other people make your opinions for you, and if you don't care everything only got one side's view (Michael More's), then this movie is the perfect suit for you. Even though the conspiracy theories Michael More comes up with are some-kinda scary, his ironic way to mention them sometimes make the whole movie laughable. I surely hope that his intentions ISN'T to make people laugh, and thereby selling more tickets/DVDs, but also I sure know better.Another weakness of this movie is the depth of it. Mr. More wants to cover too many aspects of the government he fears so much, so many aspects, that a lot of people will lose interest halfway through the movie, and sometimes it's hard to find the red line.Except the above Fahrenheit 9/11 is enjoyable, but as a documentary it sure lacks the subjective's point of view 7/10</fullReview>

Good attempt to stop the new Hitler, however it come with price - it's politically incorrect. Most of the facts was presented as the Republicans and Bush themselves are the only one responsible persons for it. But that is not true, the Democrats are in charge, Clinton bombed the factory on Aspirin in Sudam. It was Clinton, who hit with the tomahawks Afghanistan targets in hope to kill Osama bin Laden. And since this hit is very likely the ignition, what light up the fire, that caused 9/11 attack, the Democrats are responsible for it as well, as the Republicans, that let the bad guys do it. Look, what power it give them! To put it short, the whole USA overseas policy is up to blame, not just Republicans. That make this one a mere voting propaganda movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the most biased movies ever made. Michael Moore uses trickery editing, and blatant lies to convince the viewer that republicans (mainly George W. Bush) are bad. Mr. Moore included and interview with John Mccain, however he did not include the audio in this scene. (It was over dubbed by Mr.Moore's explanation.) The movie also falsely states that George Bush was involved in getting the Bin Laden family out of America. He also tried to portray his opinion as fact. For example he started to talk about what George Bush did before 9/11 and without stating any facts he showed Mr.Bush on a golf course and played the song Vacation. Other than the obvious lies in the movie, Moore did nothing but show Liberal politicians speaking their opinions. The Republicans in the movie were only in small clips edited (and sometimes over dubbed) to portray Mr.Moore's opinion. If you are not intelligent enough to see the obvious bias in this movie, than you are not intelligent enough to vote. As a Democrat, I understand to need to remove George Bush from office, however I have more integrity than Mr.Moore and I believe that lying to the American public (for any reason) is wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie (I know, took me long enough) and I was very surprised at the large amount of one-sided information Mr. Moore gave us. Now I've always known Moore to be bias in his films, but the beginning of the movie was so filled with personal opinions that I could not imagine a better way to invalidate the fine film the was to follow then if Moore had mooned the audience. That being said I thought the film was pretty darn good! And at times, very touching.But Ladies and Gentlemen this was as much a documentary as Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra was a Hallmark Card. And do to get me started on the supposed 'truth behind Fahrenheit 9/11' flicks (i.e. Celsius 411 and Faherhype 911)!! I mean honestly people, if Fahrenheit 9/11 was bias these folks take the cake.BTW if I hear another take off on a movie title that was a take off on Ray Bradbury classic, I will hold the makes responsible for the illiteracy rate in this country today :PNow getting back to my comment, if you can make it past the first portion of the film then there is hope, for beyond the Bush Bashing (and poor Al not getting support from the Senate) we have some of the first candidate looks at America and the Middle East since this 'oil-wash' began. And for a 'documentary' it was quite a well produced film, very deserving of the awards it won.So I would very much recommend this movie to anyone interested in what is going on, but remember any one who takes only one person's perspective at the truth is more dangerous then nuke in the hands of a child.

		<shortDescription>Commie Sympathizers Against Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really hoped that Michael Moore could pull it off and finally create the follow-up to his masterpiece Roger and Me. He didn't.I think the problem with Moore's films derive from his targets. In Roger and Me, his idea - little man (little, smarty-pants, angry, and sarcastic man) takes on monolithic establishment - worked wonderfully. His vitriolic raging against the machine that destroyed his beloved Flint, MI was heartfelt and, though it was an imperfect film, Moore's passion for the subject overcame those faults. His Sisyphisean task of getting that one meeting with Roger was an entertaining and informative look at corporate America.Then there was Bowling for Columbine, which, though it made some excellent points concerning violence in America, treated the subject with a sarcasm that seemed incongruous with the task at hand. Perhaps I am in the minority, but taking on the NRA by making fun of them is easy; taking them on with the integrity documentarians ought to have is something more difficult and ultimately more rewarding fr the audience. Really, what did we learn from Bowling? That (maybe) you can get a rifle at a bank? That (gasp!) Americans are trigger happy? Ultimately, what I learned that Michael Moore was a self-serving schmuck whose self-righteousness is irritating.I assumed that Moore's next film would bring him back on track.I'm not sure if I've ever been more wrong. As a secular, liberal individual who thinks that socialism is a pretty good idea and that communism could work if instituted properly, I ought to be ga-ga over Fahrenheit, which lambastes my generation's Richard Nixon.I'm not ga-ga and let me explain why: It's a bad movie and its points rarely, if ever, hit their target. Moore takes pot-shots at an administration that deserves to have pot-shots taken at it and repeatedly misses. He moves too-quickly from one-point to the next without developing the reason behind making the point. I'm not saying that I need to have my hand-held and have every little thing explained to me. I'm an intelligent young man.In making a coherent argument, one must support that argument.Moore moves quickly through reasons why Bush is bad without really explaining why those things make him bad and without addressing counter-arguments. In that way, then, Moore's treatise against the President is simply an un-sound piece of propaganda.It's just as irritating as those commercials by the Swift Boat Veterans - self-righteous "I'm right, you're wrong" rhetoric that gets us nowhere. Fahrenheit will not spark a meaningful dialogue nor do I think that was Moore's intention (though it ought to have been).What we really need is a movie that says: I disagree and here is why...Furthermore, Fahrenheit is very boring. Bowling, at least, was an entertaining polemic; Fahrenheit is plain dull. Moore will never be half the documentarian that Errol Morris is (whose Fog of War, by the way, gives far more insight into the current state of world affairs).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been a big fan of Michael Moore. The way he's marketed in the UK is as a comedian of some sorts. So many critics claimed that his latest film "Fahrenheit 9/11" is hilarious or seriously funny. It isn't. It is a damning statement of fact, highlighting everything that is wrong with the war in Iraq, the war on terror and the US government's war on the rights of its citizens. I'm no fan of Moore but I'm no fan of George W Bush either.The film opens with a reminder of Bush's dark days before 9/11, the Presidential motorcade speeding through the streets of Washington, DC to the chants and jeers of "Hail To The Thief". As soon as the 11th September comes around, we all know what happened next. The Saudi royal family (including members of Bin Laden's own family) were flown out of the States while all other commercial airlines were suspended. The Taliban were removed from power in Afghanistan and all trace of Osama Bin Laden was lost. Then the Bush administration turned its guns to Iraq, fooling the American people (as well as the United Nations) into believing a non-existent link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda. A decision whose repercussions are still being felt today, both in terms of lives lost and oil prices.For those of us who have never trusted Bush (myself included), this film doesn't really reveal anything new. Anyone who has read Moore's "Dude, Where's My Country?" or even Mark Crispin Miller's excellent "The Bush Dyslexicon" (published before 9/11) will be aware of the links between the Bush family and the Saudi royals, the remarkable success of Dick Cheney's old company Halliburton since their former CEO's rise to the position of Vice President of the United States and the shadowy Carlisle group's dealing with various "rogue nations". Sorry if all this sounds a little X-Filesque but the truth is that these stories have been around for as long as the Bush administration. All Moore has done here is bring all the loose threads together and offer it on display for the masses. And for that, he deserves every piece of praise he gets.However, despite the sheer weight of sordid detail, this film is hugely unbalanced. There is very little counter-argument to Moore's point of view and the film is loaded with provocative images such as the woman from Flint, Michigan (Moore's hometown, remember) who grieves for her dead son, killed while serving in the increasingly inaccurate War On Terror. From a British viewpoint, there is also next to no mention of Tony Blair's role in all this though that probably doesn't concern Moore or his viewers. This is made for the American public and rightly so. Despite Moore's insistence that it would alter the outcome of the preceeding election, however, it turns out that it made next to no difference at all and to be frank, it was naive to think that it would. It's not like this is "An Inconvenient Truth" or anything else that makes a significant impact on public thinking. Consider this a historical footnote for the future but it's about as reliable as doing research on Wikipedia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The CBS Morning Show's Hannah Storm interviewed Moore a few weeks ago, and it was a great sparring match. Actually, it wasn't so not so much a sparring match as it was Storm losing her cool and Moore calmly putting her in her place. She seems really upset that the movie is called a documentary because it doesn't attempt to be "fair and balanced" like all respectable news corporations pretend to be. She asks if Fahrenheit 911 is propaganda and he says the CBS Evening News is propaganda- his movie is satirical documentary. Moreover, she seems outraged that one should make a movie criticizing the holy state or an American president, or perhaps just the Bush administration. Well, even if Storm does not think people can think for themselves, I know you'll make up your own mind about the interview and the movie. The Daily Show with John Stewart did a piece on this interview.</fullReview>

In 2000 Florida election, Bush challenged media that he would win in Florida, from his own word "You can write that down". .... How did he know that?Why there is no congressman want to send his/her own son to war? Why rebuild Iraq? What if Iraq not an oil country do they still rebuild it?Think about it friends.

Somehow I doubt it.There is a lot of info missing in the movie, but its already a good movie with what it has. But nothing is "lies", most of the movie is footage and facts from govt themselves. Bush sticks his own foot in his mouth, Moore doesn't put words into anyone elses.See this movie... to not do so, is un-American.Remember: Hitler controlled the media and the people of Germany believed what they wanted to believe. To be faithful to a lie is only foolish.But, there is a very good chance that Bush will steal the next election since the "new" voting machines are manufactures by a company that is "owned" but many high leveled republicans... such as Dick Cheney.Watch this movie... Its funny, its sad, its SERIOUS at the same time... the people in the theater cheered when its over... but it won't mean much if America continues to become some "other" country not based on FREEDOM of Religion, expression and life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a pro- Democratic/ anti Republican film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film really made the Democrats look like weak-boned idiots. The most eye-opening aspect of this film is the fact that no Senator (Democrat or Republican) signed on to debate the legitimacy of the 2000 election.And of course, the only people to challenge the inaccuracy of the vote count in Florida were Representatives that were people of color (black women,one Asian woman, and one black man.) It angered me that white Democratic Senators (all the US senators holding office are white) did not even sign legislation that would open the debate and make sure the integrity of Presidential elections are legitimate and fair. (If Bush really did win, that is fine. But if votes were disregarded, that is wrong. And trust me, I don't think Al Gore is good either).Regardless of what political affiliation you are, people of color and poor whites are always going to be the fodder for powerful white people and the black people who serve them (Mammy Condi Rice and Uncle Colin Powell). To watch the big conference with all the oil companies and their ilk carving up Iraq like this was World War I European colonialism carving up Africa was sickening. The most heartbreaking part was the juxtaposing scenes of the American mother who lost her son, and the Iraqi mother who lost five members of her family to American bombs. To hear them both call on the same God to help ease their pain will make anyone cry at what Bush has done. (He is the war President, right?) And then to see young, dumb (okay, ignorant), soldiers playing thrasher music in their tanks like they're playing a video game to pump themselves up, spliced with other images of different soldiers who have no more limbs or control over their motor functions is harrowing. Funny, we only hear about soldiers who are killed, never the thousands who are now human tripe trying to figure out how they will function in America now.My favorite part of the film? Michael Moore trying to convince Senators to sign their kids up to fight in the war. Those bastards ran. I hope people outside this country get to see this film so that they know that not all Americans are down for this phony administration. I will see this film two more times, dragging friends with me and will buy the DVD too. It makes you want to strive to be a better human being, regardless of what race or class or political slant you have. Most people who really hate Michael Moore and the "idea" of this film are the people who need to wake up. The best Americans are those that can love the country and still demand the best from it as they criticize it. Pro or Con, see the movie for yourself and think about how the world sees our country.</fullReview>

This film shows the other side of Bush, the one that cares about the "haves and the have mores." Even the most conservative GOP member cannot watch this film without even questioning President's Bush and his motives. Again, go see this film. Preferably before the November Elections. It's an eye opener</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pathetic and very one-sided</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had a lot of information that was completely incohesive in nature. It does not, in the least reflect any sort of real interpretation since it does not look at the issues it represents from both sides. It simply jumps on its own bandwagon and takes the viewer for a ride of its own design with its own opinion on everything. It is truly sad to me that so many people have been duped by someone like Michael Moore who has spoken of Cuba as being the superior in health care to America (Cuba being communist, of course) when Castro wasn't even treated by the medical professionals he set up there. Michael is always talking out of the side of his head and doesn't even live up to the standards he so urgently impresses on others - like hiring minorities and living simply.Where was he when Bill Clinton was being impeached by Congress for committing perjury to the American people and falling asleep on watch when Osama bin Laden was making early attacks during that administration? Where are the biting words for liberals when they mess up? That's a good question for Hollywood and the news media who like to gloss over the mistakes of their political favorites. When will America (and the World) hear an unbiased and balanced telling of events in America. Do liberals thing Americans so dumb, they cannot think for themselves and must be led like sheep to the "correct" thinking? This is a scary thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slickly made- but one sided "mocudrama" focusing on the events after the 9-11 tragedy.Moore-a fairly talented but ultra biased filmmaker distorts the facts to fit his far left agenda. This is not a movie, or even a documentary. It is a slickly made and packaged poster for the Democrat party, which is NOT the same party it was in the days of FDR, Truman or even JFK.Moore- Americas equivalent of Leni Reifensthall is proof that anybody with a film crew nd camera can make anything to fit their agenda. So if you MUST watch it- do it with an open mind-and take it with more than a grain of salt. Wouldn't it be nice to see a conservative filmmaker do a real documentary on the liberal media-and exposing them for what they really are? Don't hold your breath.Zero stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say, I'm ashamed have been born in a country that eventually sent troops to the US in aiding Bush wage his illegal war. To me the movie presented nothing new (save for the fact bin Laden's relatives were quickly smuggled out of the US) and frankly I pity the person who somehow was in the dark about all the things the movie presents. Many people have claimed Moore tries to lead the audience to a conclusion. That thing may be true about 'Bowling for Columbine' but here he just adds a note of humor to his presentation of facts, most of them can easily be verified (others are harder to get to, but not impossible with enough pressure). In fact Moore doesn't slam the neocons at all, he allows the facts to do it by themselves, although the underlines and idea here and there, for the American audience. Moore did a very good job at poking the illegal occupation of Iraq and at the policy of terror brought by the neocons against the American people. Hopefully it will have some effect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, you call THIS propaganda?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always funny to read the comments of the Bush fans on this movie or anything Mr. Moore is doing. No wonder these people love a president who's actively ignoring the truth and twisting the facts as much as this one."If you are into hate, this is your movie" OK, so Mr. Bush, who started a war without a reason (lying about connections between Saddam and Osama, WMD and so on), is so much into love?? Also I find the comments of the Michael Moore haters much more filled with loath than the peace loving people's comments. But that's typical behaviors from these people. Look at FOX, the "un-biased" media! It's always the other one's fault! These people ignore the truth and their own state of mind. We should feel sorry for them."Michael Moore makes his point: He doesn't like Mr. Bush as a person. This is getting boring!" Let's see: About 98 % of the comments on Mr. Moore's work refer not to his work, but to his weight: "He is fat and dumb!" OK, so this is fair??"Michael Moore makes a lot of money" It's great how much these people care about some million dollars this man makes, who obviously is not interested (yet) in just being rich. There was even a site on his homepage: "Spend Mike's tax cut for a good thing". And it's quite disturbing that the same people don't care AT ALL about the HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS of taxmoney being spent by their administration for a war that was not necessary, for the benefit of Halliburton &amp; Co, nice move Mr. Cheney!"Michael Moore makes propaganda" This is my favourite. OK, so everything Mr. Bush and his preachers on FOX news is telling is nothing but the sweet and pure truth?? It's hard to imagine that anyone can be ignorant and stupid enough to believe that! Most of the comments have been written in 2004. Much more facts we do know today, how the administration fixed the facts to fit THEIR propaganda. And remember how George landed on that ship they had to turn around before so you couldn't see in was in the harbour? The fake plastic turkey at the first war Thanksgiving? You people make fools out of yourselves, really.About the film: I found it a bit too long and complicated, and most of the facts I read in "Stupid white men". But it was still great to watch Mr. Bush, maybe the dumbest person ever to reign over a superpower. Thank god America seems to be waking up now, when just 37 % of the people support him.Thank you, Mr. Moore, for keeping on the good work!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is, contrary to what many people say, very well done, and pretty much all of the sources check out. The reason why many people take such great offense to the film is that it expresses controversial views. Many people claim that Moore has no "journalistic integrity." I would then remind people that DOCUMENTARY IS NOT JOURNALISM. Documentary does not, and has not ever, tried to be unbiased. Pretty much the only ones that are unbiased are so because they are about uncontroversial subject matter. I would urge people to give examples of these supposed "unbiased documentaries" they have in mind - I would wager they could not think of any.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>of course its biased - what did you expect!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, I will candidly admit that I am a fan of Michael Moore. I am strongly left-leaning, passionate about environmental issues and increasingly anti-capitalist. Not a huge fan of GW Bush's, then! So this movie/documentary was preaching to the utterly converted in my case.However, I left the cinema feeling stupid. My main emotional reaction, other than tears at Lila Lipscomb's grief, was that I have not been nearly angry enough over the last few years. I agree with many of the comments made here, both for and against Moore. The movie is extremely manipulative and one-sided. But then I can't think of much in the media - any medium - that isn't. All news has a point of view, an editorial slant. Every TV report has been cut in some way. Every TV show and movie is, however subtly or unconsciously, promoting a lifestyle, or set of values. However this 'documentary' is a drop in the ocean, just trying to redress the balance a little. You have minds of your own - if you don't believe what Moore tells you, look into it, investigate, research, question. That's the freedom we have - use it or lose it!!I agree that the pictures of happy children playing in Iraq were largely irrelevant, and the question of the persecution of the Kurds was not addressed. I can only guess that this was omitted as the issue was also pretty much absent from all the spin and justification for the war. That was all about the WMD, Saddam's alleged contravention of UN directives. Regime change due to internal issues was not legally admissible as grounds for war, however morally desirable it may have been.The sequence showing Bush and his associates shaking hands with a succession of Arab men was pointless - I had no idea who any of them were. Maybe they were members of the bin Ladin family, maybe they were representatives of international humanitarian organisations! Presumably they weren't the latter, but captions would have been helpful!The stereotyped images illustrating the members of the coalition made me uncomfortable, and the omission of larger countries such as the UK and Spain was significant.But these faults don't outweigh the majority of the film, which appeared to me to be largely based on documented fact. I take the point raised here that much of what is 'revealed' is common knowledge, or common sense. But was it really? While mindful of potential anti-US bias in some parts of the UK press, I have read about the impact in mainstream US media of Bush's declaration 'if you're not with us, you're against us'. Supposedly, this has been widely interpreted as meaning that any criticism of the Bush administration will be perceived as anti-American. This seems crazy to me, as surely freedom of speech is absolutely central to the values cherished in America. I once heard patriotism described as similar to the love one has for one's own family - even though you love them totally and instinctively, you still recognise their faults, and even try to help them overcome them. My hope and belief is that the simple fact of this film is ensuring that many issues are debated far more widely than before. Ultimately, however, though feeling compelled to action, I am left with a deep feeling of pessimism. Over the last year or so, I have been thinking 'surely no-one is so money-motivated that they would utterly fabricate a war'. Surely there was some higher moral motivation? After watching this movie, I feel so na?ve. Yup - apparently money really does mean that much to some people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bowling For Columbine was the highest grossing feature length documentary ever made when it was released in 2002. Fahrenheit 9/11 made more money in its first weekend than Bowling For Columbine's gross. Needless to say, the release was a massive media event, and conservatives, particularly those in radio, are fighting to be the first to denounce Michael Moore and anything he does or stands for. One radio talk show host, Lee Hewitt, I think, even went so far as to call Fahrenheit 9/11 something of a Rorschach test, 'Anybody who liked anything about this movie clearly is an idiot' type of thing. It's really sad to see how badly they want everyone to look the other way. 'This movie is propaganda/a pack of lies' (Limbaugh). 'This movie is a test of your mental capacity' (Hewitt). 'The movie was SHOT badly' (Michael Medvet). 'Michael Moore is a liar' (everyone). Some even dubbed it astoundingly unentertaining and boring, an absolutely impossible assertion regardless of your political standing. You know, no matter how much you hate Michael Moore, it's hard to argue with video evidence. And by the way, Mr. Medvet, that 'grainy' look was there because you were looking at what is called stock footage. Unproduced, unedited, uncleaned, unpolished. Best not to comment on the technical aspects of a medium about which you clearly know virtually nothing. That being said, I can understand a lot of the criticism that the movie is receiving. There's a part in the movie, for example (this is probably the part that receives the most glaring criticism) in which we see a montage of Iraqi children jump-roping and singing and whatnot before the war. When I saw that part, the first thing that popped into my mind was, 'My God, why would Michael Moore arm his critics with such a sequence?' Of course, the SECOND thought that popped into my mind (note that there was more than one), was that this is a mixture of Moore's quite often obnoxious sense of humor and his tendency to show things that tend to get hidden, usually purposely.We know that Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator, that he ran an oppressive regime, that he killed his own people, etc. What people don't seem to get is that Moore is not saying that it was all singing and dancing and sweet happy cheer in Iraq before Bush took us to war there, but he was showing that those things did in fact exist in Iraq. If you think that Michael Moore expects his audience to believe that living under a dictator like Hussein resembled a trip to Disneyland, see the Rorschach comment above. Disagree with them all you like, but liberals are not drooling idiots, and Moore knows this. You look at the news media, on TV and in the newspapers, even from the very mouth of our own president, and you hear about absolutely NOTHING but killers and evildoers and murderers and mass graves and weapons of mass destruction and torture chambers and rape rooms, seemingly from people who believe that Iraq in its entirety is a torture chamber. True, Hussein ran a brutal regime, but that was simply what life was like for Iraqis. They don't understand freedom after so many years of oppression, and the notion that we could go over there and inject a democratic government into a country that has lived in oppression for so many decades and think that everyone is going to live happily ever after loving America and Americans forever and ever is MUCH more of a Rorschach test than whether or not you liked even a single thing about Fahrenheit 9/11.Is it too much simply to show that there was some level of normalcy at some levels in Iraq? And as far as being partly a result of Moore's obnoxious sense of humor, I am referring to the sense of humor that led him to hypothesize about what was going through Bush's head in the first minutes after being told of the attacks, or that led Moore to sneak up on Charlton Heston and unexpectedly ask for an apology for the families of the Columbine victims for holding an NRA meeting in Columbine shortly after the Columbine shootings. You could argue with the idea that, based on the footage of Bush in that classroom after being told about the attacks, he was clearly clueless about what to do. There is even footage of him with his head down in that children's book and his eyes are darting around the room as though he's afraid someone's looking at him. His vacuous expression is indeed unsettling. But here is the thing that has to be kept in mind when analyzing this movie from any political standpoint, THIS IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY. Michael Moore himself has explained that Fahrenheit 9/11 is not a documentary, but more of an editorial piece in which he presents HIS OPINION of a variety of facts. Context is dangerously absent at many points in the movie, but the important thing to realize is that it is entirely based on FACTS. Michael Moore has considered offering a $10,000 reward (see the July 12, 2004 issue of TIME magazine) to anyone who can successfully disprove a single FACT (NOT opinion) in his movie. Given that, Mr. Limbaugh, the assertion that the movie is 'a pack of lies' is either propaganda in itself or pure, unfiltered idiocy. In Moore's defense, he shows a surprising and much appreciated amount of restraint, playing only the audio over a black screen of the September 11th attacks, sparing us from seeing the catastrophic images that he knows we don't need to see yet again. He also largely disappears from the movie himself, taking a sharp turn from his heavy presence in his previous works, such as Roger &amp; Me, the television show 'The Awful Truth,' and Bowling For Columbine, probably because he knows he is taking on a much more touchy issue and had best let the facts speak for themselves. Notice, for example, that as soon as he appears in the movie, he can't resist walking up to various government officials and asking them to enlist their own children in the war in Iraq.Michael Moore is so determined in his opposition to Bush that he slips up at times, but the larger picture presented by his movie is impossible to ignore. We see a disturbing sequence which describes how much more money the Bushes receive from powerful and wealthy Saudis than from American taxpayers, and thus where their loyalties may lie, although this is at odds with the Saudis opposition to the war in Iraq. Even so, the embarrassing extent of Bush's verbal ineptitude is a difficult thing to ignore, especially when we compare his delivery of immensely intelligent speeches, clearly written by his teams of speechwriters, and the disquieting spectacle of Bush Unplugged which, as they say, is quite a thing to behold.If you hated the movie, fine. There's no reason that people should not be allowed to disagree with Moore's film or his political views, or even to simply not enjoy it (although opposite political views are pretty much required for lack of at least some level of enjoyment). But for crying out loud, don't make such outlandish and moronic claims as that the movie doesn't inspire debate, is nothing but lies, or is pure cinematic trash. I've heard all of these from people speaking into a broadcasting microphone, and it's really disheartening to see how closed-minded such people are. If you hated the movie, don't watch it again, if you hate Michael Moore, don't watch it at all and just go out and vote for Bush. That's how you get your revenge against Michael Moore, vote for Bush because Moore wants nothing more than to get him out of office. If, on the other hand, you are able to think for yourself, watch the movie and take from it what you will. Believe what you want, don't believe what you don't want, but don't blindly pretend that Fahrenheit 9/11 is completely negligible just because of who made it or because it presents a decidedly left-wing point of view. No matter how you feel about it, there are some serious problems with the American government pointed out in this movie to which everyone should pay attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore at his investigative Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a media press that is more sound byte than substantive, Michael Moore continues his technique of uncovering the facts and data and presenting them to a culture that is constantly subjected to "News Lite" (All the stories - None of the facts). He is a brilliant writer and director, weaving his information in an entertaining fashion that makes the movie easy to enjoy. Yes, he does get heavy handed at times with his message, but America is in such a lethargy from swallowing media drivel that I, and probably Moore as well, think it OK to have them hammered with the message. Life isn't about Reality TV. Reality is a war that is taking American lives. If more people sit up and pay attention to in depth coverage of current events, maybe we'll demand more of our leaders in the future. I doubt it. So, in the end, it won't matter what we all thought of this movie. Some will love it, some will hate it. We'll not burn books to control the masses as did this movie's namesake, Fahrenheit 451, but instead, we will watch films like Moore's, go back to our Reality TV and roughly 60% of us won't even vote in 2004.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me first say this: I hate Democrats and Republicans equally. My political views most closely resemble a libertarian than anything else. That said, I recently watched this movie two years after it was released. In "Fahrenheit 9/11," Michael Moore does make you wonder about a lot of the actions and policies of the Bush administration, some of which I already wondered about, some of which was new information. Part of the reason his approval rating is as low as it is right now is because of a lot of what's in this movie, it's just now starting to sink in. For that I applaud him. What I don't applaud him for is not being able to edit the movie down. The movie was way too long -- it could have been chopped down by about 45 minutes and still had the same, or better, effect. Michael Moore seems to really enjoy watching himself on film. Overall, though, I think everyone should see this movie, regardless of political affiliation, and draw their own conclusions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 really hits home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore did hit a raw nerve in his documentary about the Bush Administrations handling of the 9/11 attacks,before and after, and it's pushing for and getting almost complete US media support for it's war in Iraq. Moore does this by showing just how the news media played a vital role in it's support of Bush's lies and misstatements about the Iraqi 9/11 connection. As well as that countries possession of WMD, Weapons of Mass Destruction, that has led to the disastrous war in Iraq that is costing America lives and money that could have been used against the real guilty party in the 9/11 attacks: Osama Bin-Laden's Al-Qeada terror organization. The US media has nothing to brag about in it's handling of the news in regard to the "War on Terror". By giving Bush and his cronies in the congress as well as in the media all the slack that they needed in taking away a number of the American peoples rights in their phony war in Iraq against those who he called the "Enemies of America". Who only became "Enemies of America" after Bush attacked them.Smarting from all the evidence coming out of the 9/11 Commission as well as Bush's "Man in Iraq" WMD expert David Kay as well as former top WMD inspector of the UN Hans Blix and the US' own top WMD USMC Major Scott Ritter on Iraq's non-possession of the deadly WMD. As well as the 9/11 Commissions total clean bill of health in regard to Saddam's Iraq non-involvement with the Al-Qeada and the attacks on 9/11. The US media is trying to distance itself from Bush's policies in Iraq but Moore's movie "Fahrenheit 9/11" has thrown a monkey wrench into their plans. People by the millions in the USA as well as the world are seeing through the movie just how the US media was cheer-leading the US and coalition troops into the hell that Iraq has become for them. Now that same media has to take responsibility for the lies and misinformation that it spewed out over the last two and one half years. In pushing for a war that has proved to be a disaster and totally unnecessary for the American people. Unlike the war in Vietnam where almost all of the media, as well as most of those in government now supporting the war in Iraq, were against. This time as the war in Iraq gets bloodier and more illegal as more and more Americans realize that they've been had into supporting it, by the Bush Administration and US Media, what can the media say now to get the trust of the American people back? They can't say, like politicians like John Kerry and John Edwards, that they were fooled by Bush's lies The media is supposed to be so much smarter and more intuitive and have nothing to fear about not getting re-elected by the American people that most politicians, like John Kerry and John Edwards, have to be fearful of. And if, like John Kerry and John Edwards, voting to support Bush in having the right to start a war in Iraq without a declaration of war will get them re-elected, where at that time almost 80% of the American people supported Bush, so be it. What the US media has done over the last two years in it's blind support of the Bush policies in both "The War on Terror" and "The War in Iraq" is de-legitimize itself. Yet at the same time legitimize people like Michael Moore and the so-called radical news outlets, mostly on the internet, to the American people as well as the people of the world as the only true and honest news writers and news reports available. Nobody well ever take the established media seriously again when it bellows out in it's headlines about threats to Americas and the UK's security. No one will believe media stories about war crimes committed by world leaders like Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Solobdan Milosevic of Serbia because of it's, like you would decide to or not to bet on a horse at the racetrack, lousy past performances. In regard to Iraq and that countries WMD and connections to the Al-Qeada Terror Network and thus responsibility for the 9/11 attacks on America. I don't know if it was by accident or by design that Michael Moore brought out this fact about the shameless record of the US media. In regard to it's kowtowing to the Bush administration. The result of the film Fahrenheit 9/11 will be far more devastating to the US media then to Bush or any other leader who's supporting or has supported Bush in his war in Iraq. GW Bush like all politicians will come and go but the media is with us forever and has far more to lose by being exposed as a fraud and incompetent fool then any President of the United States of America ever will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the longest time, I refused to see Michael Moore's "Bowling For Columbine." Mostly, it was because of his speech at the Oscars. I'm not very big into politics, but I can't stand when celebrities get up at award shows and voice their opinions on where are nation is going. Well, I saw "Columbine" and shut my mouth. I saw that Michael Moore is a filmmaker that cares about what happens in his country. Then came the buzz around "Farenheit 9/11." I did vote for Bush, but have since felt nothing but betrayal from the administration I gave my vote to. Going to this movie the day it came out was easily one of the best theater experiences I've EVER had. I don't even think it was because the film was done so well, but because of the controversy surrounding it. I'd never been to a theater and seen news reporters asking why people were seeing it. Let's be honest and up-front about this film. Yes, it's very anti-Bush. I don't believe that's all we're supposed to get out of this film. Moore does deliver several severe punches to not only the Bush administration's credibility, but the credibility of politics in general. The president taking numerous vacations and senators not interested in signing up their children for the armed forces is vivid symbolism on the state of our political system. The other side of this coin is fact that Moore doesn't even mention the democratic party. There could be reasons for this that I don't know. But I think he's more concerned with getting out of this war than debating where we'd be if Gore got elected or the so-called "greatness" that is Kerry. Here's more honesty. No, this film is not UN-American. If anything, this film is one of the most American films I've ever seen. This is the ONLY way this material could've ever been put together. If this were a news story, it would have more spin on it than the Harlem Globetrotters could ever put on a basketball. This is free speech at it's finest. What better way to use free speech than to question those who run your country? Lila Lipscomb learned how to question her nation the hard way. There's a scene in the film where you see her walking around the White House that I feel is the film's best. She's one of the many reasons that people should go see this film.Another honest note, this film may not change your political views. In fact, this film spoke to me in volumes about why I should pay more attention to politics and to whom I may vote for. More than anything, I believe that the film should be seen because of that and not because it's so anti-Bush. I voted for the guy and I regret it just as much as I did before the movie, no more, no less. Besides, how can it change your views when it only points out the doings of the bad guy without looking at the other option.Here's the last thing I want to say. Before seeing this film, I'd never seen a standing ovation for a film in the theater that was not a repertory release. The crowd I saw this with, including myself, stood for 5 minutes. This film will stick in my memory for a long time. Along with "Schindler's List", "Pulp Fiction", "The Passion Of The Christ", and "ET", this is one of the few, truly important films that I've had the chance to see in the theater. Sure, I could've mentioned other films that I've seen in my short lifetime so far, but the ones I did mention are some of the truly elite. This is a film that everyone should see, even Bush supporters.</fullReview>

Innuedos, half-truths, things taken out of context, viciousness, and outright falsehoods do not only not make a good documentary- they are despicable and reprehensible. I don't always agree with President Bush on everything, but I do mostly on the war on terrorism, tax-cutting, and other things- and if you don't, speak responsibly and respectfully, not like this slanderous film, which will not come close to standing the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before we launched that star crossed excursion into madness we call the war on terrorism (or Iraq, pick one), I urged every living American to see Gillo Porticorvo's "Battle of Algiers." It's without a doubt the greatest movie ever made about insurgency, guerrilla movements, colonialism and the madness of trying to occupy a foreign country.Most Americans, of course, never heard of "Battle of Algiers," and even if they had, most Americans don't go to movies with subtitles on the bottom of the screen, so only a handful of Americans have ever seen that 1965 masterpiece.So along comes Michael Moore, a documentary filmmaker known for his leftist leanings and he manages to make a little documentary about what happened to America after 9/11. Everyone is going to see it, or at least, a lot of people will see it. Why? Well, in part because those who tried to stop the film's release, distribution, screenings, etc., have, of course, given it more free publicity than any film since,well, since "The Passion of the Christ."Anyway, there isn't much to say about "9/11." It is probably not the greatest documentary ever made and, although it doesn't bash Bush nearly as much as I thought it might, it is just one version of what went on in the days since the collapse of the world trade center.But it does point up some unhappy, troubling problems with our government. One is that our elected officials don't always do their job, like reading the Patriot Act before voting on it, or maybe making sure that the poor,the non-white and the luckless aren't the only people we send to war. As a proud veteran, I can only scream that one of the biggest mistakes America ever made was ending the draft. The day the kid from Beverly Hills has just as much chance of getting his behind shot off as the kid from East LA, we will have fewer wars.The movie also does a pretty interesting job in detailing the Saudi,Bush connection and raises those old, troubling questions about why relatives of Osama bin Laden were allowed to flee America two days after the attacks, when nobody else in the country could even fly.In the end, though, it is a congressman who wins the best actor award for this film. Moore goes to the capitol to try to get congressmen to suggest that their sons to go to Iraq, after discovering that only one person in all of congress has anyone serving there.He stops one Congressman who looks pleasantly surprised to see him and fairly friendly, until he realizes what Moore is asking. The freeze frame on his incredulous face is worth the price of a movie ticket all by itself.Go see this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw this movie, I didn't know much about the war on terrorism or on Iraq. This movie woke me up and had a particularly strong impact on my beliefs in our government. Michael Moore is a smart guy, no matter how fat he is, and proves his point well. I'd name it the best documentary ever, and hope it changes people's views.Who can forget Lisa sobbing as she read the last letter her son sent her before he crashed, or when she visits the White House and stands there sobbing in front of it, letting out all her hatred?Who can forget George W. Bush stammering in all of his shots are repeating things he just said, tagging him redundant? The most memorable part is when Moore confronts the congress members on the street and asks them if they would be interested in enrolling their children in the army. Of course, none of them do.This is the most powerful documentary in America and I give it a full out 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is a landmark film in American cinema. It is a very detailed and well-crafted critique on the Bush Administration from the day he was voted to be our next President to the present day with the war in Iraq. Moore does not shy away from his own opinion and presents it in a style that allows for the audience to decide for themselves whether or not what he says is the truth. Indeed, the film is completely biased but that doesn't matter because a lot of what Moore says is actually true. He provides us with statistical facts that may appear shocking to the average viewer but is considered to be common knowledge for any full-hearted liberal democrat. This is a serious drama that is told in a satirical way and I say that because the film is actually pretty funny. Clearly, Moore seduces the audience into believing that Bush and the rest of his cabinet are the stupidest people in the world. I mean you see the Attorney General John Ashcroft slick his hair back with his own saliva as he prepares to be interviewed. We also see the stressful work environment of the President of the United States as he takes a vacation to his Texas ranch. These shots are meant to influence the audience into believing that Bush has no idea what the hell he's doing and that he shouldn't have been President in the first place. But in a way that's not funny because America is run by a four-star idiot. Moore takes us on a journey into Bush's political mindset since 9/11 and we realize that he is so corrupted by the idea of supreme power that he loses focus on the American people. Moore believes that Bush cares about his own interests rather than the interests of the American people and has manipulated the people into siding with whatever he does. This film is mainly a propaganda picture for people who have no idea about the corruptive nature of the Bush administration, from their business collaboration with the Bin Laden family to the guarantee of economic profit for Bush's defense company with the manufacturing of a war with Iraq. You cannot be a liberal if you don't admire the vision of Michael Moore with 'Fahrenheit 9/11'. But you also don't have to be a liberal and stil admire this work of art. Moore doesn't simply focus on the severe strain provided by the Bush administration but rather the feelings and emotions of the American people. Moore's interview with the woman from Flint, Michigan is both powerful and engaging and we realize that soldiers are dying in Iraq for no good reason. That is the point of Fahrenheit 9/11. This war is being fought for nothing and if we don't do something about it, then America will fall in the end. If anything, this film is patriotic in nature and encourages people to seek the truth. Moore loves America and is a true patriot. But since the whole country is ignorant of what Bush is doing, we are unable to see it. Those who elected to keep Bush in the White House for the next four years are ignorant of the truth. That is the real sad part of 'Fahrenheit 9/11'. Even though the film is biased, it it still poignant and genuine and deserves consideration for Best Picture. Michael Moore is a talented filmmaker and definitely does not fail with this film.

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie with my fianc. She fell asleep halfway through the movie because of how boring it was. I must confess, I find Michael Moore to be a very annoying, obnoxious person, but I still watch his movies with an open mind. I found Roger and Me to be a very good movie, Bowling for Columbine to be entertaining (although I did not agree with Moore's viewpoints in it), and Canadian Bacon a very good satire, but I did not like this movie I was expecting a lot more out of this, as there was a lot of buildup about how controversial it is. All he does is show clips of George Bush, and continue to speculate and attack him, for the first half of the movie which was very slow moving. It started to get a little bit more interesting towards the end, but I still would not recommend this to anyone.**Spoiler Alert**What really sickens me about Michael Moore, is that he shows people that have bad things happen to them in Roger and Me, Bowling and this film, than the last few minutes he tries to make himself look like a hero for saying things to powerful people (Roger, Charlton Heston and congressmen), as if he is the only person who does anything good in society. It is almost like these movies are to increase his large ego to show people what a great person he is. His films (regardless of whether you agree with his political views) are good in the sense that they get people talking, but I would like to see what it is Michael Moore does with the profits. He makes reference to Bush profiting from oil companies, and indirectly from 9/11, but he is profiting from 9/11, just as he did from the Columbine tragedy by making a movie that made a lot of money. I will really feel upset if this movie wins an Oscar for best picture or best documentary (Supersize me was a better movie). 1 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why are Republicans afraid to see this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched it and what really hit me was that Bush was himself... Not an actor. Why are our veterans being forgotten, you never hear of how the guys that come back in pieces are doing. I never understood why we went to Iraq and now I'm even more confused. I feel that if any one believes that our president is out for our best interest as a country why are they not willing to see this movie. People say its fabricated, how can You fabricate what people are saying and how they react to valid questions? I appraise Michael Moore for his hard work and dedication to getting us some truth that we as Americans, republicans and democrats, deserve. If you feel this movie is not in my opinion important, then it is your loss. Why, if you have any doubt of authenticity go to the veterans who are in the hospitals that nobody hears about. Yes the movie has gory spots but we need to know whats going on, at least I do. I applaud Mr. Moore for his efforts to let us all know how it is. This is not a movie, it's REALITY in its truest form!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it any surprise?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not a bit surprised by what Michael Moore shows in "Fahrenheit 9/11". Specifically, I had assumed since September 11, 2001, that this was all true (although not until this documentary came out did I know about Bush getting Osama bin Laden's relatives out of the country).Now, I know that the world's right-wing ideologues want to say that none of what Moore shows has any relation to fact. Well, I have a few questions for these right-wingers: can Rush Limbaugh deny that the Saudis bailed Bush out when his business went bankrupt? Can Bill O'Reilly deny that the Republicans would have practically burned Clinton alive had he done any of what Bush has done since 9/11? Can Sean Hannity deny that we STILL haven't caught Osama bin Laden almost five years after the Twin Towers came crashing down? The fact remains that Michael Moore always interviews the people who get affected the most by these events, and does a hilarious job with it. The very fact that the Bush administration never responded to anything shown in "Fahrenheit 9/11" just shows that they can't because they know that Moore would show them for what they are.All in all, this is the documentary that I recommend above all others. It just might save democracy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those Who Can't Do, Criticize</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself a fair-minded, open-minded individual who stands *100%* behind *neither* the Republican nor the Democratic party. I do not believe it is possible to agree completely with any one political candidate or party on every single issue. The best, I think, you can hope for is to agree with a politician on maybe eight out of ten issues. Even then, if you do, and vote for him or her, you're still voting for two things you don't believe in. I was not for Bush in the beginning, but once he became my President, he became my President. And, I support my President regardless of whether I had wanted him to win or not win the office.I was never doing cartwheels over Bill Clinton. Still, it bothered me greatly when I saw and heard a bloated windbag like Rush Limbaugh making a career out of mercilessly riding Bill and Hillary with such a mad obsession.I kept asking, "If a man has the answer to every one of the country's problems, like Limbaugh obviously does, why isn't *he* the President?" The answer is quite simple: Those who can't do, criticize. If Limbaugh's life -- or his drug money -- depended on it, he could never make a better President than Bill Clinton was.Meanwhile, as disturbing as parts of this "Fahrenheit" movie are, they don't come close to matching the sheer terror I feel when I try to imagine what this country, and in fact the entire world, might be like today had Al Gore become the President of the United States in 2000. That terror is matched only by the frightful thought of what the world might be like down the road had John Kerry won that election last month! What a relief that we chose the leader who can't talk over the talker who can't lead!Michael Moore knows how to make films. He knows all about the structure and construction of a documentary -- pacing, lighting, editing, the use of music in film, etc, etc. But, he doesn't know the first thing about being the President of the United States. That's why he has never been and never will be the President -- those who can't do, criticize, remember? I will admit that at least, this windbag has a sense of humor.This film is for you if you have no appreciation whatsoever of what must be the most difficult job in the entire world and even less love and respect for America . . . and if you care only to mock and ridicule its leader. And, of course, if you're the type of person who would throw lighter fluid on a burning house, you will love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfair 'n' trite 9/11</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's see, Michael Moore uses his friendship with his political allies, the Weinstein brothers, to finagle financing out of a movie studio which made it clear that it did not want their money or name attached to his project. Relying on his usual modus operandi -- half-truths, ambush journalism and deceptive editing -- he makes a "documentary" that he openly, indeed, boastfully promises to be one-sided propaganda. When FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is finished he contrives a couple of make-believe scandals designed to create controversy and publicity. When the film gets an "R" rating from the MPAA, he advises teenagers to lie to get into the film because it is so special (and because it will add to his box office profits). And when anybody objects to his film or his techniques, he begins to whine about censorship -- and threatens legal action. And what is the ultimate point of Moore's dubious documentary? To question the honesty, integrity and ethics of President George W. Bush. Now, admittedly the actions of a President are more important than the shenanigans of a two-bit sideshow huckster like Moore, but even so, how can people -- and the media -- blindly accept the deceptive rantings of a publicity hound who will resort to any dishonesty to tell "the Truth?"As for the film itself, it is a godawful mess on so many levels. Moore basically plays a sloppy game of connect-the-dots, stretching to create links between people and events in a way that sometimes make a little sense, but just as often insults one's intelligence. "A" is related to "B" who knows "C" -- therefore "C" must be held accountable for what "A" has done. Huh? Thus, he drones on suggesting, but offering no proof, that Bush and the bin Laden families were somehow in cahoots with Osama. Does he have any evidence beyond vague insinuations and smug innuendoes? No. He can't make a genuine connection, but he beats the issue to death anyway.Moore persistently harps on the assumed culpability of the Saudis in the pre-and-post-9/11 events, yet he skims over the activities of Al-Qaida and just ignores Saddam Hussein. (Ousting Saddam was a Bush victory, and therefore unimportant.) Instead, in one of the film's most grotesque manglings of reality, Moore's vision of pre-war Iraq is of sunny skies and pristine cityscapes full of happy children flying kites. All the better to imply that the U.S. went to Iraq for the expressed purpose of murdering children. Iraq's history as a violent, ruthless terrorist state under Hussein is completely denied. Iraq's history is noted only to suggest that President Bush engineered the entire war as an elaborate way to avenge his father, George senior. How stupid can you get? The film does have a few effective moments. For instance, the attacks of 9/11 are presented on the soundtrack only, with a blackened screen. The sounds of destruction are awesome. But, one should ask, why don't we see any of the actual footage of the planes hitting the Twin Towers or the myriad people who were injured in the attack? Especially, since Moore offers up gory, graphic images of Iraqi citizens injured in the war. Could it be because he knows that powerful 9/11 images inspire sympathy for the US and that is the last thing he wants? Moore scores easy points showing the victims of war, particularly Lila Lipscomb, a Michigan woman whose son dies in the war. An enthusiastic supporter of the military, she turns against Bush and the war after losing her son. Her scenes are heartbreaking and genuine. Yet, would she be in this film if her patriotism had remained strong? Moore might argue he is giving her a voice in his film; but just as likely Moore is callously exploiting her grief to perpetuate his agenda. Her scenes are touching, yet crude and tasteless. Moore has no shame.Moore's hypocrisy extends to his use of American soldiers. He is coldly condescending toward individual soldiers (when they talk about going to war), but he switches gears and shows us injured soldiers as victims (not of Iraqi forces, but, as Moore tries to imply, of the American government). Having learned from the Vietnam anti-war movement, Moore doesn't want to alienate people by being anti-soldier, just anti-American. But he desperately wants to make the Iraqi conflict a matter of race, so he also tries to perpetuate the myth that war singles out minorities for battle, neglecting to note that enlistment is a voluntary act and that the majority of faces in is own war footage are white. Ironically, Moore engineers several "photo ops" with "the common people" to establish is proletariat credentials, even as he mocks Bush for doing the same thing.And, of course, Bush is his main target. In one cheap shot after another, Moore selectively uses sound bites and micro-mini snippets of film to sew together crazy-quilt monologues of what he wants Bush to say. The editing machine has always been Moore's weapon of choice, allowing those who support him long, uninterrupted monologues, while hacking together Frankenstein-like mosaics of Moore's design to misrepresent his opponents. When such editorial violence fails, Moore then tells us "what Bush must be thinking" at any given moment, basically playing satanic ventriloquist. Apparently, when Moore can't misquote or misdirect, he simply finds it convenient to fantasize. When Moore isn't lying through his teeth, he lies through other people's teeth. You don't expect fairness and honesty from Michael Moore, he long ago made it clear that he has no use for professional ethics. So, he doesn't like Bush and company and will do anything to smear them. Okay, that's a given. The appalling thing about FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is that it is so incredibly poorly made, yet is getting overwhelming praise from the media. Things no self-respecting journalist or editor should ever tolerate are being given a rubber-stamp of approval in Moore's case because "it is getting people talking." Fuzzy logic, sloppy arguments and research, personal paranoia, lame satire, manipulative editing, and the orchestration of self-serving publicity stunts, all add up to journalistic incompetence, at best, and libel, at worst. Yet, by playing the poor-little-me victim of supposed censorship, Moore has manipulated the press into gathering around him to create a protective shield, even as Moore shows nothing but contempt for their professional standards. Should the press demand honesty from our political leaders? Certainly. Should they demand the same thing from their fellow "journalist?" Even more so. When bad journalism gets praised, the standards and credibility of all journalism drops. Moore isn't a threat to President Bush, he's a threat to very media that seems so willing to deify him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly not liberal tripe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but tripe nonetheless. Read the previous comments -- one of the viewers was quite correct -- Moore is masterful in spinning his web and in omitting truth that a lot of people like to want to ignore for whatever purposes (and I'll admit the entire political spectrum is filled with idiots like these). If I may make an addendum, Moore is also a master is speaking out of both sides of his mouth, expressing sympathy for the poverty-stricken U.S. soldier while painting them as stupid savages at the same time. This work is no different than the rest of Moore's previous documentaries in that it's a farce of film-making. He throws out fact after fact after fact and only occasionally stumbles upon the truth (such as the desire of many conservative Republicans to use a tragedy like 9/11 to further their own political means) though I somehow doubt this is intentional. Moore's greatest gift, however, (and I'll admit he's been given it in abundance) is his knack for furthering controversy and havoc in a way so that he can turn a profit -- this film has little to do with the Bush presidency, or Saudi ties to the Bush family, or Haliburton, or Harken, or anything else mentioned in the movie so much as it has to do with Moore's desire to bring attention to himself, feed the hatred and distrust of both sides of the political spectrum (liberal and conservative), and turn a quick buck out of it. I have no doubt that this movie is headed toward an Oscar nomination, and would even wager it being bestowed with an Academy Award in the documentary field; however, the fact that awards have already been presented to this which flies in the face of the true raison d'etre of film (art for art's sake) sickens me quite a bit less than the fact that I just contributed $7.50 to Moore's personal funds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fahrenheit 9/11 NOT a documentary but political satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the movie by Michael Moore, "Fahrenheit 9/11." Why did I go? I went to see the movie instead of reading bit and pieces about it. The audience was mostly a group of age 45 plus on a Monday afternoon. About 100 people were there. About half clapped at the end of the movie and one person stood up to clap. On the Internet Movie Data Base site some people told stories of their experience at the movie. One person told how a woman sitting near by got up 30 minutes before the film ended and told her husband as she walked out that she was sorry she voted for Bush in 2000. When people accept what Moore has been propagandizing against Bush, the election in November will even more difficult and divisive. Many people may believe, as the gospel, what Moore believes. I feel Michael Moore manipulated the facts for his own political purposes. The problem is when people watch something that is suppose to be a documentary they believe it is the truth. When Moore interjects his own editorial and very opinionated comments, it ceases to be a documentary. When someone produces a documentary one expects the producer to be fair in examining the issues and then draw conclusions. I feel Michael Moore was not objective in his presentation of 'Fahrenheit 9/11.' He only produced the film to present his own biased political views. Moore's political agenda is to defeat George W. Bush in the general election. It could be described as one long political advertisement against George Bush by a political action committee. To be objective why did Moore not show scenes of ethnic Kurds lying dead in the streets from being gassed by Saddam Hussein's army? Why did Moore not show scenes of Saddam Hussein having political opponents being executed by a firing squad? The History Channel did in a show, Monday, June 28, 2004, on 'Iraq's Warring Factions.' There was no objectivity in the Moore film.The film should be labeled as 'political satire,' not as a documentary. Joe Scarborough on his show 'Scarborough Country' of Monday, June 28, 2004, presented an interesting quote from Michael Moore in the New York Times. He read this to a guest on the show, 'I want to read you what Michael Moore said. This is what the 'New York Times' David Brooks quoted him saying in England about the special U.S.-British relationship: 'You're stuck with being connected to this country of mine which is known for bringing sadness and misery to places around the globe.' Of course, he also said, 'Americans are possibly the dumbest people on the planet. Our stupidity is embarrassing.' It certainly sums up Michael Moore.</fullReview>

Although no one would mistake the director for being a Republican, it's not by far a partisan movie in the traditional sense, since Democratic propaganda is missing at all. On the contrary, it also tells about Democrat's hesitation and faults. The basic idea is that GOP told only lies on what happened before and after September the eleventh. Great motion picture, it lets facts talk, only facts. Were I American, I'd be mad at the White House, since they hide the whole truth and gave a false way on the tragedy, using the the tragic events for developing an anti-terrorist hysteria among the people and for justifying a war that got nothing to do with war on terror.

		<fullReview>SOME SPOILERS A mixed bag from Oscar winner Michael Moore coming after his highly entertaining Bowling For Columbine. The first half of Moore's incendiary anti-Bush film is largely lacklustre, to say the least. Focusing on Bush's connections with the Saudi royal family, it's hard to determine what his point is, and for the better part of an hour, Moore spurts out unconvincing facts and theories about this apparently diabolical relationship. Just what he's trying to say is unclear, and borders on incoherence. Not all of the first hour is wasted- the scene of Bush sitting in a classroom is quite bewildering, and the 9/11 segment is tastefully, and movingly, done. There are also some amusing, albeit cheap, laughs to be had from Bush, and his cronies, in this segment too, but for the most part the first half is dull, unconvincing, and maddingly unfulfilling. When it gets to Iraq, it's a whole other story. It's in turns infuriating, upsetting, disturbing, and staggering. Highlights, if you can call them that, are footage of a heart-broken conservative mother who has lost her son; footage on disenfranchised, corrupt, or just plain lost soldiers; footage of despairing Iraqi civilians; and, in Moore's home town of Flint, Michigan, footage of two recruitment officers going after everyone who's of the right age, relentlessly trying to persuade innocent young adults to join the army, no matter what their real ambitions may be.  Moore's narration in this segment is also significantly more poignant than in the previous one, his final words being both eloquent, and so very true. It's a biased documentary to be sure; it only shows one side of the story, but so what? Their are other, more valid, more important criticisms of Moore's film, which is almost forgiven for it's unremarkable first half with an absolutely harrowing final one...but not quite. In the end, it's a good film, and an important one, but a flawed one.***1/2/*****</fullReview>

Regardless of your political leanings, it makes you think - that is unless you are one of those blindly devoted to Bush and co.

What does "They hate our freedom" mean? I still haven't figured that one out.I am an independent - i.e. a swing voter in today's parlance. However watching mutilated bodies of small children due to the bombing, just so some defence company can offload excess inventory makes one wonder about the "moral leadership" we keep screaming about at the top our lungs.If I may wear my philosopher's hat for a moment, Corruption is an evil we need to live with - it can never be completely wiped out. But when innocent children get blown up just to further one's agenda - now that is true evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a documentary it is damaged by Moore's overbearing presentation and twisting of the facts but his basic message is clear and speaks for itself ? something really stinks up there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A documentary film that takes us back to Moore's memories (dreams?) of an election won by Al Gore, which then was actually won by Bush. With a struggling start to his Presidency, Bush then spends over 40% of his time officially on vacation and appears to be losing the peoples' support ? but then the buildings fell down. From this point onwards we are told how he attacked Afghanistan on his way to Iraq, all in the name of business, oil and the shady connections he, his family and his colleagues have with the Saudi royals, big business and others. Moore uses stunts, interviews and video footage to present his case.It is difficult to review this film and keep your politics out of it, and too many reviews on this site have a) hated the film because they disagree with it or b) they love it because they hate Bush, but I'll try to review the film. However ? just to get it out of the way, I am not a Bush fan and, while I am glad Saddam is gone, I am against the war and the lies and deceit (ref: Butler report) that I was told to justify it. That out of the way, Moore is a bit of a strange beast to me ? his books always interest me and open my eyes a bit but then they blow it by becoming rants which are as much spin as Butler tells us the case for war in the UK was. Sadly that is the case here, but let me list the good things first. The film opens well, letting the facts (footage) speak for itself and Moore's decision to let the September 11th attack occur on a black screen and on people's faces is much more effective than showing the footage itself, at this point I cried a bit for the first of two times. However this does not make for a case ? it just plays our emotions; what does make a good case is letting the people hang themselves ? for example footage that shows the bonds between the various people in the world is frightening; footage of staff saying Iraq has no weapons etc (in 2001) is well contrasted with footage in 2002 saying they have weapons and are a major threat etc. All this works very well because it lets the people expose themselves ? even a Bush voter would struggle to justify such a big swing from 'no weapons' to 'imminent threat' ? and the film only backs up what we have heard the Butler Inquiry conclude this week.Footage of the war itself is also powerful ? and I can only imagine the impact in the US, at least we in the UK have a more open news media (as highlighted by the BBC being the only source that covered Bush meeting the Taleban) and we have seen many images. However even I was unprepared for the sight of soldier's bodies, burnt Iraqi's, dead babies etc. Again, you could say he is using our emotions but I think he was flatly presenting a reality of war that isn't the flag waving advancements that we fed on the news (and I have seen what passes for 'news' in the US). However Moore doesn't trust his material to speak for itself ? and this is the where the film weakens its impact and its appeal across political beliefs. He rants. He exaggerates. He takes liberties with the truth. He is not a documentary maker ? he is not impartial and fair, he is a man with a banner. The best examples are scenes where he really overdoes it or puts his own opinion over the facts. We are all amazed by the fact that Bush sat reading a kids' book while the towers were burning ? but I do not know what he was thinking, but Moore reckons he does ? sure he presents it as suggestion, but he never suggest that maybe, just maybe, Bush was presenting a strong face to the country in a time of crisis. Later Moore shocks us with image of 'our boys' ? who are mostly very young, a little headstrong and certainly out of their depth and it is hard to support the war when we see them torn limb from limb ? but I didn't need a widow marched up to the White house to cry, that was upsetting but cheap. Happily Moore only made me angry at him once, and that was in his lazy, insensitive and na?ve depiction of an Iraq of playing children, weddings and happy couples ? yes this footage is real but the suggestion that this is a happy country attacked by a cruel US is just lazy ? the truth makes Moore's case more complex but no less powerful. Does he not trust his material to be strong enough without him spinning it in his favour? Did we also needs cheap footage of Bush etc preparing for interviews, or fixing their hair etc ? some of it works but some is just cheap ways of making them look silly without putting any effort into it.He does this too much and I know many will dismiss the whole film as a result, but I am an adult and am able to come to a film and make my own mind up. I know when I am seeing things and when I am being told things. I also disliked Moore's overuse of 'normal' people's opinions ? he presents them as fact but they have no more validity than different opinions held by other 'normal' people. However what the film does very well is to leave the audience with an uncomfortable feeling that something stinks and, for all Moore's cheap tricks I was left with a feeling of indignation. I did not realize that people opposed the election but could not get a single Senate member to support them; I did not realize the connection between Bush and the man who decided that Fox should give the election to Bush; I did not realize the connections between Haleburton (sp) and the Bush administration and I did not realize the fact that all the Bin Laden family were escorted out ? without so much as a question asked. In passing, this is another example of Moore pushing it ? the Bin Laden evacuation did occur but there is no proof that it actually occurred while planes were shut down. For my money, a film like this should not be made because there should be no need for it ? I should not be surprised by the connections because my news network should be telling me these things ? it is a shame on them that they are not.This film won the top prize at Cannes and I find it laughable that QT said it did so on its merits as a piece of cinema! However what the film did well is to present a situation that stinks ? it stinks to high heaven. Moore does not stick to the facts and he does not give balanced views but the Bush government has certainly not given us anywhere near a balanced view and I am amazed that some people just dismiss the whole film as 'propaganda' and are not even stimulated by it at all! This is a flawed film and Moore is not a documentary maker in the sense of the word as I see it, but, even if you only take in a quarter of the film then something still stinks really bad. I don't know if this film will change the minds of people who were going to vote Bush because I think Moore is so one-sided in his presentation that he ends up only really singing to the choir?but the basic notes to that song are hard to ignore and really, really hard to accept without feeling rather sick. Moore doesn't tell us what it is ? but something is definitely rotten in Denmark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a must-see for every American. Those denouncing the film, many of whom haven't even seen it, are the same sad sacks who think that Fox News is really "fair and balanced". This is Moore's best film to date, and he went to great lengths to assure that everything in the movie is factual. If he told any lies in this movie, trust me, the Wall Street Journal and the rest of the right wing media would be all over it. I don't agree with all of Moore's conclusions, but I do agree that George W. Bush is the worst president this country has had since Richard Nixon.See this movie! Those of us who have followed the news closely over the last four years will not be surprised by the facts presented here, but most people (like my brother) will be shocked to learn the extent of Bush's incompetence, corruption, and hypocrisy. We must vote this guy out of office in November. If you aren't registered, do so. And vote November 2nd! Take our country back!"Fahrenheit 9/11" will stand as a powerful document of this point in history. You don't have to agree with everything in it, but it does force you to confront the harsh realities of war and politics. For that I give it 10 out of 10****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A biased view of the biased view we have been shown?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I just wanted to add my two cents. It is early Tuesday morning now, and I saw this film Friday night; the subject matter as well as the construction of the film itself have had a profound effect on everyone I know who has seen it, which is probably why I am committing my thoughts to IMDb at 1 am.The film as a creature is a wickedly beautiful thing, and its blemishes only render it more attractive. First, if anyone is dying to know, I went into the film having ALWAYS been against the war in Iraq (from the moment sometime in 2002 I found out it was already planned). Secondly, continuing my confessional, my greatest fear from 9/11 on was always along the lines of "what short-sighted and dangerous things are we going to do in retaliation?"Still, a long time had passed since my most radical days (not as radical as I once thought- and an even longer time since my most conservative days), and I try to be reasonable and rational in how I view things. Yes, I am a liberal. I view complicated things such as international relations or rationale for war as complicated things, and shy away from bumper-sticker politics (or religion for that matter). While I have been derided in the past for the whole "it's complicated" argument, I believe it is a necessity to understand complexity before one can make a good decision. But decisions do need to be made, sometimes before all the facts are in, and I respect a person who can make an informed decision quickly and follow through with it.And this is what makes the timing of this film so potent- Moore is trying to show that Bush was not as decisive as he has been portrayed as, and that the decisions he made were very poor (at best). Moore has hopes that in November his viewers accept his vision and reject Bush's call to stay the course.Does the film achieve its goals? Only time will tell, but from what I saw of the sold-out audiences in "Bush-country" SC (the GOP's words, not mine), it might. IS IT FAIR in its methods? The question itself is loaded, because as much as the right is trying to portray Moore as a conceited, prankstering, America-bashing, rich 'liberal media' elite, the administration really holds all of the cards (influencing lawmaking, controlling the military, issuing executive orders, controlling access, etc), and does a decent job of projecting the image it wants to show. Fahrenheit 9/11 probably could justifiably be labeled as propaganda. Even though most of the facts are true (I honestly can't say I know all are), the film is engineered to show you one side of the story. The truly brilliant aspect of the film is that it reminds the viewer that what we are getting from The White House is also a show (down to the spit-slicked hair), and equally one-sided. In other words, propaganda. Any patriotic American should encourage poking holes in propaganda, whether it originates from a film-maker from Flint, or our head of state. One aside: (SPOILER?) In my mind, the most effective visual of the entire film was the blacked-out screen which was paired with the audio of the aircraft striking the WTC. Even though no image was projected, I am sure everyone saw the exact same image in their mind's eye, for we have all seen the same replays of 9/11 until they have permanently burned into our retinas and collective memory. We all remember 9/11; Moore wants to show us what he saw happen both before and after those tragic events.While part of me wishes for the most straightforward documentary possible on the matter at hand, another part of me realizes that dream is impossible. An 'unbiased' film would not drum up as much interest as this film has, and one could (I would) argue that a less biased film would fail to raise the questions we need to discuss leading up to this upcoming presidential election, which promises to be a referendum on Bush's leadership.Go see it, and love it or hate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is unbelievably good!!! Michael Moore succeeds in uncovering the secrets politicians and the media are desperately trying to keep us away from. He is showing how the United States Government basically created a war just because they wanted to- they just decided that it made all the sense in the world to trade Iraki lives for some oil. The movie also showed the distance Americans have from the war and the devastating effects that political decisions have on ordinary lives. Moore also proved that it was possible to lie to half of the nation and get away with it- and that in US politics you have to play dirty to get votes. The most important asset of the movie is that it is showing facts, but in a specially edited way so that one can really put the two and two together! After I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 me and my whole family got into a very emotional discussion- this movie is an excellent summery of all the news we hear every day but don't bother to think about. Michael Moore is a genius- everybody should see his masterpiece!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A key film of the new century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking an unruly mass of information, many stories with multiple strands, presenting facts and establishing connections new to the general populace, and somehow weaving all this into something as crystal clear and concise as a world book article ?yet still personal, retaining its maker's voice? is indeed the feat of a master film maker aborning. This, even his staunchest foes will have a hard time denying in light of the teeming vitality and admirable dress-down virtuosity of the film. Michael Moore has matured into a master film maker this trip out. The first half of the film, especially, is an intoxicating Welles-like collage (reminiscent of Welles' F for Fake) of fragments from all media. Moore gives the participants enough rope here, as it were, letting them trip themselves up time and again in their own amateurish contradictions. You get a foretaste of the masterfully expansive pacing of the piece ?and some of the films most darkly funny moments? during the first few minutes, as you catch privileged glimpses of the all the dramas main players preening candidly with spittle and comb, powder puff and pancake for their hour upon the stage. Clearly, they understand that this is theater. This is The Big Time, Baby! ?Bring it on! Despite the yelping of critics, what Moore says about these players certainly could be no more biased than their own brazen stab at "reality-craft," as acidly revealed by him during the course of Fahrenheit. The film eventually merges into a second film, as it were, a disturbing meditation on the death of those close to you, and on man's inhumanity to man, the horror of war and occupation. The last half of Fahrenheit is harrowing and nightmarish, a collage of maimed and bloody soldiers and civilians, and midnight home break ins with interrogations by flashlight, at the point of a rifle, with a chorus of screaming and praying women in the background. Moore poses the question (and it takes a great deal of objectivity to grasp the objectivity of this question, apparently): Who are the bad guys in this scenario? At what point do well-intentioned, freedom-loving liberators, worn down and wearied by battle, succumb to the dark side of their souls and become like their worst portrayal of their enemy? This is not a new question by any means. But Moore makes it compelling and pertinent for our time.As an experience, Fahrenheit 9/11 is many things: exhausting, laugh-out-loud funny, profound, emotionally draining, dark and ultimately stupefying. It is epic. No film will stir and involve you as much.Ten stars. Highest commendation. Genuinely genius film making. See it.</fullReview>

Well, most of time I got lost by his luxury words, but I try hard to understand what is he points.From what I can understand, I agree with his critics on movie, but his view on Moore is more significant rather than the movie itself (you can read it by yourself at the link to slate.com -- search it by yourself).In the end if article, Hitchens seems to imply that the situation in middle east is better after than before. Are they? Do U.S.A really have the right to invade every country that doesn't fit with their value of "democracy"?Moore, with his documentary, contain a propaganda that wants people to see that war or fighting is not the only solution to the problem. There is nothing wrong to be pacifist you know that Hitchens?And I can't write a review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>/\/\/\/\/\. If this movie was a wave it would look like that. The movie is a very frequent truth, lie, truth, lie with a sudden over elaborated and exaggerated opinionated statement. Its better off if you just watch the whole movie through while its muted. Now, I am not totally against the movie. It does show some interesting points that I did take into account. But most of them were scenes that were shown were Micheal Moore was not talking. I believe that everyone is deceiving some way. George Bush is a person with high power that puts fear and lies into peoples face. (to Micheal Moore). But also, Micheal Moore is doing the exact same thing, and with his already nice filmography behind him. He already has a pretty high power as well. More than the average man. The movie really needs to see that almost all presidents are pretty corrupted in the United states and have all had their controversy. Some worse than others, Some really bad at hiding it. But let this be known, The more we blind people about sitting on the right side of the seesaw while Micheal Moore tries to pull you to the left side of the seesaw. The real solution of the problem is the middle of the seesaw. When the person on the right side of the seesaw is on the ground the person on the right side cant see the ground on the other side and vice-versa. The only way too see both sides is to stay in the middle. You cant expect change when you try to step in the same river twice. It wont happen. Case in point, this movie is right, this movie is wrong. It gets a 5/10 you are better off not watching it or watching it while muted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who am I: Smart or Sentimental??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore thrives as within the complexities of mixed interests, contradictory opinions, strange facts, propaganda, complacency, blatant lies (you will just believe it all as the liars look you straight in the eyes and scare you to death with terror talk...), and much more which still makes it hard to make sense of the scope of things that just did not seem to add up with the Bush administration.Where Bowling for Columbine seemed so much more like genuine (albeit biased) critique on American culture, with Fahrenheit it's hard to know what to believe, as Michael Moore so clearly has a much more political agenda. You feel the need to stay critical while taking up the presented facts at the start of the film, then do some more digging yourself later to fill the gaps and get a chance to put it together yourself to form an opinion. This is what should be the strong side of such a documentary and aided by Moore's comic style (for those who like it) it starts fine.But what happens then? Suddenly halfway through, the movie becomes something completely different and is suddenly all about the highly emotional and subjective points of view of war widows and other individuals who have suffered greatly due to Iraq. This is surely an important story that needs to be told, but the sudden change in story telling in the film just ends up making you aware of the film's propaganda intentions, where the sentiments of these heartfelt stories are used to drive the more cerebral arguments from the start of the film home. Clever emotional manipulation? There are things worth watching in this film, but just beware. The filmmaker did think he was smarter than you when making it, and that's not right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fahrenheit 911</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Fahrenheit 911, I was confused at how this could all be true. The director, Michael Moore, suggested that George Bush was connected to Bin Laden through his companies. Bin Laden was a big investor in a lot of the Bush's companies. The film suggests that Bush overlooked Bin Laden and Saudi Arabia's involvement in the attacks on 9/11 and instead went after Iraq and Afghanistan, who he has held a grudge against. According to Moore, Bush even let twenty-four members of the Bin Laden family to leave the country following the attacks while all other planes were grounded. The family members should have been detained and questions on the whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden. I find the whole idea hard to believe because it seems like there would have been some consequences for Bush if he had really been involved with Bin Laden. Moore does not have any proof of any of this, just his own theories and the motivation to get Bush out of office.The main themes in the film were that Bush was not doing his job as President. Moore showed many clips of Bush on vacation and playing golf right after being brought into office when he should have been having meetings with his secretary of defense and other important departments. He also showed a clip of Bush the morning of the September 11th attacks reading to a group of kids for ten minutes after being notified of the second plane hitting the world trade center. Another major theme of the film was Bush's connection to Bin Laden and Saudi Arabia.This film is not very different from some of Moore's other work. Moore has made many controversial films other than this one such as Roger &amp; Me, Sicko, and Bowling for Columbine. Time Magazine named Moore one of the world's 100 most influential people.I think a lot of Moore's editing was biased. He was only showing one side of the story to help get his point across.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good agitprop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11, by Michael Moore, is yet another example of a potentially talented artist taking the easy way out. There is no doubt that MM has few peers in agitprop, but he has become a magnificent filmmaker, as well. He understands how to truly manipulate an audience without resorting to the cheese of a Steven Spielberg. Evidence of this comes from the fact that the most bravura moment of his latest filmic screed against President George W. Bush comes not from the humanzee grins of our leader- especially in the 7 minutes of paralysis after being told of the attacks, nor the oafish military recruiters he follows about poor urban malls, nor even the distorted ethics of exploiting a grieving mother whose son has died in Iraq or trying to paint the Saddam-era Iraq as a place where carefree children flew kites &amp; all was well- despite over a million bodies in mass graves over the 3 decades of his American-backed rule, but by NOT showing us a replay of the horrific fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11. He understands that the viewers memory of the event will be far more powerful than seeing it, again, for the umpteenth time?. On the + side, the film is at its best when it takes on its own- exposing the utter fallacy of the 'liberal media' during the lead up to &amp; during the war. Rather, Brokaw, Jennings, &amp; co. are shown as the sycophantic corporate daisy-chainers they really are- not once calling the Bush Administration on its, now proved, bevy of lies about the war. Of course, given the recent death &amp; apotheosis of ber-moronic ex-President Ronald Reagan by the media, it's a shame many need MM to state the obvious. Another highpoint is the connection between the fact that it is Bush's American poor &amp; uneducated fighting the Arab world's poor &amp; uneducated- a fact of wars since their start.Instead of being a detailed journalistic 'true documentary' Fahrenheit 9/11 is a disorganized mess of a film, however occasionally brilliant, that has only 1 unifying theme- a hatred for George W. Bush. As admirable as this may be in real life, it does not suffice in reel life. I suspect, though, that reel life is where MM prefers to reside, for their he can solipsistically sneer at the American public he repeatedly (&amp; not wrongly, mind you) derides as being stupid, yet Sisyphanly attempts to sway, even though few of those who should see the film will, &amp; those who do already agree with its tenets. A similar phenomenon occurred earlier this year when it was the Conservatives' turn to rail against what &amp; who they hate with The Passion Of The Christ. Sadly, despite all the wisdom MM wishes to impart to the American people he fails to heed 1 of the oldest nostrums in the book: choose your enemies well, because that's who you'll most likely resemble. &amp; from where I sit, that ain't pretty!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's already been said. Michael Moore comes off as sentimental, and by sentimental I mean to use it as it is defined by Wallace Stevens, who said "Sentimentality is the failure of Feeling." Moore's interview with the victims' family, the hushed voice, the soft gestures, all of it feels done out of propriety more than active and intense empathy, it feels as if he is cautionary when he talks to these people, and that comes off as insincere?So the complaint is one about authenticity, don't make a movie for the sake of a political agenda, make it for the sake of a feeling or conviction which may very well be associated, even causally, with a political agenda, but the political objective should not have a large presence without the underlying, more personal emotion/idea/conviction. The movie is well edited though, especially the ending-- the rhythm and cadence of the very ending is so well done: "For once, Mr. President, you're right."</fullReview>

Moore's politics were not as evident and we were allowed to observed. I kind-a wish Moore and put that in or made a movie about them instead.

It's the oldest trick in the power-grabbing game: divide and conquer. Just take a look at some of the inflammatory comments in this board - spite, intolerance, personal assassination. Yes, Moore has done his own part in this territory - but so does everyone who condemns his/her neighbor for daring to have opposing opinions. In the meantime, there's a third neighbor, waiting....Too bad Moore didn't try to identify that 3rd neighbor.

And some of the things that are revealed in this documentary were pretty 'Oh My God' to say the least. Micheal Moores interpretation of the facts he had and how he used these facts to show what the film is about is simply astonishing. The way its been put together and the soundtrack is all very very well done. When i finnished watching it i almost had a sleepless night just thinking about this film.Its a must must watch even if your not into politics. So many of my friends and family have literally been gob-smacked after watching this film. And down the Pub its probably been the most talked about movie I've ever known, here in the UK.

I especially liked the parody of the opening credits of 'Bonanza'. And it wasn't a work of fiction. You make up your own mind about whether what was said about Bush, Cheney and the others was relevant. It sounds suspicious but might not mean anything. Certain facts were stated which may have been misleading, but of course one can leave out details if a biased view is desired, and what is said will not necessarily be a lie. I didn't care for the violence in the war scenes but I guess it was necessary. And I didn't like the profanity. You can bleep the words and still get the point across.But it was actually less profanity overall than in the same amount of prime-time TV, even if the individual words were more potent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read these post and have to say I'm.......lacking........ I could think of nothing more to define my feeling. "Lacking", sums it quite well.Many of you point out the aspects of "biased". Well, if one person gives their opinion it is naturally biased. This does not make it wrong. This does not make it invalid. This simply makes it worth listening to/reading.The basic theme of this film is a representation of facts. These facts are simply that and not to be challenged. try if you might, yet the truth is documented. The business relationships are fact. The documents shown are fact.I have not seen anything more accurately represented in my life. With that said, I have unlimited respect for M. Moore. To have an opinion is one thing. However, to present hard facts which support said opinion is rare. In fat, it is almost non- existent (particularly in Hollywood).So, if you want to bash this documentary. You are on your own. one thing you may want to consider......what are your facts? What data supports your opinion? How much time, research, and effort have you invested in your opinion? Howmany people have gathered in support of your opinion and if any, why?It is very easy to sit back and tear apart the work of an individual. In fact, it's much easier to tear it apart than to support it. Support takes effort. It takes risk. Supporting something exposes one to the wrath of the masses.M. Moore is a rare individual and I find power in his ability to take a risk. We should all be so bold.Sincerely, Christopher Mars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a quick comment: Michael tried hard to bring in many different people to show that they didn't agree with Bush's approach and stance on the war *against* Iraq. However, because a small sample of people in the movie were used throughout, it does look like the opposition is very small but fervent.I'd suggest that the opposition is much more widely held than was suggested in the film. Otherwise, excellent film in a time when anyone saying something against the government is branded as a traitor, treasoner, etc. Loved the part about black Americans not being supported in Congress concerning the vote count scandal that resulted in Bush's victory over Gore.Can you say, "Keep the Power In the Family"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore does not like George W Bush. That is the main thing that comes across here. This is Moore's best work to date. The footage of the US soldiers in Iraq was one of the scariest things I have ever seen. The public beheading in Saudi Arabia will long stay in my memory. The mother of the dead soldier from Flint( Lila) was also incredibly moving talking about her son. The DVD comes with a second disc full of extras and is well worth seeing. The movie is superbly edited and paced and Moore is much more convincing in his arguments here than in Bowling For Columbine. The running time is over two hours but the time just flies in. Michael Moore has made a stimulating, witty, well-argued film and he certainly does not like George W</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brill Documentary, the hard truth!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Farenheit 9/11 is one excellent documentary from Michael Moore, i also enjoyed Bowling for Columbine but this is much better as it doesn't cover up anything its an uncensored view of the cold hard truth of the whole 9/11 Afganistan/Iraq, 2000 election fixing. Yes it may be a little biased and may not show one good point of approval of Bush's actions from Moore but it is so factual and every minor detail is covered in this to give you an idea of the point that the majority of people and in particular Moore is getting across. I really think it was a bold decision from Moore to include horrific scenes but it works in this documentary it is scenes such as that, that are being covered up and only no in this documentary do the public get to see this. There are many touching scenes such as the lady who lost her son in Iraq, these scenes really do show the hard truth of war and the after effects and Moore covers all of this adequately. Great Documentary 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a very frightening one, not a comedy at all. It starts of with the aftermath of the 2000 election. A group of African American congressman are being cut off by Al Gore who is presiding over the certification of his loss to Bush. Then the events of 9/11 are investigated with scenes of people watching the horror, followed by Bush's ties to the Saudi Arabians. The war in Afghanistan comes next with a controversial allegation that it had a lot to do with a planned oil pipeline. Finally the last part of the film deals with the invasion of Iraq and the suffering it caused among both among Americans as well as Iraqis. The film is a devestating portrait of the sinister connections and incompetence of the Bush administration. Hopefully America will take a turn for the better two weeks from today. If not, we should at least have Michael Moore if you are still permitted to watch his films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally watched it last night, but it didn't show me anything more that I knew already. Seeing it at least with the perspective of the campaign and the 4 debates has only reinforced my own opinions of the facts presented in F-911, as well as what has been released by the independent and foreign press. What strikes me even today is the unwillingness (inability) of working class Republicans (I was a Reagan Republican, btw)to see that the facts are against the best interests of the working class, and poor of America. Before I saw the movie I had already come the the conclusion that the Bush economic strategies were to create more unemployed and underemployed people to encourage enlistment into the armed forces. This is the case in Iraq (50% unemployment, hmmm... Flint was also about 50% also), with Halliburton bringing in cheap labor from Indian, Pakistan, etc... and ignoring probably the most educated and skilled workforce in the Middle East, literally forcing them to enlist in the Iraqi Army out of desperation. High unemployment/underemployment also decreases contribution to Social Security, giving more ammo to privatize SS. Heath Care Savings Accts? Give me break, can you save for even the cost for one nights stay in the hospital? Or a Surgical Procedure? The bottom line is: when you vote the Neo-Con (believe me, BushCo is no Republican) agenda, you're voting against you're best interests as a working class individual, that is, unless you're in the top 2% income bracket. Remember in the movie, Bush's "Base" is the rich and powerful, "elites" he called them. Most of us aren't his "base." Vote your best interests, vote while you still can. If you don't vote your best interests, you may as well fill out an enlistment form after you leave the polls on Nov 2. Me, I'm 44 w/no kids and I work for one of the largest HMOs in the country, either way, I'll be fine 'cept for taxes. It's the rest of the us I'm worried about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore's film has jumped way over a very thin line in today's film making. Haw dare he use this form of blatant mind numbing propaganda! I would have expected something more from someone so intelligent. His previous film, 'Bowling for Columbine', was a work of genius. He highlighted many key problems, particularly in America's controversial Gun Laws. However, watching 'Fahrenheit' has made me and I'm sure many other Americans feel almost ashamed of our nationality. He has done nothing but thrown together as many negative, disturbing images and sound bites together as he can, with the sole aim of shoving Bush from the Presidency this November. He has done nothing but use his fame and position as a well respected and credible author and film maker, to push his own, strong political views into the public eye. I would say in fact, he has used many of the same tactics of 'blinding his audience' with facts as he accuses the Bush administration of doing. How can he sit back condemning Bush, when he is prepared to take advantage of his position in the same way? I struggled with this film. On one hand, it is brilliantly made, the Media Language he uses in it is fantastic, and he truly is an intelligent man. However, my quandary arises with, as I said, the way he is blatantly pushing this film into the minds of his audience. The audience have no choice but to engage with the film. A mark of a great film? In many ways yes, but I fear the highly controversial and disturbing 'truth' in this film has in fact made it a dangerous weapon which will do nothing but harm, particularly to November's elections, but also the way the world views the American people, not just our government. He has made a mockery of us as a people, and in fact betrayed our emotions towards the war; using stories and the grief of poor people who lost family through the conflict in Iraq, or 9/11 itself merely to his own ends. He should be ashamed.The best advice about this film I can give however is to watch it. Make up your own minds. At the end of the day, he is expressing his own opinion, like I have here. Watch it, but watch it with a critical eye, don't allow yourself to be absorbed into the whirlwind of emotions that it creates, but instead look at it from you're own position, not the position it puts you in.</fullReview>

I applaud Michael Moore's work and while not balanced journalism, why should it be? Is there a balance in journalism anywhere? I would fight to the death to defend Michael Moore, but while I live near Camp Pendleton and watched many young Marines go off to Iraq, I knew in my heart, they thought they were doing the 'right' thing. How do you change someone's head? It's the same dichotomy emerging as during the Viet Nam war when the society became bitterly divided, and I'm not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel yet. I hope that all Americans will watch this film and form their own opinions about the truths presented and filtered to us through the media. As a journalist, I learned firsthand, that truth has nothing to do with reporting, and our government of the people usually has nothing to do with the 'people.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this on DVD last night and I have to say that it's one hell of a viewing experience. I'm perfectly well aware that this is no documentary, that it's propaganda (Moore has admitted as much,) but I found it deeply disturbing.The part that really upset me was the Iraq footage (the utter corruption of the Administration being understandable if utterly inexcusable,) the unbelievable destruction and the continuing, disastrous aftermath. At the beginning, the soldiers being interviewed struck me as expressing a more-or-less happy-go-lucky attitude: laughing, talking about their "theme music" while they were firing on the Iraqi positions, etc. Then came the interviews with the sobbing Iraqi survivors of the bombings.After that, we saw the troops being interviewed again, some time into the war (which, the president to the contrary, continues today.) Gone were the cheery smiles: now the voices quavered, there was real fear there and an expression of shock that the Iraqis postwar were still killing our people. And one of the soldiers spoke movingly of how something dies in you when you kill someone else.And then the sobbing American woman reading the last letter home from her son, just before he died in Iraq.I will remember these images forever. And they will be topmost in my mind when I go to the polls in November. What does it say to the supporters of the president that just last week he finally admitted that the WMDs didn't exist, and he released yet another lame excuse for why we went to war? Does it say anything to them?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a powerful documentary. I would recommend the DVD version with special features. The testimony of rice where she tries to use her personality and sophistry to thwart starightforward questions does indeed tell us a lot.To say that the documentary is impartial would be unfair. But then, it is closer to truth as we have come to know. That Michael Moore knew this truth several months before us is a testimony to his credentials.There are some straightforward facts:1. Bush was a nobody before 9/11. 9/11 changed it all.2. There was no WMD in Iraq. Nor was there amything concrete in terms of chemical weapons, or Al-Qaeda connections. There were no hidden terrorists out there in Iraq.3. Bush and his team used the threat perception to their advantage. The Iraq-war was all about oil anyways. And the interests of the President and the Vice-presidents in Iraqi and Saudi affairs are well documented.4. The media is no good anymore. In trying to sound balanced, it has degraded to the level of passivity. The degeneration is shocking.The movie may not be entirely accurate. But it does tell us what we suspected for long, in a brilliant way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I'm from the other side 'Saudi Arabia' talking about your grate Movie Fahrenheit 9/11 movie, I would like to tell you that 85% of the people of Saudi Arabia where against that incident and which we all feel sad for what have happened. I have visited ground 0 this year to be more specific August 30th and felt very sad for the loss which I have been in that building before oh my god that was and still a nightmare for many especially whom lost there love ones. I did like the part "Shine Happy People" it was so hilarious I could not stop laughing when I saw what I saw, any ways you also have talked about the devil in that part of the Movie "Saudi Arabia" I have to criticize that, because Saudi Arabia population around 20 million and I can tell you for sure only the Royal Family are the shine Happy people + the Bin Laden not the Bid Laden as someone misspelled.I wish we can make a documentary on how we are suffering here in Saudi Arabia number one of Oil reserve and we still have people asking for money in the street "Shine Happy People' You got that part right, to tell you the truth we need help yes we need help.Imagine president Gorge W. Bush take over your land because he is the president or imagine if your country is number 1 in Oil reserve, and its belong to the government but the Gorge W. bush or Saudi royal family take 80 % of the income.That is an answer to when you asked the question how much the Saudi invested in the US over 860 billion US dollar wonder why? Why do we still have damaged streets and why we do not have rail road, why always every thing is complicated in Arabia? Why you are stopped from traveling or renewing your license because you have to pay violation tickets and guess what we have company for car windows shading called V-Cool American company but having windows shading in Saudi is against the security law therefore you can have it but will be violated for, what a grate country. Back to your movie, I think the real victims are the people, the real victim is the troops fighting for no reason, the real victim is me and you, while the shine happy people play with our life like a monopoly game and the end they are the ones can enjoy our hard work and life and everything you can think of.I wish that you the American make a grate choice on whom will be your next president, which affect the whole plant.

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but some criticisms...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this film did a good job of summing up the vapid dumbness of the Bush Administration, probably the worst executive branch cast of characters in the history of the United States. It's subjective, one-sided ... but hey, at least it's honest and up-front about where it stands.However, I thought a few things were a bit silly: First of all, the finger is always being pointed at the Saudis, and -- it would seem from the visual language in the film -- at Arabs in general. And okay -- Bush is an oil guy from an oil family, and the Saudis have a lot of oil and influence with the Bushies -- we all understand that. But watching this film, you get the impression that the Saudis were also somehow connected with the invasion of Iraq, etc. When in fact, the Saudi government came out in opposition to the war, whatever private feelings might have been there at the time.Furthermore, there is absolutely no mention of Israel in this film, which is weird, considering that the people in the Bush administration who planned this war in Iraq since the 1990s were very upfront in their writings on the subject that it was a project designed to "reshape the security environment" for Israel. And Israel trained US forces, provided intelligence support, and received lucrative oil contracts (yes! Israeli oil companies supplied product to US forces in Iraq, a country that actuall *has* oil of its own...) connected with the Iraq invasion. But no mention of Israeli influence on the planning of the Iraq invasion. It was all the Saudis and the oil connection. Hmmm. I don't suppose the fact that this film was produced by two very strongly pro-Israel guys has anything to do with the omissions in this film? We're left to wonder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Parts of this movie were amazingly moving -- especially the entire Iraq sequence, including Lila, the mom who had lost her son and the scenes showing the destruction and civilian casualties. Some scenes (such as the public execution) were not really necessary and too gruesome for my taste. The scenes of burned and injured children and a dead baby were also gruesome and unpleasant. But I guess if we caused it, we ought to be willing to look at it! Parts dealing with the Bush - Saudi connections seemed to drag on too long and weren't particularly convincing. Overall, an excellent movie, though. (About as fair and balanced as Fox News, but still; it does present a view point.)

		<fullReview>Well I finally saw this movie earlier this week and I'm not at all disappointed that I did!I thought about seeing it earlier when it first came out here,but never got to it really...now when the election is going on in America I just simply HAD to see it.I really liked it.Finally someone is saying these things about Bush,which most Europeans know(I hope at least!)and are very concerned about as well,to the Americans themselves.They are the only ones who can put an end to the political careers of all these lying and dishonest people like Bush who are ruling the country at the moment.Because let's face it,as much as the Europeans and other people around the world protest against him and his government the Americans are the ones who do the voting.So I really hope that as many Americans as possible have seen this film and seriously considered the things it has to say. Sure it's obviously propaganda and Michael Moore has hardly even denied that,but still it's all basically TRUE!If only people would realize that...And also despite handling some very serious matters that affect the lives of not just Americans themselves,but people around the world,it can also be really funny! That's one thing I really like about Moore's documentaries.He doesn't just make them serious and important to watch but gives people the entertainment as well.I actually watched Fahrenheit 9/11 just the day before the last election debate and it was quite amusing when John Kerry mentioned that Bush had said he's not that worried about Osama Bin Laden and Bush replied that :'Gosh, I don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama Bin Laden. That's kinda one of those exaggerations.' And all the while his quote about not being worried about OBL was in Fahrenheit 9/11!!! OK,either Bush has a serious problem with his memory OR he's just simply lying...I'm betting on the latter option ; )Anyway this movie/documentary is a must see for anyone at least remotely interested about the state of the world.It has some very important things to say and there are LOT'S of them so I guess I'll better go see it again to catch them all.Maybe it's not as fun to watch as Bowling for Columbine was sometimes but that's not really the most important thing.The important thing is the message of the film.To quote again the very quotable George W.Bush and of course Michael Moore himself :George W. Bush :There's an old saying in Tennessee. I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that says: "Fool me once..." George W. Bush : "... shame on...". George W. Bush : "Shame on you..." George W. Bush : "If fooled, you can't get fooled again."Michael Moore : For once, we agreed. Well I definitely agree on that one!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Troubling film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of my better judgment I relented to see this movie on DVD with some friends. I am left wondering what is happening and where our country is going. I wonder that not because of this film, but because of things I knew in it that made me wonder what exactly the maker is trying to do. I have been a lifelong liberal democrat and now in my 50's, I thought I have seen it all.I was so bothered by some of the film's claims I did some research on it myself. It turns out that the filmmaker, is, how should I say this delicately, inventing a new version of the truth that might serve his political agenda? The inaccuracies are rampant to say the least. This film cannot be called a documentary because it lacks enough truth to be so. It is, at best, a personal propaganda piece for Moore and his circle of - well, what would we call them? Supporters? Friends? Comrades? I found a quote from him that might shed light on his possible agenda: "The bastards who run our country are a bunch of conniving, lying, smug pricks who need to be brought down and removed and replaced with a whole new system that we control." What bothers me most about this is his open hostility and his desire to completely destroy the America I know and love. His remarks can be likened to a Goebbels or Stalin-like attitude. Who is the "we" he talks about? His "we" sounds awfully exclusionary. Isn't that the sort of "we" the Nazi's envisioned when they propelled themselves into power in 1930's Germany? He may be the Leni Riefenstahl to a new world order he has built in his imagination.The system we have now is a free democracy. We vote for what we want as a nation. As has been said, it's not a perfect system but it's the best we've come up with so far. Moore wants to change that. He proposes an America where that disappears and we are to do his bidding. Frankly his personal disrespect for truth bothers me too much to ever listen to a thing he has to say again. Therefore I can't rate this film as anything other than trash, and dangerous trash at that.</fullReview>

In fact when he's not on camera he can be a real prick to put it nicely.

I felt that without this movie there would be a lot of stuff that we would never know about our president. This movie makes me want the election to come even sooner so maybe, just maybe our country will be in better hands.

Instead they will answer you with stupid and childish anti-Moore statements like:- "Micheal Moore is liar liar liar", "Micheal Moore is a Big Fat Pig". "Micheal Moore is a terrorist". "Micheal Moore is a propagandist".

		<fullReview>My brother just recently was shipped off to Iraq to fight for Bush's "oil war". When the war first started, I was all for it. Claiming that we needed to find those who started this war on 9/11 and get rid of them. I felt pride for America, and felt like we were doing the right thing, because that's what the public was told, bygovernment, by the media, by citizens. Great fear was presented in our faces, and that only made me want to fight for our country more, because I was scared and did not know what else there was to do. But as time wore on, and issuesopposing the war began to stir, I started to question our actions. After watching this film, I now know the truth, and I am surprised and angry. I'm surprised at the things I heard, because many of the issues discussed in the film were nevershown to the public. I'm angry at the President of our country because we are supposed to trust him. But how can we trust him when so much informationpertaining to this war, and the REAL reasons behind it, are being with-held from us. Many questions arise. Why did we go after Iraq? Why didn't we send moretroops to Afghanistan and bomb them like we bombed Iraq? Why weren't we outlooking for Osama more thoroughly? What does this war say about ourcountry? But most importantly ... what can WE do to take our country back. Put the issues back into the people's hands. America is supposed to be the land of the free, the land of democracy. Yet we are being lied to about the issues. I can only wait until my generation goes into office. We will see change. We will open up America's eyes.

		<fullReview>I read some of the reviews on IMDb about this movie before I saw it at home on DVD. Every one was or is sharply divided, so I thought o.k. it's going to be very one sided in its portrayal of political parties(Republicans=bad,Democrats=good) but when i watched it I saw both sides lose points and look bad. What brought this home was the part of the movie that shows the soldiers, who have served their country with honor and made the ultimate sacrifice, at the VA hospital. Here you see them with inadequate health care inadequate benefits and all this while Republicans and Democrats argue over who supports the troops more. As an American and more importantly an a human being this made me sick. Making this worse is the fact I have not seen anything about it on TV at all, Nothing. I did see flag draped coffins once but the dead don't continue to want money. See the movie for yourself with your political parties "Go Team" chanting on mute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, the irony of it all....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a bitter irony indeed.When this movie came out, the Republicans and their backers did all they could to decry the "manipulation" of director Michael Moore's film , Fahrenheit 911. The right wing spin machine known as Fox News, talking head Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity with mock indignation labeled Moore as unpatriotic and a liar as well. Mocked again at the Republican Convention , Moore was made a focal point to discredit him and by extension, his film.When I heard all this hue and outcry, Bill O' Reilly and his oxymoron No-Spin Zone assertions, the Truth was known to but a few. As I write this brief commentary there have been more revelations in the last week that not only show the pinpoint accuracy of everything Moore has to say, but chillingly exposes the duplicitous Government whose own NEOCON agenda has been allowed to pervert the very essence of the Democracy and freedom we all believed in.George Bush amply demonstrated in his first debate with John Kerry that the "aloofness" exposed in this film is nothing more than the TRUE Bush, a man of little conscience and intelligence; his fumbling for words or to express ideas contrasted sharply by the President he replaced, a Rhodes scholar in Bill Clinton, leaves anyone with a modicum of intelligence begging for his removal from office this November by a Democratic victory. Those 9 minutes reading "My Pet Goat" and being unable to act were revelations of the emptiness of thought and lack of leadership betrayed in that first debate with Kerry. Moore was right all along.Bush lied...that was almost made to sound treasonous and claims leveled at Michael Moore; two days ago Bremer admitted the U.S. didn't have sufficient troops on the ground to occupy and keep the peace in Iraq, charges denied by Bush and his cronies...the CIA and independent 911 Commission, a body that Bush opposed, has determined there were absolutely no links between 911 and Iraq or nuclear capability, the very reasons Bush is seen in archival footage arguing as reasons for the invasion of Iraq.I do not want my country to use the Japanese Empire of WWII as a model for "Democracy". The sheer magnitude of the TRUTH from the false case for war, Halliburton, The Saudi's and the Bush Family makes anything Moore said in May 2004 not only relevant and accurate, but now seems to be merely scratching the surface as the remainder of the TRUTH to be told is ready to come spewing forth, to topple an Administration that is more "regime" than elected voice......but oh the irony again...he really wasn't elected in the first place was he.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sat down to watch this film with a slightly skeptical mind. I expected the truth to be distorted slightly and Moore to be a bit "in my face" even though I knew I would agree with most of what he said.The film I watched was quite different from the film I expected to see. If there were any distortions of the truth, I was not aware of them. Moore allowed the "characters" (and many of them certainly are, in a very negative sense of the word) to present the case themselves. I didn't feel he was ever in my face.This is a movie all Americans of voting age should see (as well as those too young to vote). Coming from the Vietnam era myself, I expect Moore to be vindicated on the material presented (as if the information hasn't mostly been already).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vital piece of work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just by reading some of the hysterical reaction to Michael Moore's work, you can see how important his work is. Michael Moore ? much to the chagrin of some politicians and some of the people on this web page ? has carefully and methodically collected and verified a wide range of evidence that could completely change your view of the whole 'War on Terrorism'.Fahrenheit 9/11 is an excellent piece of journalism and research. It is a documentary presented in an intriguing and energetic style. At times, the work contains a touch of lightheartedness, but this is derived from the almost surreal actions of the government rather than any disrespect to the 9/11 victims. Indeed, Moore himself lost a colleague in the attack, and he documents the heart breaking loss of the mother of a dead US soldier.Sure, Moore ironically resembles a politician at times, with plenty of slant and bias mixed in with his work. I certainly don't agree with everything he says about the patriot act. But the fact remains that the evidence is hard and solid. Moore reveals a series of remarkable and at times shocking facts about the US government's behavior up to, during, and after the tragic events of 9/11.America (and my country, Britain) professes to be the "land of the free", a country that promotes freedom of speech and press. From seeing some of the people on this site you can see how important that is.As a teacher, I always advise my students that when they are choosing what 'side' to believe in any debate, they should listen to both arguments, decide who is using true facts and common sense, and then make their own decision. I truly believe the same tactic is necessary in this ongoing series of polemics. You can bury your head in the sand and scream 'Moore is a liar! It's not true! He just hates our wonderful country!' or you can watch the documentary, check the evidence, review the facts, and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A war on greed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have grown cynical about the concept of democracy; it's a great idea in theory but has never quite been realized.And who would want Bush's idea of democracy anyway? Freedom for the "haves and have-mores" and a dictatorship for everyone else. A government run by thieves and headed by a dry-alcoholic idiot-boy.But what can anyone do? Isn't it the way of the world that power corrupts? The most recent example of this being Tony Blair: in 1997 dear old Tone, "the people's prince", was all promises and ideals; then, seven years down the line, his ambition and greed have sent him into the arms of gurus, sycophants and George W. This film, however, has lifted me out of my apathy and made me angry. Yes, Moore's film is biased and emotional; however, the subject matter cannot help but stir strong emotions and sway law-abiding and honourable people against the profiteering and corrupt Bush government. Whilst the 'war on terrorism' acts as a smokescreen for Bush's nefarious acts, 'Fahrenheit 9/11' inspires a people's 'war on greed' with the only weapon our vote - if indeed it is counted - to ensure that neither Bush nor Blair is returned to power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey bcdavis-4,First of all if you are going to try to refute somebody's work, it is up to YOU (not your mommy) to check the facts. Iowa has not lost more soldiers than all other states, not even close. Our death toll stands at 13. This is high, but not even close to Illinois, which has lost 42, or California which has lost 118, Florida with 44, New York with 40 among others. In fact Iowa is near the middle in lives lost. My point being, don't start off your argument with the wrong facts, it tends to make people think you don't know what you are talking about. As far as the Saudis flying out before Americans could easily fly, well there are many FBI agents who claim that is true, and some senators as well. Including Byron Dorgan, from my home state North Dakota. Kudos to you Dorgan, that was probably not an easy thing to do in such a Red state.My two cents.........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very, VERY thought provoking movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dove into this flick as a pretty independent individual in my political views. During the film, I couldn't help but turn away in disgust at how real some of the news clips were showing our president and the administration. Michael did a great job at "cutting and pasting" certain TV shots he thought would get the point across to the viewing public and keep the film continuous. The film coverage and overall truth of the issues brought forth by Moore were truly mind altering. I now see certain undertones about the Republican party that I never really opened my eyes to before. For instance, when Bush was at the dinner banquet and stated something to the effect that the wealthy people around him were all part of his "group". He may have said that by accident, but it still sends a chill down my back in that it may have been a sub-conscious thought of his. That combined with the egregious amount of hashed "TV bloopers", if you will, of the president acting like a complete dunce.This film falls pray to college students like myself especially. Being that we are so easy to convince in general, many people my age will find that they will be "spiraled" into this movie with no self control. Avoid this easy tendency and think about everything afterwords before making your decision. This is a film that is very easy to agree with if you are not a strong person.Besides the technicalities of the movie, I still find it humorous that, even after seeing "Bowling for Columbine", only in this country will you ever see such a politically radical movie ever aloud to be shown to the masses without sensoring! Michael, you should really think about that, because in any other country with that kind of polical view, you would probably be hunted down by the government and "killed in a car accident" if you know what I mean.His views are dramatic, and some prove to make very good points, just don't fall pray to the easiness of the films 'absorption'.A must see for any political party!</fullReview>

There's no excuse for that. If this film opens the eyes of one American, it was worth it. Every fact in the film has been corroberated by documentation, and let's not forget, it's not even Moore actually saying anything factual in this film. Just his opinion on the facts as presented by Craig Unger, Dan Briody, Richard Clarke, Jack Cloogan, Prince Bandar, and the other researchers and witnesses interviewed in the film, some not even interviewed by Moore. Moore just gathered the footage and turned the camera on. It strikes me as utterly ridiculous to say he's lying, when he's obviously not lying and no one can point out any significant factual errors and present the documentation to refute Moore's claim. It's also ridiculous to complain that it only depicts one side of the issues and therefor isn't worth watching. Who says he has to show all sides of the story? That's not his obligation. Fox and the republican party has already made their side of things abundantly clear. Moore just showed us what no one else will. And for that I truly thank him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 is full of contradictions and quite blatant attempts to mislead the viewer, and yet its message seems on track for many people in Europe watching the downfall of America under President Bush. We share Moore's loathing of Bush and welcome the detailed scrutiny of his actions and highly suspect motives. Much of what he says appears, on closer analysis, to be true. On the other hand, his exclusion of the UK from the list of nations supporting Bush in Iraq is bizarre in the extreme. I also dislike his emphasis on patriotism. Why is it a good thing? why must Americans go around waving flags? It's not necessarily a good thing. Indeed in European history intense nationalism and obsession with military power have led to catastrophe on several occasions. Might it not be said that America is heading in the same direction? Here Moore has to be populist in order to appeal to Americans whose brains have been weakened by constant patriotic proganda, but it would be good if Moore could stand back from this a bit. I was impressed by the film and have thought about it more than most other films I've seen this year. What a pity it won't achieve one of its stated goals of unseating the autocrat in the White House.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that I had expected far better 'documentary' than what I have seen. I find it extremely hard to believe that it was Fahrenheit 9/11 that got Palm D'or as Bowling for Columbine is much more complex, non-bias and watchable documentary.If you have been living in Wonderland for last three years then I believe the facts that Michael Moore serves won't leave you cold. If you never read anything else beside Entertainment Weekly or People magazine, then you will find the connection between the Saudi Royal Family and the Bush elite shocking. While if you do read and watch non-bias media, and if you were against the war in Iraq, if you think that world is full of conspiracies and you truly hate republicans you will find this movie funny, amusing, enjoyable and right to your taste. It's not surprising to find that Moore wanted Fahrenheit to be shocking, to make an average American think twice before he casts his vote.But really, what did he have to say to the jury in Cannes that made them award this not so brilliant movie? Although I am concerned about Bush's world politics, the agenda of republicans, the mass media manipulation and would like to see him loose the elections I still think this is in some sort only another propaganda movie. But it was made by the side I favor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The truth can be painful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing is clear: This movie is a strongly biased one. But then, why not? The truth doesn't become untrue just because someone uses it for his purpose. Michael Moore's purpose - making sure that the US president Bush won't get reelected - is one which I must admit goes along with my personal feelings perfectly. I enjoyed the movie from minute one 'til the end, well knowing that I was looking at and listening to brilliant propaganda - people love to hear things from other people they are convinced of themselves.Keeping this in mind, everybody will have to admit that this movie is nothing less than perfect artwork - even if you don't go along with it's purpose. Just one small example: One of the soldiers in Iraq talks about how music helps him when he is to go into a fight. The song (was it one of his favorites?) which is played at that time is one by the Bloodhound Gang with the center line "Burn motherf+++, burn". Moore uses the same song when he shows horrific pictures of wounded US soldiers or the dead bodies being mutilated and put up on some stacks. It is as hit has always been: If you plant seeds of wind, you will harvest storm. I know this may be a subtle technique - but watching this on a huge screen with blasting speakers does its job.Another reason why "Fahrenheit 9/11" is such an extraordinary movie is that, in spite of its character as a documentary, it is funny (only sometimes - e.g. I loved the members of the "coalition"; especially Iceland which is portrayed by old archive material from a black and white Viking movie), sometimes really terrifying with pictures that you will carry along for long days - and the music fits perfectly.For many reasons, I am sure the movie will do its job. Another comment a few days ago (by "Gandalf 35") proves this to the best. We have a saying in Germany which means (roughly translated) "A dog will only bite if it gets hit". Yes, the truth can be painful. If "Fahrenheit 9/11" provokes more of those reactions of people who turn everything around (because, dear Gandalf, it is you who twists the facts and makes me laugh - Josef Goebbels was no left wing. As Minister for Propaganda during the Nazi era he represented the most extreme right wing.), I'm optimistic that Kerry will have a chance.Excellent movie, Mr. Moore - and "Keep on rocking in the free world"!!!</fullReview>

But Bowling for Columbine was really a major work i think but i shouldn't say too much cause i am Swedish so i don't know much about it.

		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 has been an extra-ordinarily difficult film for professionals to review. Many of the pieces have discussed Michael Moore's argument or favourite moments within the film but have given few comments to the actual film making, a few cursory notes here and there about pacing or editing. I'm usually a fairly passionate reviewer - if I really like something the reader will find a three paragraph love-in. And I'm very passionate about this film, and happy that it's a cinema documentary people want to see. It's going to be interesting to see the effects it has in the coming months - will it really have power to sway the voting habits of a country?What is startling for me is how little Moore has changed the way he presents the story. Although I missed the original release of Roger and Me (I was reading about robots in disguise at the time), for some reason I caught all of TV Nation when it turned up on BBC Two and that took me into my university years. Considering the controversy, it's interesting to note how close the new film is to the short ten minutes stories which appeared on television and his previous work.Throughout, there is still the mix of old tv footage, stunts and illustrative contemporary interviews. The proportions of each have been reduced and increased depending upon the story being told but it is very much Moore's style and just as distinctive as latter day Woody Allen. So here he is still the guy standing toe-to-toe with security guards, making impossible demands of congressman and reducing the description of the US government's response to 9/11 as old clips from Dragnet.It's a particularly good way of making an argument, but the weaknesses in the film occur when the voiceover drifts away. It's not that we need Moore telling us what to think of the images we are seeing, but it adds a coherence - at times the viewer is disgusted but at the same time wondering what the film-maker's point is other than isn't the world a horrible place. The images don't completely continue the story.But when the complete story is being told, it's very persuasive. Republicans might want to attack Moore's motives and some of the internal logic, but I'm yet to hear anyone try and rationalize the clip after clip of their President compromising the stateliness of his office. Say what you like about the paradoxes inherent in Moore the man, but it's inspiring that given the tools he has that rather than going after the small fry he's now gone right to the top.[I saw the film at a Saturday 3:45 showing and it was full. Many journalists and writer who have been to see the film with the public to see their reaction have talked about the heckling and the applause. At my showing the only time anything happened was when a clip of Britney Spears appeared in which she was asked about the Iraq war From out of the darkness deep male voice shouted: "Whore!" He was utterly silent through everything else...]</fullReview>

But what I really want to say is this: I believe the politician who was put on the line most urgently that day was actually Rudy Giuliani. The cafeteria food fight "red" and "blue" Americans are having over this film's portrayal of that day's most secondary Mr. Bush is getting in the way of intelligent discourse about the underlying problems that we must all address if we want to prevent our country from being besieged from without - and from within.

A few exceptions not included, they have failed and are still failing to bring the facts about the Bush-Administration to the American public. The media in the US are either cowards or endorse the GOP. This is especially apparent as far as nationwide TV-channels go. In 2000 the Bush-camp called CNN "liberals". Very funny indeed. How many outspoken Republicans do we know at CNN ? Larry King, Bob Novak, Bill Schneider etc. The list just goes on and on ... And Fox, well, we all know where they stand. NBC is owned by GE; CNBC is overtly Republican ... Need I go on ?Michael Moore may manipulate or exaggerate (re-arrange) certain developments, but isn't that the purpose and nature of film ? He makes people think for themselves and discuss what's going on in this world. The facts in his documentary are undisputed. Yesterday, some new material released by European media (interviews with American independent investigators, ex-CIA-people etc.) confirms the following : Osama Bin Laden's brother, who is in charge of the financial structure of Al Qaeda and the Bin Laden Group, was allowed to leave the US by plane on 13 September 2001.Mind you, previous Administrations, including Clinton's, were afraid to interfere with the powerful Saudi's because of the consequences a conflict with OPEC might have. But the Bush-clan had already been sleeping with the enemy (the Bin-Ladens) for years. So their trying to cover up the facts and to minimalize the extent of their relationship with the Saudi's only seems logical. People, just imagine what a popular Islamic Revolution in Saudi-Arabia might provoke ? Oil prices hitting, say 150 dollars a barrel ? THIS SITUATION NEEDS TO BE DEFUSED IMMEDIATELY AND IT WON'T BE EASY.One thing I know is this : if W and his cronies are allowed a second term, they risk bringing the world on the brink of a crisis of gigantic proportions.The Bush Maffia have spit on the graves of the Founding Fathers and on the Constitution of the United States (Patriot Act etc.) As we speak, they are plotting an election fraud that will dwarf what happened in 2000. Companies like Diebold (electronic voting machines) have already pledged to "deliver" certain States.A message to ALL Americans : inform yourselves, stand up for your rights, unless you want to see your worst nightmares come true after November 2004. Europe and the entire world are counting on you. I love America(ns);I just hate to see what Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld-Ashcroft-Wolfowitz are doing to your great Nation. Restore the land of the BRAVE and the FREE. From Europe with love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From a UK perspective, Moore's tabloid, scattergun approach is not perhaps how we'd go about the business of exposing George Bush. Many have criticised this film as a mess, with some justification. At one moment, he lacks all subtlety and it is as if he has handed a sequence over to one of his teenage fans (the "coalition" sequence, with its monkeys and spliffs); at another he is very subtle (Ms Lipscomb, in her pain at the loss of her son, uttering the very same words as a similarly bereaved Iraqi mother - except that you wonder if Moore actually noticed that, and if he had, would he not have picked up on it and brandished it in our faces as he does other connections?)The effect is dreadfully uneven. Why, you want to ask, did Moore not examine the unwillingness of any senator to endorse the complaints raised about the Florida election in that otherwise excellent sequence near the beginning of the film? Why did he not anticipate the obvious counter-polemic from his opponents and refer even once to the fact that Saddam's regime was, actually, pretty horrendous?It was obvious from the start that legal restrictions, starting at a trivial level, would dictate much of what we saw ("that Taxi Driver guy" indeed! Affleck's people give name-check permission: Pacino's obviously do not!). One wonders how much of rather greater significance had to be pulled. Not, presumably, the brand of T-shirt proudly worn by the Oregon lawman (does Moore really need product placement?). Nor the Mickey Mouse logo tellingly worn by another character, surely being lampooned. Or not. Hard to tell.I am glad this film was made and released. John Berger, in today's paper, believes that, uniquely for a work of art, it may ensure George W fails to get re-elected. But America is such a strange and frightening country that the opposite may equally well be true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very happy when the movie got the Palme d'or at Cannes' festival. Thanks mister Tarentino and Co. I was then a bit disappointed by the movie because there weren't not so many new things to me. But that's not important. I understand the people writing here, saying that the movie is very bad : for sure, it is out of the classical Hollywood standard (no sex, no high speed cars, no slim and gorgeous women, ...). Worse than that, mister Moore says a part of the Truth which they don't like, claiming he made a kind of nazzi propaganda. I simply hope those people will live long enough to understand that they have been supporting a real team of bushtards! History will not retain lies.Well, if you happen to read me mister Moore, I'd like to thank you. I tend to think that Americans are a bunch of stupid folks, all blind and deaf behind their dumb leader. Thanks to you, and a few others, to open my eyes.It's good to think that there are millions of citizens like you over there, who still have the right to think and talk and argue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best and worst of Moore is still pretty entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case your confused about documentaries please let me inform viewers that all documentary filmmakers have some sort of agenda. That's why their making a film! Why would someone go to all the trouble and money and time to make something that they don't feel a passion for? They wouldn't and Michael Moore in his own way (Like it or not) has again made a pretty entertaining film. I'm the first to admit that this is a flawed documentary but Moore's doggedness makes any subject that he's covering compelling to watch. There are several moments in the film that are very strong even if you disagree with Moore's politics and his approach and the first one is the footage of the Republican controlled Senate. The images of what American soldiers are doing in Iraq is both heartfelt and disturbing and Moore does show the Military in both an heroic sense and at it's most repulsive.One of the best moments is the way the film follows Lila Lipscomb who at first is a staunch supporter of the military and then the ultimate horror of losing her son in Iraq in which we witness her turn around. Arguably the most infamous scene shows President Bush not reacting when told the country is under attack and it's a priceless scene that is worth the price of admission. Moore does his best to show President Bush as a clueless bumpkin and someone with economic ties with the Bin Laden family but these are issues that we knew already so Moore does tread on territory that is overly familiar. I also thought that the scenes where Moore's narration starts to pontificate on what a certain person might be thinking is also a big flaw that does nothing but open the doors for cheap jokes. To Moore's tribute this film did make me think about this countries involvement in the Iraqi War and I would be surprised if everyone else who views this film didn't also do the same thing. That would be Moore at his best and his poignant agenda is the crucial reason as to why I'm recommending this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but not a George W Bush fan. In 2000 I was outraged at how he took office in blatant violation of democracy. Yes, democracy - recall Florida? The first ten minutes of the film showed what I already knew and believed to be true. For me, a Republican politically, this man could not, should not be have been president. What was America thinking?! Fahrenheit 9/11 is of course contrived in parts, sometimes a mockumentary. But there are some already known facts regardless:- Dubya and daddy Bush were/are buddies of the Saudis - corrupt and human rights abusing Arab rulers. There were several favors traded - no kidding.- Dubya isn't the smartest, true to popular belief and this is constantly reinforced by his actions. Do we need examples?! How can we be OK on this guy's watch?!- Dubya certainly still can't account for his time in the Texas Air National Guard.- Lastly, and most shocking, HOW on earth were the Bin Laden family allowed to leave the country 2 days after Sept 11 2001? How could anyone in the administration think that they may not know something, how could it be OK to allow them passage?!- The US and Saddam were buddies. Oh lookit Rumsfeld and Saddam together!- Iraq may be ruled by a bastard that needed to be taken out. Sure. But this war reeked of personal vendetta. There could have been more thought toward an internal coup, look how many Iraqi officials became turncoats so quickly! Instead we have a fast mounting American death toll, in addition to that of Iraqi civilians.Now if someone in the GOP would challenge this president and show him for what he is. Bush-II should NOT be re-elected. Well, just elected - remember he stole the 2000 election.Given all this, Fahrenheit 9/11 was eminently satisfying to watch. Yes, it was contrived, so what - the Prez isn't exactly honorable by me.</fullReview>

Sure, there's plenty of things making fun of George W, but he could have been made to look much worse. The film's strength lies not in the description of ties between Bush and the bin Ladins, (they're most of the time pretty weak, or not very spectacular). What's good is that the film shows the insanity of war, and how the attack on Iraq was made for all the wrong reasons. The images of the casualties of war, and the dead and wounded soldiers never shown to the American public, can hopefully take the edge of some of the most frenetic war mongers in the world. The film didn't have the same impact on me as Bowling for Columbine. This time Moore tries to focus on more issues than there's time for, which makes many things feel unresolved. If you don't like Moore's way of doing his films, then you're probably not going to like this one either, but Fahrenheit 9/11 is important as it poses questions that otherwise may never have been raised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it a documentary? Is it a satire? Is it propaganda? Is it possible that this film can forego all the labels to triumph critically with over $100 million in domestic box office? YES! Michael Moore opens the floodgates of suspicions surrounding the suspiciously appointed Bush administration: suspicions of connections to big oil, big black ops, big voter fraud and big terrorism. It's not a timeless movie; it's a film that's right on time. The award winning Bowling for Columbine was a more balanced work, it's true, but Moore has a vast and irresistible web to weave, or at least to reveal, in the Bush administrations' war mongering, oil hoarding shenanigans. It's passionate and it's about time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FAHRENHEIT 911 (3 outta 5 stars)Even though I am in complete agreement with Michael Moore's political agenda I am becoming more and more disenchanted with his heavy-handed approach as time goes by. (Good lord... can't this man make even ONE movie without bringing up Flint, Michigan?) So I can definitely see why viewers not in tune with Mr. Moore's wavelength would dismiss this film as nothing but left-wing propaganda. Propaganda it may be... but probably as close to the truth as anything the right-wing propaganda machine (led by the power elite in the White House) has been spinning for the last 4 years. Sure, this film and its depiction of events from the "election" of George W to the present day is biased... so what? Show me an entirely un-biased documentary and I'll show you a snooze-fest. Love him or hate him... but this film will definitely give you something to think about. I found the first half of the film (and its constant, repetitive Bush-bashing) a little slow-going... but the latter half... dealing more directly with the war and its victims... has some very powerful moments, undercut a bit by Moore's penchant for overkill. (Don't show a weeping mother breaking down once when you can show her breaking down TWICE!) Kudos to Michael Moore for fighting the good fight... but I think he'd be more effective by dialing it down a notch or two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the best documentary I've ever seen.You have the freedom to form your own opinions about the Bush administration and what happened on 9/11, but Michael Moore outlines some questions that all Americans have. Like, why did he suppress countless efforts to create post-9/11 groups that wanted to help the victims' families and uncover exactly WHY 9/11 happened? Why did Bush attack Iraq, an innocent country, that prior to our attack had no qualms with us (nor had ANY reason to be attacked)? There are a trillion questions that we all have concerning 9/11 and the Bush administration. Michael Moore has done a great job of uncovering these covert truths that have been kept from us since day one. Although I think at times he may have exaggerated some things, I think that this film is excellently done, and I don't think it could have been done better. See this movie, if it's the last thing you do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film clearly points out a couple of fundamental problems with the political climate in the US of A. It also gives a perfect illustration of what war really is. It contains a number of very strong parts that just need to be seen by anybody who believes him/herself to be "politically engaged". It's a good film.However I don't think it is a good "documentary" in that sense. Perhaps my European background is preventing me from being objective about this. I believe a good documentary first "investigates" a subject and lets the viewer observe the issue from different perspectives. Then at the end the viewer can make up his/her own mind/conclusions about things and perhaps the documentary can do so as well. With this film it is the other way around: Mr. Moore starts out by making a statement/conclusion and then uses examples and illustrations to prove his point. Now most of the arguments he presents are (I think) obviously current, still I don't like this "method of discussion". Perhaps it's an American thing? It seems a little bit "over the top" to me.I gave the film a 9 though.</fullReview>

Manipulate with common crowd in the name of politics, but in fact of greed and power? Because you just lack love? Because you just afraid that you are not needed, you are not welcome?You are NOT peace keepers. You NEVER HAVE BEEN.

		<fullReview>While almost all Americans (including those that voted for Bush) know that he is an inept, stupid, lazy, puppet president surrounded by a crew that is not much above the Taliban, the visual impact of seeing Bush and all his shortcomings come to life is what makes this film brilliant. Even those that voted for him in 2000 will now have to question "why did i vote for him?" and perhaps will think twice this November. The movie has shown to all Americans that are courageous enough to witness it, why the whole world has at best, no respect for us, or at worst, downright hate us.The leader of the free world sits for SEVEN MINUTES while knowing two planes have flown into the World Trade Center. SEVEN MINUTES! --- the look on his face is either "what do i do now?" or more likely "this wasn't supposed to happen to me." The look on Fleischer's face says it all. Being that i was in the lobby of the South Tower at the time of the first hit on the North Tower, my blood now boils knowing that the American President was not on the plane/phone or whatever to DC trying to assess -- he was reading "My Pet Goat"While some parts run a little long, this is a piece of brilliant film-making and one that will make anyone or any political persuasion think. Bush lovers will always be Bush lovers, no matter what he can (or rather cannot) do. This won't change their vote. But for the few that may be on the fence about this administration, it is well worth the price of admission to see what we could be in store for if there are four more years of him.Having lived through the worst attack this country has ever had, it shames me that our president used it as a tool to further an agenda for the very few in power (can anyone say Halliburton?).

The facts are that there is a financial connection between the Bushes and the Saudi Royal Family -- and that 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudi and none were from Iraq. Bush threw away a world of goodwill to wage a war against a nation that was not only a non-threat to us, but it was barely a threat to those nations it borders.It's also as plain as Moore's double chin that Bush and his neo-con chickenhawks are waging a war against this country's poor and middle-class.And thanks to our asleep-at-the-teleprompter mass media, they're winning that war, as well. Looking forward to your next movie, Mr. Moore...that is, while we still have a First Amendment in our Constitution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sickening, Important, lengthy at times... MUST SEE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big problem with this movie is that its just not going to help the world, or the US citizens, for that matter. If it would become necessary watching material for high school diplomas or college degrees, it might make a difference, but not as a "choice movie", because the people who already hate "president" Bush will love the movie, but his supporters arent even going to watch it. Nonetheless, the latter will defame it and its creator (and rate it with a "1" on the IMDB, without watching it, of course, to bring the average vote down).This is a propaganda movie against George Walker Bush, no more no less. Its been said before that its not really a documentary, but rather op.-ed., and I agree. The big thing about it is that its merely a COLLECTION. Anybody could google the internet for an hour and find out everything the movie claims. And the information has been available for months and years. Whats sickening really is that it takes an overweight biased American to bring it all together and into the cinema, in order to get Americans (who should normally take steps to control and oversee the work of their own government THEMSELVES) to look at all these facts.As I claimed above, the Bush supporters are probably not going to watch this movie in a cinema. And Bush himself neither. Thats what separates him from Adolf Hitler, for instance, who desperately wanted to watch Chaplins "The Great Dictator" - after banning it in Germany, of course. I dont like Mike Moore that much anymore, hes just TOO biased on every issue he touches, and he cant take any criticism, but hes important. At least one American stands up for his country and its true values, and does not follow the leader like a lemming.The movie itself is pretty hard to swallow most of the time; especially the scenes shot in Iraq. There are some lengthy scenes in it; the camera just stays on the weeping mothers a little too long. But I realize its important to see ALL the pain and anguish in these human beings, because its simply not shown in the usual US media. The facts come way too fast and confused, but you get the general sense of every issue touched in the movie. Overall, a very good and important work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Criticizing the President isn't new. Nor it taking cheap shots at him. Satire is built upon the idea of making light of the institution while making a political point.And "Fahrenheit 9/11" certainly does that with a gusto. It's biting, sometimes witty and often powerful, but does it deserve the praise it has received? Is Micheal Moore some sort of champion of freedom, or an ego driven madman? The truth is probably somewhere in between.The film is done in the style of an investigative journalism piece. Moore, upset about how Bush has been conducting Presidential affairs since taking office, looks into the events leading up to September 11 as well as the aftermath, and makes some startling conclusions.According to Moore, Bush dropped the ball prior to September 11 and then quickly used the event as an excuse to rally patriotism into a war cry not only against Afghanistan, the country giving safe harbor to terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, but also Iraq, whom Moore sees as innocent of the whole ordeal.During his investigation he chronicles the history of Bush's business partners and theorizes a conspiracy involving the Carlyle Group, an international business partnership that includes, along with both Bushes, several Saudi oil barons and other supposedly dubious investors, including members of the bin Ladin family. He also interviews a Flint resident named Lila Lipscomb, who undergoes a transformation from military supporter to anti-war activist after her son is killed in combat in Iraq.In terms of quality of a film, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is a vast improvement over Moore's last piece, "Bowling for Columbine." Here Moore is more calm, more composed and his target is a little more well defined, but it seems with the new film Moore's problem is his sin of omission.There is no denying what is on film, but is it the whole truth? It certainly is thought provoking, and Bush is clearly shown in this film as an ineffectual leader who perhaps depends too much on other's advise. One memorable scene has footage of Bush sitting in the Florida classroom and reading the children's book "My Pet Goat" after being told about the World Trade Center attacks, almost unsure of what to do next.But there is just too much circumstantial evidence and fooling around with the narrative for the movie to be a serious piece. What's more, like in previous Moore documentaries, it seems he can't be satisfied with the material he has, but has to mess with the storyline to make it overly dramatic. The footage with Lipscomb is powerful enough as it is, but the way Moore presents it, it seems like he was documenting a family from the very beginning only to have them suffer tragedy, when reality is quite different.In an interview in Entertainment Weekly, Moore admitted that all the footage involving Lipscomb was shot after her son's death. It doesn't change the power of her arguments, but it does change the meaning of the segment."Fahrenheit 9/11" also points out that Bush allowed for members of the bin Laden family to leave the country following the September 11 attacks, and uses Richard Clarke as the most damning voice against this, though he neglects to mention that Clarke was the one who personally okayed the departures. Moore makes mention of a pre-existing plan to invade Iraq prior to the war on terror, but neglects to mention it was created in 1998, under Bill Clinton's administration.Certain scenes in the movie are powerful but also seem out of place. One interesting segment shows Al Gore, acting as President of the Senate on his final day of office, being forced to repeatedly silence the congressmen speaking in his favor because of rules violations.One funny scene has Moore trying to get Congressmen to have their children enlist in the military and fight in Iraq after an earlier scene had Marine recruiters hunting down lower income people in Flint, Michigan. The looks on the politicians faces are priceless, and speak quite loudly -- the children of powerful people don't have to risk their lives.And that's perhaps the movie's largest faux pas. Moore is so vehemently opposed to a second term of office for Bush that he will put just about anything on screen to discredit him. If you want to see Bush bashed beyond recognition, and believe me, he does plenty of damage to his own reputation without Moore's help, then this is certainly the movie for you.But it's also a propaganda piece, and one that's presented as a documentary. And that's the biggest thing going against the movie. If this was a "movie," it wouldn't be as bad since we expect distortions in storytelling. But documentaries, for whatever reason, must be held to a higher standard, because by their very nature they're meant to show reality.I can watch "Woodstock" knowing I'm seeing a true presentation of the what's occurring on screen, but I can't say the same about anything Moore creates. His films are certainly fun films to watch and provide food for thought, but Moore has become too big a figure in politics for his message of the little guy to ring true anymore. Furthermore, in Moore's world there's no room for dissenting opinion. That's a world I don't want to live in.6 out of 10 stars. It contains undeniably powerful imagery and human emotion, but it's way too biased to be a true documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting, thought provoking film, if a little flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the nature of such a film, it is necessary to get my opinions on it in a highly objective and factual manner. This was not an easy task as I, like many other Europeans, harbor a deep dislike for the current Bush administration. For a start, I believe that Fahrenheit 9/11 is a significant improvement on Bowling for Comlumbine. Moore's latest offering drops any childish animated sections which, in my opinion, are not suitable in relation to the subject matter. In addition, the film poses some rather shocking questions about the Bush's family connections to Saudi Arabia, in particular the Bin Laden family. Also there were question's about the legality of Bush's election victory.However, facts are facts. There can be no illusion about the that Fahrenheit 9/11 is completely one-sided, allowing no right-wing/conservative opinions to be aired what-so-ever. I've the opinion that the best way to further your own arguments is to give the opposition a fair hearing and, hence, proceed to destroy or disassemble their stance using facts not rhetoric. Simply giving only one side a chance to speak merely suggests bitter and sloppy journalism. Needless to say, this film will split America down the middle, more so since elections are fast approaching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't feel or leave the theater angry after viewing this movie. Instead I was sad, disappointed and yes, a little guilty.Every issue has and should have opposing sides and views. This movie was one. The media, politicians, you and I have ours.Fact or fiction? People are being killed - fact. What interests me is whether each death (man, woman, child) is justifiable, necessary? The entire human race not parts of a world community need to feel we are and will be better off from our actions or inactions.Whereas before my opinions were only discussed with those around me. I will have my say. I'm going to vote.Even after viewing this movie, I would not be surprised if all current leaders are re-elected. Ignorance is nothing to feel guilty about.

		<fullReview>Just finished watching FAHRENHEIT 9/11, and although finding it a little TOO one-sided. MICHAEL MOORE speaks (to a worldwide audience) something that most have that audience know, but haven't the movie studio, to do so. His attacks on BUSH are relentless (yet initially witty) but come the mid section, and it's focus on the war in IRAQ, the movie takes a dark turn (as it should do, i suppose) but it's a nice counterbalance. The message MOORE (and everyone else) is trying to get across to ANY government is clear...TRUTH first....NATIONAL SECURITY second! Truth wins out in this movie, just a shame that thousands of people (on both sides) had to die, in REAL life. Bush, would have served himself better, to get actively 'involved' in the making of this movie, and i too, would have preferred to see both sides. But i guess BUSH's silence speaks volumes. And as CHARLTON HESTON (before him) BUSH won't be able to take much 'MOORE'  ******POSSIBLE (futuristic) SPOILERS*******GEORGE W BUSH is kicked out, and from then on, documentaries like FAHRENHEIT 9/11 are made about ALL possible candidates BEFORE being elected, to not only the most POWERFUL position in the world, but also the most DANGEROUS!An extremely entertaining 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but very interesting and thought-provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first: Yes, this movie is flawed. Flawed in the artistic sense (IMHO, many scenes seem to ramble on for too long), flawed in the sense of truth (some of the "facts" Moore presents are not completely true), and flawed because the movie presents a rather one-sides argument.It seems that the both factual inaccuracies and the political one-sidedness of the movie cause most of the fighting over this movie. Looking at the riot from a non-US perspective, it seems that the political left is admiring the movie because some of the facts are true, and the political right is bashing the movie because some of the facts are false. What I see from people of the political right is _fear_. Not because the movie goes directly against their motives, or because it's anti-Bush, but because is forces them (and worse: other people) to do the one thing that many people are truly afraid of:The movie forces them to think for themselves. It forces me to think for myself, that's for sure.Think about about: Is the fact that a movie isn't 100% true (or maybe even made specifically to be non-100% true) a reason not to see it, or to fear it? Yes, the movie might be engineered to influence people, but if you're aware of that, that doesn't influence you anymore. So go and see it: you will have to think. And you might even enjoy that!As for the movie influencing my own opinion: Here in Europe, where we have balanced and independent news agencies, I already knew most of the "shocking facts" that this movie presents. The only things new to me where the many many business-relations in which Bush and son are entangled. Had I been an American, it wouldn't have changed my voting-decision much.Go see this movie. And think!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought provoking...the truth as interpreted by Michael Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All of the facts contained in this movie are in the public domain and most of it has been in the newspapers. In other words, there is nothing new here. What is different is that Michael Moore had the time and resources to bring everything together into one place and present it as his version of "The Truth". Propaganda can be described as the truth, interpreted in the interests of the propagandist. In this, Michael Moore succeeds. He tells a very compelling story. We have to remember however, that comments and actions taken out of context do not give a complete picture. In this day of 'information overload' it is tempting to resort to short cuts. To let other people present us with just the 'pertinent facts. It is important, however, to remember that what we will be getting in that case is just what that person wants us to see and hear. Is that really enough for us to make an informed decision on our own?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Trailblazing Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences fails to recognize Michael Moore's FAHRENHEIT 9/11 with a nomination for Best Feature Length Documentary its place in film history is secure. This incendiary and powerful film is an unforgettable viewing experience and not only because it's a deliberate, muckraking attempt to besmirch the current president and his administration. Moore also takes aim at The Media in general, castigating The Powers That Be (NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN etc.) for a reckless mendacity that led to a televised War where TV Anchors and journalists joined the ride to Baghdad and reported and photographed only what Bush &amp; Co. wanted the American people to see and hear.In BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE (2002) Moore targeted The NRA as the Big Villain in allowing laxity in gun laws for creating the horrendous murders and maiming at Columbine High School in April of 1999. The film was a disturbing but often unintentionally hilarious expose of the state of mind of many Americans whose lives are controlled by fear and the need for firearms as weapons of defense. It was America turning the Gun on Itself, in stark contrast to its relatively placid neighbor to the north, Canada, where firearms are prevalent but murders by shooting are significantly lower than those in The States.FAHRENHEIT 9/11 employs the same canny juxtaposition of images that made the earlier film such a deliciously barbed and caustic social commentary. Although Moore's main target is one George W. Bush, other big players in his administration are vulnerable targets as well. There is also open season on Democrats and The Media in particular. perhaps the most chilling aspect of this movie.Whatever the outcome of the election in November, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 will be remembered for its unstinting bravery in stripping the layers of deceit that have plagued this country for the past four years. As with BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, it is a movie that will make you laugh, then make you cry, and ultimately make you angry. FAHRENHEIT 9/11 has an immediacy and importance that makes it the film of the year, and a clarion call to this generation and the next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Healing the nation? Possible spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Goodness, gracious me-oh-my. It is not clear what Michael Moore hates more, war or Republicans or our current president-elect, George W. Bush. How much conspiracy could be in play 35-40 years ago? If what is presented in this movie as 'fact' is true, then our current president must really be quite the genius, only playing like he has some difficulty with the English language to throw us off the trail of a massive conspiracy spanning more than four decades. When do we try to heal as a nation instead of pick, pick, pick. It takes little imagination to question someone else's motives or edit content out of context to make a point. In fact, one can edit sound bites or play with questioning motives and with a little imagination turn Mother Teresa into a genocidal maniac, or turn Ralph Nader into a job and economy destroying, subversive, or turn our former President Carter into a monopolistic, socialist or turn former President Reagan into a war hungry, maniacal mad man. Let me be clear, none of these examples are believed to be factual by this writer. However a proverb does spring to mind; A nation divided against it's self will surely collapse. Can we quit the name calling and get on with the search for truth, justice and what we used to call the American way? This writer is tired of people calling for tolerance yet conveniently failing to be tolerant of other people's point of view. This writer has grown weary of those claiming their right to freedom of speech using it to denigrate those who protect our freedoms. We do not have the freedoms we enjoy today without a war in the past whether it is the American Revolution, The Civil War, WWI or WWII. It has been said by Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, 'War makes bad men worse and good men better'. This is apparently true on the battlefield as well as in the homeland. Could we begin to appeal to a sense of morality in our discussions? Can we have a mature discussion with honest give and take and at the end of the day collaborate to find the win-win solution instead of attacking each other? Years ago there was a sometimes politically motivated cartoon strip in which one of the characters is quoted as saying, 'I have met the enemy and he is us'. If we do not unite and fight for freedom, we have already lost the war and have dishonored the 950+ soldiers already killed in the conflict in Iraq. Not to mention the 1250+ Iraqis killed and 5000+ wounded. One has to ask a few questions and seek honest answers to these questions; Was Iraq aiding and abetting al-Qaeda? Maybe the intelligence was wrong and there were no WMD's, how many resolutions from the UN do we watch Mr. Hussein disregard before we do something? What is the danger of the UN becoming irrelevant? Do we really want the largest known proven oil fields to be under the control of a maniacal, murderous dictator who rapes and pillages his own countrymen? So the query in my mind is, what do you choose to do with this information?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lets take back America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore may the wild-card that tips this election. His documentary is sending people to the theaters to see for themselves what all the gossip is about. This movie did a wonderful job in showing why we should not be in Iraq. Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that we cannot impose democracy upon a people. Most of the Arab world (over 90%) was strongly opposed to the war. Everyday in the news, we hear of car-bombings, kidnappings, etc., all by Iraqi insurgents who are opposed to a US presence in their country. How much longer will this continue? There were some powerful emotional moments in this movie. I was shocked at the scene where none of the black representatives in Congress could get the approval of a single senator. Also the part with the interracial couple that lost a son in the war was moving. It added a very real, tangible characteristic to the movie.What I didn't like so much in the movie were the petty personal attacks on the Bush administration. I mean, Bush is a puppet, an idiot, but that's all old news. Did the movie really need the scenes of Bush golfing, of Bush forgetting that saying (at the end), and of another member of the Bush admin. using spit as hair gel? I think these weakened the movie. But then, it's part of Moore's style. I guess I would have liked it if he touched more on the issue he brought up at the end, how the army heavily recruits in the poorest neighborhoods, sending the "scum of America" out to die in Iraq, while the rich sit at home and get wealthy from investments, weapons contracts, oil contracts, and whatnot.</fullReview>

Do not be nonchalant to what goes on in your country. You cant just sit down and complain about what goes on! DO SOMETHING!!!With that said, I agree with the people here who says MM don't have a lot of facts that he can relate to. In that sense, I think Bowling for Columbine was a better movie.

		<shortDescription>One of the most groundbreaking documentaries you'll see this year,and its the hottest movie of the summer of 2004</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never got a chance to take a closer look at one of Michael Moore's film with the execption of several of his documentaries including the Oscar-winning "Bowling For Columbine" which was based on one of the most tragic shooting incidents in American history. Again,Michael Moore pushes the buttons ever harder this time around and his new film really takes aim at one of the most tragic events ever witnessed,and one of the most destivating disasters ever committed on American soil. His newly politically-charged documentary "Fahrenheit 9/11" is worth seeing and its has already sprung a lot of debate about the leadership of the 43rd President of the United States and the events that really took place during the events of September 11,2001---the day when America took changed,and really the course of how the security status of this country affected each and every one of us. "Fahrenheit 9/11",is the documentary film of the year,and also it is the hottest movie to see this summer,and it really crushes the competition of the onslaught of the summer movie madness which consistently dominates the multiplexes this time of the year,and its time for a welcome change.Created with the specific intent of helping unseat the 43rd President of the United States,director Michael Moore's anti-Bush broadside of course has no pretense of objectivity. This is an provocative historical tour that runs from George Bush's narrow "election",through 9/11 and the current debacles in Iraq,the film is vivid in detail with the outrage and unsparing in its depiction of the events of that unexpected day when the country was in one of the greatest crisis ever known and a day that will go down in infamy. It also goes in detail in its depiction of Bush as something of a fatuous,incompetent Alfred E. Newman of the Texas plutocracy. Even with its onslaught against the Bush Administration,and several members of his cabinet which includes the Vice-President,and others,Moore has created a strategically-released visual argumental debate against the presidency using archived clips from various news sources,newspaper articles and official White House documents. This is brilliant piece of documentary film-making at its finest hour as Moore outlines business deals with Bush that he was involved in before he became President(and this was when he was the governor of Texas),traces to the Bush family's close ties with important Saudis,points out the major companies that stand to benefit from war and tries to get congressmen to enlist their own children in the Armed Forces---in other words,sending them to the slaughterhouse to fight for a war in Iraq that doesn't make any sense---in point sending young men and women to fight for our freedoms,and coming home in bodybags which remains us of the casualties that occur within for the defense of our own nation--which is about to become something that was a tragically almost a generation ago---Vietnam.The overall status of this is that was Michael Moore is doing and basically drives home throughout the film is that Bush is trying to help himself and his political agenda of friends and underground buddies more than he is trying to help his country,and he's got lots of interesting tidbits to back them claim up including a relentless attack on Bush where some of the most harrowing moments in the film deal with regular people including a grieving mother who lost her only son in Iraq and in scenes involving the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York,not to mention scenes involving the attack on the Pentagon in Washington,and toward a farm field in Pennsylvania where so many,many lives were lost and this movie goes into detail with further information as the film goes along that really holds the viewers attention span. "Fahrenheit 9/11",is already an early Oscar-contender entry for Best Documentary,it is one of the highly entertaining,moving films I have seen this year,and let me say that I have seen it twice already. A brilliant piece of work from one of the most controversial directors in Cimema history.</fullReview>

He has clearly done heavy volume business with our enemies and has used his power and political friends to put unnecessary fear in the minds of the American public. He has helped the Bin Laden family leave the United States on September 13, 2001; there were no commercial flights that day, but Mr. Bush gave authorization to have Mr. Bin Laden's family safely flown out of the United States of America. He has done business with and had discussions with the Bin Laden family including the step-brother of the man responsible for killing over 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001. Lastly, the film shows that is can also talk and act like a complete idiot.I'd like to believe that the information in this film is untrue. But, so far, I've not seen Mr. Bush or anyone from his administration trying to prove otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a 34 year old male from London England. On Sunday just gone, I saw the "controversial" film that the insecure right-wing media in America tried to prevent their own citizens from seeing ...The excellent Fahrenheit 9/11.There is no way you could even pay American citizens to vote George Bush back into a 2nd term after seeing that film. Shame on the Republican voters for actually believing in this BUFFOON. Didn't they check out his credentials before backing him? The theatre that showed the film was PACKED OUT. People had to stand along the aisles just to get a view. In all my years, I have NEVER witnessed a cinema packed out like that for any blockbuster. And the film was just in its 2nd week of showing in the UK.The film exposed a dumb stupid, corrupt, lying, crooked crook as a President, that values lining his own pockets more than the lives of his own people. He instructs the equally dumb American media to drive "scare tactics" on the public so they can support him sending troops to Iraq to combat a so-called "terrorist threat" so his sinister "secret agenda" of getting the oil from Iraq as well as winning rebuilding contracts for his republican friend can be realized. Then all of a sudden, things seem go a bit sour.No.1:- No Weapon of Mass Destruction No.2:- Over 900 US troops got killed and thousands permanently wounded. Coffins and the wounded are sent back home with little or no media attention, the wounded needing lifelong treatment. The able bodied troops that are left in Iraq have to stay much longer and are now homesick.So now, who are the people that the government are targeting to join the army and "PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK" to help out in their ILLEGAL war effort? Yes you've guest right, its young black adults. Yes, the same black adults that were denied voting rights in the Florida 2000 election.Yes the majority of the US troops out in the FRONT LINE "which runs the highest risk of war casualty" in Iraq are usually black, Hispanics and poor whites. The Republicans see young black adults as fresh meat, people with no future, a convenient candidate to risk death or permanent injury just to help the rich white so-called upper class elite get richer.I like the part in the film where Michael Moore confronts Republican cabinet ministers to enlist their OWN children to fight in Iraq. They all responded by running away, ignoring him or looking at him like he was nuts. There is only one republican cabinet minister who has a kid fighting in Iraq.If I was in power, I would send Tony Blair, George Bush, Rupert Murdoch and the so?called upper class elite, every Republican cabinet member, their children and supporters of the war to Baghdad right in the heart of the fighting WITHOUT guns and ammunition. "Then they will understand the true meaning of terror." Yes, let them put their own lives and money where their mouths are, and do their own dirty work, along with the help of their war supporters.At the same time I will send the US troops along with the coalition troops back home. When the film finished, there was something else I had not witnessed in all my years of cinema going... There was a big long round of applause and cheers throughout the cinema, plus on the way out and even onto the street, that film was the topic on everyone's lips.Hats off to Michael Moore. America should celebrate him. HE IS A WORLD HERO.</fullReview>

He instructs the equally dumb American media to drive "scare tactics" on the public so they can support him sending troops to Iraq to combat a so-called "terrorist threat" so his sinister "secret agenda" of getting the oil from Iraq as well as winning rebuilding contracts for his republican friend can be realized. Then all of a sudden, things seem go a bit sour.No.1:- No Weapon of Mass Destruction No.2:- Over 900 US troops got killed and thousands permanently wounded. Coffins and the wounded are sent back home with little or no media attention, the wounded needing lifelong treatment. The able bodied troops that are left in Iraq have to stay much longer and are now homesick.So now, who are the people that the government are targeting to join the army and "PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK" to help out in their ILLEGAL war effort? Yes you've guest right, its young black adults. Yes, the same black adults that were denied voting rights in the Florida 2000 election.Yes the majority of the US troops out in the FRONT LINE "which runs the highest risk of war casualty" in Iraq are usually black, Hispanics and poor whites. The Republicans see young black adults as fresh meat, people with no future, a convenient candidate to risk death or permanent injury just to help the rich white so-called upper class elite get richer.I like the part in the film where Michael Moore confronts Republican cabinet ministers to enlist their OWN children to fight in Iraq. They all responded by running away, ignoring him or looking at him like he was nuts. There is only one republican cabinet minister who has a kid fighting in Iraq.If I was in power, I would send Tony Blair, George Bush, Rupert Murdoch and the so?called upper class elite, every Republican cabinet member, their children and supporters of the war to Baghdad right in the heart of the fighting WITHOUT guns and ammunition. "Then they will understand the true meaning of terror." Yes, let them put their own lives and money where their mouths are, and do their own dirty work, along with the help of their war supporters.At the same time I will send the US troops along with the coalition troops back home. When the film finished, there was something else I had not witnessed in all my years of cinema going... There was a big long round of applause and cheers throughout the cinema, plus on the way out and even onto the street, that film was the topic on everyone's lips.Hats off to Michael Moore. America should celebrate him. HE IS A WORLD HERO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American people have been lied to this whole freaking time, and its about time that someone stood up and revealed the truth about President Bush. An excellent movie it had my eyes wide open with interest the whole time. Great movie would refer it to everyone before elections, and you'd just have to be ignorant not to see the truth. I was always sort of suspicious about our president, but this really clarified everything to me, and it also opened up more things about Bush that I haven't even heard of. I will try to inform anyone I can of this movie, and stress the importance of seeing this and being informed. Michael Moore is really a hero in portraying the real side of Bush and his administration!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to Michael Moore, you can place me in the category of "angry ex-fan." I greatly enjoyed "Roger and Me" and found about 2/3rds of "Bowling For Columbine" to be informative and entertaining. The final third, coupled with some of his remarks about the war in Iraq and the inevitable observation that, despite being funny and occasionally right, he is a sellout and a hypocrite, were enough to push me out of the "fan" column. "Fahrenheit 9/11" was almost enough to win me back. Almost.First, the film is nothing if not passionate. It is a powerful, sharply honed attack that will call people to action. Whether that action is nausea or voter mobilization depends on one's political orientation. Those who idolize George W. Bush (out of touch as some of them may be) would be well to stay away, as Moore's attack upon him is simply relentless. From the election controversy to the ranch visits in 2001 to ties to Saudi royals and beyond, Moore does not cut Bush an even break. Hell, he doesn't give him breathing room! In fact, Moore's assault upon Bush is so thorough that it actually detracts from the power of the film. Instead of a man asking some tough questions, we are occasionally left with the image of a man shouting, "I hate the president!" We knew that BEFORE we spent $9 on your movie, Mike.Once you can get past Moore's overt bias, the film does have a lot to offer. Moore's antics (reading the Patriot Act from an ice cream truck) are as funny as ever and some of his questions (why exactly WAS a Taliban official in the US in 2001 anyway) really do merit consideration. Even the most staunch critics of this film's message and ideology will have to admit that Moore did his homework this time around. The film is a blistering indictment chock full of factual information (service records, taped interviews, etc.) that cannot be categorically labeled as 'liberal propaganda.'Of course, Moore nearly undoes this newfound credibility every time he himself opens his mouth. For instance, he remarks that 'the black members of Congress were told to sit down and shut up' even though we see no such edict being issued. He also, in a poor attempt to channel Orwell, wraps up the film with a message that all wars are unjust, as the poor end up dying fighting them for the rich. What about wars fought for the benefit of the poor?I'm not about to address every point the film makes (as that would take more time than I am willing to spend), so I'll stick with what stood out most: 1.) The 2000 Election. Bush won. Get over it. The "scrubbing" of the polls isn't new to anyone who isn't living in a cave. What Moore doesn't mention, however, is that a number of military votes (most of which were pro-Bush) were scrubbed as well. Then again, telling the WHOLE truth has never been Moore's style. 2.) It's PRESIDENT Bush. Whether you like him or not, at least respect the office. Moore doesn't even do that much. His hatred is blinding. I don't think much of Bush either, but I don't spend my every living minute undermining him and plotting his destruction. 3.) Moore might be personally biased to the hilt, but the film itself is NOT an endorsement of the Democratic party. As was the case with BFC, he spends a good deal of time bashing Democrats. Whereas the previous target was Bill Clinton, Tom Daschle now gets a heavy dose of criticism. 4.) Just when I had Moore pegged as a flat-out traitor, he manages to redeem himself by showing the human side. He sat down and talked with troops, the families of troops, Marine recruiters, former government officials and more.Do you think they would have consented to any of it if they thought they were dealing with a traitor? Hell, Moore dedicated the film itself TO fallen troops and September 11th victims. That doesn't sound like a traitor to me. 5.) Moore spends a lot of time showing Bush and Co. combing their hair and prepping for TV. First of all, I'm pretty sure ANYONE undergoes similar preparation before going on air. Secondly, the sequence is of no real value to the film and inflates the running time by several wasted minutes.In conclusion, beware of this film and its reviews. "Fahrenheit 9/11" is the work of a left-wing nut and other left-wing nuts will praise it simply for that reason. Contrarily, right-wing nuts will condemn it for exactly the same reason (the difference being, many of their condemnations will result from never actually having WATCHED the film). Middle America may agree or disagree over its assertions, question/deride the validity of its arguments or use it as a point of reference, but at the very least it gets the conversation started. And, for that reason alone it is worth seeing.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an eye-opener</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard a lot about this movie before seeing it (Who didn't?) so I knew a little about what to expect. However, when I came out, I was shocked, stunned, dismayed etc.I don't go to the theatre to see movies very often, and it's been about 15 years since I went to an opening night. They are absolutely correct when they say this is not just a movie, it's an event. The theatre was packed and there was electricity in the air. The ushers were actually checking tickets for everyone, even if they had already gone in.I can't remember ever sitting with an audience that clapped, cheered, and just generally reacted to what they were seeing. I don't know if everyone was in agreement, but they were affected by what they saw. One man in front of me yelled out at the end as Bush was mangling yet another speech.Even though I gave the movie a ten, and I stand by my rating, it wasn't perfect. I didn't just willingly believe everything and I don't like the way some of the info was presented. (possible spoiler ahead)For example, the victims of the patriot act were all white and when he said, "do these people look like terrorists?" I thought to myself, "Well, they could be" If you watch it with an open mind that is all I ask. Don't just willingly believe all of it, and don't dismiss it outright either. It's important for everyone to have an open mind. If it's all true then Bush should be impeached and face jail time. Some people in the Bush camp won't watch it because they think it's untrue. This is denial. Why is it so difficult for these people to even entertain the idea that Bush has done wrong?That's what I have done. I am willing to believe, just like I was willing to believe it when Bush told us that Saddam had WMD's. I gave Bush a chance and he messed up. If they do find WMD's, then I will support Bush again.Another thing that was "wrong" with it was there was not enough info in it. I have read so much more about Bush since seeing it. I have been reading websites and books that go into a lot of detail about 9/11, things that were only touched on in Moore's movie.I have also been watching the right wing and I have seen their criticisms. These consist mainly of "It's not true" without any further explanation, and personal attacks on Moore's weight.So watch for yourself and judge for yourself, but most importantly, keep an open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We've heard "the other side."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually I was surprised. I had read a number of reviews, and I expected to see Michael Moore up front, preaching against Bush. Instead, I saw, mostly GW Bush, on camera. As a professor of economics, calling on students in class, I have seen them tongue-tied, lost, confused, and befuddled, but most of my students were just out of high school. GWB is President of the United States.The movie is entertaining, but thought provoking. The juxtaposition of the poor enlistees, the Iraq war wounded and dead, and GWB's political base hit home. The expression on the congressmen's face when asked if they would help their sons and daughters enlist was telling. I watched GWB with his daughters standing by, and remembered how Eisenhower was angry with Truman when Truman brought Eisenhower's son from the fighting in Korea to attend the inauguration of his father. Eisenhower said, "Truman had embarrassed him' His son shouldn't have left his men. Imagine GWB's daughters sacrificing by leaving the campaign to join the army and go with the troops into harm's way. Now that would impress me. The movie is one sided, but we have heard the other side in the speeches of Bush and others in his administration. I can't wait to see the tapes GWB's campaign people will drag up to show Clinton, Gore, and Carter shaking hands and chumming with the Saudi rich.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit that I went into this movie very skeptical about it, I figured it was just a load of political drivel....but it wasn't..at least not entirely.There were plenty of cooky jokes on Bush and the rest of his administration, the usual conspiracy theory (some of it valid, some of it a stretch) about connections between the Bush administration and our enemies in the war on terrorism, etc... but the most important part of the movie were the lives of ordinary people.Several times the film spent its focus on lives lost in Iraq, Afghanistan (on both sides), and emphasized a sense of needlesslness of it all.Like anything, such arguments about the reasons for a war are perpetual...yes, a dictorship was removed, yes there are economic benefits to the U.S. for going to war, and yes...there can be no diminshing of the torment and anguish over the lost of loved ones...civlian and combatant alike.But still, as with when it first happened, the one thing in the movie that tore my emotions asunder was the brief time spent on the actual attack on 9/11/2001. Moore chose to black out the screen and just give sounds... just hearing the jet-bys and impacts in the buildings made my mind swarm with thoughts of what horrible things must have been experienced by the victims...and thoughts of what in existence could possibly lead anyone to commit such whole sale slaughter...3,000...3,000 lives lost..many instantly. I didn't lose a love done in the attack, I wasn't anywhere close to it physically, but it still sends a chill down my spine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a great movie for people who like bush or dislike him.I never liked him before this movie came out.I tried to be reasonable because of course being the president of the u.s is not easy.By watching this movie most of my suspicions were true some, people might think other wise but i would rather not have George bush as a president any more.This movie really really opens up your eyes by letting you know so many things you would think a human being is not capable of.Even though people think this is all fake unfortunately it's not.Their is a very touching story of a mother who lost her son in the war.It breaks your heart to see things like that especially when they are not the only ones.We will probably never have a perfect president but i really think all that has happened in the last four years could of been prevented.Actually maybe not all things could have been prevented but at least most. This movie is not hurting anybody it's just showing the other side of the story.My opinion is that if none of this were true president bush would not of made such a big deal of it. Because by doing so it kind of showed me he had something to hide that he didn't want the American people to know. So go watch this movie and see the other side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*SPOILER* A movie that has touched me like no other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being such a big lover of IMDb and possessing such a great desire to have a positive long lasting relationship with the database, I will keep my comments brief. First off let me state the fact that I am a 22 year old man who does not cry easily (yes things have changed since the crybaby days of the '80s, heh). In the past three years there have been only two times where I have cried or could have cried intensely. The first was the day of Sept 11 itself. The second was watching Fahrenheit 9/11 with my mother. Let me emphasize that had I not restrained myself (lest my bawling disturb the other moviegoers) my crying over Fahrenheit 9/11 may have eclipsed that of my crying over the events of 9/11. *SPOILER* My first shudder was during the opening credits as the solo guitar song played. But what pushed me over the edge was the war commencing sequence for the war in Iraq. The juxtapositining of the U.S. Navy preparing to strike Iraq against Iraqi children was too much for me. For the remainder of the movie I had to restrain myself (with much difficulty).*END SPOILER* Exiting the theatre I guided myself and my mom to a side exit where I basically exploded in tears. I'm sorry if I've seemed a little too dramatic. I give this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

It was truly hilarious at times, which although compromised the integrity of the film made it accessible to a wider public audience.As a documentary it probably needed to scrutinies the facts more thoroughly.If I wasn't already convinced I don't think the evidence provided would persuade me of their verity. As usual Moore spent too long on individuals (such as the family who lost their son in their Iraq war) and relied heavily on one person's words over another. His likening of US foreign policy and the prophecies of George Orwell worked very well. In conclusion I liked the film and would stand well alongside a more serious critique of the Bush administration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Previous Moore films often contained original, new ideas.This one does not. Bush stole the election, helped by the fact that his brother Jeb was Governor of Florida, and later by the fact that the Supreme Court (Republican majority) blocked a recount of the votes - who didn't know it? Bush went to Iraq because the country's oil reserves are the world's second largest - who didn't know that? Bush convinced the American People to go to war by playing on fear and making up intelligence, with the complicity of the Brits - who didn't know that? The Army tends to recruit in the poorer ranks of society where young adults have two choices: the Army, or unemployment - who didn't know that? Young American adults got killed by the hundred in Iraq, Iraqi civilians including young children were killed by the thousand, all for nothing, the country's population will be worse off afterwards (most infrastructure destroyed) and it will become a breeding ground for terrorists - who could have been blind enough not to foresee it? Financial circles around Bush involve oil and construction companies, all looking forward to setting their hands on Iraq and making lots of money there (though this looks like it will not be so easy now) - who didn't know that? Sons of powerful politicians never get drafted for dangerous wars - duh. Bush cannot make an intelligent summary of a situation, cannot plan, cannot take decisions, does not know the most classical proverbs, and is, uh, not very smart - this was clear all along. Also, even when they were just repeating the obvious, earlier Moore films at least introduced some spice in the form of difficult interviews (or interview attempts) in difficult places. But there is hardly any of this here. The film would probably teach something to hard core Republicans - but they will never go see it, out of "loyalty". Yes, disappointing overall. I gave it a 7 and this is bordering on generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hit-and-miss, but good overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, at this point, it seems silly to argue any of the points Moore makes (or attempts to make) in this film, or to discuss the validity of any of his facts. All this has been covered in much detail by every journalist on the planet.What I will do, is analyze "Fahrenheit 9/11" as a piece of film. Let's get the bad news out of the way first: this film is fairly sloppily put together. It's rather disorganized and digresses way too often (sometimes even digressing from its digressions). However, as infuriating as the structure can be, the material is strong enough overall that it transcends the messy editing.In general, Moore executes his points very well. By now everyone has heard the tale of where Mr. Bush was when he heard of the second plane hitting the WTC on 9/11. Yet, nothing prepared me to see that look on our president's face. That was not the look of someone who is scared for the country he leads... it's the look of someone who wants very badly to pretend nothing is happening in the hopes it will just go away. Moore nicely juxtaposes INCREDIBLY disturbing comments from U.S. soldiers in Iraq with political blather about the humanitarian causes of war. He does the same trick a few minutes later when he shows the devastating effects of our bombs on Iraqi civilians as Rumsfeld gleefully rambles about our 'humane missiles'. Another chilling segment shows Bush practicing his 'serious look' before giving an address to the nation on September 11. Another nice move is Moore's refusal to spare Colin Powell in his lambasting of this administration. Sure, Powell may be the only voice of reason among Mr. Bush's peers, but he's a part of the public deception game, nonetheless.Of course, for every four hits in this film (of which there are dozens more I failed to mention), there's a major miss. His conspiracy theory about the 2000 election comes off as goofy left-field trash. His closing 'thank you' to those who are willing to fight for us reeks of trying to appease the masses, given his underlying attitude that war is pointless. Most of all (and I know many will hate me for saying this), an extended segment from the teary-eyed mother of a killed soldier falls embarrassingly flat. I do not question the woman's mental suffering, but she comes off so poorly on camera that Moore should know better than to put it in the film. On top of it, it's hard to see this segment as much more than the exploiting of this woman's loss to make a political point. Her running around Washington screaming "why me? why me?!" is not something the public should be seeing. What did Moore say to her? "I'm going to drive you to Washington and turn on the camera, and you freak out, okay?"?Let's talk about restraint. For the most part, Moore holds back from the absolute trashing of the president he could have made. Anyone who has read any of his work or looked at his website for ten seconds knows he absolutely hates the man. And making Bush look bad isn't hard to do. So Moore could have made a documentary on nothing but why George is a horrible leader. Yet instead, he mostly focuses on what one thing George has done that affects every American. This is very commendable. However, some bitterness is still lurking around the edges. He comments on the soft linen sheets Bush slept on the night of Sept. 10. Who cares? I bet Moore did too, as well as most other Americans. Linen is a popular material to make sheets out of. Some of his 'Bushisms' are pulled out of context and sound far worse that way, notably the president's comments on dictatorship. Footage of Bush being on vacation seems a bit silly too. Is Bush a bad leader because he likes to go hunting? Geez, if only Moore had someone around him to say "Man, don't put that in there... you're undermining your own cause." As far as entertainment value goes, Moore does a good job of balancing comedy with the incredibly dark subject matter. Amazingly, I probably smiled or laughed about every 5 minutes of the movie, which is nice for a movie filled with images of countless dead and wounded. However, much like "Columbine" I couldn't help but feel that it drags quite a bit in its last 20 minutes. It's too long. I say that about more than half of the movies I see, but I'm always right. I don't understand the controversy over this film. Like I said, it's in no way a bash-Bush marathon. I mean, come on... Bush wants to destroy all nature, have maniacal Christian Fundamentalists rewrite our Constitution, and make us all eat oil for dinner at night. Yet, Moore doesn't even touch these subjects (okay, maybe the oil a bit). Instead, he focuses on making a case for America's great modern tragedy: death and destruction on a mass scale because of this administration's ability to weave a good story and scare the crap out of everyone.Moore succeeds at making his point, despite the film's many flaws. I can't imagine seeing this and still thinking Bush is a good leader and there's a good reason to be blowing stuff up in Iraq. I give him bonus points for sheer boldness: this has to be the most direct political statement ever made on film. He also does a good job of making a watchable piece of work, despite the excessive length. Score: 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere in this will be a review of Michael Moore's film "Fahrenheit 9/11," but in order to really review it, I need to speak of other things, perhaps, so bear with me.I went into this film with the understanding that every reviewer, whether someone from the media or someone on-line here had indicated the film was brilliant, but was clearly biased propaganda. Even though my political views are quite close to Moore's, I still went into this film with a cynical perspective, wanting to separate fact from carefully arranged fact. Obviously, there is much in this film that is clearly subjective. When Mr. Moore makes, in his narration, little barbs at George W. Bush's expense, one knows this is not fact. One understands that when he interviews people critical of Bush administration decisions, there must be people who could defend those decisions equally well. And one understands some conclusions he arrives at about Bush are based on more circumstantial than direct evidence.[spoilers] Beyond a certain point, however, I stopped paying attention to that. Many have noted that there is little if anything in "Fahrenheit 9/11" that hasn't been told before. But like any good detective, Moore pieces together a lot of little facts to make a decimating impression not only of Bush and Republicans, but of the corruption of American business and its literal exploitation of the mindlessly huge tragedy of Iraq for nothing other than profit. But this is hardly all it is. Moore's mission is also to put into perspective and put a human face on that mindlessly huge tragedy. Yes, there can be people to counter Moore's interviewees as to why Bush made decisions he did. But is there anyone who can sufficiently counter the genuinely intelligent patriot who loses her son and her belief in her government and its war, or the soldiers missing limbs, or the Iraqi civilians screaming in agony over their dead? [end spoilers]I doubt there's ever been a documentary that hasn't assumed a point of view. Is it truth?Truth is what sells best in the marketplace of ideas and this film shows many things represented as truth by the media far less credible than what Mr. Moore presents. Whether that makes him a visionary or a con man depends on what what the future tells us was and wasn't true. I came out of this movie weeping. Driving home I even had to pull off the road to wipe my eyes because my tears were making it difficult to drive. That this film did this is a testament to Mr. Moore's content and the matchless ability with which he shapes it into what I have to say must be considered first and foremost a documentary, and one that transcends its form to become life itself, maddening, bitter, humorous, shocking, heartbreaking.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say that hasn't been said before? This movie/documentary is incredible. It is so powerful, and scathing of Bush's administration. I was a protester against the war and this movie hit the nail on the head for how I felt and also brought facts to light I didn't know, and is a must-see for all voters. It is not objective, nor does it pretend to be, but Moore does a great job of arguing his points. It is impressive, powerful, and all-around incredibly done! I want to see it again to get everything. Seeing this documentary makes me want to go out and protest all over again.I definitely agree with Ebert and Roeper: It's an important documentary to see whether you are against the war, in favour of the war, or undecided, and everyone over 12 should see this.I also think the way he handled the attacks on the World Trade Centres were perfect. He didn't show it-- a good movie, no one wants or need to see that, and that would have ruined it. He blacks out the screen, plays the sound effects, then shows the debris falling and people in shock-- very effective and hauntingTwo thumbs WAY up for this incredible documentary</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing, but not brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this movie but it disappointed me. I suppose this was mainly because I was already familiar with the main revelation of the film, namely the connections between the Bush family and the Bin Ladens. I have also seen much worse images from the Iraq war.In terms of comedy there are some good moments. However, I miss the wisecracking and stunts that Moore used to do in TV nation and his other movies. Reading the Patriot Act while driving an ice cream van was an attempt but it doesn't come off.Some of it appears a little manipulative, especially focussing on widows of the war. Grief tends to obscure the bigger picture. On the other hand this is how it is. Soldiers go to war and some die, often pointlessly. Drop bombs on a crowded city and you will kill civilians, even kite-flying children.Moore had such good material to work with it is a shame he couldn't do more with it. From the rabid right wing nature of the Bush adminstration, to the astonishing mismanagement of the Iraq war there is so much to choose from. For those in the US who rely on Fox and CNN for news, this documentary could be truly eye-opening. For the rest of us, it is disappointing that it does not have more bite, but it is worth seeing all the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ouch, it's hot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not really worthy of the Cannes award because, when Bush/Cheney are voted out in November, it will lose it's primary element of interest.Still, right now, it is stunning.If you happen to be a president or vice president, or a company taking/giving money from/to them, you'll be looking for water to help with the burn.And even a year from now, the soundtrack will still be better than any of the lame soundtracks I've heard this summer. There are few films so far this year that are as exciting or funny. Not even Spiderman 2 keeps pace. Considering it is a documentary, Moore deserves at least a pat on the back for taking documentary film-making to a higher level.My only serious complaint about the film is that Moore spent too much time with that flag waving jesus woman and not enough on many of the additional facts that would have made his case even stronger. Part of that can be blamed on timing, but even most of the stuff that the mainstream news is finally getting around to reporting now had been reported and verified by independent organizations, not to mention people that had been actually working for the president, a year or more ago.I think Moore may have assumed too much public knowledge in some areas, such as with Halliburton. He probably should have tried to make this more as an intelligence brief for the people that rely on Fox News and the Wall Street Journal as their only news sources. They simply lack the context that even people watching the other news cheerleaders have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God Bless Lila Lipscomb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've already reviewed this film, somewhere below, but after reading some totally ignorant snipes here and elsewhere, I feel really moved to add this to it:God bless Lila Lipscomb. She and mothers and fathers like her are the moral conscience of this nation, and have every right to be. Part of the movie may be opinion-driven (although well-backed with absolutely damning facts), but the part with Lila Lipscomb is absolutely, 100% documentary -- her words, her voice, her (and our) tragedy. It's a crying shame to see her so cavalierly belittled and dismissed in public by Bush functionaries and partisans. How dare they? Worse, they engage in outright lying about the subject, calling her variously a fraud, an unwilling victim of Moore, or a simple-minded patsy. None of which is true! Mrs. Lipscomb has been interviewed numerous times in the press since this movie's US release, and absolutely confirms that a) she WANTS her and her son's story told, b) Moore is a gentleman and a "softie" and was not exploiting her, c) she was offered on multiple occasions editorial veto power on her segments (which she saw no need to exercise), and most importantly d)she thinks the movie is patriotic.Not only that, she has made public appearances with the film at benefit showings for various groups and at premieres, and speaks quite movingly and eloquently. This is no dummy, folks! This should be as much proof of legitimacy and support as anyone should need, even Rush. (Why does he keep lying?)As Americans and as Patriots, we all owe her our heart-felt sympathy for her loss and thanks for her son's service. We also owe it to the country to make sure that we don't reelect what Moore has helped publicly expose as perhaps the most dishonest, corrupt, and evil "Commander in Chief" that this nation has ever had. And, aside from all that, it's STILL a great movie! Absolutely riveting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the new "American Documentary"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt compelled to comment on this film, not because I think it is bad or good, or because I question or champion its merits as a piece of information or of art. As a non-American I don't have more than a passing interest in American politics (that is, I am informed about the parties and may discuss them with friends, but I can't vote and I'm not directly affected by them). I would like to think, therefore, that I can watch or evaluate "F-9/11" from a somewhat detached viewpoint.While I think this film may be groundbreaking for many people, it was not for me. I've seen much of this information written or broadcast elsewhere, often in better format. I can also form my own opinions and observe (obviously outside of classified or secret information) what is happening in the world and what consequences certain events have. This movie doesn't say anything any intelligent, media and world- aware person can't figure out for themselves.It is also extremely problematic. Not, as many people have said, in the fact that it's undeniably biased and slanted (realistically, every film, including documentaries, contains the bias of the filmmaker, and it's pretty pretentious to think this can be avoided), but in the fact that everything is seen in simple terms. Black and white, right and left, whatever you like (as is often seen in Hollywood movies). Bush is either good or bad. The war in Iraq and reasons for it are boiled down to simplicities (despite the maze of facts given to support these simplicities). Things are never so basic in "real life". Consider, for instance, the fact that oil is the world's most valuable commodity. If the war in Iraq is almost entirely based on oil, people who rail against this must consider their own consumption of it, and how they would react if America's oil supply was to run out. Once they could no longer drive their cars, would they feel the same way about a war driven by oil? It is difficult to say, of course, because this situation is perhaps very far off. And while it's undeniably tragic that Iraqi people are being killed in this conflict, Moore unashamedly uses pictures of bloody children to elicit an emotional response- War creates jobs, war makes money, war kills babies. Stop the war. I don't agree with Bush, and I don't support the war, but I can also realize that the equation (or the war)can't really be this simple, as Moore leads us to believe it is. And exactly how does he think he's going to change people's minds about the war by showing these images? Anyone who is against it, was so long before seeing them, and anyone who is for it will find a way to justify so-called civilian casualties.Moore is often accused of being sentimental, or sensational, and he often is these things, but to a large extent he's also feeding us information, and we are expected not to question it because he's supposedly separate from the machine(s) that govern and control America. It's always a mistake, in my opinion, to believe everything you're told without doing a little research or thinking it out on your own, regardless of whether the information is coming from the Bush administration or from Michael Moore. Imagine, for instance, the volume of information that was left out of this film. Moore and his editors are very shrewd (this is also seen in "Bowling for Columbine." All that said, this is quite a valuable film, if it shows even one viewer that there is always more information behind the TV news and what the media tells us, or if it convinces even one person to stop being insanely afraid of terrorists. Take it at face value and don't try to go too deep- there's not much there. Moore is a typical American filmmaker. He's the Spielberg of documentary. And this is the new American documentary- a little sensational, a little patriotic, slightly fictional, a few valuable facts, emotionally manipulative... and it tells you what to think, so you don't have to form your own opinions. And I like my documentaries to present the facts, even if they are biased, and let me come to my own conclusions. If you want to watch a good American documentary, check out Errol Morris ("The Thin Blue Line", or even "The Fog of War") and don't place too much weight on Michael Moore (absolutely no pun intended).</fullReview>

Does anyone realize the crippling effect this is having on our economy and local businesses? What about the skyrocketing price of commodities and raw materials??? I buy raw materials for a factory, and things have been a total meltdown ever since Bush took office. Bush has taken no action except a half-hearted attempt at steel tariffs that have already expired. Everyone buys milk, butter, bread. . . Notice any change in prices lately?

		<shortDescription>Incendiary stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a must-see movie whose images live long in the mind. Written, narrated, produced and directed by the maverick Michael Moore - who has, almost single-handedly, reinvented the political documentary - this is a tour-de-force which deconstructs the simple-mindedness, dishonesty and corruption at the heart of the Bush administration. It is not fair or balanced, it is frequently outright satirical, it is sometimes too personalised, and (at one point at least) it is frankly cheap (the effort to persuade Congressmen to send their sons to war). But we know before we go into the cinema that this is not a standard documentary but a personal polemic and it is all the more powerful and impressive for that.From the opening scenes - where we are reminded of how differently it should all have been (since Al Gore actually won the Presidential election of 2000) - the visuals are captivating. So often, Bush destroys himself by his vacant stare or his banal comment or totally inappropriate behaviour. The testimony from a dead soldier's mother from Moore's home town of Flint is very moving and the footage from Iraq itself, obtained while with US troops, is deeply disturbing. It reveals the class divide in America - poor, often black, men fighting wars that make rich, white men even richer - in a political system that likes to deny the concept of class. Indeed this is a very a rare work: a political film that might actually influence politics.</fullReview>

Yes, it does express Michael Moore's opinion, and sadly enough it does express many truths that can't be denied. It is an American movie. C'mon here, all film makers express some sort of opinion in their movies. Shindler's list? Primary Colors? American History X? oh yea, I forgot "dude? wheres my car"....that movie can be called bias against dumb people. Yes, these movies are all made out to be dramas or comedies and not a documentary. But in some way, there's an opinion that is being expressed by the director. What's so wrong for Michael Moore to put an opinion in his movie with facts to support it? This movie gives more attention to the people who the media forgot about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't think of a single way to improve this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was skeptical about the film at first. I saw "Bowling for Columbine" some time ago, and though I liked it, I knew that it was so biased and skewed that any conservative seeing it would rip it apart. I was afraid that Fahrenheit would also only serve to polarize, and would do no great good for the anti-Bush cause. A friend of mine with a born-again Baptist, republican boyfriend was going to see the film and wanted to take the guy. I advised her against doing so, as knowing Moore's style, I feared that it would only make her boyfriend scream "Viva Bush." But, after the film, the guy was really impressed and now wants to see "Bowling for Columbine."Now that I've seen the film, I understand that I was very wrong. I think that Moore did a splendid job of packaging all the information that was on the back pages of the newspapers throughout the past three years. The movie is rather factual, and though it isn't as much "fun" as Bowling, it is an experience. As far as forcing people to think and re-evaluate the actions of this administration, I can't think of a single thing to change about this film that would make it more effective.Someone told me that the film would have been more effective if it wasn't so one-sided. Indeed, Moore only presents his view of the events. Perhaps, if all points were presented from both sides, and the viewer was free to decide who is more sincere, Fahrenheit would be more of a cinematic artistic success. But, I view this film as simply an answer to the side that we've been hearing for the past three years. As in a debate, this is the counter-argument to statements from Bush such as "The world is safer now that we have conquered Iraq." Statements like this have gone largely unchallenged in the headlines, and it's about time that Moore answered.Overall, taking the past three years as a whole, media has not been presenting us with a balanced view of what is going on, and Moore does a bit to redress that.Also, my wife, who was under the World Trade Center as it was collapsing, cried uncontrollably during many parts of the film. We both think that it was incredibly powerful, even though most of the facts in it are already known to us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We can always say that this movie reflects only Michael Moore's interpretation of the events ... But even if it's 1% true only, this is still interesting to see how people can be manipulated into thinking what someone wants them to think.There are a lot of good moments where you can have a good laugh. Brittney Spears' comments about Bush comes at a very good time in the movie, for example.But there are also very strong moments, like the first part on Iraq, where you see civilian Iraqis killed by US soldiers, just because they were there. This is not blaming US soldiers, because they are doing what they are told, and what they are taught. But this is also showing that the world is not composed only of US citizens, but there are other people with a right to live in the world.There is also a very good part on the US soldier that discovers, after wanting to kill every Iraqi he met, that there is no sense in this war. The letter received by that woman from her killed son is, I think, very meaningful of what a young American (or a young person at war for his country somewhere in the world) can feel ..I have always thought this war never should have been ... But I will probably not get any friends in the US for that. However, I just hope this gives some thinking material to US citizens once they see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all i have to say that my English is not so good. Now I have to say that Michael Moore did a nice job with 9/11. Putting question marks on minds is not easy and I think 9/11 is doing this. Did anyone recognized that George looks like a godfather? He has all this power and he knows that, he doesn't cares what American people doing or what they are thinking about this war or anything. He has a face like which you can read that he doesn't cares who dies in Iraq, civilians or American soldiers.There is nothing in this documentary that Micheal Moore is telling that we don't know actually. Bush and Saudi connection was a fact and was always there. We know that the only reason why America is in iraq is the petrol (Well as we know not just iraq). We know that America is trying to put fear in its own people heart like they did in cold war (with all this nuclear bombs and communist). We know who is going to make the biggest profits from this war and who is going to pay with their lives. With all this facts that we already know, did we really need to watch 9/11 to recognize it? Or are we just too lazy or busy to see the facts. Well 9/11 can be a good educational documentary for my 12 year old boy but thats all. If you guys feel like that everything you saw in 9/11 was something that you don't know then the question is, where you guys been all this time?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More to the Film than Bush bashing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a bigger message here than just Bush's mistakes. It has to do with a failure of the public to listen to what's happening, and a failure of the press and other media to tell us when the emperor has no clothes on. All the information in the film was available to us but we were too lazy to get it, and too easy to accept the spin put on by Bush Cheney and Rumsfeld. The press reported what Bush was saying and not what he was doing. When he started to move substantial numbers of troops to Iraq's boarders it was clear that we would invade. Yet Bush kept telling us that we could avoid war, when he had no intention of stopping the invasion. Where was the press? It has to do with having a leader with Bush's ignorance of history and a lack of appreciation of war's consequences. The country elected an under educated and under read president who couldn't imagine what would be the consequences of his actions. He is a person who must rely on the judgment of others because he does not know enough to exercise judgment of his own. He needs to have his people give him alternatives to choose from. Hence the seven minutes of inaction after hearing about the second plane hitting the world trade center. I think Moore hit the nail on the head when he guessed that Bush just didn't know what to do. He needed to have Cheney or Rumsfeld give him some alternative courses of action to choose from, and they weren't there. So he just sat. When Bush does make a decision it's not based on what he learned from history or on an appreciation of the consequences of his actions, instead its based on what his faith tells him to do.This thinking is what resulted in the Iraq mess.What the message of the movie is to me is that the people in the USA need to have an appreciation of what war is really like, and how bad the consequences will be. We need to see the bodies dismembered and lying on the ground. We need to see bombs explode, people getting shot, and the soldier's stumps and artificial limbs. We need to have a number from the pentagon as to how many of the 5000+ wounded have artificial limbs, are blind, are paralyzed, or are destroyed mentally. We need to see the pain of the mother in Flint, and how it is magnified by the fact the war was a war of choice. We need see the pain of Iraqis and realize they hurt just as badly as we hurt. We need put a number on how many have been killed, is it 10,000 or 30,000.Who is shown by the film to be ultimately responsible? It is us: the people, the press and especially the Congress. The people swallow anything the President tells them. The press won't report what is really going on. And congress seems willing to go to war as long as their sons and daughters don't have to do any of the fighting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing expose of democracy gone bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it probably isn't news to most of the world that democracy in America has long been more a fact of advertising than a fact of life, the degree to which the corporate news media practice censorship is bound to shock even the staunchest knee-jerk Bush supporters.Starting with the reporting of the election, censorship of the Senate refusal to support the protest by African-American Congress members, through the egging of the presidential car on its way to the inauguration, this film documents the shocking failure of the press to honour its obligation to the American people.The movie is an understated indictment of the coup which put and maintains George Bush in power, and as such could have been sub-titled "The Triumph of Mediocrity".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider myself a critical and political thinker. This movie heightened my dislike, distaste and disappointment with a man my country calls its president.The argument by his supporters (and sadly there are many) is that the movie's scenes are unfairly presented out of context. A cinematographer, I am not. But it doesn't take one (even a really good one) to realize what an incompetent this man really is. How unfit he is to drive a car let alone run a country.He is smug, arrogant (without cause) and is as out of touch with the American public as a Vulcan would be at a NYC Circuit Party. An American Idol judge once described a contestant as,"..you and Latin music go together like an onion and chocolate ice cream...". His attempts at being President of the United States are similar in taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most important movies of our time. Michael Moore cannot get enough praise for having the courage to put out there what has truly been a great cover-up, and affecting all our lives. In a vastly entertaining, engrossing and edifying way, Moore has transcended the silence of the media and given us so much information that hasn't been reaching the people of the United States and the world. If it appears to be a conspiracy, well, it is!Moore did his research, and presented the truth about the Bushes, et al., their buddies the Saudis, and how as ordinary people we are all suffering because of their greed for money and power. Moore has shown how a tiny group of the highest order of criminals are running our country and how powerless most people are to do anything. I thank him for doing what he's done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not going to tell you about the movie. If you have seen it, i don't need to. I you haven't seen it, you better do.The movie opened today in Belgium (europe?). Can't say the place was full but then i guess a wednesday afternoon with poring rain is not really the moment to fill up a theater. Reaction of the public? Laughter in the hilarius moments, deadly quit when things got real. In the end there was applause, again not a lot, but more then i ever heard, we don't applaud in movies.On leaving, there was a line waiting, and the press was around asking people their opinions.Man was i glad i could go out in the pouring rain, it really was the weather that reflected my mood best.What struck me most are these American boys and girls that are fighting right now in Iraq. I don't dare them calling men and women, they are boys and girls. Many look hardly older then the 17 R-rating age.THEY (almost) MAY NOT GO AND WATCH THIS MOVIE, BUT THEY MAY GO TO FIGHT AND DIE IN IT !!Over here, when I was young, there was a military draft, so most of the military age guys ended up serving their year in the army. Service could be delayed by studies. I first went to college and then to the army.Those boys &amp; girls who now fight and die in Iraq were hoping to first serve in the army and then to college. Some will never make it.It is an injustice!! It is an injustice that starts all the way at the bottom, and goes all the way to the white house. Michael Moore brings this to the screen. Go and see this movie Spread the word ACTPeace</fullReview>

Once again "Michael Moore" raises so many controversial questions "in your mind" and to the public eye about how we, as the "general public" are so programmed to think and believe what the media delivers. And also how and why we [as a society] have become so powerless to change it. If you like political and social Melodrama and cutting edge technology film-making, you need to see this film. It is films like this and "bowling for Columbine" and "the Big one" that make Cinema well worth going to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie 3 times before i made up my mind about it, and I read a lot of forums and articles about it. I really believe the movie could have been much shorter... the first hour really delivers sufficient blows to make even the most cynical of conservatives think. I Live in the UK and the BBC reports the current political events very differently to the US news broadcasts i have seen. I mean had we been shown that kind of ambiguity and lack of answered questions in the months leading to the decision to invade Iraq by Tony Blair, he would have been instantly ridiculed. In the UK the political debate about going to war begun much later only when the US decided they had enough reasons to go in and summoned their ally did we have to start deciding whether Britain should answer the call. Watching the US President blatantly not disclosing information and not even giving reasons for it, to us Europeans it looks incredible. If a politician is asked something and he replies in that vague ambiguous manner that Michael Moore shows many US Govt Official using it would look like a comedy. Not even the ever dramatic Italian parliament delivers comedy on this level, and they fist fight over soccer matches! I can't believe the American people actually voted for this clown! Thank you for showing us Europeans that despite your infinite superiority you are not perfect! You guys mess up just as much as us except with a much bigger magnitude (you guys like to do things 'BIG' the American Way! So unless somebody does mange to discredit Moore on the Important facts, not the little details, this documentary maker form Flint Michigan( God everybody knows about Flint now ,Ha!) has made a movie that might topple the scales of what the movie depicts to be one of the most dangerous clan of people on Earth!

		<fullReview>I really did not intend to see this film, but unexpectedly my brother expressed an interest in checking it out. Unexpectedly as my brother, like my aunt, likely had voted for Bush in 2000. My aunt had already sent an email with the title "Unfarenheit" so I guess she had missed the Fox News memo that all references to it should officially play off 7-11.Yawn...But hey, at least they both did see the film. The reason I intended not to is that I thought I would be largely familiar with what Moore was trotting out. And honestly I was, although I was not aware of the roll call of representatives desperately seeking a senator. And yes I am aware that John Kerry was a senator then. Al Gore lost the "dot race" a long time before that.Anyways back to this film per se, which will prove difficult in any review, professional or otherwise... Another even more fascinating element was the heat-seeking doggedness of the two military recruiters. Those bad-video-game "Army of One" ads don't have anything on these sales soldiers. It would be interesting to watch an entire documentary on those in that career.I didn't laugh very much (the Dragnet collage got me...I confess). Thankfully he left off freedom fries wrapped in duck tape and so forth. I did cringe a lot; not just when the rest of the audience was laughing, but at the barrage of the blistered and bombed bodies. The sub-plot of the Lila Lipscomb brought forth the most complicated emotions... While I cannot comprehend her grief, the tragic circumstances certainly were not incomprehensible.With two young infants myself, it is harder and harder for me to "theoretically" contemplate the draft. Even though I know it and social security are probably in the same vote-proof "lock-box"...even though I can guess the economic trajectory of my life, while not senatorial in stature, should likely dodge the issue, I still find myself wondering if as an aspect of our democracy, mandatory conscription would not be fitting; albeit with options like they have in Germany.This country is worth dying for, this government however may not be. It seems like it never has been in my adult life. This film sure won't stem the flooding tide from Watergate coursing on down. At the same time, mass graves anywhere in the world require intervention. I think this is the "civil rights" issue of our day, though I don't think isolationists will look as ugly and outdated as racists eventually. But do file me with the liberals who think we should be in Iraq today...Again the specter around this film, and around politics in general, is far more complex than any "evil axis" type of thinking. Any time I hear a politician use the word "evil" I'm immediately preparing to set my jaw against them...the problem for me with this film is that I think Moore paints with the same limited colors too much. Additionally he tosses in a plea for simple decency for the troops (that's where one battle today is it seems, whose troops are ultimately "ours?")Another skirmish seems to be broken out along the line of "if only 10% of this film is true..." Well 10% of this film is true in relation to *any* political candidate (Kucinich merited a 9.8% but we can round up.) The Republican responding volley aims for the film as de facto (and yet factless they would have us believe) campaign financing. My opinion regarding the film...see it with someone you are least likely to agree with. Then have a meal with them, and talk about whatever issues spring out of the film for you. For my brother and I it was unwarranted wiretapping...I was surprised at my difficulty in conveying to him what a bad thing this would be.Or skip the film, but don't skip the meal. I know it is tough for folks who put in 40 (or 50 or 60) hours a week to digest a seven-discourse meal. I know that presidential elections can seem to have all the trappings of student body elections (with no option to vote for Mickey Mouse). But we owe it to ourselves, we owe it to our kids, and we owe it to the thousands of Michael Pedersens.Yours for a better world (and film, this gets a 6/10 for me...)</fullReview>

This piece felt a little bit more as a serious punch-documentary compared to his "Bowling for Columbine", and were not really that mixed up with as much jokes as we are used to when Mr. Moore is in control of the production. You really get tensed, seeing all these facts that binds the U.S commander-in-chief with the drill for oil in Iraq, the help to the Bin Laden's, and so much more. It's a strong experience, and I, always being an complete piece of anti-Bush, do feel after seeing this that hopefully all republicans (and all other innocent Americans) will wake up from their sleep in the fire, and regain control and peace in their country.

The scenes where Moore is trying to get the members of Congress to sign up their children to fight in the military is very frightening.

		<shortDescription>What is it about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the old days, when I grew up, the world of cinema was so wonderful, so simple. There were the bad guys with overpowering arms, usually wearing uniforms that would make it easier to spot them. Sure, they had more people, more guns, more of anything, but they were not on God's side and they would eventually lose against a few but brave rebels who were in possession of "the force" or just armed with dry humor and cool little gadgets that could fit in a wrist watch. At the same time, the world stage of politics was quite simple too. Out there were the evil communists that wanted to get us, our freedom, our money, maybe even our women (although I am not so sure about that). Ever since the evil commies are gone things have become more and more confusing to the point that a good nation like ours is hated by so many uh... terrorists. Why would anyone with self respect hate a peace loving, law abiding nation like us? I hoped this movie would try to answer that question. It did not. It is one of the few political movies of the liberal side coming out of the United States of A. that gets media attention, probably because you cannot ignore a movie that has won the Palme d'Or, a prize that used to go to slick Hollywood productions in the past. Probably even more so because it will make profit. And so it does. Funny at times, it shows what anybody who reads independent news already knows. There is little to learn from it in terms of research. That actually might be the most shocking truth about the film: The public of the United States of A. knew the facts for months if not years - to no effect, some calling them lies to this day. Then there is the human face of warfare, suppressed by the propaganda machine of the US Government (in South America we would be the first to call it "Junta") - and yes - even super equipped warriors fighting men out of computerized tanks and helicopters might get hurt once in a while. We kind of could have guessed that too. The film tries to end the reign of a possibly never elected president of the United States of A. and it might even succeed.Does that change anything? Didn't Moore make the same kind of movies when the so called other party ruled? It is a great film for what it is: good entertainment, ridiculing a ridiculous president, then again giving a little glimpse into the sad reality of life that is not polished by the glamor of Hollywood. One part I found chilling: US soldiers killing humans on a screen as if it were an old fashioned black and white arcade game. It is Moore at his best, trying to understand the violence the US of A stands for.The movie, given all its merits, fails for me in one point. It hardly ever touches on the hubris of a society that feels supreme in an almost Nietzschean Uebermensch way, ready to execute and expand the Monroe doctrine (the US has the natural right to domain the Pacific, the Atlantic, the world), committing 200+ years of world wide genocide and pirate wars while, simultaneously, feeling like being God's blessing to the face of the world. It's probably asking too much of a movie anyway, and I guess this humble realization of mine might have only coincided with the timing of its release. It is quite painful to imagine what the film could have actually shown, and maybe the people of the United States of A. can be thankful for that. Fahrenheit is entertainment, it is documentary, it is political, but to what degree? Will Fahrenheit do anything beyond the purpose of entertainment, which is to make you laugh, cry or feel horror? Will it stop the country from being driven entirely by the logistics of business? Will it make "The liberal Americans" (no, not the Brazilians, the Mexicans, the Argentinians, the Canadians) feel better about the greatness and freedom of their nation by giving proof that someone has the guts to critique a possibly illegal government with a funny documentary? Will it make Michel Moore richer? No, no, and uh... double yes. Hey, it's just a movie, so relax, whoever you are.</fullReview>

You see a number of victims looking up into the heavens. All watching the same thing above, you never get to see the horror of the towers. Michael Moore begins his masterpiece with the historical awe of 9/11. Later, we begin to see comedy that does justice to its audience. Many documentaries are unable to have both tears and laughter, but this does. The audience is not force feed a message of hate or political advice to vote Democrat. The audience is being reminded how this all happened and why. How we got to where we are today and how Bush got himself in the White House.

		<fullReview>Despite the fact that this documentary, on many occassions, used statements made by bush and his staff to discredit almost everything he'd done since he took over, there was not a single lie here. Bush has set up America to put up a public display of incompetence in front of the rest of the world that we only knew from the actions of France (lol). Seriously, the documentary tries to justify Bush's attack on Iraq, and suggests that all things remaining equal, and assuming, that Bin Laden and Al Qaeda were responsible for 9/11, why Bush chose to let the Bin Laden family leave America without questioning them like so many other Middle Eastern or South East Asians were. The documentary also attempts to explain why Bush went into Iraq, and does a pretty good job of connecting the attack on Iraq to leniency shown to the Bin Laden family. All in all, it shows that there is no justification or reason for American presence in Iraq. Also, despite the fact that there is not any solid proof that shows that Bin Laden was responsible for 9/11, when the US agreed that he was responsible for it, he was still given plenty of time before the US military actually attacked where they though he was. All in all, fantastic. It's funny, entertaining, disturbing and will give you an insight into the business that George Bush runs, and holds more dear to his heart than the United States of America. And for the love of God, tell the Texan doofus to stop playing golf on camera and making lousy comments. We know he's a fool; he doesn't need to put that on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a passionate person and believes in his cause, and this movie reflects that. As he himself says that he made this documentary in order to get rid of Gearge W. Bush, and boy did he do a good job! I am not American and even then when I saw it I was really filled with strong emotions. F9/11 makes a great case as to why Bush family has screwed this country, and possibly the rest of the world. Most of the accusations have been backed by some form of fact or another. Though I am not a lefty or a righty, and so after the initial shock, I did feel that I was used and this was an exaggeration so I did look up most of the things he said on the net and some of the stuff was verifiably true.That Michael Moore will be a victim of his reputation is also inevitable. Most right wingers will never like it or agree to it. But then no one can change their views. I wish anyone who watches this movie, either right wing or left wing, should not get carried away by emotions and after watching should at least try to try to verify the all the facts, and I guarantee that he/she would be find that most of them would be found to be true.I must say that I felt touched by the movie because it made me realize the true cost of war, a war without any reasons, and I do hope that Bush doesn't come to power again so that the world can be a more peaceful place.*** SPOILER ***The accusation that Michael Moore makes that Bush stole the election of Florida, is such a serious charge that if true it would be a huge slap in the face of the democracy of this country. It should be investigated till either it is proved or disproved. Also why didn't any senator approve/recommend (dont remember the right word) the statements made by the African American Congressman, that the names of their constituents were missing from the Ballot. I would like to know this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fahrenheit 9/11 bound to inflame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is likely that most of those who go to see this movie will be people who already don't like Bush, given the pre-release publicity. Some who see it and some who will never see it will call director Moore names like "anti-American" and "America-Hater". But, really Independents and Republicans are the ones who should see this movie. There are those who would pick at details about historical accuracy but the main thrust of this movie is perspective, not history. The film is not just about Bush bashing. It is about perspective on our relationships with despotic governments we do business with and the military conflicts we have with them. It is the film maker's perspective and he does not try to hide that. Moore lays out the way he sees our decades old cozy relationships with dictators and theocracies in the Middle East that feed our oil interests. These are regimes that habitually and systematically trample on human rights. This is serious perspective bound to inflame some people, especially those who tout themselves as promoters of "American Values". Moore expresses his perspective in a hilarious way, however. The film mixes extremely serious and disturbing subject matter with an outrageously comical presentation. Moore uses images in the American popular culture past and present to make his point and express his humor. This is the essence of Moore's comic genius. And Moore allows Bush to reveal himself with his own words. The movie displays Bush without the GOP marketing machine behind him. The many film clips of Bush looking ridiculous and saying the dumbest things is just laugh-out-loud funny. Michael Moore creates movies designed to elevate the consciousness of the public. He does so because he loves America and wants to make America a better place by exposing the institutional corruption in the system that harms all of us. There is nothing anti-American about it. The film is anti-stupidity. But any good psychiatrist will tell you an elevation in the patient's consciousness can generate anger and depression. No doubt this movie will make a lot of people very mad. Moore's detractors will say he is "out of the mainstream", but those figures in history who elevate the public consciousness are never in the mainstream and they always make a large segment of the public very mad. Those who disagree with Michael Moore should tell us why they disagree rather than just call him "anti-American". They need to tell us why they believe it was a good idea for Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush to arm Islamic militants in Afghanistan in the 1980's who later formed the Taliban. They need to tell us why they believe arming the Dictator, Saddam Hussein in the 1980's who later invaded Kuwait was a good thing. They need to tell us why they think it's OK to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia and other oil producing countries we do business with. But most of all they need to tell us why they believe GW Bush turning the Dictatorial State of Iraq in to a destabilized Terrorist State was a good thing. They need to tell us how they can justify chicken hawks like the Bush administration sending everyone else's kids to die in Iraq but not their own. You can pick at the details in this movie but the facts remain about how the right wing corrupts our great democracy and uses our kids for cannon fodder to fight in wars resulting from our past support of despotism. This movie is an eye opener and no one who sees it can walk out of the theater without being affected. The truth is a powerful thing and those who are exposed to it can deny it for a time but they can never remove it from their subconscious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conservatives Need Not Bother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are no words to describe Fahrenheit 9/11. It's garenteed to be a hit with its target audience because it tells them what they want to hear. Its target audience: the same people who sat in the theater with me. They range from the extreme, the people who think that wearing deodrant is surrendering to the enemy, to the slightly more `normal' ones who just find `Bush bashing' to be a perfect way to pass the hours. The movie delievers Michael Moore's (and only Michael Moore's) opinion on the Bush administration. We all remember Michael Moore. He's the man who wouldn't leave the stage at the Oscars in 2003 because he needed to get as much of his political commentary crammed into his five minute acceptance speech as possible. He's opinionated and not afraid of it. Although there are a lot of people who might be afraid to disagree with Moore because he never fails to make people who don't follow his lead look incredibly foolish. And in Fahrenheitt 9/11, his target of aim is George W. Bush and the administration. And foolish he does make them. There is never a shining moment for out Commander In Chief. If he's not ignoring his country to play golf, he's forgetting the words to an old saying, he's lying, etc. Conservatives who are hailing Mr. Bush as their hero should not bother attending this film. Go see the light-hearted Shrek instead. However, should you be home to an open mind, this is a must-see. Those who are complaining about this film are saying the Moore is creating a web of lies and with holding information and taking things out of context. I see all these as ridiculous complaints. If a documentary maker showed all the information at head, no point would ever be made. That's the purpose of a documentary, an opinion, one point of view. And as for the accusation about lies, how Moore's stretching the truth too much, how this cannot be true. Are these people just afraid to admit that this might actually be the truth? Michael Moore is just another version of Jo Public trying to understand why innocent lives are being taken everyday in Iraq. The conclusion he reaches is one that will make the viewer laugh, cry and think twice about the hierarchy system that is the base of out society. ****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore's Stirring Call to Arms!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the theater, today, July 4th, 2004, expecting to see Michael Moore presenting the first post 9/11 anti-War film. Instead, Michael Moore has given us one of the most stirring call to arms I have ever seen. He shows us how useless in fighting back against the 9/11 terrorists were our invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, how feeble and incompetent is our homeland security. In chilling detail he makes an indictment of how the Saud Royal family is in bed with both Osama bin Laden and American business, and his message could not be any clearer: we are 2-1/2 years late in invading Saudi Arabia, occupying Mecca, and installing an American-style democracy in that terrorist stronghold. We must go to war now! Thank you, Michael Moore, for opening up my eyes! Mr. Moore, I am signing on to your holy crusade!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie regardless of your political leanings (****)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Michael Moore a lot, but he can sometimes be annoying even when you agree with him. I was looking forward to "Fahrenheit 9/11" but I had heard so much about it I was already sick of it before I saw it. I wasn't prepared for the absolutely staggering, emotionally devastating film that it is.Even if you don't agree with Moore or like him, there is no denying that this is powerful, powerful stuff and so timely that it hurts. Whether you think George W. Bush is awesome or if you agree with Moore that he's an incompetent, moronic douchebag (I'm in the latter camp), this film is essential viewing, if only to let you know what's actually happening in the world in a way that the news won't show. You can come to your own conclusions. Despite the heavy subject matter, there are also frequent moments of levity that are appreciated (my favorite being a product demonstration on live TV). But even with these, you will leave deeply affected, no matter what political party you lean towards. Moore puts a human face on things that most of us don't like to think about. Whether you buy Moore's assertions about the ties between the Bush family and the Bin Laden family is up to you. I'm not sure, but I do know that white men in suits can get away with a hell of a lot, and sometimes they do.</fullReview>

We don't get to see images of children and women who have been dismembered or had their skin burned black from bombs...or flag draped coffins of dead American soldiers...or get given the count of the physically and mentally wounded...or find out the body counts of the "enemy"... It all gets presented like an exciting video game.Fahrenheit 911 lets us see a little of what war REALLY looks and feels like to the people are fighting it and who are the victims of it, and it's heartwrenching and disgusting.The movie doesn't paint a very pretty picture of the Bush administration who made this Iraq war, or of their motivations. Dishonest and deceit! Every American should see this movie, and then start thinking about what we can all do to make this country stand for something again.Powerful movie-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore does it again. Sure, he doesn't offer both sides of the story, and he doesn't prove each and every finding or conclusion he mentions. But i get the feeling the film's purpose is not so much as to convince people that things went exactly as he describes. The film's purpose seems to be, to MAKE people THINK more and think BETTER. Even if half of what he describes is true, it really means that the American people (and everyone to an extent) have been fooled for years.And it has been EASY, because no one gets informed.Moore wants to change that, and he already has changed people, with his films and TV series. Fahrenheit 9/11 is just the next step.And it is a good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent documentary, but too many personal twists make it lack 100% credibility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One wishes that Moore had stuck to plain fact telling and not resorted to making it an overly personal diatribe in between...showing Lisa whose son had gone to war for long sequences...made the story lose its hard hitting edge. And in places the movie seemed to have purely gimmicky tactics, showing Bush's hair getting touched up in the beginning helped build the introduction in a satirical fashion but repeating it within the movie seemed overdone. After all anyone who faces the camera does the same. Moore kept going off on a tangent like soliciting senators to send their children into the army, but also unearthed some utterly human characteristics and memorable moments - like the young boys sent out to war who walked in with a 'rush' playing rock music and came out disillusioned with the very purpose of war. Overall one wishes he had stuck to more hard hitting facts with his personal commentary rather than following some personal agenda of his own to make it into an utterly believable film. All said and done, this film would certainly have quite a negative impact on the Bush camp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the meaning of the word propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I was shopping in the grocery store today I overheard a woman telling another woman that Fahrenheit 9/11 is "propaganda." I don't think she was being ironic. And I didn't get the impression that she had seen the movie herself. She was wearing a shirt with the imprint of stars and stripes, and probably considered it her patriotic duty to bash the movie. Prejudice is a long standing tradition in the conservative Midwest.I saw the movie twice last weekend. I took my younger brother, who is seventeen and would be eligible for a draft, to see it. Most of the information I already knew from being unemployed after graduating college and spending a great deal of time analyzing the media. Eric Alterman's WHAT LIBERAL MEDIA? is a good place to start if you want understand how the liberal media myth works. Propaganda defined by dictionary.com is "the systematic propagation of a doctrine or cause or of information reflecting the views and interests of those advocating such a doctrine or cause." Fahrenheit 9/11 is not systematic propagation; it has a beginning and ending and whether you agree or not with the way the information is presented, you would have a difficult time disputing the facts. On the other hand, propaganda would very well describe the systematic propagation of the Bush administration and the in bed media that would prefer you to not see the movie because of the damning portrayal of its complicity in misleading the American public.In reality Fahrenheit 9/11 is a patriotic and pro-American movie. In this polarized political climate there will be those who will not see the movie based on some comment by Rush Limbaugh or any of the various pro-administration pundits. Ignorance is not bliss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 911 is a masterful piece of documentary film-making. It is a must-see for anyone who cares about world events. Michael Moore intertwines a humorous narrative, news archives, and tongue-in-cheek selection of music to reveal the very unpleasant truth about the current Bush administration and the motivation for the war in Iraq. The film makes connections and allusions that would seem preposterous if it wasn't for the arsenal of archival clips that reinforce and validate the message. With Moore's unique access to powerful images, clips and footage the public has never seen, he puts forth a very convincing story. While it is entertaining, it is also astonishing and moving. When I screened the film, the audience applauded at the end, and so they should. I hope this film is seen by a wide audience with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The portions of the film dealing with the loss of loved ones are searing. It is made all the more so by the fact that we cannot have faith that these men and women who have died are doing so for a noble cause. To that end, the film simply makes a muddled understanding of Iraq and Afghanistan a bit murkier.Moore abandons the neutral tone of the documentary in favor of bloopers, music inserts, and elements of vaudeville as he himself goes to the street to follow marine recruiters, asking congressmen if they would send their children to Iraq, and the like. Moore suggests that people of color, the impoverished, and our children are bearing the sole burden in the death toll, which is not my observation in scrolling through the lists of those fallen in this war.At the heart of the movie is the conspiracy theory of links between the Bush administration and the House of Saud. Have yet to find a conspiracy theory that held any validity once it got past half a dozen people. The House of Saud is in real trouble; and that is an interesting story but not in the scope of this film. Moore's film would have been brilliant if it had chronicled the botched diplomatic job of the past 40 years in the Middle east.For the dollars spent on the ticket, I got my money's worth.</fullReview>

In America both the movie and the response to it are allowed and it is heartening that both are taking place when so many factions in our society wish that it would just go away or be banned.From its opening detailing the Florida fiasco and corruption to its close which shows Bush characteristically fumbling and mumbling through a commonplace piece of folk wisdom its argument is that President Bush is not deserving of nor fit for the office that he holds.And a persuasive piece of argument it is too, reinforced by information and images not seen before - at least by me - and interpretations often decried as unpatriotic.It's my belief that as many people as possible should see this movie especially if they leave the theater as angry as I did but for the opposite reason.It's July 3rd as I write this, I can't think of a better movie to see on July 4th.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FAHRENHEIT 9/11, Michael Moore's new documentary, focuses on the happenings prior to and following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. More specifically, it focuses on Bush's actions concerning the attacks and how shady it all seems to be. It seems to be a pretty unnecessary documentary, considering half of America (or more) already knows this and feels this way. But it is already, needless to say, very popular and making tons of money--somewhat ironically.I think Michael Moore makes great documentaries, even if they are incredibly biased. This film is no exception--nearly every scene is trying to exploit the opinion that Bush is an idiot who never deserved to be elected. And while I agree with a lot of the opinions stated in the movie, I can see that these same opinions would upset a lot of Bush's followers. I won't state any of my own opinions here, because this is not the place, but the movie is certainly convincing in what it chooses to debate. And there certainly are a lot of facts that have been overlooked by many (including myself) and will make a lot of the people in the audience think, "Huh. Never knew that. How interesting." It really is remarkable some of the links and ties that are pointed out in FAHRENHEIT 9/11--but this could just be the use of clever editing and bias.I think Michael Moore's last documentary was much better than this one--although, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE also had a lot less to be biased about and it wasn't on a subject as touchy and uncomfortable as our president and one of the most awful, high-profile terrorist attacks on our country in history. FAHRENHEIT 9/11 does not disappoint though--it has its fair share of good points and powerful moments (a lot of the scenes involving the mother of a dead soldier in Iraq are very heart-wrenching and moving), and even throws in some good humorous moments. But it's very one-sided (as is to be expected), and almost pretentious in its delivery.FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is likely to be a huge hit, and though it's incredibly biased and will be hated by many for this reason, it makes its point. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's curious how people assert this film is a pack of lies yet offer nothing to support such a claim. Moore's detractors (and Bush's apologists) should either put up or shut up.The movie does a good job of arguing that George W. Bush is not the rightful heir to the presidency. That he is in cahoots with the Saudis, and specifically with the bin Ladens. That his real loyalty is not to the people of America, but to a small clique that controls most of the country's wealth. That during his presidency America has become reviled, especially in the Middle East.Moore shows, by example, that there is nothing wrong with pointing out the hypocrisy in our leaders and questioning their motives. Most democracies excel at this sort of thing, although the United States has stumbled lately. Nowadays, being "a patriot," as Britney Spears demonstrates, means keeping your mouth shut and agreeing with whatever the president says. This approach has worked wonders in democracies like the Soviet Union and North Korea.My favourite moment comes early on, when outraged protesters pelt the presidential limousine. The rejection of Bush's bona fides is symbolic of the divided nation. What a crying shame the media didn't let people know what was happening at the time. Did they think it wasn't newsworthy or were they just too afraid to show it? What else have these cowards refused to show us?I think this worthy film will change very few minds. The wealthy and the extreme right will vote for Bush regardless. God himself couldn't change their minds. Ordinary folks will continue to despise him. What it might do, however, is help motivate the electorate to get out and vote in November.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most important film of the decade.---8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 needs no introduction. It has been the most-talked about, most anticipated, and most profitable film of it's kind ever. Not a single newscast in the last month went off the air without mentioning this highly controversial film. I have been waiting anxiously for this film since Mr. Moore announced that he was going to make a documentary about the Bush administration. I was a little worried that because of it's anti-Bush content that it may never be released in public theaters. But fortunately it has thanks to Bob and Harvey Weinstein.The documentary itself was well worth the wait. Moore shows a lot of stuff you already know, but the way he shows it really hits it home. It is not all new information, however, as Moore shows footage and interviews and gives facts about the government that you have never seen or known before such as the ridiculously low number of rangers guarding the state of Oregon. There are vintage Moore moments as well, such as when he rides around the capital in an ice cream truck reading the USA Patriot Act over the speaker. However, the film has a more serious tone than Moore's previous films. The most moving part comes when Moore follows and interviews a mother who lost her son in the war in Iraq. I don't think there was a dry eye in the theater.Fahrenheit 9/11 is the most important film of the year and probably the decade and should been seen by as many people as possible. And yes, even more important than Spider-Man 2. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a documentary . . . yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from viewing this film. for the first time in many years I had to go a second time to the theatre to see the film because it was sold out. that doesn't happen very often here in placid London Canada.documentaries come after the fact, a sober recapping and analysis of usually recent history, the better to get close to the participants. the participants in this case are the republican big shots and sycophants that cluck the party line whilst other participants like the mother from Flint Michigan and the mother in Baghdad grieve the loss of their loved ones. this is a film of propaganda purposes frankly admitted by Mr Moore to sway the American voters to oust the rascals that mishandled the whole twin towers/911/al quaeida/bin laden/saddam/etc mess. on this count it succeeds magnificently. like all propaganda it mixes in a great deal of verifiable truth. supported by the words and actions of the target of the propaganda.no extensive voice overs were required or used in this film unlike 'roger &amp; me', Moore's earlier effort or to some extent 'bowling for columbine'. the footage which is very graphic in some places proves the adage a picture is worth a thousands words. spoilers follow:the film starts off musing about how the florida election fiasco was a nightmare, no, it wasn't, it all happened. it then details Bush's extensive vacation time prior to 911, continuing to footage of Bush at the moment the towers were being destroyed. you see him puzzled like a deer caught in the headlights. continuing, the film then details with numerous reference to fact how for instance, members of the bin laden family were permitted to leave American soil days after the attack, despite all domestic flights being grounded likening it to as if Bill Clinton had allowed members of the Timothy McVey family free passage out of the country after the Oklahoma bombing. furhter ties to saudi interests are described but I don't want to spoil it too much. suffice to say the film continues in the same vein by showing how the Bush administration then seized the opportunity presented by 911 to siphon off support from the American people and translate it into support for the invasion of Iraq. Oil interests loom large in the process with organizations like enron and halliburton taking the spotlight, and the Bush team members involved getting prominent mention. the fact that Bush sr. as former president is able and does in fact utilize CIA briefings in his private dealings with saudi big shots is also mentioned, an example of the deep entwining between Bush, Bush supporters and friends, and saudi interests.God help the American people and people of the world if Bush wins reelection. In my opinion it will hasten Armageddon by intensifying the polarization that is occurring on a global scale because of the hypocrisy and duplicity trotted out by Bush and his ilk, disguised as a 'war on terror' in the interests of 'democracy in Iraq'. its all about the oil people, the sooner you realize that the sooner you will understand these events and the motives of those with their hands on the levers of power. thank goodness there are people like Mr Moore willing and still able to make films like this the educate, entertain and persuade the common people to withdraw support from a corrupt administration like that of george dubya currently in place.we will see the final results in November of this year.</fullReview>

There's a reason there's so much outrage about this film, and this president. That's because it is so revealing, and the angry people probably don't want you to see everything that's revealed. These are the people that are bringing "freedom" to the rest of the world. Isn't it funny that those are the same people that are trying to get a movie banned for exposing the truth about our leader? No amount of censorship can rewrite the past, oh wait... that's why you have to see this movie. While you still have access to the truth. But find out for yourself, then make up your mind, then vote.

But the liberties that Michael Moore takes with his innuendos aren't even close to those employed by Rove and Gillespie when discrediting many Democrats. I would be just as happy in four years to see a movie like this about John Kerry if he turns out to be as monumental a failure as George Bush has been. Unfortunately, most Republicans spent so much time justifying their votes for Bush in 2000 that they can't generate enough humility to admit that he stands to be the American Nero. If only Moore had let Bowling for Columbine speak for itself, instead of using the bully pulpit two years ago at the Oscars, there would have been more seats filled by many more people who needed to see that movie and who need to see Farenheit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The question I had leaving the theater is where is the controversy. Moore portrays with some pretty good accuracy a picture of the major political events of the last few years. This movie is an indictment of the current administration, however, it has more deep philosophical dimensions at heart.Moore excellently cuts file footage to display the character of Pres. Bush, but more so illustrates the two worlds we have in the US. It seems we have a culture of decision makers and those who are forced to enact the decisions, and unfortunately it seems that the later has lost much of its say in the process. So if you are looking for scathing controversy you really should look somewhere else; if you want to see a movie that depicts the true tragedies of war and the tactics of fear and uncertainty in governance go for it. This movie does not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MUST SEE, then go vote</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you go vote, you owe it to yourself to see what the president's been up to. You may not agree with the opinions of Michael Moore, but all the fact's are true (double checked by the head of the New Yorker Magazine's fact-checking team), and that's all that really matters, isn't it? There's a reason there's so much outrage about this film, and this president. That's because it is so revealing, and the angry people probably don't want you to see everything that's revealed. These are the people that are bringing "freedom" to the rest of the world. Isn't it funny that those are the same people that are trying to get a movie banned for exposing the truth about our leader? No amount of censorship can rewrite the past, oh wait... that's why you have to see this movie. While you still have access to the truth. But find out for yourself, then make up your mind, then vote. Exercise your first amendment right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different points of view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love the country, I love the friendship and the hospitality. I love the people and their way of living: free and mostly full of respect for another. I lived in the USA for almost 5 years and I guess I know the country pretty well. I worked for the US Air Force and I honor its professionalism and dedication towards freedom. I was shocked and in grief with the entire nation over what happened 2001. I was very much astonished about the coalition tied together to fight terrorism. B U T: How can one such great nation allow a presidency who puts that all in danger, for reasons well known at least in Germany. And why does it need a Michael Moore to get the story across. His film is full of flaws and the way of approaching things is everything but balanced points of views. Isn't that scary, that the entire network and news system in the entire country failed. Local burglary being more important than what is going on in Sudan right now and what are the real motions of George W Bush. That should be the primary task of the opinion building agencies in the USA. Why does it need Michael Moore to learn about truth? That's the real problem. America wake up, protect your great country and it's values. But don't use Michael Moore for doing so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read many criticisms of this film, and I have noticed a pattern that all of the negative ones follow. First, they most certainly include some level of personal attack on Michael Moore ("unAmerican," "terrorist-lover," "fat slob", etc.). Second, if they bother to attempt any dispute of the facts Michael Moore presents, they can easily be proven to be way off base (e.g. Christopher Hitchens's convoluted smear job in "Slate"). Since I don't rely on the corporate mass media for all of my information, I wasn't surprised by most of the information that Moore presented in his latest film (the scene with the African-American congress members lining up to protest the 2000 (s)election result was news to me, though; not even Al Gore signed off on those protests?! Yikes!) However, I thought the manner in which he presented the facts and his own interpretations of them was stunningly brilliant. By spending most of the film allowing the people and the events to speak for themselves, he crafted a damning indictment of the Bushies and the scam they've perpetrated on the U.S. public.The fact that so many vehemently attack this film-- attacking without substance, often without having even seen the film-- just proves that our nation is crawling with pols and pundits who wish for us to remain 'patriotic' and ignorant sheep. It also proves, if judging only from some of the reactionary nay-saying I've read here, that there are probably more than a few militant sheep who are willing to accede to those wishes.</fullReview>

I saw the film on a Tuesday morning [I had a vacation day]. The film was filled with a huge variety of people -- all ethnicities and ages, but about 50% of the theatre audience was over 55.

		<shortDescription>Some of the memorable things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moore, for all his faults, does provoke thought. One thing that struck me early on was the apparent necessity to target a villain in place of Osama bin Laden. A sustained focus on bin Laden could have greatly damaged the Bush administration, given the hasty departure of the bid Ladens from the U. S. and the long-standing relationship and mutual financial interests of the Bushes and the bin Laden family. Unfortunately for the administration, Saddam didn't do a good job in his role as the villain. He was nowhere near being the dangerous threat we were led to believe he was.Several scenes really stand out: the somebody-please-tell-me-what-to-do look of President Bush in the Florida classroom after the WTC buildings had been hit, the anguish of those who lost loved ones in the war and the terrorists' attacks in the U. S., the grief-stricken Iraqi female calling on Allah to destroy us, and the frustration of the soldier at giving freedom and seeing hate in return.I'm not sure this is Moore's best movie, but it is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be the first film to decide a presidential election</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 is a bold, brazen attempt by Michael Moore to bring down the George W. Bush presidency, and it just might succeed. Much of the movie's damning evidence against Bush is circumstantial. Some of it is exaggerated or taken out of context. But Fahrenheit 9/11 presents so much compelling evidence with so much emotion and passion that it could be the most effective political tool to ever come out of Hollywood. In addition to being a skillfully crafted documentary that should be the odds-on favorite to put another Oscar on Moore's mantle, Fahrenheit 9/11 should be a future case study in movie marketing. Moore successfully hyped a minor controversy with Disney into a big deal, then let the right wing blunder their way into making it into an even bigger deal. In the process of trying to prevent people from seeing the movie, the right wing fuss is only raising the curiosity level. If Bush is indeed defeated for re-election by a small margin, he might have good reason to blame this movie and the man behind it.</fullReview>

Shouldn't we be allowed to see everything about this war--good and bad? Images arepotent--and the images in Fahrenheit 911 are profoundly disturbing--from thesuffering of the "collateral damaged" innocents--children, old people, families, to the thoroughly disgusting look on President Bush's face as he minces andpreens on the camera prior to his announcing the war with Iraq . Wouldn't you think he'd be overwhelmed with the gravity of the situation and with what he was just about to announce? Instead we get those sneaky little grins--Wow! For the first time, I am embarrassed to have such a President. Everybody should seethis film. Even if you are put off by Mr. Moore's political opinions, you still should see those images, too often missing or glossed over by the mainstreamAmerican media, but heartbreakinly shown in this extraordinarily powerful film.. People from overseas should also see this film--they have to know that not all Americans slavishly followi the dictates of our current administration--we are a widely diverse country--and this film shows that so vividly. With insight, clarity, understanding, pity and anger--our current situation in the United States and its position in the Middle Eastern world is put under the microscope. With such a controversial film, perhaps we each see only what we want to see--but at least he's making us see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore's film is factual, nobody has yet successfully debunked any of the facts presented in the movie. Where are the lawsuits? What has some folk's panties in a knot is that Moore spins the facts. Well, DUH, it's not as if everyone out there spins facts, it's just he spins them in a way that the government does not want you to see. So, if you call a spin a lie, well then, everyone is lying. The film certainly evokes emotions in its viewers. Moore is his usual effective self in presenting one side of an issue. Those that say he should state both sides of the issue do not understand the nature of documentary film-making. Anyway, does the Bush Administration consider both sides of an issue? No, they do not, and they are smug about it. So, on one side you have the government presenting only one side of an issue, and Moore presenting the other.See the movie and you at least will have broadened your view. Those that will not see the film are neglecting their obligation as good citizens to examine all views on an issue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore's riveting documentaries have always voiced the opinions of the silent majority of Americans (it is his contention that most Americans agree to a liberal view of society, yet are bound by a conservative economic identity which keeps many from speaking out.) However the bias in his work is undeniable. I think this film is dangerous in the hands of those who consider themselves "politically naive." Many people have written that this film opened their eyes to information that they had never known before. While this is good it is vital to realize that what one should take away from his work is a greater understanding of large ideas and not manipulated statistics. (Ex. in Bowling for Columbine, he is not historically accurate during the "What a wonderful world" montage, but the larger picture he represents is right on.) I think he does this to appeal to a larger audience (generally naive) and not just to staunch liberals. Although he does manipulate facts to further prove his point, the larger views he conveys are not at all false and are really quite frightening. One must view this film objectively and weed through the small inaccuracies to get the truth- Moore's painfully truthful analysis of the Bush administration and the war in Iraq.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an ultimate reality check for all Americans.Bush family establishing business and diplomatic relations with Saudis where America gets its oil: good or bad? I thing it is good, afterall it was democrat's idea to conserve American oil for the future and rely on the import sources.America used Osama Bin Laden to drive Soviet Union out of Afganistan. Would Americans prefer to send their own troops there and start an open war with USSR? Or should have the president just ignore the situation and let soviets take over the entire oil fields in middle east? that is what they were planning to do.It is a war for oil... hmm... I wonder what Michael Moore would be saying if he had to fill up his car with Regular at, say, $5, $6, $7 per gallon.Weapons of mass destruction.... is ballistic missile that takes out an entire city block is not mass enough? A few of those were shot at Israel. Did we had to wait until Saddam had actually used a nuce or something stronger than conventional ground to ground missile? It is not that hard to make or buy a small nuclear bomb if you are a head of a country such as Iraq, in fact you can even buy one and it is relatively easy to hide it in the desert, or keep it at the neighboring countries just in case UN comes with inspection.I feel sorry for all parents of those who die, my heart is with them. But, when their children signed up to join the army did not they realize that primary function of the army is to fight a war? They signed up for money and nothing else. Ups, now we actually have to fight, we did not know that! Duh, you are in the army now, you've sworn. War is never fair to anyone, especially those on the front lines. No wonder they are upset.Michael Moore is an excellent producer and I think the film deserves award it has received, but he is a hippocrat when it comes to politics. It is easy to make any point using cinematography, especially if viewers have no way of checking validity of all the materials used in the documentary. If Michael Moore was a republican supporter he would have made a film that brings an entirely opposite point and he would have made it as convincing as F.911.To all Americans: when you vote use your head, do not follow your emotions.The film is made to tweak your emotions, but it cannot tweak your brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore one-ups himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like many of the like-minded friends I know, flocked to theaters the opening weekend. I missed it Friday, but got in Saturday, and the place was packed! The object: to put "Fahrenheit 911" in the top five ballpark, and keep it from vanishing from theaters. I'd said prior to seeing it that, although on a smaller scale, this was the liberals' "Passion of the Christ," a movie swarming with so much preconceived gossip that like it or not, people will go see it. (For the record, I never saw Mel Gibson's controversial movie) Still, while it only mildly surprised me that the movie made No. 1 at theaters, I was shocked when I heard it made something like two million more than "Bowling for Columbine," the other highest-rated documentary, causing Moore to out-do himself.The movie, undeniably, is an opinion piece. A movie made with an agenda in mind, and I don't have to say what it is. You probably already know Moore's feelings about President Bush, or you wouldn't even be reading this. From the opening scandal surrounding the 2000 election, to the filming of Bush &amp; Co. getting ready for their speechmaking. (Wolfowitz salivates on his comb to slick his hair back) And then, the Trade Centers are hit... We don't actually see the planes hit the towers, but rather, we hear them, then are faced with the astonished and saddened faces of people standing in awe. Paper's flood the air with a cloud of smoke. But we do see Bush, sitting quietly in a Florida elementary school, contemplating the news in his head during a photo-op. And so starts the Bush-bashing, an ambiguous yet slanted look at long ties to cabinet members, their ties to oil, the real Ahmed Karzi, and Prince Bandhar of Saudi Arabia.The movie demonstrates the lackluster conflict in Afghanistan, where too few soldiers were sent, and took too long at getting to al Qaeda's suspected locale. Then the War on Terror. In one episode, a woman is asked to take a container of breastmilk from the plane, yet another man is allowed matches and cigarette lighters. During this time it is estimated that there would be eight Troopers on duty at any given time in Oregon. (Nice defense from terrorists) Then they show how Bush used the tactic of War on Terror to coax politicians into lending support for his Iraq plan. The details of any infamous incidents in Iraq are not covered, although troops are seen playing around with a couple of POWs. Some soldiers talk about listening to music during their fighting. One song they listen to seems tailor-made for killing.Michael Moore also follows Flint, Michigan resident Lily Lipscombe, a patriotic "conservative Democrat" whose daughter served in Desert Storm. Her son is stationed in Iraq, and when he dies, she is transformed into a grieving mother, one who never thought such a tragedy would happen.The whole film is punctuated by George W. Bush's worst moments in front of a camera. As for Moore himself, he remains behind the camera for a good bit of the film, better to keep the audience focused on the business at hand.Will it sway those who are not initiated? Swing-voters are likely targets, but Republicans, unless extremely moderate, won't even see it, most likely, let alone vote on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shattering, funny, manipulative, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 could be the most importantAmerican film in recent memory. It reminds us at the power (and danger) of cinema, as it could possibly influence the fate of one's nation. With the anti-Bush controversy surrounding it, it surprises me that at the end the film comes across as a testament of Mr Moore's deep love and passion towards the United States. He wants a change and he still believes it could happen, and there is sense of hope throughout. It was a cathartic experience. And no matter what your political views are, you cannot possibly deny the cinematic thrill &amp; power of FAHRENHEIT 9/11.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i am proud of Michael Moore and his film, and plan on letting everyone i know and don't know that it is a must see, and ASAP. this film wakes you up &amp; hits you right in the face as an American. i love this country, but cannot believe our President and where he plans on taking us little people. lets hope that as the future approaches, that we all take a step back and really understand what leadership means. This film really struck something deep inside, and i cannot stop talking to everyone about it. don't get me wrong, i don't hate Mr. Bush, i hate what i learned, and question his ethics and values. i agree with some of the critics comments, that the most disturbing scene in the movie was in the beginning where Mr. Bush was reading to those young students. The look on his face is priceless after being told that we are under attack. i guess we will always wonder what he was thinking, but i guarantee we will never get the truth in his answer! Congrats Mr. Moore. Well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Call me naive, but I went to see Fahrenheit 911, thinking I was going to have a good old time laughing at dumb George Bush. Boy, was I wrong. I walked out of the theatre feeling as though my chest had been ripped open and my heart ripped out.I was in tears and rage throughout the movie, as I witnessed Bush's jihad on the constitution, truth and the English language.Michael Moore deserves, not the Oscar, but the Nobel Peace prize, for bringing to the screen the truth about the liars, thieves and butchers that have stolen this country from us, and mock us with their every word and deed.God bless you Michael Moore.My only criticism of the film, is that Moore failed to discuss Clinton's impeachment as compared to what Bush has done to this country, what is treason, and what crimes against the nation merit which penalties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael's Best Ever / SPOILERS INCLUDED</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This record-breaking documentary ("the highest-grossing documentary of all time on its first weekend in release, taking in $21.8 million"--Sharon Waxman, NYT, 6/28/04), winner of the 2004 Cannes Palme d'Or, is deeply affecting and heart-breakingly funny.One of Moore's best, beautifully edited, and containing much less of Moore himself than his previous movies. Which, God love him, isn't altogether a bad thing. Michael has reportedly withstood many efforts to include more of himself in the film, and had the good sense and artistic taste to see that much of what he was showing needed to stand by itself.The movie is, quite understandably, generating so much controversy about its subject matter that the quality of the film-making is frequently overlooked in the process. (In some cases, the overall level and quality of discourse is as low as I've ever seen.) But the movie IS riveting (people didn't hardly even leave to pee or smoke), and Moore has learned much about the art of film since "Bowling for Columbine." Moore has also gone to great lengths to ensure that his facts will hold up under the kind of close scrutiny that has already begun and much of this information is available on his website--so far, none of this kind of criticism holds up, even a little.What I have seen--what I saw in the movie--was the kind of footage that we as Americans are prevented from seeing on our evening news. Iraqi civilians and American soldiers are shown wounded and dead, political detainees are shown being humiliated by American soldiers, U.S. soldiers are shown questioning American involvement in Iraq, and grieving relatives of dead soldiers are shown coming to terms with the fact that their son's death was in a war about which they were lied to, and which even he didn't believe in, in the end.Much has been and will be made of the fact that Michael Moore stands to make a great deal of money from this movie--as if that somehow negated the validity of his message. Let's not forget that he will make this money honestly and openly, not by creating death and destruction overseas, and that, Michael being Michael, he will see that a portion of it goes to causes that he finds worthy.This movie has been making people laugh and cry in theaters all over the U.S. (and Canada &amp; Europe, I hear). It has also been getting strangers to talk to one another about the movie's painful subjects in these same theaters. If a documentary can so shatter the seeming apathy and complacency of Americans in such a profound way, then it is obvious that we're looking at a significant movie.I've heard people say that Michael Moore 'doesn't believe in anything,' as if his debunking of some myths about the U.S. was THE original problem, and not the lying liars that first lied to us to create those myths. Michael believes in plenty, and what he believes in is obvious from all his films-he believes in an America that can do better by its citizens, he believes that jobs, healthcare, food and quality-of-life are more important than wars that line the pockets of the American elite, he believes that gun-loving might sometimes lead to gun-using, and he believes that individual Americans can be amazing, but that as a group, sometimes they sit back and let their leaders carry them to some very bad places. The very fact that Michael bothers year after year after year should show the dubious that he believes that some things are very important, indeed.Go see it. And then do something peaceful to help us heal the situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a very naive person before this film: with daily affirmations of the natural goodness in people,believing that no politician could ever do so much evil.That people were more paranoid than they need to be. But 9/11 changed all of that. Living here in NYC. I wanted justice from honorable leaders with integrity and firm character conictions..However, this film with the actual footage of GWB saying from his own mouth, how he, had his fathers'(Bush Sr.) ear for a price. Blew me away.It was in fact about money and oil and how to hide it.What were the real reasons about the attack on Iraq? Cheney &amp; GWB and crew never looked so different to me.I am so upset that the media has attacked the messenger(Moore) and not focused on the message.It is not about if Clarke gave the okay for the Bin ladens to leave or in fact one senator does have a family member in the armed service. IT is the fact that NOT anyone in the media has addressed the major charge of the Saudis money trail and what they got in return from the group.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone interested in the documentary film tradition, I would not call this a documentary. I would compare it to a political cartoon like "Doonesbury". Moore takes delight in playing the role of court jester, with humor, farce and innuendo mixed together with terrifying and dismal reality.Overall, it is much more entertaining than I can imagine any straight documentary to be, so its audience will be that much broader. I saw it on a Monday night and the theatre was completely packed. It's hard to imagine anyone seeing this film without being outraged, in one way or another. Perhaps several ways at once. If this leads people to do their own research and find things out for themselves before election day, the country will surely be better off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminded who was at fault.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the number of comments, it seems pretty much everything has been said. Moore's latest effort, while important, is not flawless. He occasionally fell into hyperbolic rhetoric and the amount of time lingered over Lila Lipscomb's grief bordered on exploitation. Still, there was no arguing many of the facts. The plight of the African-American Coalition was exasperating and amusing, pointing out just how many wealthy middle-aged white males consistently hold the reins of power. As I was leaving the theatre one of the patron made the point that the Bush Administration wasn't only at fault, the American people shared the blame. My initial response was the typical "Yeah, they voted him into office.";however, before the comment was finished it dawned on me that Al Gore received the popular vote! Our fault lies in not being more outraged. Why haven't the people called for the elimination of the outdated Electoral College? Why are we allowing the continuation of the Primaries, which in a matter of weeks give voters no real choices? Why do we keep putting these monied politicos in office; individuals who'll complain and bluster about an opposing party until it's time to do something meaningful(A-A Coalition, voting against the Patriot Act, putting there own children in the military)? We accept a mainstream media that is so afraid of losing access to the White House they'll refuse to report anything controversial, but parrot Administration rhetoric. We got plenty on Bill Clinton's sexual liaisons, even an impeachment, yet Bush Saudi connections, or the Bin Laden family exodus barely caused a blip on the radar screens. Moore's film and views are important; after all we have been constantly bombarded by the conservative opinions of the Drudges, Rush Limbaughs, and President Bush himself. Fahrenheit 9/11 starts to balance the scales with the facts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore has done it again. This man has changed the game. Edutainment, I believe is what its called. He has found a way, a style, a technique and jumped in with both feet. I think I've seen most of his work, from the two TV. Shows he did, T.V. Nation, and the Awful Truth all seasons which were hilarious and completely shamefully shocking, his three documentaries Roger and Me, which was good, The Big One, which was better, Bowling for Columbine which was even better, however not as humorous, and now the strongest and least funny, yet most potent, poignant, powerful, and timelyFAIRENHEIT 9/11. GROUND BREAKING. I am baffled how people can talk down on this film, the critics are moving, however there not getting very far. For starters, Id like to see him challenged in his arena (documentaries), the people have spoken, voted with their feet and green-backs, this is the hands down, highest grossing documentary of this type of all time. The few who talk down on it, are jokes, lets see them try to convince the sold-out mobs stretching around the corners in almost every city &amp; state in this nation, and next week all over the planet, HELLO. For one thing, this film is very Patriotic in the authentic sense of the word. Not used as a war cry, or for general all-purpose support like Bush who Moore strips of his mask, showing the real clueless, spineless child he is. 9/11's strongest moments are when Moore is sympathizing with the mother of a dead marine. He points out how she has made the ultimate sacrifice for her country, and his main closing point is that these very brave young men and women not be thrown into a war unless it is absolutely necessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a crowd for a Monday, 11:00 a.m. performance. The ropelines from the weekend were still up. The audience, from the responses at certain portions of the film, seemed to be anti-administration -- that's anti-administration, not anti-American and not anti-military. Nowadays a person must explain himself lest he be falsely labeled. At the end we all left, in silence and in disgust. Thanks to Michael Moore and his staff. I would like to see a film that counters the contents of this film. If you viewed Fahrenheit 9/11, you know that is impossible. Where would a Republican find, for example, a woman whose house was just bombed thanking the Americans? Who among the senators and the representatives will be telling the camera about all their children serving in the military, esp. Iraq? How will the connections among the Saudis, the Bushes, influential corporations otherwise be shown? One of the most disturbing images was the actual recruitment of non-elite teen-agers by US Marines. Was that real? How was that filmed? One line to a teen-aged boy: "May we cross you off our list by talking to you now? What is your name?" What list? Was that real? How was the footage acquired? It was so like telemarketing: a response to every response. Scary! The most amusing part in addition to those silly faces was the Bonanza segment. A sickening scene was the make-up one, especially Paul W.'s styling his hair. So much went into this film, and so much, if not all, will remain with the thousands of viewers -- the bloodied, mutilated arm of the young boy, the swaddled, dead infant, and the agony of the mother whose soldier son returned home by way of a flag-draped coffin. And she was not able to have any kind of access to The White House! A great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ironically, I came to this movie excited as hell but left it without much to say....that's only because much of what Moore brings up in his docu was already thoroughly researched/discussed. The problem is the masses. The masses that gave Bush 49% (or 51% if ur a neocon) of the vote only because they saw more of him on TV than any other candidate, or the masses that would treat the latest scare on TV with the utmost gullibility.Our mass media paired with this majority of uneducated, "Do what you're told", distracted everyday people has caused our "consent to be manufactured" (Love ya, Chomsky) and means those of us who are not automatons of the American dream are left out, almost completely silenced.Thank god for Michael Moore, a man who throws out the truth and gets %$^&amp; thrown back at him. He has effectively turned the theaters in which his film is played into deprogramming stations for the masses.I've only read a few other great reviews for this film, and I am eager to see what the spinsters on CNN/Fox/NBC/ABC have to say about it. In fact I challenge Bush, Sean Hannity, and that little b****** who made the "MichealMooreHatesAmerica" film to publicize their negative input.

		<fullReview>Great film that does an excellent job of re-capping the last four "blunderous" years of George W. Bush. Michael Moore is obviously biased in his assessment of the Republican administration, but his facts are that. Facts. Why were so many highly placed Saudis allowed to leave the country before the F.B.I. could question them? What was the pressing need to invade a sovereign nation without the approval of the U.N., thereby breaking the U.N.'s most fundamental tennants? Why did Bush do nothing to combat terrorism prior to 9/11 and in fact slashed anti-terrorism spending. Why was he on vacation for 42% of his first 9 months in office? How many soldiers that are fighting in Iraq come from wealthy families? Not many. Not surprising. Rich Americans are told to go to Disney, to continue spending while the country's poorest are being asked to make the ultimate sacrifice. Brutal. Shame on this administration. I hope this film tosses Bush and his ilk firmly out on their a$$. A must see for any open-minded people of the world and especially American voters.jw</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It starts off with shots of former Vice President Al Gore at a rally, with people such as Ben Affleck and Stevie Wonder among his supporters. It jumps into the Florida dilemma with the election, and shows how angry people were when George W. Bush won.This movie proves my, and others, point on how dumb, unreliable and malicious George W. Bush and his administration are and have been with dealing with Iraq. It shows well edited clips of Bush sucking up to the upper class of our society, of him digging for bugs during his first year in office, and of course, his 7-minute response to the September 11th attacks (in which he did nothing)Michael Moore bravely ventured to areas that not many other filmmakers would go to: such as approaching Senators and asking them to sign their children up for the war, and going to Flint, Michigan to interview a woman who lost her son. He even showed graphic clips of the soldiers in Iraq, and how awful the situation really is.Overall, this documentary successfully portrayed Michael Morre's view on President Bush and how badly he dealt with the Iraq situation. By the end of the movie, people were standing up and cheering. It's a film masterpiece that should be seen by everyone and will surely make an impact on this year's election.</fullReview>

By "real" people I mean authentic people, people who are aware of their humanity, whose souls understand that we are all related and thus that how we treat each other matters. Michael Moore tells a story in Fahrenheit 9/11 that everyone who follows world affairs should already know, and that many, apparently, around the world do know. The systems for delivering news in the USA tell the stories that the powers that be want to tell. Unfortunately, they are, for the most part, not the stories we should already know. I heartily recommend Fahrenheit 9/11 as presenting one of the most important stories of our time.You can't go wrong choosing to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If MM was a G. Bush supporter, I have no doubt he could produce a film that would present evidence and emotion to paint GB as the greatest thing since sliced bread. Michael Moore makes no apologies for his slanted view. However, I have not seen any evidence that the allegations MM makes are not 100% accurate. The intent of this film is to show the American people things about the Iraqi war that most have probably never thought of. Its very easy to think of war in the "good guys kick ass" terms. It puts a very different spin on it when you see 18 year old kids aka soldiers 30 seconds after a bomb has exploded and they are lying on the ground bleeding to death. Or you see a pile of burned up and bullet ridden 5 year olds...some of whom are still alive. Makes people actually think about the ramifications of sending troops into war...and do we have all the facts needed to make a decision? We should ALWAYS keep those images in our heads before we commit to war.He also outlines business and financial ties that the Bush family has with the Bin Laden family. These are not unfounded allegations - these are documented facts. Based on the reactions from the crowd around me in the theater...most people had no idea. I'm glad that MM has made it easy for those people to get that information.I didn't come out of the theater any more educated, because I pretty much knew about everything that he had presented. I also can't really say that I like MM's way of explaining things to me like I have an IQ of 80 (like I won't realize that he's trying to manipulate my view of things). However, since I've been debating the subject of the war in Iraq with a lot of people and find that too many say "We are fighting Iraq and Saddam because of 9-11"...I think this movie serves a good purpose. It presents the facts in a dumbed down, slanted and prepackaged way that some people need. If that gets Bush out of office in 2004, I'll recommend that everyone go see it.--Tina</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freedom of Speech. Absolutely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After this film won the Golden Palm at Cannes, what is impossible to argue with is that this is the film the rest of the film/arts/world community wanted to see SO badly that they gave their highest honor to a documentary made by an American eccentric. This is the film they believed we should make. This is the critical assessment of ourselves and our political machine they wanted us to make. It is a film that sees us, the U.S., they way the rest of the industrialized world sees us -- and it is critical, occasionally condemning, and always hopeful that we will pull ourselves up by our collective All-American bootstraps and kick ourselves in the butt when we screw up on the global stage.Or maybe what they wanted to see so badly is that we are not all blind, stupid, bleating sheep they are afraid we are -- and that maybe this really is the place where freedom of speech means we get more different perspectives than are offered by CNN, Disney, TIME, the NYTimes and FOX. For 2 years after 9/11, anyone that said anything against Bush (or even questioning Bush) was set aflame by the conservatives. And, truth be known, for the first few months, this was a reasonable response. However, the responsibility of the press (though evidently not the corporate press) is to ask all the questions regardless of the political tides. Since the corporate press didn't do it, it fell to those outside the corporate media. What once was the domain of investigative reporters seems now to fall to independent film-makers.Whether we agree or disagree with Micheal Moore's point of view, conclusions, suggestions, and his assembly of the puzzle pieces, we will fight tooth and nail for his right to try to do what the press and the political analysts failed to do --To ask all the questions. --To exercise the freedom of speech we believe in.I hope Michael Moore is wrong about at least part of what he presents. I also know that he is probably right about big parts of the puzzle. And I know for certain I want him to keep asking questions with the camera running.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Moore: Slick, Humorous, Compelling and Thought-Provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, I do not work for the United States Government, but I do work for a defense think-tank that focuses on U.S. interests in the Middle East, Terrorism, WMDs and Global Islamic Fundamentalism. These views are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my employer, its advisors or directors.It's an interesting juxtaposition, to see the events of September 11th, Operation Enduring Freedom and the U.S. invasion of Iraq through the eyes of Michael Moore, after having seen them firsthand. Over the course of the last few years, I have seen this nation become increasingly hostile against questions aimed at our leaders. Personally, I see it as a citizen's duty to ask questions of our leaders and their policies, even if we believe in them, yet such questions are increasingly labeled as "un-American" and even "pro-terrorist." Perhaps, after seeing this film, more and more Americans will begin to ask themselves why the issues Moore raises aren't being thoroughly questioned and why those questions aren't being answered.Yes, as usual, Moore uses fast editing and careful wording to imply 'facts' that aren't quite true, but then again, I've yet to see a film that doesn't present the story through the eyes of the producers and the director. You should no more take every frame as absolute truth than you should take Rush Limbaugh's daily radio show as holy gospel.Two important elements that should play heavily on the minds of Americans: 1) while the FBI did "interview" most of the Saudis who left the country on September 13th, agents were given less than 24 hours to investigate and speak with more than 1,100 Saudi nationals and 24 members of the bin Laden family; 2) why haven't we seen more interviews with our troops in Iraq -- why aren't they allowed to speak freely (enlisted personnel who have publicly criticized the Administration have been reassigned or dishonorably discharged).If anything, there was quite a bit that Moore left out -- I'd like to see an examination of the Saudi kingdom's continued efforts to spread Wahaabism - a key factor in creating the current climate of extreme fundamentalist Islam that pervades the Islamic world and continues to pervert the minds of young muslims. Furthermore, I'd like to see someone examine exactly why the Keane-Hamilton Commission to Investigate the Attacks Against the United States of September 11, 2001 completely ignored the findings and recommendations of the Hart- Rudman Commission on U.S. National Security in the 21st Century, which highlighted the impending threat of Islamic terrorism long before that Tuesday in September.Every American *SHOULD* see this movie, whether or not you agree with its message - at the least, there should be a national discourse on the issues raised by Moore.</fullReview>

So far as the thing I personally have checked, Moore is telling the verifiable truth. He's certainly not putting anything pro-Bush in the movie, but he's upfront about that.

		<fullReview>Michael Moore has an ability to weave together enough fragments to paint a seemingly convincing portrait - grossly oversimplifed and one sided - however it may not be immediately apparent to enough of the audience lacking critical thinking skills. To present a truthful depiction, you need to examine both sides of the coin - why doesn't Moore discuss how Saddam Hussein gassed his own people (Kurds) in Iraq in the mid-1980s? And why does he choose not to examine Bin Laden's motivations for his attack on the US? provoked or unprovoked? Or what flaws in our own society result in us electing leaders we later regret? Thus the film is reduced to delivering a grossly oversimplified message which we already know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid pseudo-documentary, but falls prey to Moore's typical indulgences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore does not make documentaries, he has admitted this several times. He creates "pseudo-documentaries."I have never been a big fan of Moore, since he is pretty dishonest with his "pseudo-documentaries." He never uses logic, he spoon-feeds you half-truths and works your emotions. Here's his usual formula:1.) Present a rumor as fact, with absolutely no hard evidence to back up his claim. 2.) Drive it home with hyperbole (aka the Moore Sledgehammer), often with a nice witty angle. (Music, film clip, joke, etc) 3.) Totally omit facts that call his conclusions into question. 4.) Presents himself as the champion of the underdog, working class guy, so we'll root for him and swallow all of this tripe without thinking about it.These movies make me angry over Moore's pure arrogance. He reminds me of the kind of orator who does a masterful speech, because he's good at propaganda and manipulation, but he cannot debate, because he is unable to deal with challenges to the concepts he is driving home with a sledgehammer.Now make no mistake. I am not going to say Moore is wrong here. In fact, I think he's pretty on target with some of his claims. Keeping people in fear because they are easy to control... a message in "Bowling for Columbine" that was about as subtle as a fire axe in the chest... I think it's entirely plausible. The whole Iraq War as an excuse, that was already planned and 9/11 was a convenient excuse... yep, I think that's pretty obvious to everyone. The Saudi connection to the Bushes.... yes, I've long seen that as an ulterior motive. The poor of this country paying in blood for the policies of the rich... DUH, Mikey.... hasn't it ALWAYS been that way, since the wars Dark Ages? And of course, the view that Bush is the source of all our problems. I personally do not like Bush, I think he's dumb and probably the worst president since Harding. But Michael Moore has publicly shown his intense personal hatred for Bush. I'd like to remind you all of that before you watch this movie. Again, he offers little proof, and a lot of spectacle, and a lot of people come away thinking he can't be wrong......and before you take Michael Moore's word as gospel, as so many people seem anxious to do, let me remind you that Bowling for Columbine was filled with all kinds of outright false claims, misleading dubbing and spliced speech footage. Simply because someone makes a powerful case (through an eloquent argument or a good movie, which 9/11 actually is) does not make him automatically correct. As always, you should research the evidence before buying into propaganda or opinions in general.I saw a message on this board saying Michael Moore should be shot for this film. Moore has a right to his opinion. He has a right to communicate his opinion to as many people as he can, and that's a right that does not exist in many countries. Censorship of opinions of the government is one right the government has not taken away from us, as evidenced by this film's release. And that's the best kind of free speech. Yet you can disagree with him and refuse to see his movies.As usual, I'll do the former and not the latter. Because it was a good film, and it is the duty of us as Americans to keep an eye on shady dealings of our government. I just don't buy in all of Moore's words, which he has proven before to be less than truthful and mere interpretations presented as absolute truth. And this movie smacks of a lot of that.7/10.</fullReview>

He did a good job of expressing the feelings of most people about the events before and after 911. Here are a few strengths and weaknesses:Strength: People were quiet during most of this movie. But it was wonderful when people would just start clapping, like when the solider said that if he was asked to return to Iraq, he would refuse, because he couldn't stand to kill poor and innocent people to make Bush rich. That was beautifulWeakness: The tone was too satirical, too funny, I know no one wants to be bored at the theater, but these are somber issues, not funny ones.Strength: He obviously spent a great deal of time researching for this movie. It was very comprehensive, he reminded us that we did not in fact elect Bush, he showed us documents that link Bush to the Bin Laden family, etc. He left few stones unturned. Weakness: Not enough attention to the suffering of Iraqis. I know that Moore knows his audience, and they are more interested in seeing how their tax dollars are being wasted to make a few millionaires richer, but to me the real issue at hand here is the unjustified and brutal suffering imposed on the people of Iraq.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One anarchist's brief review and first impressions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 (my rating: 6.5 out of 10)Mike Moore's new film , besides its many flaws, is all together a well assembled piece of work. The distinctive humor of the director from Flint is as sharp as in any of his other flicks. His skill in ridiculing his victims (and make/let them ridicule themselves) is one of the points of strength of this 2 hour film.The movie is funny and not boring; it also does not overwhelm the viewer with notions and information, making it appealing even to those who generally shy away from political documentaries. Unfortunately 99% of the facts exposed had already appeared not only on countless mainstream books and newspaper articles but even on documentaries such as "Breaking The Silence" By (Australian?) journalist John Pilger, "The Bush Family Fortune" by Greg Palast &amp; BBC, "In Shifting Sands" by former UN inspector Scott Ritter, and many other titles; including nearly any Indymedia film/presentation on the Bush administration and the war in Iraq. If you have already seen those documentaries you'll find 9/11 Fahrenheit has little to teach you. Many aspects of the corruption-loop of corporate-capitalism and representative democracy are more than just hinted at. At the same time there is little effort to present it as one enormous flaw in the democratic system, instead the focus is kept on the bad behavior of a few specific individuals and companies.Bottom Line : The movie is more than decent and it's worth going to see it. Although personally, I was hoping for more than just a "Bush-Bashing festival" with a wink at the Democrats. I personally believe it can be very misleading to the less informed viewer who will not perceive the corruption of our ruling class as a systemic problem, but rather as something we can affect through the very instruments this corrupt ruling class puts at our disposal. Sacrificing some less useful footage in exchange for a clearer and wider picture could have transformed the film into something closer to a top-notch work of political analysis (such as M. Achbar's "Manufacturing Consent : Noam Chomsky and the Media").HIGHS-A good collage of (previously surfaced) essential information.-Great footage of George Bush and gang buddies humiliating themselves-The film is mainly structured for that large sector of the publicwhich has slacked on the homework (which is good)-The public exposure of the contempt and complacency of Congress was admirable. I am happy that tens of millions of people will find out that all those bills that get passed all the time, get barely looked at by their representatives.-The grotesque display of racism by the institutions at the time when tens of African-American representatives could not get ONE SINGLE SENATOR to sign their motions against Dubya's presidential victory, was refreshing.-Good depiction of the armed forces mentality and mind-controlling techniques. LOWS-Most of the film content had already appeared in documentary-format as far back as 2 years ago. Sadly enough, It took the involvement Disney Corporation to communicate a slightly more realistic picture of reality to the large masses.(Now, isn't that frightening?)-A definite pro-Democrat spin. Personally, I would consider the presidential victory of Al Gore quite far from "A dream". I thought the focus put on not re-electing GW Bush is excessive and even scapegoat-ish. The bi-partisan support (and even nature) of many of the Bush Administration policies is conveniently not addressed.-The film generally lacks historical background; not only when analysing Iraq and Afghanistan, but even on the individuals who make up the current administration. it does not fully expose the criminal past of monsters such as Donald Rumsfeld, John Negroponte (even though he was not ambassador to Iraq when the film was finished, he was still US ambassador to the UN until then) and Paul Wolfowitz.-The complicity of the corporate media in government affairs is also overlooked (other than sporadic attacks on FOX news).-Iraqi and Afghan voices are almost absent (made exception for some footage of middle-eastern civilians being abused by US troopers or weeping in the aftermath of bombardments).-Obviously the movie was finished before the Abu-Grahib "scandal". Still there is no mention of the many abuses carried out against Afghan POWs and "enemy combatants" (on Afghan soil). I recommend a flick called "The Convoy of Death" if you are interested in that). Not even Guantanamo Bay is mentioned (If my memory is not faulting me).-There was no mention that March 20th 2003 (the beginning of operation "Iraqi Freedom") was the day of largest worldwide anti-war demonstrations in history. (if you want to see something about that watch "We Interrupt This Empire" By San Francisco Indymedia)-Arguable choice of showing the "shock and awe" footage, but blacking out the screen when the airplanes hit the World Trade Center. Aren't they equally horrific? -An invitation or suggestion to the public to carry out opposition (let alone gain actual control over our destiny) BEYOND the electoral booth, is absent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw F911 at a matine yesterday and this movie is truly a MUST-SEE! It's a "FAIR and BALANCED" view of one George W. Bush. Finally!It played on three screens and was sold out in the middle of the afternoon. The audience applauded and laughed riotously throughout the movie.Some highlights:Moore reminded us that Bush and the Taliban were FAMOUS friends before 9/11. Bush and the Taliban leaders, PERFECT TOGETHER, and on film too! (Maybe that's why Bush gave the Taliban two months head start before invading?)Moore also reminded us that Bush and the Saudi ambassador are SO close personally that Bush had nicknamed him "Bandar Bush"! (I forgot!) Bush and the Saudi Royals,- ONE HAPPY FAMILY. Especially after 9/11! Moore has film of Bush and all his people shaking hands with the Saudis after 9/11. All of them are THRILLED to be in their august Saudi presence, except one. Watch the look on Colin Powell's face,- just precious! Apparently Powell is the only one who remembers 9/11, and that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi, as was their leader and their financial support. All the other Bush people forgot 9/11 totally.The film of the war is not your run of the mill corporate-censored for the USA stuff. It's from other sources, and Moore's own "plant" in the Army. Let's just say it's realistic. Moore shows the great good taste not to replay the towers burning or the people jumping to their deaths. (We remember) Instead he shows the plight of the families. Thanks!Moore has the complete tape of Bush's response to finding out that the USA was under attack on 9/11. You won't want to miss that!And you'll want to see the ending, that last 30-40 seconds, of the movie,- over and over and over. Moore saves the very best Bush clip for last. It's a doozy.PS #1: All that talk on the corporate TV about the movie being propaganda is balderdash. Even if you shut off the commentary altogether, and looked only at the films and listened to the Bushistas own words, the same point would get across,- exactly. The truth may hurt, but it's the truth nevertheless.PS #2: This movie will be a MAJOR blockbuster. Eisner's head should be on the block shortly. Hope none of you own Disney stock. They just lost a mint!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie serves a purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If MM was a G. Bush supporter, I have no doubt he could produce a film that would present evidence and emotion to paint GB as the greatest thing since sliced bread. Michael Moore makes no apologies for his slanted view. However, I have not seen any evidence that the allegations MM makes are not 100% accurate. The intent of this film is to show the American people things about the Iraqi war that most have probably never thought of. Its very easy to think of war in the "good guys kick ass" terms. It puts a very different spin on it when you see 18 year old kids aka soldiers 30 seconds after a bomb has exploded and they are lying on the ground bleeding to death. Or you see a pile of burned up and bullet ridden 5 year olds...some of whom are still alive. Makes people actually think about the ramifications of sending troops into war...and do we have all the facts needed to make a decision? We should ALWAYS keep those images in our heads before we commit to war.He also outlines business and financial ties that the Bush family has with the Bin Laden family. These are not unfounded allegations - these are documented facts. Based on the reactions from the crowd around me in the theater...most people had no idea. I'm glad that MM has made it easy for those people to get that information.I didn't come out of the theater any more educated, because I pretty much knew about everything that he had presented. I also can't really say that I like MM's way of explaining things to me like I have an IQ of 80 (like I won't realize that he's trying to manipulate my view of things). However, since I've been debating the subject of the war in Iraq with a lot of people and find that too many say "We are fighting Iraq and Saddam because of 9-11"...I think this movie serves a good purpose. It presents the facts in a dumbed down, slanted and prepackaged way that some people need. If that gets Bush out of office in 2004, I'll recommend that everyone go see it.--Tina</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freedom of Speech. Absolutely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After this film won the Golden Palm at Cannes, what is impossible to argue with is that this is the film the rest of the film/arts/world community wanted to see SO badly that they gave their highest honor to a documentary made by an American eccentric. This is the film they believed we should make. This is the critical assessment of ourselves and our political machine they wanted us to make. It is a film that sees us, the U.S., they way the rest of the industrialized world sees us -- and it is critical, occasionally condemning, and always hopeful that we will pull ourselves up by our collective All-American bootstraps and kick ourselves in the butt when we screw up on the global stage.Or maybe what they wanted to see so badly is that we are not all blind, stupid, bleating sheep they are afraid we are -- and that maybe this really is the place where freedom of speech means we get more different perspectives than are offered by CNN, Disney, TIME, the NYTimes and FOX. For 2 years after 9/11, anyone that said anything against Bush (or even questioning Bush) was set aflame by the conservatives. And, truth be known, for the first few months, this was a reasonable response. However, the responsibility of the press (though evidently not the corporate press) is to ask all the questions regardless of the political tides. Since the corporate press didn't do it, it fell to those outside the corporate media. What once was the domain of investigative reporters seems now to fall to independent film-makers.Whether we agree or disagree with Micheal Moore's point of view, conclusions, suggestions, and his assembly of the puzzle pieces, we will fight tooth and nail for his right to try to do what the press and the political analysts failed to do --To ask all the questions. --To exercise the freedom of speech we believe in.I hope Michael Moore is wrong about at least part of what he presents. I also know that he is probably right about big parts of the puzzle. And I know for certain I want him to keep asking questions with the camera running.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Moore: Slick, Humorous, Compelling and Thought-Provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, I do not work for the United States Government, but I do work for a defense think-tank that focuses on U.S. interests in the Middle East, Terrorism, WMDs and Global Islamic Fundamentalism. These views are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my employer, its advisors or directors.It's an interesting juxtaposition, to see the events of September 11th, Operation Enduring Freedom and the U.S. invasion of Iraq through the eyes of Michael Moore, after having seen them firsthand. Over the course of the last few years, I have seen this nation become increasingly hostile against questions aimed at our leaders. Personally, I see it as a citizen's duty to ask questions of our leaders and their policies, even if we believe in them, yet such questions are increasingly labeled as "un-American" and even "pro-terrorist." Perhaps, after seeing this film, more and more Americans will begin to ask themselves why the issues Moore raises aren't being thoroughly questioned and why those questions aren't being answered.Yes, as usual, Moore uses fast editing and careful wording to imply 'facts' that aren't quite true, but then again, I've yet to see a film that doesn't present the story through the eyes of the producers and the director.

It was very comprehensive, he reminded us that we did not in fact elect Bush, he showed us documents that link Bush to the Bin Laden family, etc. He left few stones unturned. Weakness: Not enough attention to the suffering of Iraqis. I know that Moore knows his audience, and they are more interested in seeing how their tax dollars are being wasted to make a few millionaires richer, but to me the real issue at hand here is the unjustified and brutal suffering imposed on the people of Iraq.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One anarchist's brief review and first impressions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 (my rating: 6.5 out of 10)Mike Moore's new film , besides its many flaws, is all together a well assembled piece of work. The distinctive humor of the director from Flint is as sharp as in any of his other flicks. His skill in ridiculing his victims (and make/let them ridicule themselves) is one of the points of strength of this 2 hour film.The movie is funny and not boring; it also does not overwhelm the viewer with notions and information, making it appealing even to those who generally shy away from political documentaries. Unfortunately 99% of the facts exposed had already appeared not only on countless mainstream books and newspaper articles but even on documentaries such as "Breaking The Silence" By (Australian?) journalist John Pilger, "The Bush Family Fortune" by Greg Palast &amp; BBC, "In Shifting Sands" by former UN inspector Scott Ritter, and many other titles; including nearly any Indymedia film/presentation on the Bush administration and the war in Iraq. If you have already seen those documentaries you'll find 9/11 Fahrenheit has little to teach you. Many aspects of the corruption-loop of corporate-capitalism and representative democracy are more than just hinted at. At the same time there is little effort to present it as one enormous flaw in the democratic system, instead the focus is kept on the bad behavior of a few specific individuals and companies.Bottom Line : The movie is more than decent and it's worth going to see it. Although personally, I was hoping for more than just a "Bush-Bashing festival" with a wink at the Democrats. I personally believe it can be very misleading to the less informed viewer who will not perceive the corruption of our ruling class as a systemic problem, but rather as something we can affect through the very instruments this corrupt ruling class puts at our disposal. Sacrificing some less useful footage in exchange for a clearer and wider picture could have transformed the film into something closer to a top-notch work of political analysis (such as M. Achbar's "Manufacturing Consent : Noam Chomsky and the Media").HIGHS-A good collage of (previously surfaced) essential information.-Great footage of George Bush and gang buddies humiliating themselves-The film is mainly structured for that large sector of the publicwhich has slacked on the homework (which is good)-The public exposure of the contempt and complacency of Congress was admirable. I am happy that tens of millions of people will find out that all those bills that get passed all the time, get barely looked at by their representatives.-The grotesque display of racism by the institutions at the time when tens of African-American representatives could not get ONE SINGLE SENATOR to sign their motions against Dubya's presidential victory, was refreshing.-Good depiction of the armed forces mentality and mind-controlling techniques. LOWS-Most of the film content had already appeared in documentary-format as far back as 2 years ago. Sadly enough, It took the involvement Disney Corporation to communicate a slightly more realistic picture of reality to the large masses.(Now, isn't that frightening?)-A definite pro-Democrat spin. Personally, I would consider the presidential victory of Al Gore quite far from "A dream". I thought the focus put on not re-electing GW Bush is excessive and even scapegoat-ish. The bi-partisan support (and even nature) of many of the Bush Administration policies is conveniently not addressed.-The film generally lacks historical background; not only when analysing Iraq and Afghanistan, but even on the individuals who make up the current administration. it does not fully expose the criminal past of monsters such as Donald Rumsfeld, John Negroponte (even though he was not ambassador to Iraq when the film was finished, he was still US ambassador to the UN until then) and Paul Wolfowitz.-The complicity of the corporate media in government affairs is also overlooked (other than sporadic attacks on FOX news).-Iraqi and Afghan voices are almost absent (made exception for some footage of middle-eastern civilians being abused by US troopers or weeping in the aftermath of bombardments).-Obviously the movie was finished before the Abu-Grahib "scandal". Still there is no mention of the many abuses carried out against Afghan POWs and "enemy combatants" (on Afghan soil). I recommend a flick called "The Convoy of Death" if you are interested in that). Not even Guantanamo Bay is mentioned (If my memory is not faulting me).-There was no mention that March 20th 2003 (the beginning of operation "Iraqi Freedom") was the day of largest worldwide anti-war demonstrations in history. (if you want to see something about that watch "We Interrupt This Empire" By San Francisco Indymedia)-Arguable choice of showing the "shock and awe" footage, but blacking out the screen when the airplanes hit the World Trade Center. Aren't they equally horrific? -An invitation or suggestion to the public to carry out opposition (let alone gain actual control over our destiny) BEYOND the electoral booth, is absent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw F911 at a matine yesterday and this movie is truly a MUST-SEE! It's a "FAIR and BALANCED" view of one George W. Bush. Finally!It played on three screens and was sold out in the middle of the afternoon. The audience applauded and laughed riotously throughout the movie.Some highlights:Moore reminded us that Bush and the Taliban were FAMOUS friends before 9/11. Bush and the Taliban leaders, PERFECT TOGETHER, and on film too! (Maybe that's why Bush gave the Taliban two months head start before invading?)Moore also reminded us that Bush and the Saudi ambassador are SO close personally that Bush had nicknamed him "Bandar Bush"! (I forgot!) Bush and the Saudi Royals,- ONE HAPPY FAMILY. Especially after 9/11! Moore has film of Bush and all his people shaking hands with the Saudis after 9/11. All of them are THRILLED to be in their august Saudi presence, except one. Watch the look on Colin Powell's face,- just precious! Apparently Powell is the only one who remembers 9/11, and that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi, as was their leader and their financial support. All the other Bush people forgot 9/11 totally.The film of the war is not your run of the mill corporate-censored for the USA stuff. It's from other sources, and Moore's own "plant" in the Army. Let's just say it's realistic. Moore shows the great good taste not to replay the towers burning or the people jumping to their deaths. (We remember) Instead he shows the plight of the families. Thanks!Moore has the complete tape of Bush's response to finding out that the USA was under attack on 9/11. You won't want to miss that!And you'll want to see the ending, that last 30-40 seconds, of the movie,- over and over and over. Moore saves the very best Bush clip for last. It's a doozy.PS #1: All that talk on the corporate TV about the movie being propaganda is balderdash. Even if you shut off the commentary altogether, and looked only at the films and listened to the Bushistas own words, the same point would get across,- exactly. The truth may hurt, but it's the truth nevertheless.PS #2: This movie will be a MAJOR blockbuster. Eisner's head should be on the block shortly. Hope none of you own Disney stock. They just lost a mint!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie serves a purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If MM was a G. Bush supporter, I have no doubt he could produce a film that would present evidence and emotion to paint GB as the greatest thing since sliced bread. Michael Moore makes no apologies for his slanted view. However, I have not seen any evidence that the allegations MM makes are not 100% accurate. The intent of this film is to show the American people things about the Iraqi war that most have probably never thought of. Its very easy to think of war in the "good guys kick ass" terms. It puts a very different spin on it when you see 18 year old kids aka soldiers 30 seconds after a bomb has exploded and they are lying on the ground bleeding to death. Or you see a pile of burned up and bullet ridden 5 year olds...some of whom are still alive. Makes people actually think about the ramifications of sending troops into war...and do we have all the facts needed to make a decision? We should ALWAYS keep those images in our heads before we commit to war.He also outlines business and financial ties that the Bush family has with the Bin Laden family. These are not unfounded allegations - these are documented facts. Based on the reactions from the crowd around me in the theater...most people had no idea. I'm glad that MM has made it easy for those people to get that information.I didn't come out of the theater any more educated, because I pretty much knew about everything that he had presented. I also can't really say that I like MM's way of explaining things to me like I have an IQ of 80 (like I won't realize that he's trying to manipulate my view of things). However, since I've been debating the subject of the war in Iraq with a lot of people and find that too many say "We are fighting Iraq and Saddam because of 9-11"...I think this movie serves a good purpose. It presents the facts in a dumbed down, slanted and prepackaged way that some people need. If that gets Bush out of office in 2004, I'll recommend that everyone go see it.--Tina</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freedom of Speech. Absolutely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After this film won the Golden Palm at Cannes, what is impossible to argue with is that this is the film the rest of the film/arts/world community wanted to see SO badly that they gave their highest honor to a documentary made by an American eccentric. This is the film they believed we should make. This is the critical assessment of ourselves and our political machine they wanted us to make. It is a film that sees us, the U.S., they way the rest of the industrialized world sees us -- and it is critical, occasionally condemning, and always hopeful that we will pull ourselves up by our collective All-American bootstraps and kick ourselves in the butt when we screw up on the global stage.Or maybe what they wanted to see so badly is that we are not all blind, stupid, bleating sheep they are afraid we are -- and that maybe this really is the place where freedom of speech means we get more different perspectives than are offered by CNN, Disney, TIME, the NYTimes and FOX. For 2 years after 9/11, anyone that said anything against Bush (or even questioning Bush) was set aflame by the conservatives. And, truth be known, for the first few months, this was a reasonable response. However, the responsibility of the press (though evidently not the corporate press) is to ask all the questions regardless of the political tides. Since the corporate press didn't do it, it fell to those outside the corporate media. What once was the domain of investigative reporters seems now to fall to independent film-makers.Whether we agree or disagree with Micheal Moore's point of view, conclusions, suggestions, and his assembly of the puzzle pieces, we will fight tooth and nail for his right to try to do what the press and the political analysts failed to do --To ask all the questions. --To exercise the freedom of speech we believe in.I hope Michael Moore is wrong about at least part of what he presents. I also know that he is probably right about big parts of the puzzle. And I know for certain I want him to keep asking questions with the camera running.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Moore: Slick, Humorous, Compelling and Thought-Provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, I do not work for the United States Government, but I do work for a defense think-tank that focuses on U.S. interests in the Middle East, Terrorism, WMDs and Global Islamic Fundamentalism. These views are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my employer, its advisors or directors.It's an interesting juxtaposition, to see the events of September 11th, Operation Enduring Freedom and the U.S. invasion of Iraq through the eyes of Michael Moore, after having seen them firsthand. Over the course of the last few years, I have seen this nation become increasingly hostile against questions aimed at our leaders. Personally, I see it as a citizen's duty to ask questions of our leaders and their policies, even if we believe in them, yet such questions are increasingly labeled as "un-American" and even "pro-terrorist." Perhaps, after seeing this film, more and more Americans will begin to ask themselves why the issues Moore raises aren't being thoroughly questioned and why those questions aren't being answered.Yes, as usual, Moore uses fast editing and careful wording to imply 'facts' that aren't quite true, but then again, I've yet to see a film that doesn't present the story through the eyes of the producers and the director. You should no more take every frame as absolute truth than you should take Rush Limbaugh's daily radio show as holy gospel.Two important elements that should play heavily on the minds of Americans: 1) while the FBI did "interview" most of the Saudis who left the country on September 13th, agents were given less than 24 hours to investigate and speak with more than 1,100 Saudi nationals and 24 members of the bin Laden family; 2) why haven't we seen more interviews with our troops in Iraq -- why aren't they allowed to speak freely (enlisted personnel who have publicly criticized the Administration have been reassigned or dishonorably discharged).If anything, there was quite a bit that Moore left out -- I'd like to see an examination of the Saudi kingdom's continued efforts to spread Wahaabism - a key factor in creating the current climate of extreme fundamentalist Islam that pervades the Islamic world and continues to pervert the minds of young muslims. Furthermore, I'd like to see someone examine exactly why the Keane-Hamilton Commission to Investigate the Attacks Against the United States of September 11, 2001 completely ignored the findings and recommendations of the Hart- Rudman Commission on U.S. National Security in the 21st Century, which highlighted the impending threat of Islamic terrorism long before that Tuesday in September.Every American *SHOULD* see this movie, whether or not you agree with its message - at the least, there should be a national discourse on the issues raised by Moore.</fullReview>

It had a lot of facts in it I had not known.* The riot/demonstration at the inaugural motorcade.* The Democrats refusing to back African-American congressmen seeking an investigation into why so many African-American voters in Florida were disenfranchised.* The number of Carlyle Group connections in the War on Iraq.To name a few.I've been on the web ever since checking Moore's facts, trying for corroborating documentation things I saw in the film. So far as the thing I personally have checked, Moore is telling the verifiable truth. He's certainly not putting anything pro-Bush in the movie, but he's upfront about that. He called it an anti-Bush movie, and it certainly is that.I think everyone who saw this movie will learn something they didn't know.

		<fullReview>Michael Moore has an ability to weave together enough fragments to paint a seemingly convincing portrait - grossly oversimplifed and one sided - however it may not be immediately apparent to enough of the audience lacking critical thinking skills. To present a truthful depiction, you need to examine both sides of the coin - why doesn't Moore discuss how Saddam Hussein gassed his own people (Kurds) in Iraq in the mid-1980s? And why does he choose not to examine Bin Laden's motivations for his attack on the US? provoked or unprovoked? Or what flaws in our own society result in us electing leaders we later regret? Thus the film is reduced to delivering a grossly oversimplified message which we already know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid pseudo-documentary, but falls prey to Moore's typical indulgences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore does not make documentaries, he has admitted this several times. He creates "pseudo-documentaries."I have never been a big fan of Moore, since he is pretty dishonest with his "pseudo-documentaries." He never uses logic, he spoon-feeds you half-truths and works your emotions. Here's his usual formula:1.) Present a rumor as fact, with absolutely no hard evidence to back up his claim. 2.) Drive it home with hyperbole (aka the Moore Sledgehammer), often with a nice witty angle. (Music, film clip, joke, etc) 3.) Totally omit facts that call his conclusions into question. 4.) Presents himself as the champion of the underdog, working class guy, so we'll root for him and swallow all of this tripe without thinking about it.These movies make me angry over Moore's pure arrogance. He reminds me of the kind of orator who does a masterful speech, because he's good at propaganda and manipulation, but he cannot debate, because he is unable to deal with challenges to the concepts he is driving home with a sledgehammer.Now make no mistake. I am not going to say Moore is wrong here. In fact, I think he's pretty on target with some of his claims. Keeping people in fear because they are easy to control... a message in "Bowling for Columbine" that was about as subtle as a fire axe in the chest... I think it's entirely plausible. The whole Iraq War as an excuse, that was already planned and 9/11 was a convenient excuse... yep, I think that's pretty obvious to everyone. The Saudi connection to the Bushes.... yes, I've long seen that as an ulterior motive. The poor of this country paying in blood for the policies of the rich... DUH, Mikey.... hasn't it ALWAYS been that way, since the wars Dark Ages? And of course, the view that Bush is the source of all our problems. I personally do not like Bush, I think he's dumb and probably the worst president since Harding. But Michael Moore has publicly shown his intense personal hatred for Bush. I'd like to remind you all of that before you watch this movie. Again, he offers little proof, and a lot of spectacle, and a lot of people come away thinking he can't be wrong......and before you take Michael Moore's word as gospel, as so many people seem anxious to do, let me remind you that Bowling for Columbine was filled with all kinds of outright false claims, misleading dubbing and spliced speech footage. Simply because someone makes a powerful case (through an eloquent argument or a good movie, which 9/11 actually is) does not make him automatically correct. As always, you should research the evidence before buying into propaganda or opinions in general.I saw a message on this board saying Michael Moore should be shot for this film. Moore has a right to his opinion. He has a right to communicate his opinion to as many people as he can, and that's a right that does not exist in many countries. Censorship of opinions of the government is one right the government has not taken away from us, as evidenced by this film's release. And that's the best kind of free speech. Yet you can disagree with him and refuse to see his movies.As usual, I'll do the former and not the latter. Because it was a good film, and it is the duty of us as Americans to keep an eye on shady dealings of our government. I just don't buy in all of Moore's words, which he has proven before to be less than truthful and mere interpretations presented as absolute truth. And this movie smacks of a lot of that.7/10.</fullReview>

Moore, the infant terrible of documentarians told host Jon Stewart that he had an agenda (moviegoers never would have guessed) and that his facts are clear with their interpretation an open field.Moore probably believes this but many of his facts in this powerful but flawed documentary aren't so crystal clear and neither are they necessarily proven. Moore wants to see Bush defeated in November and as a documentarian with a cause he follows in a fairly long line of film-makers who, subtly or otherwise, have an agenda dear to their hearts. No one will ever denounce Moore for subtlety."Fahrenheit 9/11" may be one of the only films I've ever seen where the audience - most of them - began prolonged cheering when the director's name appeared in the OPENING sign boards. That reflected, of course, the political leaning of an affluent Westchester audience that was all-white and which filled surrounding parking lots with SUVs and luxury cars (my Honda Civic a small disgrace).Moore opens the film with a creative look at the Twin Towers tragedy. Rather than showing yet again the planes knifing into the buildings and their tortuous collapse, he uses sounds from Ground Zero with a blank screen which then segues to the horrified and occasionally hysterical visages of people on the street. We don't have to see the collapse-Moore correctly knows that what he's done is to rip loose indelible, horrific memories that supply what isn't on the screen. From there he goes to THE election as seen from both Florida and later in a joint congressional section where black representatives, one after the other, forlornly or bitterly demand the investigation into Florida fraud that can only take place with at least one's senator's acquiescence. No senator gives his or her signature and the scene bespeaks yet another betrayal of minorities, here at a crucial time in a hallowed place.Much of what follows is a demonstration of what even many Bush supporters can't avoid admitting - he's a mental lightweight, a fool and a clown but a man who through family contacts (especially 41's) with both American industry and the Saudi Arabian oligarchy is one rich fool. And his family's involvement with Saudi Arabian magnates who have invested billions in the U.S. is well presented and will be hard to refute.Many scenes that follow are readily familiar-Bush the very experienced and dedicated vacationer, Bush reading a children's book in a Florida school on 9/11 for seven long minutes after an aide whispered in his ear that the second tower had been hit and America was under attack. Apologists will trot out the usual vapid excuses for Bush's indifferent attitude and lackadaisical unrolling of short (and occasionally unintelligible) sound bites while the nation desperately needed real leadership both after 9/11 and during a war that seems to offer no likelihood of victory and even less of disengagement.The war in Iraq gets much play with combat scenes and footage of grisly dead and wounded, some from Al Jazeera with a few shots also prominent in the currently running "Control Room."Soldiers and family members are interviewed. Some troops are troubled by the war, others are repelled morally and politically. For other soldiers the war is an adventure, a chance to prove their mettle and the value of their training (these troops haven't been wounded yet). Family members are either arch-patriotic and supportive or they are riven with tears as they recount the loss of a loved one. A broken mother's account of learning of her son's death in combat by telephone from the Defense Department is heartbreaking: audience members were crying. (What happened to the claim that all such notifications are done in person by uniformed personnel? An economy taken as the casualty list increases?).While Moore makes the argument that the war's true purpose is to advance American business interests (Halliburton comes in for some well-deserved hits) and the military, especially its young members, are fodder for the plutocrats, the case isn't well advanced by showing scenes regularly screened in news reports and specials. It's Hidden Agenda Analysis Lite.What is both surprising and unexpected is the degree to which Moore, the sole interviewer, is unusually invisible, his typical attention-grabbing shenanigans at a minimum. In one episode he commandeers a Mister Frostie truck to drive around the Capitol reading the USA Patriot Act to members of Congress over the loudspeaker, some of whom admit on screen that they don't read the bills they vote for. This isn't news but when it's in reference to the very troubling, hastily put together and deeply flawed USA Patriot Act it's a reminder of how much power this administration sought and received with little careful legislative scrutiny. Almost none, in fact.Sillier and very irrelevant is vintage Moore waylaying members of Congress and offering recruiting literature while urging them to have their kids enlist. Enlisting or not is a personal decision-in our time it's no longer reasonable to arraign any parent on the charge that he/she has forsaken a patriotic duty to urge military service to their kids. TV coverage of Vietnam started to put paid to that. I'm reminded of that grand World War II patriotic song, "I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Bomb."Moore isn't just putting out a documentary-he's urging involvement by sympathetic viewers to defeat Bush and he has a website and a scheduled online Town Meeting to advance his goal. That's his privilege. Make no doubt about it: despite what some hysterical anti-Moore people are saying "Fahrenheit 911" is very much in the tradition of film, documentary or feature, aimed at motivating viewers to demand or make change.I saw "Fahrenheit 9/11"at the Jacob Burns Film Center dead set in the center of a constellation of very well-off Westchester, NY communities. Tomorrow I'll be back in Manhattan and I want to see the film in a less anti-Bush neighborhood (yeah, I'd prefer a second viewing in the South or rural Midwest but I can't find the time to fly around just to see Moore's movie again).Moore's movie is very important because his deep passion goes beyond the self-promotion central to his previous films. He's a zealot with regard to Bush and Iraq. That makes him both a fierce documentarian and a lightning rod for attack. How or if "Fahrenheit 9/11" will sway voters, especially those not committed to one side or the other, remains to be seen. What is certain is that Moore's fevered creation is a political milestone in documentary films.10/10</fullReview>

A lot of it is archived footage of news and of Bush, but also interviews and a couple of Michael Moore gags where he goes out into DC and tries some funny but sad things(like try to get congressmen to enlist there children to go to Iraq - half of them walk away, the other half laugh at him- do we really want to be governed by these people?). Conservatives B*tch about this movie because secretly they know it's true and who wants to admit they're wrong? So they back up Bush by calling this propaganda and lies.I knew Bush was a horrible person going into the movie. This flick didn't have to confirm it for me. Most anyone who will see this hates Bush. This movie isn't about brainwashing people's minds with liberal propaganda because the people already hate him. This movie exposes more of the horrible president we're under.

Everyone on this planet should see this movie if for no other reason than to be part of the national debate. This film made me think and question all the balogna I hear on talk radio and cable tv.

		<shortDescription>Moore's not just in it for money. It's about exposing an immorality to improve America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny, entertaining, opinionated, selective, and slanderous...and it's not a big lie. The right can argue and spin against Moore's slanderous editing, selective interviews and presumptive conclusions and underhanded jokes, but when Moore presents documents on screen, and images that Bush wouldn't dare let you see, you will know that something isn't kosher with Bush, no matter how much opinion and slander is involved in the way the film is made.I don't care what party you are on, you must see it if you ever want to be taken seriously as an educated debater in my book, especially if you are going to criticize Moore. Not seeing this film is the equivalent of plugging your ears, going "La La La, I'm right, no matter what you show me!". Obviously, we are never going to be swayed by "He's fat and he hates America". See the film, or be laughed at for refusing knowledge of what he says.The film is not about attacking the Republican party. He just targets Bush and his associates. It's not about sympathizing for terrorists or Saddam Hussein. He's not protesting the war in Afghanistan. There's not a moment in the film where he says "the republican party wants this or that", and there's no moment where he says "these terrorists are innocent victims." Footage of 9/11 is minimal. In fact you don't see it happen. He knows we've all seen it, and that showing it again is just rubbing it in. No bodies were shown from that incident, obviously so people who want to claim he's using footage of dead 9/11 victims for selfish reasons can't do so.Moore didn't release this film to just make money. Besides, don't you conservatives out there believe in capitalism, or only when a conservative like yourself is reaping the benefits? You'll criticize Moore for making making money on a film, but what Halliburton does in Iraq is just peachy, and the Bush team using 9/11 footage for campaigning is fine and dandy.Moore made this film because he has footage that he believes proves there is something not right with the President, and he felt it was morally right to share it with the public.People who accuse Moore of profiteering off of 9/11 obviously haven't seen the film, so if you want anyone to believe anything you have to say about the film, or Moore, you have to see the film first from beginning to end and tell them the last line of dialogue so they know you saw it.Remember, you can criticize the slander and selective editing all you want, but you can't discredit the documents and footage, and therefore can't discredit all of Moore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Much As It Could Have Been; Worth Seeing Anyway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good points of this film have already been gone over elsewhere.It shows us that George Bush really is not as smart as one needs to be to be president; it shows us that Sherman was correct and "war is hell," our "war of liberation" in Iraq included.It reminds us that Bush stole the election from Gore, with the aid of highly placed Republicans everwhere from the control room of Fox News to the governorship of Florida, and with the aid of wimpy Democrats.All that is very good.On the negative side:It's good to be reminded that American troops have done horrible things in Iraq, but this movie did not shake me as much as simple, mainstream press coverage of the Abu Ghraib abuses.So, it's late, and it's not as powerful as what we've already seen.Moore plays his usual game of stacking his own deck. For example, he shows footage of Iraq before the war started. In his vision, Iraq is a happy, peaceful place of happy, peaceful people.Those images are fine -- it's the images that are missing that are the problem. Moore does not show women being repeatedly raped, as a means of Iraqi state torture; he does not show the after effects of the gassing of the Kurds; he does not show the kind of images that caused intelligent, decent and well meaning people like Kanan Makiya to argue for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.The movie's single biggest problem is that it plays a very, very comfortable "Us v. Them" card.Viewers can walk out of this movie patting themselves on the back because they are not George Bush. They can feel virtuous and righteous. They can feel superior and smug. They can feel that they don't have to do anything, because the Bush family is the problem.That's dangerous nonsense, of course.Bush-hating leftists also drive cars.Bush-hating leftists also guzzle petroleum.Bush-hating leftists, to the extent that they drive cars and guzzle petroleum, are as much resonsible for the Iraq war and US presidents getting into bed with corrupt Saudis as anyone in the Bush family.And Michael Moore, oh so conveniently, never, ever has the courage or the intelligence to mention that.To say, "Okay, you liked my movie, you gasped at how stupid Bush is -- now go kill your car. Rely on public transportation. Walk. Agitate for alternative fuels. Live in re-designed communities. Don't just be smirking, smug, superior limousine liberals."And that's a pretty big flaw in a movie in which every frame centers on the evils of petroleum addiction, the corruption inherent in petroleum addiction, and the very high price of petroleum addiction -- an addiction to which right wingers and left wingers have equally succumbed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Challenge To Republicans: See It And Decide For Yourself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't put this succinctly enough: "Fahrenheit 9/11" is a pro-American film. This film upholds the values I was raised to believe were American values. This film treats our troops in Iraq with respect. This film treats Iraqis as human beings. This film treats the victims of the September 11th attacks with dignity. This film upholds the traditional American doctrine of war as a last resort. The only contempt that this film shows is contempt for those who derailed the real war on terror, and led us into a war for profit based on lies.I went to see "Passion of the Christ" even though I didn't want to. Why? Because I wanted to be able to discuss the film intelligently with others. I didn't like the film, and I knew I wouldn't like it when I entered the theatre, but I went anyway because I felt it was my duty to be educated about it.I make the same challenge to supporters of the current administration. Bite the bullet, pay the eight bucks, and decide for yourself. Don't let others decide for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Welcome to America people a place where we are all free to express our views. In America popular speech is as important as unpopular speech, and our founding fathers believed that if a goverment lost sight of the needs of its own people that it should be critiqued. Michael Moore has made such a critiqued and it is a blistering indictment of the Bush Administration's policies after 911. The movie is about the explotation of tragedy for power. I won't say that much more I don't want to ruin any of it for you who haven't seen it, but believe me this movie packs a wallop and my moderate hide loved it. To all you cranky coservatives who damn Michael Moore and curse his name remember this you bashed Clinton into the ground like a stake, well guys get ready for Bush Bashing 2004 cause paybacks a well...you know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to Documentaries Mr. Moore is among the best if not the best there is. The purpose of this type of film is to encourage the viewer to pause and think. This film accomplishes that and more. There may be those who disagree with Mr. Moore's point of view, but one cannot deny the gravity of this film. The facts are there for all to see. Mr. Moore puts his own spin on things but the facts remain nonetheless. He has a knack of finding the "every day person" and showing us how they are affected by decisions made by government and business officials. In this film that "every day person" is personified by Lila from Flint, Michigan. I believe that "Bowling for Columbine" was a bit more powerful film but Fahrenheit 9/11 is well worth the money and time waiting in line for tickets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is a celebration of the freedom of speech</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>much can be heard of the controversy (the direct mockery of our commander in chief, the *facts* to be straight and true, and a grassroots conservative group to ban it from theaters) and if your on either side then this film can explain a lot. the presidency has been deceiving the people once the suggestion of war came. war does not bring any peace but more wars and more violence (example: the occupation of "post war Iraq"). the great thing about Michael Moore is not what he has done in the film but what he hasn't done. sure more can be put in but the greatest facts remain. The movie is one sided and the audience are aware of that (the numerous news reports and Michael Moore's appearances on TV shows about the film) but its not a typical Michael Moore film. Many who are aware of him know his ambush approach to questioning and mocking politicians and corporate heads out of the dark like Charlton Heston in bowling for columbine. that approach was unfair to Charlton and Michael is more reserved here. he knows the facts will speak for itself. for the occasional mockery (the ice cream truck to the capital, the enlisting of congressmen's kids to go to Iraq, and the gunsmoke portray of figure heads)but what we want to hear are the people there such as congressmen, documents, and the people involved in the war directly and indirectly. the emotional part comes from Moore's interview with a woman who lost her son in the war and her reading his last letter. as i sat in the theater my eyes began to tear and also heard the crying of people around me. this moment can make anyone cry and some argue its used to justify Moore's favor. i don't think so. its very hard to hear the soldier's stories in the media and also the effects of the war. the effects of the Florida election and the budget cuts are well presented. the black votes are new information to me and the documents of bush's records in the national guard. since Moore had old records before they were changed and release there is a comparison hard to deny. the more is a take it or leave it situation. you can accept the facts or embrace them as new evidence against the president. for many liberals and democrats who want to throw bush out of the white house this fuels their rage as more evidence; not seen or heard on the news. the film is excellent entertainment as Moore embraces the comical sides of the situation as well as the emotional ones. to many your money is well deserved here and i thought so. politics or not this film is a real eye opener. go see it and remember to vote in November.</fullReview>

For anyone who is a policy wonk, there is not much new here information wise, sans the touching personal stories, but it is presented in a coherent and compelling manner. Know going in that it is a POV documentary and that Moore presents his point of view that is very anti-Bush in the area of his reaction of the "war" on terrorism and his separate war on Iraq. The way Moore shows the principle players getting ready at the start of the film and then getting unplugged at the end, "here starts my film, and here ends my film," is a nice presentation piece of opening and closing. This film displays at times very graphic images and is not recommended to young children but it is a very important film, whether pro or anti-Bush to see, for all adults to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>45% of America is going to say right on Mr. Moore and 45% will say what a piece of crap. I am a die hard Democrat but know that Moore doesn't take a trip anywhere unless he can only turn left to get there. After watching Bowling for Colombine I looked into some of the things he said and discovered that twisting and stretching the truth is not only something he accuses the right of doing but something he does himself from time to time. The tone of this movie is dead on and the majority of misinformed Americans would be shocked to see some undisputed facts of the movie and catch just a small glimpse of why more people than ever world wide hate us and why it is now easier than ever for some groups to recruit the poorest of the poor to die fighting us. By tone I mean the "look at the left hand and never mind what the right is doing,' ulterior motives pressing forth the personal agenda of this administration from top to bottom. No President was ever or will ever be perfect and make everyone happy but what they do they do in our name and at the end of the day people die because of the decisions they make and we have to believe they are dieing for the right reasons or we take a step closer to being more like what we are fighting to stop. Watch this movie and question the things we all just assumed were the right reasons before the war and decide for yourself come election time. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Moore's movie showed the truth about the corruption in our government. Moore is quite a facts man, and I love how he backs all of what he says with documented evidence. The images from the film were astute and not overdone, and overall, I found the film informative, humorous without being glib, and thought provoking. Also, Moore always finds a way to shove the facts back at his target, and the scene where he asks the Senators to enroll their own children in the army was superbly done. Just the looks the Senators' faces said all that was needed. And those marine recruiters! They were like used car salesmen: selling their ideals with lies. The only question that I would have would be if the Bush administration will address any of these questions. Hopefully, when people see this movie, it will move some of the sluggish "my vote doesn't matter" people into taking a stand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say how interesting it is that this movie wasn't shown in 2 main theaters in my town, which usually have every movie that comes out. Yes, people know it's the truth, and they are afraid. Now... this is an amazing movie, pure and simple. It is a masterpiece documentary that everybody should see. This film shows nothing but the truth about who the American government is, and it goes into details with nothing but facts. It covers everything from Bush and 9/11 to Afghanistan and Iraq. I didn't learn much from this movie that I didn't already know, but it served as a great reminder. I'd like to thank Mr. Moore for being so brave and creating this movie. I'd also advise him to be very careful now and stay safe. Advice for everyone else: go see Fahrenheit 9/11 now. 10 out of 10. I would give it more but I can't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Michale Moore and not because he brings news to us which the mainstream media so very diligently hides, in a form of a great documentary. But because he helps us connect the dots, the news articles which we read and ignore, thinking its some kind of Bush or Republican bashing. 911 again shows that our soldier are dying in Iraq in vain, innocent civilians are being killed, for what? Oil? And for profit of companies that George Bush, his father and Dick Cheney hold a big share of.This movie is an eye opener for those conservatives who still believe in Bush. This movie and Michael Moore's other movies all have solid references to the source of the facts, news and statements. Not a single fact is made up.Apart from what this movie addressed and would probably help throw Bush out of White House. It brings home the point that government of our country is as good as us people. In 911, Bush is heard saying "Fool me once Shame on you, Fool me again Shame on me". So we have been fooled not again, only this time it was not Vietnam or Desert Storm. It was a plan meticulously executed, with drumbeat of Al-Qaeda and WMDs, to satisfy the greedy corporates with Bush connections and without. I think it did not address why American Democracy has been providing choice of only two parties for the last 4 decades. Why do we Americans donot raise voice to revamp the Federal Election Commision and most importantly the Presidential Debate Commission (PDC)? I think it is the FEC and PDC combined with Electoral College system that is the root of all problems, limiting our choice to elect. Just like Carlyle, Halliburton and Unocal the PDC is a private body which influences American mindset.I hope Michael Moore will make a movie which hits to the very core of our wrongly practiced Democracy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore hits at the Bush agenda with the Moore perspective. Moore is deeper, far more articulate than the Bushies. Moore has some major points to score for the side of democracy and against lopsided rule of the Republicans and their freedom for all those who can afford it. Moore's job IS a real job. He necessary to society. Bush turns out to be a destructive, selfish figure who's never had an honest job in his life. Moore might well convince many that Bush is a war criminal. If Bush had ever had a real job maybe he wouldn't have got into this trouble. This picture is not just your average documentary. It has more drama and laughs than a lot of features. It also appears to be a social phenomenon. I will only describe the scene at the theater as packed--and the people, after the show, very concerned. Oh, and Moore has a way of lightening up--surprising given that the material can be heavy. You are denying yourself an opportunity to be an informed citizen if for some irrational reason you decide not to see this movie and see what everybody's squawking about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie would be a over zealous slant against bush, but it's a middle slight to the left film. It just shows him doing what he does, and catching him at a number of lies. Moore does what journalist are supposed to do - report events! It was a whole lot funnier than I thought. It think it's so important every US citizen see how we have abandoned our own dead and wounded solders. (Where's their movies and news updates?) Also, the news tells us were only hitting civilians, but when they are holding a dead child one get's a better sense of the brutality that is this war.Anyway, I strongly encourage everyone who will ever vote to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I am proud to have men like Michael Moore as my fellow Americans. He speaks up, while most of us either hide in the ostrich position or are just plain ignorant on what is going on is the world. We are constantly being fed by the media with one-sided stories and that is is patriotic to support and stand behind all the evil doings of this country. Peace is patriotic too! It is easy to become politic after watching this well made documentary. It made me cry, it made me laugh, It made me shake my head in disbelief. A documentary that rocked my world. Critics are still going to trash it for Moore's subjectivity, but hey now, he certainly knows how to stir things up and possibly change the future? How long are we going to search for a terrorist behind every bush? Would a man of integrity, please stand up and become our new leader?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monumental Achievement-An Important Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say what you will of Micheal Moore. Yes, he does sometimes invade the privacy of others to gain specific reactions for his films, and yes, he probably wouldn't enjoy anyone doing that to him. He can be a jerk, but this jerk can make one heckuva film. Moore proves in this film more than ever, his talents not just as a rabble-rouser, but as a filmmaker. He masterfully uses seemingly endless interview and archive footage to go beyond just documenting, but into the realm of story telling; with prologue, a bookends effect, a cast of players, character development, conflict, etc. It is a very poetic film at best, with the ability to gain every intended reaction; at times, the audience was laughing one moment and crying the next. Film-making aside, it is hard to decide how much Moore indulges the audience with footage that is taken out of context. Especially in his depictions of the white house staff, Moore may have over exaggerated many of the things he used from archive footage. Regardless over how unfair or what bias for which Moore has been criticized, the arguments are futile against: 1. his undeniable freedom to make any film he wants just as any director would, and 2. the power of the evidence he has in this film. Unlike past films, nearly every argument Moore presents is backed up with actual documents and, most powerfully, video footage (especially that out of Iraq).So he's done it again, but this time it's more relevant, more powerful, and more entertaining than ever. Regardless of personal politics, everyone should see this film; if not to be enlightened by many of the facts presented, but to simply debate their view afterward. We all have a right to our opinions, thank god Moore exercises his.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>45% of America is going to say right on Mr. Moore and 45% will say what a piece of crap. I am a die hard Democrat but know that Moore doesn't take a trip anywhere unless he can only turn left to get there. After watching Bowling for Colombine I looked into some of the things he said and discovered that twisting and stretching the truth is not only something he accuses the right of doing but something he does himself from time to time. The tone of this movie is dead on and the majority of misinformed Americans would be shocked to see some undisputed facts of the movie and catch just a small glimpse of why more people than ever world wide hate us and why it is now easier than ever for some groups to recruit the poorest of the poor to die fighting us. By tone I mean the "look at the left hand and never mind what the right is doing,' ulterior motives pressing forth the personal agenda of this administration from top to bottom. No President was ever or will ever be perfect and make everyone happy but what they do they do in our name and at the end of the day people die because of the decisions they make and we have to believe they are dieing for the right reasons or we take a step closer to being more like what we are fighting to stop. Watch this movie and question the things we all just assumed were the right reasons before the war and decide for yourself come election time. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally the truth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that Moore's movie showed the truth about the corruption in our government. Moore is quite a facts man, and I love how he backs all of what he says with documented evidence. The images from the film were astute and not overdone, and overall, I found the film informative, humorous without being glib, and thought provoking. Also, Moore always finds a way to shove the facts back at his target, and the scene where he asks the Senators to enroll their own children in the army was superbly done. Just the looks the Senators' faces said all that was needed. And those marine recruiters! They were like used car salesmen: selling their ideals with lies. The only question that I would have would be if the Bush administration will address any of these questions. Hopefully, when people see this movie, it will move some of the sluggish "my vote doesn't matter" people into taking a stand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie would be a over zealous slant against bush, but it's a middle slight to the left film. It just shows him doing what he does, and catching him at a number of lies. Moore does what journalist are supposed to do - report events! It was a whole lot funnier than I thought. It think it's so important every US citizen see how we have abandoned our own dead and wounded solders. (Where's their movies and news updates?) Also, the news tells us were only hitting civilians, but when they are holding a dead child one get's a better sense of the brutality that is this war.Anyway, I strongly encourage everyone who will ever vote to see this movie.</fullReview>

It is easy to become politic after watching this well made documentary. It made me cry, it made me laugh, It made me shake my head in disbelief. A documentary that rocked my world.

		<fullReview>Say what you will of Micheal Moore. Yes, he does sometimes invade the privacy of others to gain specific reactions for his films, and yes, he probably wouldn't enjoy anyone doing that to him. He can be a jerk, but this jerk can make one heckuva film. Moore proves in this film more than ever, his talents not just as a rabble-rouser, but as a filmmaker. He masterfully uses seemingly endless interview and archive footage to go beyond just documenting, but into the realm of story telling; with prologue, a bookends effect, a cast of players, character development, conflict, etc. It is a very poetic film at best, with the ability to gain every intended reaction; at times, the audience was laughing one moment and crying the next. Film-making aside, it is hard to decide how much Moore indulges the audience with footage that is taken out of context. Especially in his depictions of the white house staff, Moore may have over exaggerated many of the things he used from archive footage. Regardless over how unfair or what bias for which Moore has been criticized, the arguments are futile against: 1. his undeniable freedom to make any film he wants just as any director would, and 2. the power of the evidence he has in this film. Unlike past films, nearly every argument Moore presents is backed up with actual documents and, most powerfully, video footage (especially that out of Iraq).So he's done it again, but this time it's more relevant, more powerful, and more entertaining than ever. Regardless of personal politics, everyone should see this film; if not to be enlightened by many of the facts presented, but to simply debate their view afterward. We all have a right to our opinions, thank god Moore exercises his.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth Hurts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>45% of America is going to say right on Mr. Moore and 45% will say what a piece of crap. I am a die hard Democrat but know that Moore doesn't take a trip anywhere unless he can only turn left to get there. After watching Bowling for Colombine I looked into some of the things he said and discovered that twisting and stretching the truth is not only something he accuses the right of doing but something he does himself from time to time. The tone of this movie is dead on and the majority of misinformed Americans would be shocked to see some undisputed facts of the movie and catch just a small glimpse of why more people than ever world wide hate us and why it is now easier than ever for some groups to recruit the poorest of the poor to die fighting us. By tone I mean the "look at the left hand and never mind what the right is doing,' ulterior motives pressing forth the personal agenda of this administration from top to bottom. No President was ever or will ever be perfect and make everyone happy but what they do they do in our name and at the end of the day people die because of the decisions they make and we have to believe they are dieing for the right reasons or we take a step closer to being more like what we are fighting to stop. Watch this movie and question the things we all just assumed were the right reasons before the war and decide for yourself come election time. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally the truth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that Moore's movie showed the truth about the corruption in our government. Moore is quite a facts man, and I love how he backs all of what he says with documented evidence. The images from the film were astute and not overdone, and overall, I found the film informative, humorous without being glib, and thought provoking. Also, Moore always finds a way to shove the facts back at his target, and the scene where he asks the Senators to enroll their own children in the army was superbly done. Just the looks the Senators' faces said all that was needed. And those marine recruiters! They were like used car salesmen: selling their ideals with lies. The only question that I would have would be if the Bush administration will address any of these questions. Hopefully, when people see this movie, it will move some of the sluggish "my vote doesn't matter" people into taking a stand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say how interesting it is that this movie wasn't shown in 2 main theaters in my town, which usually have every movie that comes out. Yes, people know it's the truth, and they are afraid. Now... this is an amazing movie, pure and simple. It is a masterpiece documentary that everybody should see. This film shows nothing but the truth about who the American government is, and it goes into details with nothing but facts. It covers everything from Bush and 9/11 to Afghanistan and Iraq. I didn't learn much from this movie that I didn't already know, but it served as a great reminder. I'd like to thank Mr. Moore for being so brave and creating this movie. I'd also advise him to be very careful now and stay safe. Advice for everyone else: go see Fahrenheit 9/11 now. 10 out of 10. I would give it more but I can't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this movie today - very good, although it's impossible to verify the accuracy/truth of the representations made by Mr. Moore.I generally disagree with our involvement in Iraq, because the expenditures of money and lives are unjustified by the returns. I do, however, think it's ironic that this movie implicitly justifies our invasion/occupation of Iraq - consider the consequences under the Saddam/Uday/Qusay regime to the creator of an analogous movie about the political misadventures of Iraq's leadership.I've been reading some of the posts and I notice that it's not long before one party to a "conversation" directs a nasty attack at the person of their "adversary."

It was amazingly compiled, and didn't even focus on some of the major faults of George W. Bush, only the ones that are a result of 9/11.

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Michale Moore and not because he brings news to us which the mainstream media so very diligently hides, in a form of a great documentary. But because he helps us connect the dots, the news articles which we read and ignore, thinking its some kind of Bush or Republican bashing. 911 again shows that our soldier are dying in Iraq in vain, innocent civilians are being killed, for what? Oil? And for profit of companies that George Bush, his father and Dick Cheney hold a big share of.This movie is an eye opener for those conservatives who still believe in Bush. This movie and Michael Moore's other movies all have solid references to the source of the facts, news and statements. Not a single fact is made up.Apart from what this movie addressed and would probably help throw Bush out of White House. It brings home the point that government of our country is as good as us people. In 911, Bush is heard saying "Fool me once Shame on you, Fool me again Shame on me". So we have been fooled not again, only this time it was not Vietnam or Desert Storm. It was a plan meticulously executed, with drumbeat of Al-Qaeda and WMDs, to satisfy the greedy corporates with Bush connections and without. I think it did not address why American Democracy has been providing choice of only two parties for the last 4 decades. Why do we Americans donot raise voice to revamp the Federal Election Commision and most importantly the Presidential Debate Commission (PDC)? I think it is the FEC and PDC combined with Electoral College system that is the root of all problems, limiting our choice to elect. Just like Carlyle, Halliburton and Unocal the PDC is a private body which influences American mindset.I hope Michael Moore will make a movie which hits to the very core of our wrongly practiced Democracy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore hits at the Bush agenda with the Moore perspective. Moore is deeper, far more articulate than the Bushies. Moore has some major points to score for the side of democracy and against lopsided rule of the Republicans and their freedom for all those who can afford it. Moore's job IS a real job. He necessary to society. Bush turns out to be a destructive, selfish figure who's never had an honest job in his life. Moore might well convince many that Bush is a war criminal. If Bush had ever had a real job maybe he wouldn't have got into this trouble. This picture is not just your average documentary. It has more drama and laughs than a lot of features. It also appears to be a social phenomenon. I will only describe the scene at the theater as packed--and the people, after the show, very concerned. Oh, and Moore has a way of lightening up--surprising given that the material can be heavy. You are denying yourself an opportunity to be an informed citizen if for some irrational reason you decide not to see this movie and see what everybody's squawking about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strident, Powerful, On Message With a Vengeance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'm not fair" proclaimed "Fahrenheit 9/11" director and writer Michael Moore last night on Comedy Central's "The Daily Show." Moore, the infant terrible of documentarians told host Jon Stewart that he had an agenda (moviegoers never would have guessed) and that his facts are clear with their interpretation an open field.Moore probably believes this but many of his facts in this powerful but flawed documentary aren't so crystal clear and neither are they necessarily proven. Moore wants to see Bush defeated in November and as a documentarian with a cause he follows in a fairly long line of film-makers who, subtly or otherwise, have an agenda dear to their hearts. No one will ever denounce Moore for subtlety."Fahrenheit 9/11" may be one of the only films I've ever seen where the audience - most of them - began prolonged cheering when the director's name appeared in the OPENING sign boards. That reflected, of course, the political leaning of an affluent Westchester audience that was all-white and which filled surrounding parking lots with SUVs and luxury cars (my Honda Civic a small disgrace).Moore opens the film with a creative look at the Twin Towers tragedy. Rather than showing yet again the planes knifing into the buildings and their tortuous collapse, he uses sounds from Ground Zero with a blank screen which then segues to the horrified and occasionally hysterical visages of people on the street. We don't have to see the collapse-Moore correctly knows that what he's done is to rip loose indelible, horrific memories that supply what isn't on the screen. From there he goes to THE election as seen from both Florida and later in a joint congressional section where black representatives, one after the other, forlornly or bitterly demand the investigation into Florida fraud that can only take place with at least one's senator's acquiescence. No senator gives his or her signature and the scene bespeaks yet another betrayal of minorities, here at a crucial time in a hallowed place.Much of what follows is a demonstration of what even many Bush supporters can't avoid admitting - he's a mental lightweight, a fool and a clown but a man who through family contacts (especially 41's) with both American industry and the Saudi Arabian oligarchy is one rich fool. And his family's involvement with Saudi Arabian magnates who have invested billions in the U.S. is well presented and will be hard to refute.Many scenes that follow are readily familiar-Bush the very experienced and dedicated vacationer, Bush reading a children's book in a Florida school on 9/11 for seven long minutes after an aide whispered in his ear that the second tower had been hit and America was under attack. Apologists will trot out the usual vapid excuses for Bush's indifferent attitude and lackadaisical unrolling of short (and occasionally unintelligible) sound bites while the nation desperately needed real leadership both after 9/11 and during a war that seems to offer no likelihood of victory and even less of disengagement.The war in Iraq gets much play with combat scenes and footage of grisly dead and wounded, some from Al Jazeera with a few shots also prominent in the currently running "Control Room."Soldiers and family members are interviewed. Some troops are troubled by the war, others are repelled morally and politically. For other soldiers the war is an adventure, a chance to prove their mettle and the value of their training (these troops haven't been wounded yet). Family members are either arch-patriotic and supportive or they are riven with tears as they recount the loss of a loved one. A broken mother's account of learning of her son's death in combat by telephone from the Defense Department is heartbreaking: audience members were crying. (What happened to the claim that all such notifications are done in person by uniformed personnel? An economy taken as the casualty list increases?).While Moore makes the argument that the war's true purpose is to advance American business interests (Halliburton comes in for some well-deserved hits) and the military, especially its young members, are fodder for the plutocrats, the case isn't well advanced by showing scenes regularly screened in news reports and specials. It's Hidden Agenda Analysis Lite.What is both surprising and unexpected is the degree to which Moore, the sole interviewer, is unusually invisible, his typical attention-grabbing shenanigans at a minimum. In one episode he commandeers a Mister Frostie truck to drive around the Capitol reading the USA Patriot Act to members of Congress over the loudspeaker, some of whom admit on screen that they don't read the bills they vote for. This isn't news but when it's in reference to the very troubling, hastily put together and deeply flawed USA Patriot Act it's a reminder of how much power this administration sought and received with little careful legislative scrutiny. Almost none, in fact.Sillier and very irrelevant is vintage Moore waylaying members of Congress and offering recruiting literature while urging them to have their kids enlist. Enlisting or not is a personal decision-in our time it's no longer reasonable to arraign any parent on the charge that he/she has forsaken a patriotic duty to urge military service to their kids. TV coverage of Vietnam started to put paid to that. I'm reminded of that grand World War II patriotic song, "I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Bomb."Moore isn't just putting out a documentary-he's urging involvement by sympathetic viewers to defeat Bush and he has a website and a scheduled online Town Meeting to advance his goal. That's his privilege. Make no doubt about it: despite what some hysterical anti-Moore people are saying "Fahrenheit 911" is very much in the tradition of film, documentary or feature, aimed at motivating viewers to demand or make change.I saw "Fahrenheit 9/11"at the Jacob Burns Film Center dead set in the center of a constellation of very well-off Westchester, NY communities. Tomorrow I'll be back in Manhattan and I want to see the film in a less anti-Bush neighborhood (yeah, I'd prefer a second viewing in the South or rural Midwest but I can't find the time to fly around just to see Moore's movie again).Moore's movie is very important because his deep passion goes beyond the self-promotion central to his previous films. He's a zealot with regard to Bush and Iraq. That makes him both a fierce documentarian and a lightning rod for attack. How or if "Fahrenheit 9/11" will sway voters, especially those not committed to one side or the other, remains to be seen. What is certain is that Moore's fevered creation is a political milestone in documentary films.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious! Depressing! Eye Opening! Exploitationist! Propaganda! Welcome to Michael Moore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone should see this movie, but not for the reasons you might think. The first half of the movie is basically hilarious, almost to the point that one might suggest Michael Moore should be making pure comedies using archival footage and setting it to music as he does brilliantly many times in this film. Then the humor starts to fade away and the propagandizing starts as well as the exploitation, sensationalism, and way over the top sentimentality. This is where I felt the wheels sort of came off and the film started to loose some of its established credibility.One of the best things about documentary is its ability to uncover history unknown to most people and even at times unknown to everyone. There is some of this in this film, but Moore frequently doesn't dig deep enough or probe or postulate far enough about some of the things he uncovers. For instance, he discusses the Afgan pipeline and some of its history, but he doesn't go back 30 years to explore the real story of American involvement in the pipeline pre-Soviet Afghanistan.Also, he makes it seem like Bush didn't react to the bombings because he was either being just plain stupid or just didn't know what to do. He fails to uncover material pertaining to the PNC (Plan for the New American Century) initially created by Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz years ago during the Clinton years which in its final form calls for things like multiple wars on multiple fronts (Iraq, Afghanistan?) catalyzed by a "new Pearl Harbor" (9/11?) which if dissected to the degree Moore uses for other subjects here, would have been a much more powerful, and conspiratorial movie implying more than just Bush's family connection to the Saudis and his own incompetence. Instead, he just defames Bush by pointing out how corrupt his family ties are to the Saudis and making him look like he's just some kind of idiot punk cowboy out for war of any kind.The overall problem of the film is that the only people that are going to see it are the choir which he is basically preaching to. Real conservatives have already been told what it's about and they've heard the story before, so in the end all it is ultimately going to do is strengthen both camps and further separate the national political bases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is only a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I see here is fear or fear, or fear of truth, perhaps fear of information. In relation to Moore's previous efforts; Many of these people driving USA-made trucks, etc. should realize that 75% of the parts made on those trucks are not made in America. Mostly Mexico, Canada, etc. Those parts of those very trucks and cars many people drive, Moore tried very hard to keep the jobs producing them in the in the hands of American workers! Instead the high percentage of production on cars , trucks , and SUV's are made outside America.Fahrenheit 9/11 is simply a MOVIE. It is not Moore's job to do any more than that. Do we cry "liars", "Cheats", and "slime balls", at George Lucas because there really is no Death Star? But the smallest infraction, the smallest millimeter Moore goes off-course in this movie will be ultimately looked at with a 1000-inch diameter magnifying glass, which is sad. Even though Moore is a notorious fact checker with all of his material in all his films and books. He makes sure that what is in the movie is in fact truth, and often it is not he who does the talking it is the person being filmed. Yet , Moore is the liar ??Same with Clinton's memoir- (off topic) Clinton has been out of the White House for 4 years! and the general rule is once you release your memoir book-it is over Clinton is fully back to civilian life. Yet still these right-wingers still attack Clinton as though he is running the show. I don't know, but it seems to me Clinton does not hold the job of "President" anymore.We should all start looking more toward the center instead of being so separated we are all Americans, not Democrats, Republicans, etc. Unfortunately in today's world you almost have to have full-blown video footage to prove something actually went down. Sadly this movie will probably come off as a election year commercial(to conservatives) than a documentary, and a documentary still is a vision of one man. Every filmmaker adds a stamp of their own viewpoint on any film, including a Documentary. Editing a film alone can change something very quickly as wee see often on TV news shows. You decide what he shows you and make your own choice!American always has to find a scapegoat and Moore is the current kicking bag for the right. He only made a film, and that film is not filled with magic hidden rays to warp your mind. See it and make your own decision that is what being American is all about.An analogy is that being truthful is an expected quality of a "good man". A person being 100% truthful and making people accountable , well that is not honesty- that is CRAZY. I often hear statements about Moore of that ilk " That guy is too truthful, he is just plain crazy". "Moore is a dangerous man". I thought that honesty was a virtue , something in the 10 Commandments, after 2001 I guess it is crazy to be "too" honest .Let's stop bickering and all start being Americans again!!</fullReview>

As a theoretical "Democracy" we should all be able to view, or not view this movie and make our own decision as to its merits. To deny its distribution would be to create an society that is exactly what we claim to abhor in Iraq. As Americans we are a member of a Democracy and have the right to view and listen to anything that is not found to be illegal in our courts. Even Hate groups have the right to speak as they please as evidenced often by a vast array of people ranging from Neo-Natzis to Right-Wing extremists. Many of our fore-fathers and great leaders warned against ever fearing to question our government. To do so would represent a total failure of what our forefathers attempted to achieve when they created our government. They attempted to create a form of government unlike the one they fled that would allow freedom from government oppression. In spite of some "Hate" groups, this vision has carried forward as to the foresight shown in the drafting of our Constitution and the separation of powers to always keep any branch of our own government from gaining complete control. I suppose they understood the saying "Power Corrupts, Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely!" I would like to Thank Cinemark as well as all the other theaters who showed this film to let the "People" be the judge of its merits. After all letting the People decide is what a Democracy is all about. Isn't it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply, this is a movie that must be seen by everyone. It will have the power to ignite a fire under the collect rear of America and I think we all can agree- it's about time.I stepped into the movie skeptical, already knowing a lot about Bush's connections to the bin Laden family and the Haliburton oil deals. But Michael Moore managed to connect events that no one in the media takes time to do. The result is a disturbing picture of Bush's interests and extreme shortfalls when it comes to running anything successfully- from failed oil businesses to this country's foreign policy.But Bush's failures aren't the driving force of this movie. The second half, in which a mother who lost her son in Iraq is featured, is extraordinarily powerful. Her loss is what most of America has been prevented from seeing because of different government policies. But to watch this woman go to Washington, DC months after her son is killed and break down in front of the White House is gripping. Moore does a wonderful job of showing her grief in the midst of another tourist grilling the mother on her loss. "Where did you son die?" as if she didn't believe the mother. Then she leaves with the harsh "yeah well a lot of other people lost someone too." Moore doesn't say a word, thankfully, and lets the audience judge for itself the cruelness and ignorance of some people who blindly stand behind the Iraq invasion.This is definitely worth seeing, no matter where you stand in the political spectrum. I'm not going to pretend that the movie is objective- far from it. But no one who claims to love America and stand for freedom should be afraid of the debate and questions this movie will raise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's convoluted Bush-Saudi connection is weak, at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Congratulations to Michael Moore for a successful liberal propaganda film. I enjoyed the movie and laughed several times. When it comes to real facts, the movie loses credibility. I will never believe that Bush put his own interests ahead of the security of this nation. That would make his own family unsafe, and his legacy a failure. This movie undermines the presidency unfairly. It is easy to either demonize or idealize a person (as Bill Clinton said on Larry King). Bush has made mistakes in the war on terror and is not a great orator. He is a true American and would never sell his soul to the Saudis or any country. As for the Iraq war, Moore's questioning of the motives is right on. The case for weapons of mass destruction was poorly made by Bush's administration. This does not change the fact that Saddam was a danger to his neighbors, especially Israel. He used chemical weapons on his own people and funded suicide bombers. He launched missiles at Israel during the Gulf War. He was an evil man. Bush did a poor job of building a coalition and getting world support. He was too impatient. Overall, the movie exposes the arrogance of the Bush presidency, but is not a "smoking gun" like watergate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To all of those who denounce government-critical voices as "Un-American", which is meant to be synonymous with "traitors": Ever since the second world war, there has been this ongoing discussion how it could happen that a highly civilized culture like Germany could be the place that allowed the Nazi regime to flourish. How could it be that masses of highly civilized Germans didn't pull the plug on their government before it became militantly suppressive, and overwhelming enough to silence all opposing voices by naked force ?Well, it's for the same reason that today, intimidation, peer pressure and the attraction of the masses motivates large numbers of civilized Americans to comply uncritically with the will of their government. Perhaps these people should note that it is their duty and responsibility as citizens of a democracy to have a critical look, and to see that their country is sliding down the path of fascism. America under this regime is going the way of the strongest in sheer physical, military power. It has stopped to care about the international community, international laws, diplomacy, or diplomatic tact. Whoever owns the weapons shall be the one to rule according to their will, since opposing voices do not have the physical power to interfere. The aftermath of 9/11 has allowed the present government to understand the lengths at which their military power can intimidate the rest of the world. America these days is not respected in the world, it is feared. Within America, the government interferes with free speech, and most of the press is indeed intimidated. The temporary after-9/11 taboo of government critique has been exploited to suppress any government critique henceforth.If the pro-government enthusiasts let this further culminate, if they continue to allow 9/11 to be the pretense for the crucifixion of the most basic American democratic principles, they will later be held accountable for the crimes that this present regime is sure to commit if reelected. And this will be most shameful for America as a whole. When Bush was elected the first time, there was no way anyone could foresee the consequences (although from his past as Texas governor, it could have been clear that he can cope when people's lives are at stake). The consequences are clear now, and if he is elected again, the world will point its finger at the American people who will be guilty as a whole.Moore may not have created the most perfect film, but at least he had the guts to resist peer pressure and intimidation. Now is the time for large numbers of people to do the same, for the sake of democracy, and for their pride as Americans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have family and friends in Iraq fighting for the elite, or Bush's "base" (as he calls them). I can't stand it anymore. Before I watched this movie I tried to explain the staged war. Maybe you have tried to convince someone not to go "fight" this war. This movie will reinvigorate the struggle to enlighten our youth before sending them away. Recruiters are out their telling lies. A recruiter told my 17 year old cousin, when she was thinking about signing up that she would "never leave the country," because she was "protecting the state of Louisiana." Within a year she was sent to Iraq. The lies, the death and the destruction--they are all in the movie. Go watch it, then talk about it, listen to what people have to say. Michael Moore is not the only one saying it. Do your homework. Even if you don't agree, talk about it, and listen. Not having an open dialogue prevents the democratic process from ever beginning. God has no race, country of origin, or religion.</fullReview>

That the director uses "Selective editing" to skew the video to his point of view.Looks like the vast conservative bias is the so called "liberal media" gets real upset when their own tactics get turned against them.

		<fullReview>Michael Moore has created a documentary of ingenious substance. He is awakening the truth about the Bush Administration and their four years of lieing and BSing. The Republicans don't want this movie out cause it's the truth and thats something they just hate. Michael Moore is a concerned citizen not a traitor, thats what people should realize. Do not listen to the critical media, go watch this film and encourage your friends to do the same. Our country was moving forward with Bill Clinton even though he had his share of problems our country was moving forward. The Republicans hate that Michael Moore is opening ordinary Americans up to the fact that we are living in a world of lies. President Bush does not care about the average citizen but only his own political and economic interests. Please go see this movie with an open mind and you will be transfixed. It is easily the best film in years. No joke, this movie is easily the best thought provoking film I've ever seen. Tell all of your friends to go see this movie and to vote for John Kerry for president so we can stop the lies. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's convoluted Bush-Saudi connection is weak, at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Congratulations to Michael Moore for a successful liberal propaganda film. I enjoyed the movie and laughed several times. When it comes to real facts, the movie loses credibility. I will never believe that Bush put his own interests ahead of the security of this nation. That would make his own family unsafe, and his legacy a failure. This movie undermines the presidency unfairly. It is easy to either demonize or idealize a person (as Bill Clinton said on Larry King). Bush has made mistakes in the war on terror and is not a great orator. He is a true American and would never sell his soul to the Saudis or any country. As for the Iraq war, Moore's questioning of the motives is right on. The case for weapons of mass destruction was poorly made by Bush's administration. This does not change the fact that Saddam was a danger to his neighbors, especially Israel. He used chemical weapons on his own people and funded suicide bombers. He launched missiles at Israel during the Gulf War. He was an evil man. Bush did a poor job of building a coalition and getting world support. He was too impatient. Overall, the movie exposes the arrogance of the Bush presidency, but is not a "smoking gun" like watergate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this tonight with my mother, we'd been looking forward to it for some time since seeing Moore's Bowling for Columbine. Let me say first that with both of these documentary films, I was not at all bored and did not feel as if I were being taught a lesson in school!Moore has a way of blending humor while delivering important information to the country.I was very pleased...From special appearances by Ricky Martin and Britney Spears to 'Afghanastan' starring George W. Bush, I was certainly laughing and kept very entertained!No movie is truly a great movie, of course, without a sad touching scene; in this case, the scene where one of the dead soldier's mothers meets with a Muslim woman in the street, both of them crying about how Bush's administration killed their children...then a heartless woman comes and starts yelling at the soldiers mother about how it was all a stage and she should blame Al Qaeda, not Bush.And, to bring it to an end, Moore used my absolute FAVORITE Bush quote..."Fool me once...shame...shame on...I-Ifoolmuh can't get flloed again!"Cue the standing ovation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damning indictment, poignant statement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's dispense with a few things from the start. All documentaries have an inherent bias; in fact, all art shares the bias of the artist. Art has often been used to address the political and social conditions of the time, whether it is the literary works of Steinbeck, Orwell, or Upton Sinclair; or painted works, like Picasso's Guernica. This film is Michael Moore's statement about the Bush Administration and the war in Iraq. It is a statement that reflects his viewpoint; but, it is a viewpoint shared by a large number of people from both political parties. However, Moore uses documented, verifiable sources to put together his film. At the same time, he presents footage that a large segment of the population have never been shown and puts a human face on both sides of the conflict. Spoilers: The first half of the film documents the 2000 election and the Florida recall; followed by the actions of the administration, leading to the events of September 11. During this segment, he shows African-American US Representatives attempting to bring objections relating to election fraud in Florida and their subsequent failure, due to the lack of cooperation from a single Senator, as required by Congressional procedure. This is followed by little-seen footage of protesters lining the path of the inaugural motorcade. Events progress to 9/11.At this stage, Moore presents the horror of the attacks, using only audio, no visuals. We hear the impacts of of the jets and the subsequent reactions of bystanders. The viewers minds are left to fill in the visual horror of that day. When we finally do see footage, it is the reactions of people on the streets, the photos of missing loved ones, and the haunting sight of debris blowing in the wind.Moore proceeds to document the strange event of the government allowing several Saudi citizens, including members of the Bin Laden family, to fly out of the country, while other flights are grounded. The Saudis are never questioned, despite the majority of the hijackers being Saudi citizens. Moore then proceeds to document the Bush family's ties to the Saudi government and the Bin Laden family, through their oil businesses and George HW Bush's work for the Carlyle Group. This leads to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.In Iraq, we are exposed to footage that was not seen on media broadcasts. We see upfront footage of Iraqis with their dead loved ones. We see bombs hit and tanks roll through the streets; not from the distant vantage point, but from the ground. We see and hear the pain of Iraqi people, as they dig through the rubble of what had been their homes, searching for the remnants of their family. We also see young soldiers talking about the rush of combat and the loud, aggressive music they played while in combat. But, we also hear from soldiers who have been shaken by the horrors they have witnessed, as we see the scarred and wounded bodies of men women and children.The film also documents the personal loss of a woman from Moore's hometown of Flint, MI. She was always a big supporter of the military and encouraged her children to seek a college education via military service. Her son is shipped to Iraq, where he is killed in a helicopter crash. She reads the last letter he wrote; his disillusionment with the reasons why he is there. She tells the painful story of her official notification of his death. She later makes a visit to Washington DC, for a jobs conference, and comes across a protest against the war. She relates her own story as an insensitive woman states that the protest is all staged. The Flint woman defiantly recounts her own loss and how it was not "staged." Immediately afterward, she talks to the film crew and breaks down from the emotion of the confrontation. Her pain reaches out from the screen and grabs your soul.Moore makes skillful use of music to emphasize points and add some trademark humor. Yes, this is an attack on the Bush Administration, but he uses their own words and actions (all documented and verifiable) to damn themselves. The most telling footage is of a dumbstruck Bush, sitting in a Florida classroom, taking no action after having been told of the second plane crash.He simply does nothing and his aides do nothing. Granted, actions were being taken in Washington; but, the leader of the government sits there and does nothing.This film deserved the honors it received at the Cannes Film Festival and it deserves to be seen, regardless of political viewpoint. It should be seen because it documents how ordinary people are hurt by war, even when conducted on the other side of the world. It puts a human face on both the Iraqis and the American soldiers who are fighting there. It documents how the lowest economic levels of society are always the first to step forward in service to their country, but that the wealthiest remain untouched. It documents the profiteering that is associated with the ongoing events in the Middle East. It provides a viewpoint that is not well represented in the mass media (the alleged "Liberal Media". It takes both parties to task for their actions and inactions relating to the events of Sept. 11 and the aftermath (the Patriot Act), the road to war in Iraq and the subsequent loss of human life on both sides. It does what art should do; it challenges you and makes you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another brilliant yet entertaining vision from Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its not surprising that this film had the longest standing ovation when screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Moore's research speaks out sharing what progressive Americans want to express, but have been given nothing but grief for not applauding Bush's consensus society.I laugh when i read the previous viewers comments accusing Moore of being Anti- American. How is that so? For questioning the government and working to create one free of greed and lies? If that is anti- American, then America is full of those sharing the same sentiment. Even if you don't agree with his ideas, that is what America is about- free speech and freedom of ideas. ALL IDEAS, not just the ones you like.So when the Patriot Act was passed, of course those that enjoy their freedom, will speak loudly in concern... that is, when they find out the truth about the Act. Moore's purpose is to share what the government, in their growing ties to Corporate power, tries to keep out of America's consciousness in order to serve its own needs. And those needs are not in the best interest of the American people.This is a must see documentary, along with "The Corporation"- a film made by the same Canadian company that made "Bowling for Columbine". These two films should be seen by any who consider themselves informed voters. They show America's darker side, not to express hate for the U.S.~ instead, to provide knowledge to those wanting to create a better country and world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a lot of a political fighting about this movie. Let us not forget that life is bigger than politics. How the system with only 2!!! political parties, i.e. republicans vs. democrats, that rule this country and life of millions of people dependent on them be called a democratic. 2 is only many enough to make a wrong decisions in this complicated world. Where I'm getting at is when there is narrow limit of choice like in our political system there always be abuses, corruption, wrong directions, "mistakes" never straightened, because 2 is almost like 1. Take an example in economy, there are laws against the monopolies not without a reason, because it's proven that monopolies hinder the progress, tend to corruption, slow to change, kill competition. Imagine you have only 2 big corporations in entire economy, competing with each other... Of course, this 2 corporations would profit enormously (there are no others to share with, right?), but poor customers, they would be taken for a ride, and no others to turn to, because again, there are only 2 corporations... Do you understand this, citizens?! We have in this country 2 big political corporations, republicans and democrats, who usurp the decision power, and who, as last few years proved, cannot make right decisions, but only blame on each other all the wrongdoings and mistakes. Starting with Clinton and finishing with Bush, all those big wrong decisions that people are so unhappy about were done finally by both these corporations/parties, backing each other, and yes, House and Congress, as a final approval bodies consist of members of both parties of almost equal proportion. So, whatever Michael Moore's film shows, the real problems lie not in Bush (he himself can't do much, it takes a lot of people to make and then execute any political decision), or Clinton, or Kerry, it's a system of very limited choice, in true sense not democratic, that brings the disaster, abuse and corruption. Checks and balances, checks and balances...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a lot of things, but probably the most important is a strongly left minded political force. Bush is the opposite. Now i am not for Bush, or, on the whole, republicans. But that does not make me a democrat. In the USA we are limited to our choice between these two extremes. With that said, while i do believe Bush needs to be taken out of office in a very bad way, one shouldn't let their disgust for one side, in this case the political right, allow them to be sold on an equally elitist point of view from the opposite side, in this case the political left. Michael Moore uses the same scare and shock tactics his opponents do, he just uses them to further his political view. That is not always a bad thing on either side, sometimes the best way to get people's attention and to get them talking is to give them a shock of reality. The question then lies in: what is reality, Moore's version, or the ruling Republican version?If Moore makes one think that is good. If Moore makes one question that is good. If he makes one do their own research that is good. What is dangerous is if one easily buys into what he says as easily as some buy into the ruling power in the US today. Go see this film no matter who you are and do it with an open but cautious mind. Don't let others make decisions for you, or let them force their opinions on you. Educate yourself. Vote. Either way you do, let your decision count.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look at the ratings: all 1s and 10s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is going to pack a wallop. People will love it or hate it with not much in between. All you have to do is look at the IMDb ratings to see that. There's a couple hundred people who gave the movie 10s and a somewhat smaller bunch that gave it 1s and not much in between. (Makes me wonder how many of these folks have actually seen the film.)I saw it. I think it ranks with "Columbine" as a powerful but deeply flawed presentation. Mike's work, as always, uses a lot of very gripping images that cannot be argued with: recruiters lying to kids to get them to sign up, babies burned and mutilated by US bombs, and the incredible seven minutes that the Commander-in-Chief of the US military spent sitting in a classroom reading "My Pet Goat" after he had been told the second tower had been hit and the nation was under attack. You think Bill Clinton would have sat there waiting for someone to tell him what to do? Or even, God forbid, Richard Nixon? Hell no. Now, on the other hand, Mike is as fast and loose with the facts in this movie as ever. He always shoots himself in the foot by making dumb fact errors and editing footage to show his point of view in the best possible light. I wish he wouldn't. Because so much of what he has to say is really important, and really deserves to be heard. Leaving your enemies a big hole through which to drive is just dumb. Go see the movie for yourself and judge for yourself. You're smart. You don't need Michael Moore to tell you what to think, or Move America Forward to tell you that all good Americans will close their eyes, put their fingers in their ears and hope this movie goes away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm the first to admit that Moore's films can be rather heavy-handed and didactic, but _Fahrenheit 9/11_ is amazing in that he actually steps back and doesn't indulge himself with being so overly jokey and *wink wink nudge nudge* about the subject matter.I think this was a wise decision because the film stands up on its own. I know there are a lot of conservatives who won't see this film solely because they think they know what it's all about. They would be quite surprised were they to actually take a chance and see it. Even liberal people who might automatically determine they like the film before seeing one frame will be surprised at how intelligent and well-researched this documentary is. Everybody can get something out of this.I implore anybody with an open mind to watch this film whether it strengthens your preexisting opinions or gives you insight into something not many people in this country understand. So many people in this day and age get their news mainlined directly from their cable box to their brains and are unfortunately too lazy to look for additional facts on their own. (Admittedly, the our country's current negative climate contributes to this.)For those who have had issues with _Roger and Me_ or _Bowling for Columbine_, you'll be pleased to know the events as they are presented aren't taken out of context to make a point. Merely providing the viewer with various facts that the average American is completely clueless about (including myself!) makes this a powerful film that is already getting people talking. And that's what America is all about. This polarizing attitude that is so prevalent in our great nation is really rather pathetic and I hope this film helps to make people understand that they can't possibly know everything and to shut up and listen to others with differing opinions every great once in awhile.</fullReview>

I saw a prerelease sneak preview of this film and must say it lives up to all the hype. I only wish he could have covered the Nick Berg incident. Listen people we can't continue to blindly follow and not question authority. If Michael Moore does nothing more than open a few eyes then he has done well. Just remember, our government only tells us what it wants us to know. All presidential candidates are crooks, you don't get to that level of politics by being a nice guy. They all have something to pay back, they all owe someone, and look out after their own. While this movie may be opinion, it it is still worth seeing. Above all watch with an open mind.

		<fullReview>If the White House and a large corporation like Disney do not want this film to see the light of day until after November, then they raise suspicions by displaying their fear. If there is an undecided American out there who doesn't have feelings one way or another for Bush, then shouldn't they see the film? Not so that they will join the other 50.1% of Americans (and 4 Justices of the Supreme Court) who dislike Bush, but so that undecided Americans can hear both sides of "a story". The media corporations have spent a lot of private money to ensure that Bush look "presidential". Mr. Moore has an alternate view of the man who was banned by Congress in 1987 from doing financial business with the Congressional Savings and Loan. With all of the free air-time that Bush is going to have over the next 6 months, I would like to know that American voters can pay $9.50 to go see this movie in a Theater. Those who love Bush can go see Spiderman and let the rest of us see Fahrenheit 911.</fullReview>

And Disney is hoping and praying that it will just somehow go away and die someplace quietly outside the borders of the US of A. What we are witnessing here is blatant, partisan- and multimegamedia-sanctioned censorship of a not-so-flattering portrayal of the Bush Administration that could very well have an influence on the outcome of the upcoming election. As things stand now Miramax is trying to buy the film back from Disney, who have flatly refused to advertise or distribute the movie they financed, because Jeb Bush, the Governor of Florida, could potentially curtail many of the tax breaks that Disney World currently enjoys in that other great Sunshine State. Now isn't that just about the most unAmerican thing you've ever heard out of Disney? Walt would surely be turning in his grave. (Or would he?) The key point is that all freedom-loving and cherishing Americans need to be given the opportunity to see this film, or else we could all be very well turning in our own. Go get 'em Harvey...!

Some people think that nothing in this movie is true but the truth really is that the people in the United States of America are being lied to now more than ever. Moore talks about 9/11 and the war in Iraq. This is such a hard movie to watch. Especially the families of all the people who died in Iraq and I am not just writing about the soldiers and their families. I am also writing about the people who live in Iraq who didn't do a thing to anyone and they died. It's tragic to watch a little boy get his head stitched together.

		<shortDescription>Incendiary, utterly patriotic expose from Michael Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the peak of my own short-lived, hard-core liberalism, "Fahrenheit 9/11" was THE movie to see. After the whirlwind controversy regarding its theatrical release that led to a successful opening weekend at the box office, I found myself impressed by Michael Moore's chutzpah and fearlessness, but also his blatant (and acknowledged) opportunism in making this stunning expose on the Bush Administration a tool to adversely affect his chances of re-election in 2004 (well, we all know that turned out). I've said this many times, but I became disillusioned upon Dubya's second term, and politically apathetic; until tonight, my previous viewing of "Fahrenheit" was prior to the election. Three years later, even to my currently-disenfranchised self, the film carries an impact that is no less potent. While Moore is skilled in organizing/editing his films to best back up his leftist stance, he is ultimately just as manipulative as the nightly news in his efforts to invoke a reaction of outrage from his audience. But despite this, I thoroughly enjoyed the film--my reaction ranged from laughter (a "Bonanza" send-up entitled "Afghanistan"), spine-tingling chills (the sound effects of 9/11 played over a black screen), and yes, outrage (especially when bin Laden's relatives were flown out of the U.S. days after the attacks, while commercial airlines remained grounded). The footage shot within Iraq is grim and disquieting, and some could easily dismiss this as sensationalism; yet when you consider how sanitized the network news has made the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is an unpleasant truth whose image certainly merits display, if only to snap us back to reality. While Moore's guerrilla-theater denouement (of the filmmaker and a soldier soliciting pencil-necked senators to sign their kids up for the military) is a fizzle, the footage of Lila Lipscomb (a Flint, MI mother whose son is killed in Iraq) is extremely moving. For as messy as the details surrounding pre- and post-9/11 have been, Moore does a fine job distilling the facts through a slightly smug, always opinionated veneer that keeps the viewer interested; but maybe more importantly, the film overall exemplifies the director's own patriotism (which many debate or decry), while making the pundits and anchors of nightly news programs seem like anemic and shameful vessels disclosing a watered-down view of "what's going on in the world."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A punch in the face that is still unmissable, despite its bias and being eclipsed by later documentaries such as Outfoxed and The Corporation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We wage a war to save civilisation itself", says US President George W Bush during Mike Moore's Palme D'Or-winning Fahrenheit 9/11. "We didn't seek it, but we will fight it, and we will prevail." But Moore, who won last year's best documentary Oscar for Bowling For Columbine, mounts a damning case against the self-proclaimed "war President", with a film that is more polemic than traditional documentary. There's so much information in this film that it's unmissable, no matter what your political alignment. Beginning with the notorious "stolen election" that gave Bush Florida and the presidency in 2000, Fahrenheit moves through the first eight unpopular months of Bush's presidency. According to the Washington Post, he was on holiday 42 per cent of that time. An abrupt shift to a black screen signals the onset of 9/11, presented as sound without images, and all the more emotive for it.Moore's characteristic humour is less apparent in Fahrenheit than in his other works but appears when mocking Bush's initial indecision in the face of the 9/11 strikes. More disturbing are the Bush family's alleged Saudi connections, and the overall Saudi investment in the US economy (around 7 per cent). And most affecting are the images of suffering Iraqui civilians. Unfortunately, their story is cut short to concentrate on the US army's plight in the war that's claimed the largest number of military deaths since Vietnam. ****/***** stars.</fullReview>

FahrenHYPE exposes a lot of Michael Moore's deceitful editing techniques. However, FahrenHYPE also tries to portray Bush as the greatest leader ever. It even tries to justify the Iraq war by comparing Saddam's threat to the U.S. with Hitler!!! Saddam is/was a bug that could be squashed easily when compared with the threat of Hitler. Anyhow, Moore's film-making is brilliant, which is why I still consider this a great movie. If you want to laugh, cry, and be angry all in the span of a 2 hour movie, Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" is very entertaining. Just do NOT expect to have all the facts. The basis of his argument is mostly correct, but he uses deceitful ways to edit the footage and statistics. This film is a brilliant piece of propaganda that would make ANYONE angry at Bush after seeing it. Rating: 8/10 (based on the film)...2/10 (based on its "facts" that do not support it enough and are basically lies)</fullReview>

However, I'll do my best.First, this documentary is biased, I have no doubt about it. Moore has cut and used cinematic tricks to emphasize his view and opinion. But at least he is obvious about it, and it is pretty easy to recognize and disregard. That said, I believe there are a lot of interesting facts that Moore tells in an effective and mostly humorous way. That there is a big part comedy here does not at all diminish the facts, instead it is used well to emphasize facts. There is also coverage from the war, and I must point out that those scenes are not at all funny, mostly they are horrible and disturbing. But in a cinematic sense, those scenes and pictures are well used and very powerful. The movie is well directed and narrated, apart from a few scenes that were simply stretched out longer than their message and importance merited. As a result, the pace sometimes got too slow. But the music selected, and how it was used, was superb.However told, this is a movie presenting many interesting facts, that should make you think. It doesn't matter what political opinion you have, or what conclusions you draw. There are important facts to see and consider. So, see this movie and then make up your mind about it. Do not trash or glorify the movie without having seen it. It is better than that.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched 9/11 the other day and i think it is an interesting film. I have noticed that a lot of the comments are from the USA. I am from the UK and i think the election in 2000 was a fix. If the facts alone without Micheal Moore have been confirmed then this is bad. Why should 12 judges decide on the votes in Florida. Votes are votes and should have been counted with the highest scrutiny with the world watching. This would have probably resulted in Al-Gore being president. I am not surprised that Bush had his car pelted with eggs. The terrorism color levels are for children and American TV is really tacky. Someone making money from parachutes for people jumping out of skyscrapers is the height of bad taste. I know that Micheal Moore is biased, however if you look at the footage from American TV and check out the facts then something is very wrong. This is my response for those who have commented without much of an argument, try and work your way around what i have said!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who wants the truth??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I appreciated this film because it gave me a point view that I don't get when I turn on the news or open the paper. I think at some point you have to read between the lines and this film does that. The fact is we're ALL human ...so whether you're a Democrat or a Republican what's the one thing we want most of all? the TRUTH. No one likes to be lied to, especially not by the president. Grant it, Mr. Moore's films aren't always 100% correct, but at least he is questioning authority. A lot of American's think it's un-patriotic to question authority but don't you think it's the American thing to do especially when we're at war, killing people every day? Think about that...we're KILLING everyday, shouldn't this make us question "Are we sure we're doing the right thing?". Did Mr. Bush get re-elected because American's live in fear and our fear is his power? I also wanted to address the comments on this message board by those that overwhelmingly disapprove of the film and criticize those who buy into the idea. This is what I say to you...PROVE US WRONG ...give us hard core facts, give us detailed reasons why we SHOULD trust Mr. Bush. The comments thus far have been extremely vague, nothing they've said has convinced me otherwise. For example a message by "bonlad" Denver, CO USA "If the people who like his movies would actually open their eyes and do just a little bit of investigation, they'd see just how much bias (lies) he actually put in his "documentaries" instead of excepting blindly his truth." Well, here's an idea, make your own Fahrenheit 9/11. That way we could "open our eyes". It could tell us how to "investigate" properly and at last it would make us realize "how much bias" there are. (ok so I'm being a bit sarcastic) But seriously, if there was such a film, you better believe I WOULD be there to watch it, front row, because I want to be that much closer to getting the TRUTH.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is perhaps a little late to watch this movie, as its stated purpose was to educate Americans in time for the presidential election. But even without the backdrop of the election, this is a supremely relevant, powerful movie.Director Michael Moore, noted for his documentary Roger and Me and later his short-lived television series TV Nation, begins with a simple premise: that President George W. Bush's first term, particularly since the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, has been deeply flawed. Moore examines the handling of terrorism in the months prior to September 11, the president's reaction to the attacks, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq overall. Moore leaves very few stones unturned in his thorough dissertation of U.S. foreign policy of the past few years.It really doesn't matter if you the viewer agree with Moore; his aim is to make you feel something, whether it's disgust toward the administration or disdain toward the film and its creator. If you're a staunch Republican who supports the president no matter what, you almost certainly won't be swayed by this movie; you're far more likely to view it as leftist propaganda. If you're an opponent of the president and his policies, this movie will only reinforce your viewpoint. So, in that sense, it is definitely propaganda - clearly so.Moore's MO is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. And boy, are there plenty of both in this movie. He interviews soldiers in Iraq; some are elated to be there and treat gunning down Iraqis like a video game, and others are openly dissatisfied for not being allowed to return stateside, even though their tours of duty have expired. Moore interviews the mother of a soldier stationed in Iraq; in the beginning of the movie, she's gung-ho for the war, proud that her children are overseas (she even says she thinks she's the proudest around, as if it were a contest). By the end of the movie, she's a grieving mother of a soldier killed in battle. Her scenes are searing in their emotion. She reads a letter from him, the last one he wrote; she'd received it a week or so before he died. Among Moore's other tactics is badgering various members of Congress, asking them if they would mind enlisting their children. (Turns out only one member of Congress has a child serving in Iraq.) None will do so, which isn't surprising. Moore also examines the connection between the Bush family and the bin Laden family, especially pre-9/11, the strength of the relationship between the Saudi Arabian government (well, ruling family) and the Bush family, and the relationship between the Saudis and the United States economy.It's important to recognize this movie for what it is; it's dangerous to assume that it's a straightforward documentary. It's an unabashed look at what historians may someday call one of the worst presidencies in American history. For now, though, it's just the first half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a thought-provoking movie for patriots!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 is a great movie for many reasons. I think that every American who loves his or her country would want to watch it and discuss it with friends and family members. Just as our Founding Fathers fought for our freedom in the 18th century (and many Americans have fought to preserve it in their subsequent lifetimes), we must fight to keep our democracy great for ourselves and the generations to come. Yes, we have external enemies, but we also have to stand up to the current administration and demand that we be told the truth. That doesn't seem like it's asking so much, yet the president and his supporters want us to believe that if we question them, if we ask for the truth, if we don't give them "blank checks" to do whatever they want, that we are somehow not patriotic Americans. I AM a patriotic American, and obviously (to anyone who sees the movie) so is Michael Moore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a must-see movie ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... regardless of your political affiliation. It is very well and convincingly put together, its logic easy to follow, providing a view point that is skillfully made plausible. While I don't want to offer an opinion on what is presented accurately, what might be stretched or misrepresented, the point of it all is this: It is plausibly presented and we all have an obligation to determine for ourselves what is true and what is not and then act accordingly, for instance, on election day.I urge everyone to remember the question how on earth a Nazi Germany came to such power in the late '30s and was subsequently able to commit horrendous crimes against mankind and what the answers were to that question: "We didn't know," "we heard rumors, but didn't believe it could be possible," and "we only followed orders." Not that I, by any means, mean to suggest any commonalities between the present American government and the German Nazi regime or put them in any way on the same level. However, we all should have learned a lesson from history: You HAVE to consider "the impossible," you HAVE to listen to all view points, you HAVE to inform yourself, and you HAVE to subsequently act accordingly.Micheal Moore presents a view point that is virtually eliminated from main stream media coverage, although it is shared by many. As a freedom loving, democratic people, we all have an obligation to listen to it, consider it, and build our opinion about it - AFTERwards.What Michael Moore does is, at the very least, raise questions and present his basis for these questions. Leaders in any nation need to be questioned continuously, not only if there is the least bit of doubt about their motives, intentions, and actions, but especially then. It is our responsibility to ensure that our leaders are indeed representing us the way we want to be represented for reasons that lie in our best interests. And one can only do that if one is willing to listen to the other side, even if we hear uncomfortable things or things that may seem a bit "far off." Michael Moore has shown in his movie that there is indeed another side to what we are fed day in, day out on main stream television, and that side deserves a good looking at. See this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am very disappointed with some of the reviews posted on IMDb.com for the movie, they appear to be politically biased and no effort is made to substantiate claims and allegations about the movie. I would like to request they provide more information about them or in other words "Put up or Shut up"Many people say that this film is full of lies, isn't it strange how they are not more specific with their allegations? if there are lies fine, SHOW ME THEM, don't tell me they are there show them to me, quote to me what is untruthful, tell me why it is untruthful and point me to where you found the evidence that this is untruthful. If you cant do that then I'm afraid it is you who are the liars.I do not begrudge people a view on the movie but your review would count for a hell of a lot more if you have actually seen the movie and not just COPY AND PASTED some venomous, unfounded outburst by one of bush's diddymen and passed it off as your own judgment (the people calling the movie Nazi propaganda should probably take note and re-read the current paragraph several times over to make sure that they completely understand it and possibly also find a definition of what a Nazi actually is).I have never before seen a US movie put so much effort into verifying every word said as the truth, movies like U-571 which completely re-write history to make the movie more entertaining for Americans bring American movie making's international respect and reputation far below what it should be but Fahrenheit 9/11 goes along way to restoring them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 is a big, cinematic sour cream pie in the face of George W. Bush, his crew; a group that hijacked patriotism in the same way that the Taliban hijacked Islam, as well as the social sector he represents. Yeah, it's manipulative, and sometimes blatant. The sequence showing a kid flying his kite just before the bombs started falling made me wince a little. But Moore would probably say he's merely fighting fire with fire, pie with pie. The kite kid may have been having fun but the ground on which he ran was just a thin crust over an abyss of summary amputations, hydrochloric acid immersions, midnight disappearances, and very hard time in Abu Ghraib. This was Saddam's Iraq, remember; the nearest thing we had on Earth to the Klingon Empire. It's also periodically hilarious (Witness the incredulous Congressman when Moore asks him to consider sending his own kids into the service and to Iraq.) For viewers on the left, Fahrenheit 9/11 will certainly re-fan any waning flames of activism. It will make those on the right gnash teeth and cry foul. But for those not sure what to think it may supply a quite weather-resistant something to think about.Despite its upside yo' head approach, Fahrenheit 9/11 actually let George Bush off more easily than it might have; certainly his cast of supporting characters: the comb-licking Paul Wolfowitz, the chilling and hypocritical Dick Cheney (5 Vietnam-related draft deferments yet an avowed war hawk), the simply strange Condoleezza Rice, and our own Othello, Colin Powell, to mention a few. There is more that the film could have said, as well as a few things that could have been said better; possibly an even closer look at the murky relationships that underpin the Bush family, especially its CIA connections. Let's not forget that one of the Agency's known modus operandi is the manipulation of elections, although historically in foreign countries? historically. Remember also that the CIA's mission is only tangentially to protect us here. Its real prime directive is optimizing conditions for American interests abroad, especially business interests. At least some reference to the repercussions of a post-Saddam power vacuum would have been good in this film's context, perhaps addressing the deluge of Iranian and Saudi cash in support of Iraqi Shiite and Sunni factions respectively. It only hints at the absolutely stunning lack of foresight on the part of the Bush Administration that has us and our stalwart service people up to our waists in the mire, regardless of how righteous the initial motives for invasion may have seemed. Too much was probably made by Moore of the Bin Laden family's hasty post-9/11 exit from the country, as these people were almost certainly innocent of any wrongdoing. Sure, they were tight with the Bushes, but that's not yet a crime. Too little was said about the administration's thinly-veiled, near-unprecedented arrogance toward the, albeit, lily-livered legislative branch of the government, on which our current unilateralism is founded. But, all considered, the film's main point has been made, or at least implied.For many Hindus, everything is Karma; a word that translates most simply as Action, or possibly both action and its result. Nonaction is also a form of karma, because it too can generate results. That the Bush Administration is even possible reflects the karma of the sort of stall-inducing aerodynamic drag that results when a culture becomes, perhaps, too civilized; too complex, too disembodied, too abstracted by its own weight and momentum; a construct into which enormous quantities of energy must be channeled merely to hold it all together. Fahrenheit 9/11 is the Bush Administration's karma, the result of underestimating the intelligence of the majority of Americans and over-estimating its own charisma, as well as that of the presidential office. We're reminded that the real power in America tends to run at periscope depth, but under the cool Bush sparkle it has broken the surface, like a modern nuclear sub; conning tower out, most of the hull still submerged.If the events surrounding the 2000 presidential election returns from Florida had transpired in France, much of the country's population would probably have been in the streets. In fact, they still might be there today. The French tend to be quite realistic about some things, such as sex, politics, and, of course, international relations; one of the main reasons Paris was not shelled into rubble by Hitler. But they do know how to be really p***ed off when that is called for; something we're still learning. The fact that, in a culture as politically demure as ours, Bush's inaugural motorcade was egged implies that America has not yet completely lost its cojones. The parallel fact that many media pundits denounced Fahrenheit 9/11 before it was ever screened should be reason enough for almost anyone to see it, aside from the fact that nothing like this film has ever been made for major release. It is something of a milestone. There's an old saying that has numerous variants: 'When among the wolves, howl.' In that light, Michael Moore, the current alpha coyote of the Left of Center pack, definitely be howlin'. That a film like this can be made and seen is a testament to how cool, and hot, America still is. Word is that an anti-Michael Moore film is slated for release. I'm sure Moore would say, 'Bring it on.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie like this was long due. It is an eye opener for people who have blind faith on their leader to make all the decisions. A movie on similar grounds is due on Tony Blair the the British involvement in the Gulf Wars. A tremendous amount of effort has been put by Michael Moore in the making of this movie. The case studies example- Lila Lipscomb (possible spelling mistake) who had absolute blind faith in the American military in the beginning, and the loss of this faith after the tragic death of her son in Iraq, the class discrepancies in American society has been shown in great depth by Michael Moore. To end the movie, Michael Moore makes a futile attempt to recruit the sons and daughters of US senators by approaching them individually. After watching this movie, one wonders how the citizens of United States (2nd or 3rd biggest democratic nation in the world!) puts up with such a dictator like George Bush.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to respond. I cannot sit idly by and watch the dissemination of inaccurate information.rbrb posted a comment entitled, "Telling the Truth Causes the Controversy", listing 8 "truths" of the movie. I must comment... FACTUALLY... about his "truths".1) Moore clearly overlooks the FACT that EVERY INDEPENDENT recount of the Florida ballots after the election showed Bush winning... some by less than 100 votes, others by thousands.2) Politicians had no place in disputing the results. In the U.S.A. the Judicial branch had jurisdiction and a politician's opinion would have had no bearing.3) The Clinton White House had numerous warnings about Bin Laden... and attacks on the U.S. during his tenure. Bush was delayed in his start due to the whole Florida fiasco, and received virtually the same information Clinton based his decisions on.4) This statement does not dignify a comment. It is mere opinion.5) A conspiracy theorist would be proud of this one... Supposedly, Bush is linked to Bin Laden through an oil company his father joined the board of. However, Bush Sr. joined the board AFTER it ceased to be the property of Saudis. Enough said.6) Richard Clarke admitted publicly the Saudis left the country on his decision, and his alone. Moore had plenty of time to change that in his film and still left it in to deceive.7) Iraq: UN and Clinton said Iraq had WMDs in 1998... did they magically disappear by 2003?8) Minorities? Give me a break. The U.S. has a VOLUNTEER military.To call anything in the film "fact" insults the word.Bush does not have to respond to anything. If he responded to every onslaught from the Democrats in the last 6 months, he would be doing nothing but responding.Moore deserves NO awards, except in France. I can tell more truth with less brain than I currently have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The information so brilliantly assembled by Moore is not new to anyone taking the time to read the available body of factual material pertaining to the American leader and his cronies; however, the compression and the illumination of all that has transpired since his "election" makes for powerful drama. Moore deserves unreservedly his Cannes award for Fahrenheit 9/11 due to the simple reason that as a film 9/11 threaded it's way through the morass of governmental lies and disinformation that has blanketed the Bush leadership as well as the insidious invasion of an innocent country. When making a film against the background of so much chaff,or should I say chards, thrown out to cloud reality you are attempting to document a reality that has lost it's existence for the participants in the much-lauded democracy so often regurgitated by the American leader.I am in awe of Moore for his brains and courage to confront the magnate monolith in power in Washington today. The USA and the world needs dozens of Moores to unmask the reality of the evil, Dubya loves that word, that is inexorably undermining the liberal democracy passed on to us in this century through the efforts of the courageous French in their revolution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To call this a Bush-bashing film is an embarrassing bit of oversimplification. Moore indicts the Democrats and the national news media, as well as the citizens of our own country. He makes the apparently daring statement that we all have culpability and being able to take responsibility for mistakes and wrongdoing is the first step in correcting them.Words like manipulation, bias, anger, rant are all being used to downgradeMoore's opinion, but his is as valid as anyone else's and the only post I have seen on this review thread to really address the specifics of these accusations calls Bush the greatest president since Washington, which shows less a facile scholarship about Bush than it does about Washington himself.Many of the points in Moore's documentary have been attainable facts for quite a while now, though many are under reported, some have never been strung together in quite this fashion, and few still have been used to an editorial point. But they have been there for those who pay attention.The right talks about the left being filled with rage as if that honest emotion is shameful. The funny thing is that all I see in the conservative responses to this film - indeed to any criticism of the president - is a seething anger that seems on the verge of popping a vein in their forehead.The larger message of the film is the same message as in any of Moore's films - that the upper class will always manipulate data in such a way that the lower class will think that what is bad for them is what is actually good for them. It's the way it has been in our country since Washington and it continues to be the American Way.So just go see the movie and decide for yourself. Who cares what anyone else has to say?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An act of patriotism and one of 2004's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Michael Moore and his politics or hate 'em, it's undeniable that "Fahrenheit 9/11" is one thoroughly entertaining, thought-provoking and immensely watchable movie.Moore might rely on guilt by association, but his film's so damn effective because amidst the skewering of the Bush presidency, he tosses in nuggets of truth too strong to discount. There's the Washington Post's finding that Bush spent 42 percent of his first eight months in office (weekends included) on vacation and, insinuations aside, well-documented business relationships. You don't have to take as gospel everything in this satirical documentary. You shouldn't. But it's a helluva launching pad for debate - discussions that should have occurred months before our young men and women were sent to die in Iraq. Especially, since we know the rationale turned out to be wrong and we very likely were misled. Moore insinuates, you decide.Subtlety has never been Moore's forte. He can be boorish and self-aggrandizing, but this is a more mature work than his previous films. He tackles the 9/11 attacks with restraint and knows the strength of his story barely needs his in-your-face shtick. Moore revels in being cheeky, too - his "Bonanza" parody is inspired. Clips from a "Rebuilding Iraq" conclave underscore the aim of war profiteers and the sound bite at the end brilliantly depicts a leader who can't grasp simple declarative sentences, let alone idiomatic speech.Moore's accumulated sensationally good footage - priceless scenes of the attorney general singing, Bush at a fund-raiser of "the haves and have-mores" (as the president puts it), a vacationing Bush insisting he's doing the nation's work, yet struggling to come up with what exactly that is, and shots of Bush seemingly making faces just before he's about to announce to the world that he's waging war on Iraq.Moore attacks Democrats, too. He exposes their cowardice for not questioning Bush's decision to go to war against Iraq and their inexcusable behavior when not a single Democratic senator agreed to make formal the Congressional Black Caucus' protest of the certification of the 2000 election results.The film also shows how easy it is for our leaders to manipulate the public and curb constitutional rights because, sadly, Americans are quite willing to sacrifice their rights for the false feeling of security in a post-9/11 America.The film's greatest impact comes when Moore turns to the Iraq war, complete with harrowing scenes of carnage, including bloody civilian casualties, sad tales of U.S. military casualties at Walter Reed and disillusioned soldiers at Fort Campbell, Ky. And there's the heartbreaking story of Lila Lipscomb, a flag-waving patriot whose visit to the White House is emotionally devastating cinema verit.The film isn't flawless. Scenes of Iraqis enjoying life before the war includes nothing about our one-time ally Saddam's brutality. And Moore perhaps shouldn't have surmised what was on Bush's mind as the president sat still for seven minutes during a photo-op at a Florida elementary school after being told of the second plane hitting the WTC. We get the point in spite of Moore's narration.Republicans insist Bush did nothing initially to exhibit strength, stability and calm. The footage seems to convey a stunned president who has no clue what to do next. There's more panic and confusion in those eyes than calmness. You can just picture another president, say, JFK, making an amusing quip about having to leave early, calmly rising and snapping into action, without waiting for an aide telling him what to do or sticking around to read "My Pet Goat." Patriotism isn't merely flying the flag or adorning your car with "These Colors Don't Run" Stars-and-Stripes, or for that matter, "Redefeat Bush," bumper stickers. The profound insight of a gum-chewing Britney Spears notwithstanding - she tells an interviewer Americans should trust, and never question, the president's decisions - being skeptical of our leaders, especially in times of crises is patriotic. As brutal, scathing and passionate an indictment of a president, government leaders and their motives as this film is, it remains tremendously funny, audacious, defiant, poignant, provocative and sad without ever losing its focus. It exemplifies patriotism. If this film prompts more discussion and skepticism of our government's actions, then Moore's performed a truly patriotic act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but unsubtle, ungracefully and inelegantly made. But maybe now in a time of ignorance and superficiality such brazen tactics are the only way to make us understand. Perhaps Moore's critics don't understand that there is no REAL truth. Covering something from all angles, be it a war, an argument or a misunderstanding doesn't lead to pure truth, only confusion.It's no secret that Moore has an agenda with this film. And I agreed with it long before I saw it. The point is President Bush must not be re-elected. And Moore gives us hundreds of reasons why. However it's the manipulation of the editing and arranging of montages that prevent the film from having any real dignity or class. Sure there is a sense of humor and huge understanding of American politics (you MUST pay attention to every last word) but Moore's point is too biased to really connect with me. Not that I think Bush deserves any sympathy or a second (or 1, 345, 456th) chance. It's just that his intentions come across too forcefully. Yes, the war in Iraq is unjust and the biggest lie and waste of human life since the Vietnam catastrophe. And all for what? For money, nothing more than paper. If we ever come through this will we trust the Government again? Most ominously not. After watching this film will you ever trust the Government again? I promise you...you won't!There are some powerful scenes, a woman breaking down in tears reading a letter from her dead son who died in Iraq for Bush's greed, every Senator Moore meets refusing to sign their children up for the Army while poor black kids from the projects willingly sign up, the charred bodies of US soldiers being dragged through the streets in Iraq. But the most effective part of the film was also the most ingenious. The opening to Fahrenheit 9/11 plays the sounds of planes crashing into the WTC on a black screen. Powerful effects without the use of images at all. Why? We've seen it so many time we need not see it again. Because terrorism is blind. Out of respect for people sensitive for such images being exploited yet again. And to heighten our awareness of the horror of just screaming and panic and the cheapening of human life.There are parts of this film that will rile you up and enrage you, be it the skillful arranging of facts or the ignorant bystander calling the woman crying over her dead son 'staged'. Sadly though, it wanders off the point in the middle and kind of sags. If it had been leaner then I wouldn't have gotten so impatient. But as it stands Fahrenheit 9/11 is an unapologetic firestorm designed to rip right through the Whitehouse and the Senate. With any luck it will.We may not ever trust any new administration but we'll NEVER be fooled again. Lesson might be learned. But at what price?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if everything, or anything for that matter, in Fahrenheit 9/11 is true or not, but the evidence, however biased or one-sided it may be, sure seems to be overwhelming against President Bush and his constituents as a group of people who's motivations, and the end results of those motivations, were not for the the majority of the American people, especially the poorer ones, but were in fact, for those who are the Have's, not the Have Not's. Unfortunately for those of you who are the Have Not's, you will remain the Have Not's. I don't question the desire to succeed, whether it be economically, socially or politically, but what I do question is the means about how one does so. Why do we value the material and not the thing that should matter most...how we treat a fellow human being?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most inflammatory movies ever to see wide release. Love him or hate him, Michael Moore has put together a compelling film. Critics will quibble about statistics cited and opinions offered, but there is too much damning evidence in this film that suggests 1) Bush went after the wrong people following 9/11; and 2) we were misled into a war with Iraq. If George W. Bush fails to win re-election in 2004, this film can take at least partial credit. It's that powerful.As of July 6, 2004, I had seen the film twice. Once at 11:45 p.m. on opening day, once at 2:45 p.m. on the Monday afternoon ten days after its release. Both houses were packed with few or no empty seats, and people cried audibly during certain scenes in both showings. To write this film off without seeing it would be intellectually bankrupt, no matter what your political affiliation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most important films of the last 10 years...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>COUPLE SPOILERS (ESP. AT THE END) I just saw this movie and felt that I had to comment on it. I'll start with two quotes from the people with whom I saw it. "It's about time that the rest of the country found out what we in Texas have known for the last 10 years. Dubya is incompetent." "Gee, I wonder why we haven't seen any of those images here in the United States."It is clear that the administration is heavily controlling information about the war to which we as country are entitled to (from the caskets waiting transport to Bush's financial ties), and Moore sheds even more light on this. I think that the most powerful images in the film is the juxtaposition of the Iraqi woman whose house was blown up and of Ms. Lipscomb grieving for the loss of her son. From this aspect, I think that the film brings out is the how the common man on both sides of this conflict have the same bottom line: death and destruction. And all of this brought on by the greed, vengeance, and lies of the people that will never see any of this.All in all, Fahrenheit brilliantly teases out the human and economic aspects of the War on Terror. However, I would liked to have a little more on the foreign policy implications. I don't think that the film dealt with how the war has affected anti-Americanism throughout the entire Middle East. Especially considering the fact that Iraq is more than likely innocent of what the US is charging them with and that fueling the fire of anti-Americanism and probably creating a larger terrorist base throughout the Middle East. Are you really safer because we invaded sovereign Iraq?I would just like to comment on anyone that says that Moore and the film are anti-American and/or unpatriotic. This opinion is an incredibly patriotic film. Patriotism does not mean that you rally 'round the flag and fail to question the policies of the administration. Patriotism means that there is an enlightened citizenry and you are informed, educated, and do not simply rely on what the government tells you is right or wrong. After all, we have the power in this country, but we routinely fail to exercise it. Whether you like it or hate it, it no doubt made you think and debate within or without yourself about policy and hopefully will move you to vote in November. Which makes the film patriotic. Also, I'm fairly sure that Moore does not dislike the soldiers in Iraq, as has been intimated. The best way to assure that our soldiers are safe is if they are back home. The last line of the film sums it all up. "All the soldiers ask is to trust us not to put them in harm's way unless it is absolutely necessary. Will they believe us now?"</fullReview>

How many shots of Bush speaking as a mentally retarded cowboy do you need to see before you draw the conclusion that he's a giant money-hungry idiot?Moore's not just "one-sided", he's not just "attacking Bush". He's showing us the corruption, warts and all, and people can't handle it. They won't acknowledge it. Moore's sounding the alarm, AGAIN, for those who haven't heard it since Dubya stole the election. You can attack Michael Moore all you want. His crimes (if any) pale in comparison to that colossal egomaniac who sits in the white house AS WE SPEAK.Do something America.

		<fullReview>We saw Fahrenheit 9/11 with a clearly partisan crowd. The reluctant Marine was applauded when he explained his refusal to return to Iraq if ordered. The closing line following Bush's bumbling the 'fool me once...twice...' was lost in applause and laughter. (if anyone can shoot me that Moore's retort, I would be forever grateful). And there was a clear absence of the usual crowd of those who think that they're sitting in their living rooms in dialogue with the characters on the screen. It was Saturday afternoon, after the opening day and there wasn't an empty seat in the house. Even with the blockbusters, that seldom happens.If Kerry winds up in the White House will he have a friend in Michael Moore? Not really because the same invective used so effectively against the Bush administration can easily be turned against another rich white guy with family ties.What impact have Moore's films had? He has been preaching to the choir forever. Will this be the one? Let's hope.He makes strong arguments without the shackles of objectivity. Reviewers are urging all persuasions to see it. But will they? I doubt it.Cynical me? Nah! </fullReview>

For the critical-thinking Democrat ("one who practices social equality"), frustrated and disenfranchised by the ongoing backwardness perpetuated by the Republican "Agenda," Michael Moore unravels the bare threads of Bush's "magic cloak of deceit" regarding 9/11, the election, and the war effort, and knits a sweater of shame and ineptitude. It's pieced together in a humorous, artsy way. You'll leave the theater asking yourself: What ELSE has gone on that we don't know about? Is Bush, Inc. doing the best they can at their job? Yes, sadly, they may be. They're probably just following the Golden Rule - those that have the gold, rule.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an very important film about a VERY important time in the history of the U.S. We are at a crossroad in our destiny and the importance of knowing what kind of people are running this country should be an over-riding concern. Did I say ruining this country ? Another important note is that this is an extremely well-made documentary. It is easy to see why it won Cannes' highest award. This film should be viewed with an eye towards factual accuracy. Keep in mind that most of what you now see in a "newscast" is less accurate than ever before due to the limited scope of ownership of media in the U.S. As an editor, it embarrases me to see how news media often present "experts" who are really shills for the extreme right wing. Mr. Moore is to be congratulated for his wonderful condensation of reality into an entertaining, informative, and concise examination of the most frightening attempt by our government to assert TOTAL CONTROL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that this movie is freely shown in theaters is evidence that the American nation is a truly democratic nation, a direct continuation of the Athenian democracy of the Classical Era. It doesn't matter whether a person is pro or against the Bush administration to appreciate good political criticism. Michael Moore has never being elected president so I am sure he can't possibly know all the complexities and difficulties associated with governing a country. It may be the case that while his facts are true his criticism is not fair because of many other issues which he may not be aware of. It may also be the case that President Bush may be one of the most competent that ever lived in the White House. What matters is that this movie presents some criticism on the current administration in a thought-provoking way and can be used for initiating dialog between politicians and parties about what went wrong (if anything went wrong) after 9/11 and how we can fix things. It is this kind of thought-provoking criticism that keeps democracies alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what is all the fuzz about this being propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so it has become fashionable to call Fahrenheit 9/11 propaganda.According to WordNet propaganda is:"information that is spread for the purpose of promoting some cause"if we take this definition everything that the White House says, everything that Fox airs, everything that any of the right wing radio nuts say is propaganda -- and all I can say is so what?Now if we compare the Fahrenheit 9/11 to the Nazi propaganda that some right wing radio and TV nuts have done then I have to say there is nothing in the movie that compares to that in the slightest.There are some questionable facts in the movie (one or two), then there is the way Moore puts different views next to each other to strengthen his points (btw the Bush White House does this all the time -- WMD-Saddam, 9/11 and after three months 50% of American believed Saddam was responsible for 9/11) but overall the movie is based on showing a side of the story of the last four years that the right just don't want people to see -- now if this side of the story would be all wrong why would they bother? And by the way I remember a lot of this story and it is not that different from that Moore is telling in the movie. Unfortunately most people won't watch the movie, and most of the people who will don't need convincing that the country needs a new president..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is the truth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard a lot about this movie before, but didn't consider in seeing it till recently. And it's my first time seeing a Micheal Moore Movie. I know who he was, but never seen any of his works.And I have to say, that this documentary movie really does give me the facts I didn't know about the whole Iraq issue.Fahrenheit 9/11 has gathered footage, and video recordings that you wouldn't see in the public, for obvious reasons. First off, you see a bit of the Florida recount vote thing that occurred in early 2000s, What Bush was doing 9 months before 9/11 occurred, and some unavoidable events that looked so simple to avoid.You'll see a lot of interviews from famous celebrities of the New Media, the U.S. Army Corp, Anti-War supporters, deprived mothers, and those who dislike Bush's job in handling the war.Despite it being about the war we're in, It's really a work of art by a filmmaker who is doing something for those who feel helpless about what has happened these few years.And Moore, did a great job in making this documentary possible. He narrated it, starred in it, and has also helped those who suffer from 9/11, relatives being deported to the battlefields, and just why this whole thing happened in the first place.It also features some strong moments including footage of Iraq under attack, civilians wounded &amp; dead, and families who lost their loved ones in 9/11 and in battle. Yes it sounds grim, but it does add some humor to it including why Bush isn't doing so great as president, with footage of him looking like a fool. As well as Micheal Moore commenting on the war itself, and taking some action by interviewing recruits, congress men, and many protesters.I haven't seen many documentaries in the past, but this is one hell of a great documentary to watch again and again. It's educational, graphic, ideal, and genius at the same time. Highly recommend it to Bush haters, protesters, Anti-War Groups, or those who want to know the truth. I wouldn't recommend this to Bush Adminstrators, close friends to Bush, Countries of the Middle East, or those who support the war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WILL change the way you think about Bush &amp; his "War on Terror"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see for yourself Michael Moore's juxtaposition of pre-9/11 interviews of figures like Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice, asserting that Saddam Hussein has "not rebuilt his army", and can not (in Rice's words) "even project conventional (military) power on his neighbors", with post-9/11 footage in which THE VERY SAME PEOPLE insist that Saddam Hussin is an imminent threat to the security of the United States, developing nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction and collaborating with Al-Qaeda, you will understand exactly what Michael Moore is trying to say - we were duped. The American people were duped into a war that was not necessary, with an enemy that was not a threat.But why did our government dupe us in a time of war, when we were under attack from a very REAL enemy? Farenheit 911 answers this question with an indisputable fact: there was A LOT, LOT, LOT more MONEY to be made by the military-industrial complex by invading Iraq, a country with the world's second largest oil deposits and a large well-developed infrastructure that would need to be rebuilt, vs. Afghanistan, a poor undeveloped country with no natural resources and no infrastructure of any type to destroy or to rebuild.Consider this: less than 20,000 American troops invaded Afghanistan (a state run by Islamic terrorists who openly gave OSAMA BIN LADEN SAFE HAVEN), but nearly 140,000 American troops invaded Iraq, a country whose secular dictator hasn't threatened America in over a decade, and whose alleged "weapons of mass destruction" have never been found, even in traces. Michael Moore made a lot of statements in this film I did not completely agree with. For example, in the film's opening, he asserts that Bush won the 2000 election through fraudulent means. Although he presents some compelling evidence for this, it is not conclusive. He also exaggerates some figures, such as saying that Bush proposed cutting combat soldiers' pay by 33%. In reality, it was only Imminent Danger/Hostile Fire Pay he proposed cutting, a bonus received by soldiers in designated combat zones, and no soldier was at risk of having his overall pay cut by 33%. Additionally, he uses broad stereotypes, such as displaying the Netherlands as a nation of drug addicts in his mockery of the U.S-led "Coalition of the Willing" to topple Saddam. In reality, the Netherlands has a well trained modern military.But these minor exaggerations did not distract me from the well illustrated truth of the overriding theme of this movie: that the Bush administration used the 9/11 attacks to rally Americans into supporting an unjust war on Iraq, for the enrichment of his wealthy supporters in the military-industrial complex, at the expense of the lives of the men and women of the U.S military, AND AT THE EXPENSE of catching Osama Bin Laden, the real perpetrator of 9/11.I was not old enough to vote when Bush was re-elected. If I had been, I probably would have voted for Bush, like most Americans, including my family, who trusted the President unflinchingly in the days after 9/11. This movie opened my eyes. Now that I am 18, there is no doubt where my vote will go in 2008. If you are a thinking person, this movie will open your eyes too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not A Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the most important thing I would say about this movie is that it is not a documentary. By that I mean that it does not present an unbiased view of historical events. It is really a political commentary directly before the 2004 US presidential election. Not only is it clearly biased, but there are more than a few questions on its integrity of information. There were of course many other extreme political viewpoints before the US 2004 Presidential Election. One item to the other extreme was the book written "Unfit for Command" regarding candidate John Kerry. My very strong advice is that if you are viewing or reading any information from either the "extreme left" viewpoint or the "extreme right" viewpoint to take that into account and try to balance it with other facts.For those who believe that this movie is the end all of truth, my very strong advice would be to read the US 911 Commission Report. This 911 commission report was written by a bi-partisan committee, and I believe is the most accurate and non biased account of the 9/11 happening. Even if a person does hate President George Bush and only wishes to listen to negatives on him, there is much more at stake here. The Fahrenheit 911 movie also in my opinion treats several countries outside of the US very poorly ? giving a biased viewpoint of them also. While I will not go into detail country by country, I do believe these countries deserve to be given a more even handed approach. I had a very different viewpoint of several countries after seeing Fahrenheit 911 and then later reading the more even handed 911 commission report. Which do I believe after viewing both? The written 911 bi-partisan commission report by a great margin.If one does not have time to read the 911 Commission report done by a bi-partisan committee, I would strongly recommend the two hour 911 version as done by the History Channel over Moore's version. The History Channel version sticks more to the facts and includes (My opinion) much more information. That is actually a very strong second negative to the Moore version Fahrenheit 911. Aside from being biased, it is actually low on real information. The 911 Commission report and even the History Channel 911 report did a much finer job.</fullReview>

This is clearly a blatant attempt by the leftist naysayers in our country to bag on an honest and moral president that is leading this country the only way he knows how: the RIGHT way. At least with in the case of Roger and Me, Moore was attempting to do something that he felt was right. I mean, attacking Corporate America is at least understandable for someone that is just shy of being an out an out Commie. But putting down the leaders of our country is infuriating, especially when lives are at stake. Liberalism is a virus that is infecting this fair nation and should be the enemy of any God-fearing Conservative. I have to admit, I didn't see the whole movie, I mostly saw the trailers, but this movie is still the worst piece of propaganda that would rival that of Communist China. Lets not confuse emotions with hard core facts, the Bush Administration has more intelligence people out there than Moore does.

I could compare Moore to several historical figures, but I'm not going to sink to such lows.

		<fullReview>I am a Canadian, have seen Fahrenheit, as well as Roger, Bowling, the Big One, etc. Have any of you noticed the pattern?Moore's first movie Roger and Me, little guy against the big guy, rah! rah! Somehow, Moore made money off an unfortunate circumstance, Flint Michigan's state of affairs, throw in images of everyone's pain and anger. Rough estimate on profit for Moore $10 million. Rough estimate on his charitable donation back to his 'beloved' hometown 'zero' dollars.Next up, Bowling for Columbine, this time he decides that the title should contain elements that will stir up emotion and anger. Show victims, film people who didn't want to be filmed, etc. typical scandal-type documenting. Rough estimate of Moore's take $50 million, his donation to help the victims of Columbine "zero".On a roll, he decides to capitalize on one of the worst moments in history. Armed with $50 million in his pocket (no longer the David but the Goliath!)He steals the name of his next movie from a true filmmaker Francois Truffaut's "Fahrenheit 451". This assortment of archival footage cut and pasted with some archival music purports to present the facts. Ahh the rub!The fatter cat (literally and figuratively) sets out to blast Bush's handling of the country, terrorism, economy and vacation time! The film begins with the events of the election, where he claims the results were fixed. Moore had so little 'proof' to present that he had to manufacture a Newspaper Headline! He borrowed a letter to the editor and placed it on the frontpage of a paper. Just this single solitary item is enough for anyone to completely discount the rest of this movie. Only the facts Moore, please.Then, as the events of 9/11 unfold, Moore has you believe that the Bush government didn't do anything to prevent the terrorist attacks. Excuse me, but wasn't Clinton/Lewinsky in office for the World Trade Center, Oklahoma City, African Embassy and the Navy ship bombings, what did he do? The terrorists were getting their flight training and planning the attacks under Clinton's nose!!!No one and I mean NO ONE could have prevented the attacks, given the airport security measures that were in place at the time. If anyone were to blame,it was the Clinton administration! The hatred for America was brewing long before Bush came along. Besides, for eight years during Clinton, Saddam continuously defied the world by stalling inspections, etc. Why didn't he take a stand. I applaud Bush for doing something. In the post 9/11 world, anyone caught 'bluffing' should be warned, then attacked if necessary. Who is Saddam to not abide by the world's (United Nations) demands?I am Canadian, with strong ties to America, I am disgraced by our former Prime Minister, Chretien for not aligning with the US and Britain (our father and mother). We could have at least said, 'we are behind you', 'but we can't send troops'. Now Canada must live the stigma of not having helped our biggest trading partners. By the way, world, the next time there is a disaster anywhere, don't call the Whitehouse, the phone line is disconnected.Getting back to Fahrenheit, Mr.Moore what the hell do you propose that Bush should have done when he was notified of the 2nd plane hitting, you moron! Jump up, with cameras rolling, in front of a room full of kids (oh, you don't have any) and run out with your hands on your head! By the way, his press secretary, who was in the back of the room (great omit Moore) wrote on a paper for Bush to see, 'don't say anything yet'. Facts, Moore, facts please!The overwhelming response by Americans after 9/11 was 'protect us' and 'punish those responsible'. Mr. Moore, what did you propose in your film, should have been done that Bush did not do? Exactly! He did everything right, he went after the culprits, he went after the ones who harbor them, and sent the message out that terrorrism, in any form will not be tolerated. This was the will of the people, and the will of most of the world (except yours).Moore attempts to place 'monetary gains' as the sole reason of Afganistan and Iraq attacks. Please, Mr. Moore, monetary gains, you are the poster boy of 'monetary gains'!!! Did you give any of the $200 million plus, that you made from this movie to the victims of 9/11??? Then you say that Bush couldn't catch Bin Laden, why didn't Clinton in 8 years?It is simple to dissect this movie and break it down into nothing but election propaganda. Without a doubt, Moore is waiting impatiently for the next big unfortunate incident to occur, so he can capitalize on it as he has in the past. It is sad that the same country that allows a person to rise out of lowly Flint, Michigan and 'become' the fat cat that he so vehemently despises is being lambasted in this film. America is great, Moore you are not.</fullReview>

This is pure, violent and very efficient propaganda material rather then a shocking objective documentary. And Michel? My favorite filmmaker?

		<fullReview>Before I went to see Farenheit 9/11 I saw Bowling for Columbine to see just what all the fuss was about with Michael Moore. I must say that Bowling for Columbine had been presented in a rather unique way in which I had not been accustomed to when viewing documentaries.Documentaries either present something factual in an entertaining format, displaying facts straight-forward and in-your-face, or they have the potential to drag out and bore the audience into a stupor. For the duration of Farenheit 9/11 it does nothing in the latter.Of course this is only the tip of the iceberg. To be honest I had never seen such impactive scenes in a documentary in my life. It can go from being hilarious (Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Tony Blair storming into Afghanistan a la Bonanza) to the downright emotional (the mother whose son was killed in Iraq confronting the White House in a highly emotional scene which I will always remember).Farenheit 9/11 is a must-see film. People from all walks of life should see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Telling the Truth Causes the Controversy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to this film,George W. Bush and his associates, including Bush Senior:1) Unlawfully and wrongly won the 2000 presidential election, and in particular, had conflict of interest people deciding Florida;2)Many politicians did not have the courage to dispute the election result;3) Bush and Co were told before 9/11 of a pending attach by Bin Laden but were too stupid, lazy, bothered, or self-interested to care;4) On 9th September 2001 George W. Bush was clueless and cowardly;5) Before, during and after 9/11 Bush etc were profiteering from the oil rich relatives of Bin Laden to the detriment of the people of the USA;6) attempts were made by Bush etc to cover up his Bin Laden connections. Relatives of Ben Laden were allowed to leave the USA on or about the 13th September 2001 which hampered the investigation into 9/11;7) The war on Iraq was unnecessary and the launching of the war was an attempt, amongst other things, to hide the connection Bush has with the Bin Laden relatives;8) There is a deliberate attempt to use 'minorities' as war fodder, to the detriment of them but to the benefit of others. Only 1 out of over 500 congressmen had sons or daughters serving in Iraq.The facts in this film are clear and the inferences to be drawn from them compelling.If this documentary is wrong, then why no rebuttal or legal action from Bush and others in it?Why did the "US media" fail to tell the truth and leave it to an independent film-maker to do so?Ain't it interesting how when you tell the truth it becomes such a controversy.....Well done Michael Moore-you deserve all the awards.A brave man you are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's eye opening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in the eye of a storm of controversy, Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 is a potent indictment of the moronic administration that is currently running the self-proclaimed most powerful nation on Earth. I myself am not an American, and wasn't a fan of George W. Bush before watching this movie anyway, so many of the ideas that Moore presents were already instilled in my mind prior to watching; but the way Moore argues and the relativity and believability of many of the facts that Moore uses are likely to put doubts in the minds of even the most ardent of Dubya fans. Michael Moore has clearly done his homework on the issues he raises in this film (which is what you'd expect), and the way that the movie is put together is eye opening, intriguing and a lot of the time, very funny. Moore is very sarcastic, and the way that some of his arguments are put forward border on genius. The western style attack on Afghanistan and the "dream" sequence at the start are among the best of them.There's some great tunes on display in the movie, and the way that Moore has selected his music is hilarious. While REM's "Shiny Happy People" plays against the backdrop of Bush shaking hands and smiling with various Saudi Arabian's, you cant help but laugh. The film is at it's best and most potent while Moore is feeding the audience information about Bush's administration and his relationship with the Bin Laden's. It's obvious that Moore feels passionate about the subject material, and he gives it his all with a variety of different fact giving methods. However, when we enter the final third, the film takes a huge downturn. Moore professes that the press doesn't cover the individual loss of life for each soldier because it's "too much of a downer", and so he does so here. Ironically, it puts a huge downer on the film as the high-energy debate that was raging in the first hour fades away into a routine showing of the tragedy of war. This was perhaps a necessary route for Moore to take, but I'd have liked the film a lot more if Moore had stayed on topic, even if means a shorter movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reguardless of whether you are a Democrat, Republican, or anything else, and regardless of your opinions of anything, this is a film you need to see. Whether you come away with a totally new perspective or an unchanged one is unimportant. This film is biased, but that's not the point. The point is that this film shows and tells things that no one else does. The film is edited and narrated by a man who has a strong opinion and is trying to make a point, but the clips you are seeing are all real, and you will never see them on CNN on Fox News. It is a true crime that the level of actual information in the national media has dropped to such a low. No one who claims to be an educated American or who feels they have the right to vote should ignore this film. We are given enough "feel good" journalism on TV. It's about time we saw something that is disturbing, raw, and honest, and that asks the tough and important questions that nobody else asks any more. As far as the actual art of the film it's better than most documentaries, not nearly as well crafted as Moore's last effort, "Bowling for Columbine". Still, even now, after the election, I think everyone should watch this movie because there are a lot of facts in it that you will find difficulty getting straight anywhere else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate it when a person talks to me like I am in the third grade. It is insulting, being a highly educated person to be talked to like I could not possibly comprehend what is going on. Fahrenheit 9/11 is two hours of that.And that is directly representative of how the liberals view the people of this country. Idiots who could not possibly understand the intricacies of life or politics. This movie is very poorly done with regards to documentary films. Documentaries show the situation, and allow the viewer to arrive at their own conclusion. Documentaries are also filmmakers investigating a theory. Sometimes they are disproven. Michael Moore does not allow the truth to alter his theory. He manipulates film clips to force them to conform to an incorrect hypothesis. And he lies in baby talk throughout the film, forcing the viewer to think that someone using such small words and such idiotic tones could not possibly be lying, the person narrating isn't smart enough to concoct lies. Well Mr. Moore is a unique individual. A product of the chat room conspiracy theories and a working knowledge of a camera. Someone not smart enough to seek the truth, but not dumb enough to be able to craft a fictitious truth from smart bits of irrelevant information. This is truly a POS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore took a great premise and gave back a sophomoric film with little bite. First half of the movie is very strong and presents a good deal of conjecture and causal analysis. Moore cannot stay on this path, and begins to degrade the impact of this film by showing us shocking and distasteful scenes in place of thoughtful and provoking argument. His focus on himself as left wing crusader makes a mockery of all the hard work people have put in to prevent, limit, and fight the battles. We all know war is hell, but the arguments against going to war were strong, the dedication to the warriors true, but he makes all soldiers appear to be childish, testosterone-fueled buffoons. Not far, or fully accurate. The message is excellent, the method immature.</fullReview>

That is why our government, as well as many other UN countries, made the very risky choice to not join the so called "coalition of the willing". Michael Moore appears to be succeeding in opening the eyes of the very people who can stop this madness - the American people. Most of the rest of the world already knows. That is why it was so important for this to be released in the USA of all places. If this helps to get the country back on track by enraging the masses enough to vote accordingly in the next election, Moore should be given a place in government. This movie could very well save the soul of America and that is what makes it so much more than just a great documentary. Hopefully people of all nations will owe Moore a huge debt of gratitude as this type of film could literally change the future of the human race.

What's great to see is that you don't just have to hear some woman or man on the television telling you how evil the other side is. YOu get actual footage to back it up. YOu can see exactly how the president truly is and how completely screwed up everything became. From the first couple of minutes that show how Bush became a puppeteer in the 2000 election and all the connections that he has that gave him the election from that point on you see what truthfully came out of it all. The media was by most part biased and even admitted it. Fear was a tool and this movie shows how based on fear they were able to make America into whatever they wanted. This movie doesn't have to change people's minds to get them to see it but it does broaden your horizons to maybe think that not everything is black and white. The things said and done can not be altered to make them worse than they already are. Go and see this movie.</fullReview>

One writes that the Clintons met with Taliban officials, and I have searched high and low through reputable news sources (sorry, I don't count Rush Limbaugh as either reputable or honest) and have not found such a thing to be true. In fact Hillary Clinton was a very open critic of the Taliban's treatment of women and other aspects of their laws. Why would she consider aliasing with these people? 10/10, great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"?nothing is over the line when it finally comes down to winning or losing the presidency of the United States. Nobody is safe and nothing is sacred when the stakes finally get that high. It is the ultimate fast lane, and the people still on their feet in September are usually the meanest of the mean." - Hunter S. Thompson.Whether you hate Michael Moore or not, you can't deny that his idealism is in the right place, for he embodies an American concept that is fast being stultified by the American Government itself ? the Right to Free Speech. Though I question some of Moore's juvenile methods and embarrassing stunts, I do not refute him the right to prise open the government's Pandora's Box of guarded, privileged information in an attempt ? misguided or not - to delineate between fact and falsehood. Would that we were all prepared to go to such lengths to expose what we believe to be truth.For those who righteously complain about Fahrenheit 9/11's one-sided slant, the same can be said for the government's (and by association, the media's) blinkered dissemination of information to the public at large. The litmus test for democracy is that ALL viewpoints be given equal shrift in the media and in congress; further, that each disparate viewpoint be afforded the same amount of RESPECT as that which each individual holds as truth. The hardest part about SAYING you believe in Freedom is ACTING like you do. In the words of Henry David Thoreau, Moore "serves the State best by opposing the State most."With this film, Moore has provided the rejoinder to years of enduring the fascist whims of a government despicable enough to wield the specter of the long-since-razed Twin Towers as collateral. He is not merely a gadfly guerrilla film-maker with an agenda steeped summarily in "opposition" to the reigning Republican Party. He is not perfunctorily anti-President or anti-government; he is ANTI-DUPLICITY. For this documentary, Moore culled a wealth of disparate strands of information and fashioned them into a cudgel of defamatory data against the smug politicos in power. The message of this film is not that "George Bush is duplicitous" ? ALL politicians are duplicitous ? the underlying significance is the realization that ANY government would have used the WTC attacks to prey upon the fears of the populace to feather their affluent beds. ANY government would ensure that their business associates were well cared for during periods of civil unrest and that an international incident that bottlenecks the world economy would not quell their rapacious income-earning ability. The first half of "Fahrenheit 9/11" focuses on arousing the intellect, the second half is drenched in emotive appeal, with Moore shifting the focus from the highest government offices - perpetuating their blood money behind the lies they sell to the public - to the lowest grunts in the trenches, crimson-necked Bubbas to a man, inculcated with those lies, drenched in misplaced patriotic fervor, empowered to "bring the ideal of democracy and freedom to (Iraq)". Moore fearlessly does what no "news" program has done before him ? spotlight American politicians backpedaling, contradicting themselves, talking nonsense - from the transparently furtive Dick Cheney, whose very presence simply oozes Gollum-like underhandedness and scum-trickery; to the awkward warbling of John Ashcroft, who instigated the paradoxically-named Patriot Act; to Donald Rumsfeld mouthing like an automaton about "the humanity" that goes into bombing innocents.Moore exposes the symbiosis the Bush family shares with the faction responsible for the 9/11 tragedy ? the Taliban. Even with known allegiance to the terrorist cells known as Al Qaeda, Taliban officers are still able to saunter more freely through the corridors of the White House than even born-and-bred Americans. Any wonder that the Bush Mafioso ? whose business dealings with the Taliban net them ten-figure incomes ? are considered co-conspirators in this unethically twisted financial coup. As one of the interviewees in the film comments, "It's about making money. It's about making a LOT of money."The fact that George Bush Junior comes across as such a vacuous, empty-headed paragon of imbecility is no one's fault but his own. Sure, biased editing and out-of-context statements may be used to contribute to any public figure's denigration, but the plain truth is that any person with a modicum of English appreciation needs simply to hear the stumbling, third-grade elocutionary delivery of this American President to conclude that it was not "smarts" that won him the White House. We don't even need to satirize Bush ? that chased-ferret look is a sniggering point to begin with ? then he starts speaking... mispronunciations, malapropisms, grammatical obscenities fly out of this mental midget's mouth like a tennis ball launcher set on Wimbledon Pro, coupled with an unwarranted arrogance and condescension (he KNOWS we know who his dad is) and that uninformed, blank-staring mien as cream-whipped topping. The film closes with yet another Bush synapse-disconnect. Though one imagines he would be aware of his limitations by now, apparently George W. still believes he can successfully venture off-script during speeches and inject profundity like a Kennedy or a Jefferson. In this instance, what he tried to say ? and ended up burbling incoherently ? was, "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me", but even a well-worn axiom in the mouth of this ersatz President turns to mealy-mouth mush:"There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas - probably Tennessee, that says: Fool me once... shame on... shame on you... If- fool me- can't get fooled again..." It's appropriate that Dubya's botched aphorism echoes the prophetic Who song, "Won't Get Fooled Again", for that song's final lyric now attains a brutal literalism:Meet the new boss / Same as the old boss.(Movie Maniacs, read this unabridged article at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/Fahrenheit911.html)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Towards the end of Fahrenheit 9/11, a grieving mother starts chatting up with an anti-war protester, talking about what they've lost. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a female comes flying out of nowhere screaming "this is all staged! This is all staged!" Well, is it? I've always liked Michael Moore's stuff. Even though, yeah, I don't like these personalized documentaries where you're the main subject. But actually, Michael Moore IS in his films, but what makes his films unique is that he lets his subjects speak for themselves, which always is 10 X more interesting. In Fahrenheit 9/11, this is more of a political historical documentary then Bowling For Columbine, as he tackles many subjects, but mainly focuses on one target. That's right, George Bush. Moore has done his research well, and his allegations about Bush are very well documented and thought out. Some of it is shocking, some of it funny, but a lot of it will get people talking. Moore declared that his film would lead to Bush not getting elected, and would win the best picture Oscar which I thoroughly disagree with. The reason for that is what I said in the beginning, just make your films Michael, and keep your grandstanding out of it, therefore, you'll make the film stand on it's own merits (see my opinions at the beginning of this review).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a highly emotional and important film. Michael Moore is a great talent, and is is unique in his unwavering vision. That said, I thought this was another great entry in his life's work. In fact, it was inevitable that he would make this film, considering his remarks at the Oscars, and it is a great breath of fresh air to watch his joyful and relevant storytelling techniques.This is a story that needed to be told, considering the events that have happened in the world since September 11th. I am sure that many people have felt lost and not sure what in the world is going on. Moore does a good job of voicing these frustrations. And like a good work of art, this film leaves us with even more questions. Humor and sadness are mixed eloquently here. The humor provided solely by President Bush and his comments and facial expressions. The sadness comes from the footage of the carnage in Iraq and of the 9-11 footage. The choice not to show the towers being hit, but to have the sound playing was effective and possibly more emotional. If you are not a fan of Michael Moore, or of his politics, you will not like this film, as it is an opinion driven film. A timely documentary, footage flows together well. One scene involving the supporting countries of the USA for the Iraq war, like Morocco, Romania, etc. although amusing, could seem a little racist.</fullReview>

To tell a compelling story, you need to explain why events happened, who was involved, and how each event led to the next.For as much as Michael Moore has used films to grandstand about certain social issues, this film is truly about two things: the young soldiers who sacrifice their lives for a war without cause, and Bush's past. The best part of this film lies in the archival footage, tape recordings, public records, and humanity of those interviewed.A few things to say to those who haven't seen it--people in the theater, including myself and those who went to see it with me, were moved to tears several times. And finally, applause for someone who stood up to tell a moving, awakening story that encapsulates a vibrant expression of free speech.The result: I'm donating to Kerry's campaign.

Amazingly this drivel does a disservice to all sides of the argument and victimizes many of the individuals 'interviewed'.The ultimate solution would be to lock Rush Limbaugh and Michael Moore in a cell together and then they will negate each other as they are nothing more than two sides of the same coin, oh, and not to mention the world would be a better place without the mindless propaganda that is the most common product of either. Also, an original title would have been a plus.I hope I am not wrong in believing that the U.S. public (or at least a reasonable percentage of them) is/are capable of making informed decisions about the events since 9/11. If not we as a people have failed in the most basic responsibility of being a citizen of this country and this world, and that is the responsibility to understand both our country and the world we live in and support those that will uphold the U.S. Constitution and will deal with foreign and domestic issues with the welfare of the public as the primary goal.If this 'production' is the best that our media can produce then we are indeed in trouble as we have lost the ability to see the forest for the tree we just ran face first into.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'To speak his thought is every freeman's right, in peace and war, in council and in fight.' ?Homer.In 2004, amid a loud 15-minutes standing ovation, 'Farenheit 9/11' got the Best Documentary Film Award at the Cannes Film Festival, exemplifying its overwhelming clout.Michel Moore, a man known for his earlier popular documentaries like 'Bowling for Columbine,' produced this devastating piece of 'truthful account.' Narrated by the director, this is based on several newspapers, magazine articles and books published on this controversial subject. It is a critical analysis about America's war on terror, precisely, how the nation was misguided by its leader, President George W. Bush.The film opens with George W. Bush's much controversial election victory (year 2000) over his rival Al Gore. In the following parts unfolds the disgraceful way in which the Nation was betrayed by the smartly manipulated campaigns by Bush and Co. This film thoroughly examines the Bushes' and Saudi Royal family's business connection, long before the September 11 terrorist attack. Soon after 11/9, the unseen visual shows President Bush's reaction, in fact his inaction! We also come to know that more than any valid reason oil interest was behind the invasion of Iraq, in which America also faced heavy casualty. Sarcastically, Moore tells how the 'freedom of war' deformed into 'business of war' in Bush-instigated Iraq war. A touching interview with an American mother, who lost her son to the Iraq war, mournfully shows the real loss of the common man. Showing its deceptive 'freedom campaigns,' the ordinary people, mostly blacks and deprived, were literally 'caught' by the US Government, the visual shows! In one segment, through a smartly enacted drama, Moore reveals the Congressmen's evasion of sending their own daughters or sons to war-front! This gritty film unfolds misuse of government authorities to manipulate the secret documents, popularly quoted in the media as 'sexing up' of documents. The film also made possible for us to hear the voices?along with gruesome visuals?of ordinary Iraqis and their sorrows. A well presented, persuasively argued and highly regarded as unbiased ? this critically acclaimed documentary is a cherished treasure of free speech.'Freedom lies in being bold.' ?Robert Frost</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boy are we in trouble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I rented this film, I did not support Bush, I suspected many of the things covered in this shocking documentary. The facts covered where so shocking that I could not believe how MANY Americans have turned a blind eye to such obvious things and still support Bush. The glaring facts are astounding of what has and is happening to our country. When Michael Moore proclaimed at the Oscars that the president had gotten us into "a fictitious war", I did not quite know what he meant....Now I can't believe how ignorant I was. This film is not just telling you why Bush should not be re-elected, its informing you on what we are already in and just how deep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a fan of this film, you need more education. This is a clear attempt of Mr. Moore to edit and cut film to achieve his objectives. And if you believe his nonsense, you need to put down you welfare check and pick up a book or newspaper. Mr. Moore is an architect in his attempt to get uneducated and uninformed people to believe his nonsense. Nice try Mike. Rise above the NONSENSE. Achieve more then Mr. Moore believes you are able. Read the FACTS. Make your OWN opinion. Employing his wry humor and irreverence to promote his left wing agenda, director Michael Moore crusades against President Bush and the War in his latest documentary, Fahrenheit 9/11. Like The Passion of the Christ; the movie sparked controversy in the media before it ever hit theaters. From finding a distributor after Disney dropped it to contesting (and finally accepting) the MPAA's R rating to claims of censorship, this is more than just the release of a movie -- it's a campaign. In his opening and closing sequences, Moore uses footage of Bush and his administration preparing for TV appearances; having makeup applied, their hair combed, etc. If this is supposed to show that Bush is guilty of trying to look presentable to the American public, no one is going to accuse Michael Moore of hypocrisy. But the real purpose is to paint Bush and the War as one big facade. Moore's conclusion is largely argued from fallacious appeals to emotion, sure to fuel Democrats in their battle for the White House and leave those looking for a well reasoned critique of Bush and current events out in the cold. Fahrenheit 9/11 is repetitive, saturated with Moore posing questions in voice-over and cutting to shots of Bush stumbling on answers. Bush has set himself up for this, of course. With all of his struggling for words and thoughtless pauses there is plenty to play with in the editing room. But the approach feels much like a stand-up comedy routine; you have the set up, you have the zinger, then the next one. None of it is well integrated -- some of it self-contradictory -- and Moore offers few answers to the problems he claims America faces. Footage that is meant to lead the viewer to a self-evident conclusion often does not. At times it is misleading or bends the truth. There are appeals to emotion, such as a mother in tears blaming Bush for her son's death or Bush announcing the Iraq invasion inter cut with idyllic shots of children flying kites in Iraq. Soldiers listen to explicit heavy metal music while going into battle, the implications of which are neither explored nor clear. Moore tries to demonstrate that the world is not behind the war by listing only the insignificant countries of the Coalition of the Willing -- while significant countries like the United Kingdom are omitted. Still, Moore presents some interesting facts: the Bin Laden family being allowed to leave the country after 9/11 when all other air traffic was grounded, various intertwining of politics and business, and Bush continuing his grade-school photo op for seven minutes after the second plane hit the World Trade Center. Moore implies that the enemy is not militant Islam or Iraq; it is Bush, an inept and bumbling president who keeps himself in power with his color-coded terror alerts that trick Americans into thinking the nation is at risk of annihilation. The fact that Bush is simultaneously portrayed as a fool and as a master strategist of power is one of Moore's many contradictions. Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn't ask why America was attacked, and it barely acknowledges that 9/11, the worst single attack on America in history, was an act of war . What happened on that date -- and its causes -- are conspicuously absent from Moore's movie. There is not a single frame of the act that is the reason for Moore's movie: passenger planes hijacked by religious fundamentalists crashing into the Twin Towers. But Moore makes sure to display any collateral damage at the hands of Americans. Ultimately, Fahrenheit 9/11 is propaganda for the converted. Just as Christians voted for their faith at the box office with Passion of the Christ, so liberals now have an opportunity to have their ballots counted too. But few minds will be changed. Even the legitimate questions Moore poses are not answered or are overshadowed by his emotional and deceptive tactics. The result is a monotonous smear piece, not an honest opinion, which is why it fails as a documentary. www.CapMag.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Endless Bowling Match.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Controversy is breeding cinematic greatness this year as Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11", along with Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ", pushes the envelope on intelligent and thought-provoking American film-making. This is a documentary feature (I think arguably the finest of all time) that pulls no punches as Moore dives into the George W. Bush administration head-first like a heat-seeking missile with only one objective---find and destroy. Moore started a stir after he won the Best Documentary Feature Oscar for "Bowling for Columbine" in 2002 as he bashed the current White House president in a wild, daring and chaotic speech that sent shockwaves even through Hollywood (not exactly Bush country to start with). "Fahrenheit 9/11" is supposedly a justification to Moore's public views. The movie is a blazing powder keg as an unbelievable amount of research, archive footage and Moore's unchallenged brand of getting in the face of the man and the system the man represents extends throughout the picture's running time. A political nightmare in 2000 took place as the presidential election came down to Florida where wrong-doing and possible voter fraud occurred. Things went from bad to worse as President Bush's excessive vacation time in Crawford, Texas is questioned and then of course that fateful day in September of 2001 changed the nation and the world forever. Fear, in Moore's eyes, dominates the administration as they do their best to keep the general public scared with mixed signals and messages. The thin red line then comes into play as George W. Bush and Tony Blair's role in Iraq becomes skewed with that of Saddam Hussein. Why attack Iraq? What about Osama bin Laden's relatives that fled the U.S. shortly after the New York terrorist attacks? And how did they even get a flight when air transportation was supposedly shut down? Was Iraq the real threat? Can the Taliban even be tracked down? What about Middle Eastern/U.S. affairs with the oil of the world? The questions are not easily answered as Moore paints a portrait of a dizzying web network where nothing is quite as simple or clear as it seems. Is anyone in Washington, D.C. any help? Well they do not even seem able to read bills that are passed. And who suffers? Not the rich and powerful. It is those in places like Flint, Michigan, a place where the poverty rate is staggering and where unemployment is near 50% in some areas. Who takes advantage? Try pesky military recruiters who chase down poor white people and economically down-trodden minorities shamelessly like old time evangelists or medicine men. And as it has always been those with so little fight for those with so much. And is anyone willing to do like the Almighty and sacrifice their own offspring for something they believe in? Moore is not shy at all. The movie does its best to explain and educate all viewers, even those who do not want to hear or see. All angles are covered and all corners swept. Bush's unsuccessful business career gets a glimpse. His closest advisers (Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld and many others) are shown at their very worst through seemingly endless news items. The film gets emotional as Moore finds a middle-class family in his hometown who has suffered the loss of one of their children. Pro-Bush people turn on a dime as the economy and unsubstantiated war force many fence-sitters to re-think their political beliefs. "Fahrenheit 9/11" is an anti-war picture at its finest. I always think back to the 1930 version of "All Quiet on the Western Front" when the primary character (played by Lew Ayres) states that there is no glory in dying for your country. He believes that when your choices are to die with honor or live that the only logical choice is the latter. Moore has very similar outlooks in this day and age of international chaos. This movie could be discussed for days and days and the major points would never be touched upon. Moore, like him or not, is an amazing talent as his visions and the way he executes them are truly something remarkable to behold. To write a critical statement of "Fahrenheit 9/11" does not really do this project justice. It is near impossible to express the brilliance of this important and intelligent movie. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great entertainment ? though it is not a documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all let's get it on paper: Bush weren't the cleverest president the USA has seen. Bush is not the most popular president in the history of the USA (actually he must be the first President to have been elected with minus votes). And the war in Iraq maybe wasn't as just as first thought (let's face it: Saddam didn't have weapons of mass destruction). The 3 point above Michael Moore looks on pretty fine. But after that the documentary just evolves into a hate campaign against George Bush. Between the lines Michael Moore says that George Bush more or less planned or knew of ? which is a lie. Let me present the evidence; let's first go back in history. In the 1970ties president Nixon had to resign because he ordered his people to break into the democrats' headquarters in the Watergate hotel in Washington DC (the so-called Watergate-scandal). It took a single man to bring down Nixon (deep throat). Nixon fell because of a burglary ? then think of it: Bush should, if Michael Moore is right (which he isn't), have planned or known of 9/11. Logically Bush didn't do any of these things, and neither did any the American Government. That would have been exposed very quickly ? THAT IS A FACT. Al Quaida planned 9/11, and Al Quaida planned it alone, that is a fact. If you believe that Bush or some one other in the US-Government planned 9/11 you must logically also believe in UFO's, Bigfoot and that Elvis lives ? that is a fact. Michael Moore insinuates that Bush and Osama Bin Laden worked together: Because CIA helped Al Quaida, Taliban and Osama Bin Laden to beat the Russians in Afghanistan in the 1980ties. Michael Moore does more or less say that because they worked together against the Russians, then they must logically still work together (feel free to laugh at Michael Moore's lack of intelligence). Let me give all you people an historical example that it is a stupid theory: in the star of the Second World War the Russians and Germans worked together: they developed tanks and tactics together at the Russian tank-school at Kazan, Russia. Later they worked together to smash Poland, and do war crimes together. Then suddenly in 1941 Germany attacked Russia, in operation Barberrosa. Germany smashed most of Russia until 1942/43, when the German 6th army was defeated at Stalingrad. Then Russia went on the offensive and destroyed most of Germany until they captured Berlin in 1945. If you believe in the rhetoric of Michael Moore's documentary the Germans and Russians had planned all this. Look how illogically this entire thing about Bush planning 9/11 sounds? It is a lie. Only unintelligent people believe in what Michael Moore says, that is an undeniable fact!! Now that we have proved that Moore is wrong in most of his political bashing against the Bush-administration, let us move on in the film. When he wants to make the political point the US-army is bad and its soldier are stupid, and its leaders stupid he uses a good, and well proved, propaganda technique. He interviews the most stupid American soldiers (and you can see that Moore (or some one else) have made the soldiers say it) and then clips it together with gore footage of blown up, and probably, innocent Iraqi civilians (mostly women and children). With that Moore draws a contrast between the evil and dump US-soldiers and the weak and innocent Iraqis ? Michael would have had a great career in the 1930ties Nazi Germany (his propaganda is very well made). Then he moves on in his bashing of Bush. He interviews some journalist or self claimed expert on Afghanistan. Michael Moore asks him how long it took for the US-army to come to Afghanistan after 9/11 ? it a little under or over a month for the regular army to take over Afghanistan. And then the two men agree that if they were president they would be in Afghanistan within a few hours. In that moment the whole documentary fell apart. Michael Moore reveals that he doesn't know anything about military tactics. The whole strategy about Afghanistan was NOT to just jump right into Afghanistan ? by then getting the whole country against the USA. Secondly it was also a Special Forces war ? THAT IS A FACT. All the Special Forces linked up with the northern alliance (who did fight against the Taliban), to fight the Taliban, and let the Afghans them selves fight and take over the country. Thirdly: it takes time to organize the Army, the Air Force and the Navy to make a strike and invade a country on the other side of the world. Fourthly: it also took time to secure all the diplomacy. Michael Moore ignores all these FACTS deliberately ? he knows that they did all they could to destroy Al Quaida and capture Osama Bin Laden, of course he does. Moore ignores all the evidence just to bash all that Bush stands for. He lies deliberately to discriminate his political adversary (Bush), like Joseph Goebbels did in Germany in the 1930ties. Michael Moore chooses the evidence that fit his theory, and then he ignores all the piles of evidence that speak against his bashing of Bush.But I must say that it is a very entertaining movie ? though it is not a documentary. It is not a documentary ? that is a fact. Fahrenheit 9/11 should not be labelled as a "documentary" but as a funny and political bashing of President Bush.My advice: watch it and laugh, just don't believe in anything it says.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore backs up much of what he says with documented fact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scenes involving George W. Bush's military record and business dealings are backed up with proof on paper in this film. Whether or not you like Bush is decidedly crucial to your support for this film. Moore clearly is no fan of this president and makes his case known without pulling any punches. Moore uses the very freedom that Bush is always pandering to make his points clear and demonstrates that motion picture documentaries can be as entertaining as any work by a talented director working from a manufactured screenplay. If only all reality t.v. was as good as this film, it might be worth a look. Moore is a much needed voice for the left coming across strongly and if you support George W. Bush's views on the freedom he is always selling, then you must defend Moore's right to make a film like this. Anything less would be hypocritical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me tell you that I am a self-proclaimed Liberal Democrat. Bearing that in mind, I am going to try to be as bipartisan as is possible when examining content of this nature. Fahrenheit 9/11 opens with a surreal, yet somehow familiar, image: a Gore victory party. Thus begins part one of Fahrenheit 9/11, which shall be called "Election 2000." Moore presents lots of rarely-seen footage of the congress floor, etc., thus providing a convincing argument that Bush did not, in fact, win Election 2000 legitimately. Part one continues for 30 minutes, setting up the bulk of the film, which shall be called "The Bush Presidency: Parts I and II." It's interesting that Moore devotes 30 minutes to the mere exposition of his film, which has nothing to do with what the Bush administration has done with Dubya in office. However, these 30 minutes set up the idea in the viewer's mind that Bush is an illegitimate president who should never have been in office. The film then begins its opening sequence, which plays on how much of the presidency is just show. While the film is more of a series of arguments against Bush (sort of a film version of his book, "Dude, Where's My Country?"), these arguments are strung together in such a way that anyone who sees this movie loses every shred of doubt that Bush should not be president. The Bush presidency section of the film is divided into two parts: pre-and immediate post-9/ 11, and the War in Iraq, the latter being the most powerful part of the film. The bottom line: this film leaves many indelible images in the viewer's mind ("Most people call you the elite, but I call you my base"), and eliminates any notion that Bush is the right man for the job. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a conservative or liberal and I am definitely not a George Bush fan..can't stand him. He just might be a murderous, profit hungry dictator that this movie makes him out to be..either him or those international money changers pulling his strings.There actually might have been potential here for a real documentary film but this "documentary" is a piece of garbage. It's kinda like one of those political commercials. Those ones where they play the dark sinister music while they talk about candidate B's shortcomings (Bush and neocons), then play the warm-fuzzy, cheerful music when they talk about how good candidate A will be (various "victimized" liberals)..imagine that for 2 hours straight.Michael Moore was, at no point, anything close to objective in this film. He clearly chose to only use subjective sources that would support what he was wanted and then presented them as "fact" with absolutely no exceptions. If anything, I think he turned so many people off, that he probably actually got more votes for Bush in the 2004 election.On a side note, another thing that bothers me with Moore (besides his grotesque lack of physical conditioning) is that he consistently portrays poor minorities as the victims of 'the man' in his films. While seemingly on their side, this is simply passive racism. It appears he wants to be this iconic Bill Clinton type by appearing to understand minorities, yet holds them in disguised contempt. Do you actually think he associates with this crowd in his personal life? He is just another white charlatan trying to feed his own ego.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conspiracy Theory a la Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead! This film is actually better than "Bowling for Columbine", but still a far cry from Moore's debut into the big leagues of American film-making, "Roger and Me." Moore does not hide his biases here, and it is obvious from the get-go that this is a propaganda piece for Moore's personal beliefs. This movie, in essence, was a rallying cry for voters to not re-elect George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential campaign; to this end, Moore presents relevant points about the selfish interests of the Bush family, and how they jeopardize the interests of the American people as a whole. As Moore makes his argument, he does hit on very important points as to the dubious business interests of the Bush administration.Whether one is a conservative or a liberal, one does see the dilemma President Bush dealt with after the September 11 attacks, where he had to juggle his family's ties to Saudi oil families--which includes Osama bin Laden's clan--and his need to prosecute a war against terrorists who are related to those business links. It is possible that it was not easy for Bush to completely sever those links to the Saudi oil families--which date back to his life as a fledgling businessman, and Moore makes the argument that Bush made a very poor choice in placing his business interests before his job as president. A president must make sacrifices, even if that means excluding old friends and colleagues, and Bush clearly was not able to do that. Whether the president was complicit in a conspiracy to line the pockets of his cronies at the expense of homeland security, however, is debatable, and it seems a rather extreme extension of the idea that Bush made a poor decision in continuing his business ties with the Saudis after 9/11. Moore stretches this thesis quite thin, and one need not be blamed for having doubts about Moore's credibility.Moore continues the ideas he espoused in "Bowling for Columbine" when he describes the Homeland Security color-coded warning system as a ploy to create a fearful and gullible American public that would acquiesce to whatever schemes the president had already cooked up. Moore goes to great lengths to argue that the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War were not about fighting terrorists or disarming Saddam Hussein, but merely get-rich-quick schemes for friends of the Bush family. It's one thing to argue that Bush had a difficult time cutting ties to his old business partners when he became president; it's quite another to cast him as a Machiavellian schemer who cares not a whit for the life of the American soldier in his great plan for personal profit. This argument reeks of extreme cynicism, and Moore uses all of the tricks of the movie-making trade to demonize the Bush administration as just another tendril of the great octopus that constitutes the capitalist oligarchy. There may actually be some validity to many of Moore's claims about Bush, but one has to analyze his arguments carefully, and see if the pieces of information he presents add up to a cabal of bourgeois fat-cats who build an empire on the lives of soldiers. Above all else, one must understand Moore's real agenda, and do independent research on the information he presents. On the surface, Moore's whole thesis seems too convoluted to be believable.The movie does do some good in showing the toll of the Iraq War. We see wounded civilians and soldiers, and understand the bitterness of both as they fight a war with rather nebulous motives. An interesting scene includes the worries of a lone Oregon state trooper as he patrols the coastline, lamenting the lack of funds from the federal government to beef up law enforcement in case of a terrorist attack. This was one of the most entertaining and believable scenes in the movie, and it blatantly presents the troubles with regards to funding for the incipient Homeland Security department. As was the case with "Bowling for Columbine," Moore returns to Flint, Michigan, which, as of 2004, was still economically depressed, and where many young people join the army in the midst of crippling unemployment. This seemed like one of the more intimate and heartfelt scenes of the movie, as it at least was tied to Moore's home town.As a whole, the movie presents a radical left-wing perspective of the Bush administration that not all movie goers will find convincing. As with any of Moore's other movies, one must be highly critical of all the information he presents and all the arguments he makes. Still, he ties his loose bits of information into a coherent argument with a large all-encompassing theme, which he could not do with "Bowling for Columbine." This, at least, shows Moore's maturity as a director and polemicist. If Moore is to continue to make polemic movies (which, I suspect, will be his bread-and-butter for years to come), I hope he continues to develop the techniques which have made "Fahrenheit 9/11" one his most coherent movies to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Personal statement &amp; propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All right, most people will say that this is a love-it-or-hate-it film (possibly in line with what your party politics are). I cannot say I either love it or hate it. It's a problematic film in many regards and in other regards it's a triumph.Whaaaat? Let me explain. First of all, it's a gigantic floating propaganda piece. There's no getting around that. Moore himself admitted that he hoped the film would help get W. Bush out of office. You know its motives, so you know going into the film that it will not attempt to be balanced in any way (and you can be sure that it will selectively forget information).But, it does do a few things right. First of all, it does what it wants to do as a propaganda piece very well. It's successful at propaganda (it will never change the minds of the convinced, but will do plenty to help sway the minds of the unconvinced). Why? Because it brings all that Moore has to say about the current administration to the people in a very easily digestible way, complete with pop culture references.The other thing I have to respect about the film is how it does bring many things to the public that isn't and wouldn't be brought to the public in any major format. This includes the casualties of war, up close and personal, not just on the United States side, but on the side of the Iraqi people as well. There are many images in the film that wouldn't get seen otherwise and I think it's important for Americans to see these images. That is what we signed up for when our government decided to head on into war.As I write this, I feel a little bit of anger--but not necessarily towards the current administration, but towards humanity and war in particular. You see, the part of Farenheit 9/11 that got to me had nothing to do with all the conspiracy theories and bumbling about the evil administration, but it was the horrors of war. And war is horrible.But that's beside the point. The film has a lot of problems, especially when it comes to being honest. It leaves out a lot of details. If you're all fired up from the movie, take a little time out to read the following article in Slate. Now Hitchens suffers from a lot of the same confusing rhetoric that Moore himself suffers from, but it's a good counterpoint (in being a anti-"political rant" and having plenty of incomplete thoughts, just like Moore's film). It might cool you down a little.Moore conjures up a lot of contradictions and conspiracy theories that just served to offend my intellect. The part that got to me early on was the insistence of the guilt of the entire family of Bin Ladens. I mean, perhaps they might have some involvement, but we couldn't say for certain that they did and yet Moore likes to hammer home how we let these currently unsuspected individuals get away. Furthermore, he makes a lot of implications about the connection between big business, Saudi oil and the Bush family but none of them are ever validated. Just implied. That doesn't make for a strong argument but Moore just continues on as if his implication was fact.And like Moore's past films, he makes great use of editing. He leaves out details that would detract from his point (see the Hitchens article) and puts in random bits that, out of context, help aid his point (all sorts of quotes of Bush saying the ridiculously stupid things that we all know he tends to say). Not saying that he doesn't have some good points, but it's just not the whole picture.That said, it is a propaganda piece and if I weren't such a level-headed person, I might've been swept up in all the raging chaos that Moore happily puts out. In that regard, Moore does quite a good job. It's a propaganda piece of a very high order and it's light on the fact and heavy on the opinion, but spins it all very well together.The last major problem I had with the film was that it was too long, too confusing and too undisciplined, all characteristic of Moore. I don't mind the stupid antics in front of the camera or the pop culture inflections, but the thing that got to me was that he keeps putting stuff in his films that it doesn't need. He doesn't need the Oregon coast. He doesn't need to spend so much time in Flint. And if you're going to make an implication, get ready to back it up with a harder connection. And dangit, cut some stuff out, it would be far more effective if it were shorter.Of course, perhaps I just wanted an anti-war film instead of a political tract. As a personal statement (which might be just as confused as the filmmaker) and a work of propaganda, it's quite impressive. I'm glad he didn't replay the whole terrible incident of 9/11. It didn't convince me of anything, but I can imagine that it will fire up the minds and hearts of all those whose first bite into knowledge will be in this film. I just wish it didn't have to be done this way. 6/10.Either way, I'll be happy if it gets viewers to think about voting. Now I just hope they get their heads cleared up with some knowledge before they get voting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shame on you, Bush &amp; Co. !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a real masterpiece from Michael Moore that lets you thinking that's not possible but unfortunately it's the reality. The documentary and testimonies show how young US people are thrown away for the iraq (oil) war and all that for nothing and without any reasons!! Shame on you George W. Bush!! What did we learn from the last WWI or WWII??? The facts in this film are really unbelievable but we all have to open our eyes. Mister Bush wants only thing: war. I hope very strong for the moment that president or dictator George W. Bush will not be reelected. It would be a big catastrophe for all the Americans and for all the rest of the world if he should be voted again. Don't get me wrong; I don't want to make politics but after I have all heard and seen about this man I cannot trust him. The story as itself is written perhaps too long. But Mister Moore did a great job with courage. Please, see it and talk about with your friends. My wife and me vote: 6.75/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Democrat, and I believe Bush needs to be removed from office, but I hope I can post a critical, non-partisan look at this film and how it has been fashioned.I just finished watching it. A lot of it was very hard to watch, and it only increased my anger with the Bush administration. That said, I have some criticisms:* Unlike with Bowling for Columbine, Moore does not want viewers of this film to make up their own minds.* Moore doesn't always fight fairly. I thought his portrait of pre-war Iraq was blatantly one-sided. He never mentions once that Iraq was a dictatorship (in fact, he refers to it as a "sovereign nation"), so he loses points for intellectual dishonesty.* He certainly gets a lot of footage out of Lila Lipscomb and her grief over her dead son. I think he overdoes it, and I felt even sorrier for her that her grief was being exploited for this film.* The film is too long; most of the last half-hour should have been cut.* I didn't learn anything new, but then I've been following this administration pretty closely.* I have to say that Michael Moore knows how to make a very persuasive storyand he knows how to push an audience's buttons. This is agitprop of the highest order.Aside from that, I think this film is right on target as far as facts are concerned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the price of freedom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How frightening that 1984 has come to past, yet no-one has stood up to object. The first 5 minutes of the film reminded me of news I had heard before. Yet somehow, its significance had been erased. Modern living, limitless choice, capitalism and to a larger extent, plain human selfishness, are the dulling factors. Why think about such difficult concepts when there are so many delightful distractions? Why energize a single grey cell, let alone a finger, to fight for truth and justice? Mr Moore is my kind of Superman to tackle this uncomfortable subject. And despite the congratulatory voices, I suspect, his life has got a lot more difficult since the film's success. But then that's the price of freedom...the majority enjoys a deceptive freedom only because there are those who had to sacrifice theirs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this movie is Rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this awful piece of trash because it was supposed to have these great battle scenes that compare to "Desert Storm". In a similar Kubrickian twist, I'm equally as disappointed by this Docu as I was by the comparison made between "Fahrenheit 911" and "Bowling for Columbine" (an equally stupid overblown movie). OK, a comparison between thousands of barely armed Iraqi rebels being slaughtered in the hundreds by giant rolling balls of burning hay to fifty American dudes wearing High graded armour is JUST NOT THERE.The problems run deeper. The "Terrorism" theme in this movie is overly simplistic. OK, I'm an idealist, but if a documentary's gonna be anything more than entertaining, if it's gonna have pretensions to being relevant in some way to real life, as this movie does, it better not have no meat on its bones. This movie's theme goes nowhere beyond pure shining heart idealism that nobody could really believe in. IN war, everybody gets dirty. I know that, everybody knows that, but this movie of good guys vs. bad guys is NOT a great movie. It's just not. It's just entertainment, and even on that level it fails because it's too long and the acting of Michael Moore is terrible. Bombzers on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>all documentaries have an agenda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All documentaries have an agenda, and this is obviously the work of a man who passionately believes that America (and the world) deserves a better president than this one. Isn't Michael Moore allowed some beliefs? Isn't he allowed to explain them to us, putting forward evidence, in a film that people choose to pay money to see? Bush and his cronies certainly had a few "beliefs", many of them totally without any supporting evidence (eg Saddam has WMDs, Saddam was involved with 9/11 etc etc). And the result of Bush pushing his beliefs is that tens of thousands of people are dead, and the world is a much more dangerous place for all of us. Oh yes - and a few thousand ultra-rich Americans have become even richer.I took the time to check out some of the websites attempting to refute the arguments and evidence in the film, and this turned out to be quite amusing. Not a good start when it turns out that the homepage of this Kopel guy is covered in NRA stuff - obviously Moore got his goat with "Bowling for Columbine". So the guy has an agenda too. Second thing that struck me was how the writer was wriggling and whining about how - OK, Moore's facts are almost all accurate, but the *impression* he gives is false. Wake Up! The world looks different according to whether you are a gun-toting republican moron in a SUV, or a "liberal".Anyway - great documentary, as partisan and one-sided as it has to be, when it is attempting to redress some of the balance lost when the Whitehouse was stolen from the American people.</fullReview>

Michael Moore takes documentary-style cinematography to a new level with this very well-done movie. The footage isn't kind to George W. Bush, but Dubya should probably thank Michael Moore for not being harder on him. It's obvious from what is presented that Mr. Moore could have told and shown a lot more than he did.

		<shortDescription>"Why do they hate us?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore expropriates the weaponry of the angry rightwing radio host - and employs them in a devastating onslaught against the Bush regime in particular, and American imperialism in general. 9/11 not only exposes the U.S. government for the murderous, hypocritical gangsters that they are, but is also a moving tribute to its many thousands of victims, from the broken mothers of small-town America, to the amputees of Germany's military hospitals, to the rotting corpses of occupied Iraq.Yes, this is a flawed film. In its determination to produce a powerful critique of the Bush regime that is accessible to a wide audience, it is occasionally guilty of tabloid-style excesses. It dumbs down. It plays cheesy music. Even so, these criticisms pale into insignificance when compared to its achievements. Above all, in the present poisonous political atmosphere that prevails in 'with us or against us' Bushite America, its bravery is awe-inspiring. By implication, it is also damns a cowardly Democratic opposition, too fearful to resist the most rightwing American administration of modern times, and too complicit in its crimes.Like all populist films, it boasts an abundance of villains, though sadly has more victims than heroes. In a flare of genius, the towering figures of America's political establishment are portrayed as actors, covered in as much make-up as their rhetoric is with deceit. Those complicit with the executioners who so audaciously stole the 2000 presidential election are not spared. One of the greatest 'scenes' of this masterpiece is when the reviled Michael Moore confronts those Senators who voted for the Iraq war, and asks them to demonstrate their enthusiasm for the invasion by sending their own children to the war-zone. He reveals the corruption of American democracy ? a middle class political establishment that voted to send the children of working-class America into the quagmire of Iraq.In a society that glorifies fictional violence in movies and computer games, and yet censors real violence from the evening news, Moore demands we confront what war really is. In war, the ruling class send their most impoverished workers to their deaths, and yet they face no consequences as a result of their own actions. In war, children's arms are blown off. In war, people are fried in their beds by precision guided missiles. You may well flinch in these scenes, but don't look away, because these are the crimes committed in our names. Why, Moore asks, was this bloody war fought? For human rights? To save civilization from weapons of mass destruction? No, he answers ? this was a war fought for oil, motivated by the greed of a big business looking to carve up the corpse of Iraq. Moore drags these rich vampires out of the secrecy of their back-stage machinations kicking and screaming ? and reveals them as the real rulers of America. This analysis is backed up by the arch-villain (and buffoon) of this epic film ? George Bush, who declares to those he describes as the 'haves and the have-mores': 'Some call you the elite ? I call you my base.' This, from the callous spokesperson of the American regime, his own family knee-deep in business ties with the Saudi Arabian dictatorship, which mysteriously escaped blame for terrorism whilst the nemesis of Islamic fundamentalism, Ba'atheist Iraq, was torn to pieces.This film is electrifying, disturbing, moving and impassioned. It is rightly a call to arms against tyranny, war and oppression. It is plea for the saving of American democracy. In such a polarised society as the US ? a polarisation which produced this film ? it is difficult to know what the result will be. Perhaps it will deepen the resolve of the Left, and merely antagonise the Right, who cry foul against the 'liberal establishment' despite their stranglehold on the American mass media. Hopefully, it will answer that question that has puzzled millions of Americans, particularly since 9/11: 'Why do they hate us?' The answer is, when you bully, bomb and invade impoverished nations in the name of global supremacy and big business, you will reap what you sow. Yet this film also silences the Islamic fundamentalists and the misplaced (but understandable) anti-Americanism of the European Left. It demonstrates that not all Americans are chauvinists bent on world domination, who are brainwashed with reactionary propaganda and supporters of the hated Bush. Millions of them are as angry as we are. That is why Michael Moore is a true American hero, flawed though he is ? a dissident who belongs to the best traditions of American democracy and revolutionary heritage. May he open the floodgates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>... One of the greatest things I've ever seen, and undoubtedly the best documentary ... simply unbelievable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's only been out for less than a month, and already this film has created an uproar the film industry rarely sees. "Fahrenheit 9/11" is writer/director Michael Moore's (he also produces) second megahit documentary. Last time, in "Bowling for Columbine", he examined the gun-associated violence that America seems so addicted to. Now he takes it a few stories higher with this poke at "President" George W. Bush's time as president.NOTE: If you didn't notice, I put "President" in quotation marks because I cannot see why anyone would consider Bush and actual president. I am a Democrat and complete anti-Bush. Anyone who can't stand to see Bush made fun of should stop reading this right now.I walked into "Fahrenheit 9/11" with doubts about a few things. First, I wasn't sure about going to see a documentary in a theater. I live in a small town in an extremely small state, so seeing a documentary at the movies is pretty much a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Second, as much as I completely despise our current so-called "president", I had by doubts about Moore. It sounded to me like he was taking it way too far.When I came out of the theater, I was pretty much speechless, and unfortunately, I still am. The film was unbelievable. I've seen some very fine documentaries, but none compare to this film. Michael Moore is the type of filmmaker than can keep anyone with an open mind (or a Democrat with a closed mind) glued to the screen for as long as he wants. I was completely glued for the entire two hours and two minutes. Moore has the footage, and explains the events to us in a way that any dimwit can understand. He can be witty and hilarious, and yet also make us extremely thoughtful. To add to this, he throws in a soundtrack that will sometimes make you laugh out loud at the irony of some of these songs."Fahrenheit 9/11" is one of the greatest things I've ever seen, and undoubtedly the best documentary. Sometimes funny, sometimes tear-jerking, and always thought-provoking, Michael Moore has made a masterpiece that is simply unbelievable.FAHRENHEIT 9/11 by Michael Moore. **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a bear of a guy who with his scruffy face and ball cap has the marvelous ability to get in people's faces without offending them. The class struggle message that is given in Roger and Me and Bowling for Columbine, is brought home even stronger in F9-11. The black-outs, the cartoons, the implications, the strong evidence and old-boy networks, the portrayal of George H.W. and his son, George W., as the center pins of these vast money-networks is masterful. You can accuse Michael Moore of being a muck-raker, a potty-stirrer, a cynic, an America-hater or some other unpleasant name but you cannot deny that he is an excellent film maker and that he does his homework. His recruitment efforts with the congressmen was a master stroke and the looks on their faces when they realize this is not a photo op is worth the price of admission in and of themselves. I was impressed how it starts with the purloined 2000 election and then builds up to the network connections. However, Michael's musings on George W.'s reaction in the school room are less convincing: Bush's face reveals real shock. The disengaged, lost expression is not necessarily one of a man worried about having to cover his trail but one who is absolutely in compete shock. The contrasts of Bush with the more insidious Cheney, our not-so beloved Veep, are likewise striking. The ne'er-do well son who was spoiled by his mother, who messed everything business opportunity he was endowed with and is constantly bailed out by Daddy's pals winds up being president. He is not leadership nor is he shown to be the buffoon or village idiot that most Liberals prefer to cast him as-- he is a caricature of the devious, conniving, power-hungry plutocrat that his vice-president really is. Bush comes off not as a stupid bungler but as one who is being skillfully manipulated by a much more egregious pilot, his own underling, Cheney.Moore is very carefully not to make the mistake of past liberal follies who attack wartime efforts. Jane Fonda will never be allowed to forget her moment of foolishness, sitting in a gun mount in Hanoi, thus earning forever the nickname, Hanoi Jane." Moore avoids this black splash by clearing sympathizing with the troops and young people being pulled into a fracas this clearly not of their making.There's little doubt there's a slant to this message. The bias is set from the get-go but it's well done and the argument build on the evidence is damned hard to overlook. True, he does get on a soap box for a few instances but the oil-deal networks, the tell-tale military records and the contradicting public declarations rather speak for themselves.It's very interesting to note that I attended a late showing that was quite well attended by obviously working-class people who clapped enthusiastically at the film's conclusion.Bravo, Michael. Don't let up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This, unsurprisingly, is the most political film I have ever seen. I was expecting a intelligent and honest tale of reasons why Bush is a bad man (the sentiment I won't cover here but I think any intelligent person will reach the same conclusion). After a while and after several notable missing facts (like the UK was in the collision, not a small fact) and also the stretched use of context I started feeling the same as when I listen to some shows on Air America, this is a purely one sided picture.This is not so much a documentary as a political broadcast for the democrats. Now it is clear Moore would love Bush to be removed from his current position, something that the majority of the western world supports, what I disagree with is the not so subtle way that Moore is using this film to attempt to do that. The degree of omission, of sarcastic voice overs and over playing of emotional cards (the distraught mother), the often very thin connections and use of sympathy figures appear not to be aimed at those who could fall for bushes war of fear. In short this film is not a documentary, it's too biased and too opinionated to fit into that category from my perspective. This is a political film made by angry people to try and change things. The aim may or may not be mobile but as a result as a film it really does suffer and from a British perspective this film is as subtle as a 'Bush is an Idiot' T-shirt. Six out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Switzerland Reacts (Shock)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I live in a french-speaking part of Switzerland, a country stifled by a growing sense of it's own irrelevance, coupled with a small-town fear of anything from outside it's own borders. Twenty years ago Switzerland was Utopia, now it's just a washed-up backwater railing against the European Union and foreigners, increasingly fueled by sub-Nazi nationalist hysteria - just today the main headline in the regional tabloid centered on gypsy camps causing chaos.So for a Swiss theater to be moved to the point of spontaneous applause by a foreign film, especially an American one (American money is fine, but Americans can only come here if they respect the Swiss and pick their litter up), is a matter to be recorded.The film itself, well, I will keep it straight. This non-documentary, political commentary has a lot going for it. Moore is on good form, the story he has to tell is grippingly delivered in a supermarket tabloid kind of way and the facts that he has to report are damning indeed. Nobody can walk away from this without thinking about where the once mighty Empire is going. Somebody else in one of the reviews drew a parallel with Rome, I quite agree. The streets are not burning yet but it is on it's way.The story to me hit home in that particular area - namely the the "haves, and the have mores" as George W. Bush put it himself, and the rest of the population who are dangerously cut off from so many things, school, jobs, college, a future. One day they will rise.The rest of the movie, the amusing montages, the often overdone sentimental sequences, lack focus because they lack counterpoints. Moore is never one to let journalistic balance get in the way of a good story and here it is a drawback. Happily enough he does pull off one excellent sequence, the 9/11 playback against a black screen. Just the noises of pain, horror and shock.But the film does deserve to be piped into every American home and force fed to every last citizen, preferably through the network of Fox News.7 out of 10</fullReview>

A clear signal that the gravity of the situation requires real action from anyone who cares. The world needs to have leaders who can deal effectively with the major challenges that are threatening our planet (global ecological threats, major wars, massive shifts of jobs to other continents, etc.) and not make them even worse, and that's exactly what Bush did (Kyoto, beginning trade wars, instability in the Middle East, etc.). But the solution is not as simple as to just eliminate W from the equation. The whole political and economical structure of the US (and for that matter most Western societies) needs to be rethought, starting with asking ourselves what our true values and ethical standards are. This is no easy task and that is why as many citizens as possible need to mobilise and revolt against the rotten apple and make it healthy again.This film has incredible merit as being the first of a new generation of political pamphlets but it should've seized the opportunity to step up to the plate and take a head spot in the March against the White House. If we don't act against this administration now, we will allow this way of running the US (and effectively the world) to become normal and thus allow our societies to evolve towards corrupt fascist dictatorships.'What luck for the rulers that men don't think.' ?

		<fullReview>I was in a state of shock for almost the entire movie.. in 5 minutes of film I had felt angry, I had laughed, I had been utterly shocked and I had grieved for all of the injured, the dead, the innocent victims of the Bush Administration. I always knew the so called 'Free World' was full of crooked, money hungry suits but I had no idea that the Almighty dollar had become quite this Almighty. I had a co-worker about 2 years ago from Pakistan, a VERY well mannered, well spoken but shy kid who was a devout Muslim and even spent extra time teaching me about islam. When he and I first met and had started talking as friends while at work he told be about a pipeline, and that this pipeline was going to mean a lot of money for a lot of high up people... and I had never heard anything about this before... I knew Bush was into oil, there is oil in this province and the running joke around here is that once Bush catches on he'll be coming up to do a little regime change north of the border. I had no idea the depth of the situation in the middle east until I saw this movie. when they mentioned about the pipeline I was like "Oh my God he was right" It is truly eye opening to see how one sided the media coverage of 'The War on Terrorism' has truly been. The times are indeed changing.. they're absolutely right.. we aren't safe, and it's a bed that's been made for us by the very people we trust to ensure our way of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I make no apologies for my politics or for the fact that I think Michael Moore is a genius. He shows us the unsanitized aspects of the war that some people would rather keep hidden (charred bodies hanging from the bridge, screaming and suffering Iraqi civilians, our own soldiers revelling in the destruction they've inflicted) and raises some serious questions about where "our" president's loyalties lie and to whom the administration is beholden (it ain't us!) Now, having said that, I am aware that Mr. Moore is a master of the insinuation and perhaps false impression-without uttering a false word-but then again, the footage speaks for itself. When George Bush stands there and smugly tells the outrageously wealthy white-tie audience, "You're my base" he is simply revealing himself for what he is and what he cares about, and he needed no embellishment from Michael Moore. It is what it is, folks. No matter what else you may think he is-activist, traitor, whatever-Michael Moore is a superb storyteller who has shown a lot of growth as a filmmaker and entertainer. Give 'em hell, Mike!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much information for one movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time it ended, I thought my head would explode trying to keep straight the massive amount of "new" information that was presented. Combined with the emotional roller coaster that this movie is, I don't believe I've absorbed half of what was presented. I'll certainly have to see it again, at least once more, to properly assimilate and absorb it all.The sad truth of the matter is that so much of the information in the movie is news to me. The point is well made that the media has, at the very least, been lax in doing it's job to keep us informed. At the very worst, one might believe that there is no longer a free press in America. It brought to mind the lessons I learned about the press in Germany before WWII. The images of the dead, the injured and the dieing in Iraq, coupled with direct evidence of the deceit on the part of the administration that led to this war, was devastating. One might try to blow it all off as propaganda, but how to dismiss actual footage of Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell both emphatically saying that we KNOW Saddam Hussein does not have Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)one day, and the exact opposite another? How can one conclude anything less than deceit?But the image that will not leave my mind is that of the President picking up a child's book and beginning to read it after being told of the second plane hitting the World Trade Center on 9/11, that our nation was under attack. Never mind Michael Moore's conclusions - you have to wonder, "What was Bush thinking?" Knowing how I reacted to that event, how the people around me responded, how people all across America and even around the world reacted - with horror, concern and an urgent, burning desire to do something - it's unbelievable that the President of the United States chose to pick up a children's book and attempt to continue with his photo-op. Yet we have actual footage of that very thing happening. For everyone who did not vote for Bush, this movie is horrible evidence that their worst nightmare has come true. For anyone who did vote for Bush, let me just remind you of the old saying he tries so hard to remember in Fahrenheit 9/11. . . "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me." See this movie. If there are errors, point them out. If you disagree with Michael Moore's conclusions, develop your own. If it confuses you, read, learn, find out the truth, but SEE THIS MOVIE.</fullReview>

I found myself laughing because it was so comical, but after a while, I realized I was laughing at reality and this upset me. This war is really tragic and horrible to so many American families. I think the troops over in Iraq are heroes. I think that if our legislators are in favor of war, they should be prepared to send their own sons and daughters.

His critics say the film is full of lies but I'm not sure what statements they target. I am a news hound and am very well informed but didn't have anything glare at me as inaccurate. I'm sure there could be a few small inaccuracies but certainly nothing huge.Please consider that only the American people are divided on this man, the rest of the world detests him. In fact he is actually the most hated man on earth. No surprise there. While our only ally in the war appeared to be the British, the reality was that Tony Blair support Bush and NOT the British people, they were and are overwhelmingly against Bush and the war. Fox News ("Fair and Balanced" - yeah right)is calling the French and now the BBC traitors, cowards and whatever else because they bash Bush. Wise up Fox, the whole planet hates Bush and for very good reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conservatives can't question Moore's facts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No logical person can argue against the vast majority of the questions Moore raises in the film. However, as usual the right can only attempt to write off the film as a personal attack on Bush or an attack on the presidency. I guess the right has forgotten that criticizing a leader when they do a poor job, is the right thing to do and obligation of any intelligent citizen. I'm so tired of the refusal of our society to sit and think about the facts.Everyone seems to form an opinion just because they believe in a certain political ideology. Before walking out of the movie or bashing it, have glimmer of an answer to the important issues Moore raises. Not because you are a democrat of a republican, but because I think WE MADE A MISTAKE TRUSTING GEORGE BUSH AND WE SHOULD REALIZE THAT FACT AND QUIT TRYING TO HIDE BEHIND OTHER AGENDAS!!!!! This was a great movie because it brought up all the uncomfortable things we are responsible for by going along with this administration. At a minimum we ignored the fact the vast majority of the civilized world told us this war was wrong long before we surprisingly "found out" there were no WMD's but we were too incompetent to know what even the smallest and poorest countries of the world knew. In all honesty we all strongly suspect something else motivated our government and we still aren't quite sure what it was. Moore gives the best explanation to date, we just don't want to admit our leader lied and cheated us out of BILLIONS for the benefit of the "haves and the have mores." Argue the facts, not if Moore likes Bush, or you like Bush, or you like conservatives or liberals. I went out and bought Dude, where's my country and it gave much more detail and references Moore's claims. If you want to discredit the movie, attempt to discredit the references for all the factual things that prove our leader not only made mistakes, but used us. Moore editorialized. Our media editorialized when they didn't chase down half of glaringly hypocritical acts of our leader. In fact I saw much of the content of this movie on a Canadian "60 minutes" equivalent well over a year ago. I still wonder why none of our new networks picked up the story. I guess it all boils down to the fact that those who research the facts and love their country are going to have to side with Moore. Those who may still love their country, but speak out of ignorance will side with Bush.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit it, with me, Michael Moore was preaching to the converted. I've got all his books and seen all his movies. I've read more than a few anti-Bush books. So was I surprised? YES. I was moved to tears and shocked by images of war that we never see in film or TV. The political trail of tears that Moore tracks is not a new one to a lot of people, but he shows it comprehensively, and here's another shocker: with RESTRAINT. The peoplecomplaining about the facts as they appear in this truly great documentary should be grateful that he doesn't hit us with a far bigger sledgehammer, which he really could have. He presents the facts and just when he can go in for the kill, he more often than not, backs off and lets the viewer complete the thought. Being told of the content vs. seeing it are two completely different experiences, though. If you've already HEARD about Bush's "thousand-yard stare" in the seven minutes after being told that the second Twin Tower had been hit by a plane, you haven't SEEN it: It's perhaps the most chilling thing in the whole film - and that's saying a lot. I understand that people are passionately split in this country, and I understand why a lot of people hate Michael Moore. But I must say, those who gave this film a "1" in this forum almost certainly voted without seeing it. I defy the most rabid Republican to see this film and give it a "1". And to those who voted "1" and did not see it: Make your vote count. Go see it now. And then see if you still hate it. Seriously. You owe it to the rest of the imdb voters, but more importantly: you owe it to yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*perchance might contain spoilers* Yes, see this movie, if anything to tweek off the armor chestplated, shrieking and spasmodic GOP types, who declare Hades and damnation upon all whose eyes fall upon this motion picture. Michael Moore has hewed together an interesting, spell binding and slam bang salute to democracy with this heavy fall out documentary. If IL' daddy, the 41st President (papa of the current Bush) had to shimmy down the pole from the ivory tower to personally attack Moore, calling him: "...A slimeball...", then you know, this is a must see of a pic. If he had just blown it off with the wave of a hand, then most of us "proles" (i.e. dirty blue collared types) wouldn't have bothered, I think. Moore mixes together in montage and audio a deeply probing relationship between the Bush clan, American defense and intelligence communities and those happy-go-lucky Saudi folks, for whom lots o' cash has been passed around. Moore's wry (and I do mean as wry as a Saharin desert) commentary, combine with words captured straight from the horses mouth, after a fashion, make for an informative and compelling saga from start to finish. I think you'll laugh (as I did), get uneasy over the moribund foreign affairs (as I did) and take a long, long second look at our current President (as I know I sure did and will do with my vote come next ballot can collecting). This is heavy stuff, and will make you think long and hard. Yes, you might even shed a tear or two, yet the choice is clearly up to your own mind. Yes, you can dismiss this as Anti-American pap or you can shake the pom-poms of democracy; either way, you are thinking for yourself (hopefully), without some obnoxious soundbite doing it for you. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't just look at this film as anti-Bush--which it certainly is. The point here is that someone has stepped up for humanity. Moore makes a number of points--in an entertaining fashion--that forces us to at least consider what's transpired in this country over the past four years. Moore's main points are: 1/ the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are joined at the hip because of money 2/ the Administration's post 9-11/anti-terrorist campaign plays on scaring the American public 3/ the war in Iraq was a put-up job 4/ It wasn't just the White House but also Congress and Big Media who got swept up in the "whee, we're going to war" excitement 5/ The decision to invade Iraq put our armed forces in harm's way--unnecessarily 6/ Less fortunate people in our society wind up suffering the most in wartime Enough of the term paper points. Moore handles all this with news clips--some pretty shocking, Dragnet bits, good music and a tone that carries a very simple theme--does any of this seem fair? If Bush comes off like a clown, then when addressing a dinner of fat cats, he might try avoiding statements like, "Some call you the elite. I call you my base." The spirit of the 60's lives and his name is Michael Moore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those who dismiss Michael Moore's film making as grandstanding for his own beliefs are half right. He is using the documentary format to push is own thoughts, feelings, and agendas forward, but that is what a filmmaker does.As for grandstanding, not so much. In fact, once Fahrenheit finishes its anti-Bush ideas, facts and footage (to great comical effect) the heart of the story is exposed.Moore lets it all hang out with those who are stuck in the crossfire of war. American soldiers who are at first seen going in with gung-ho enthusiasm drift into a haze of blood-shed and confusion of what is worth fighting for. American families at home watch TV news reports praying not to hear the name of a loved one. People of Iraq plead with soldiers and God for the U.S. to leave their homeland so that some peace can be gained and loved ones buried.And then there is Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan. All his previous films touch on the small town that could be any 'small town USA'. Here we meet a woman whose son is overseas fighting in the war in Iraq. We see her hang the American flag with dignity and pride outside her house. As time passes and tragedy strikes we see her views change. Fahrenheit 9/11 is being called an attack on President Bush's agenda in the Middle East, but it should also be noted that it is an attack on war itself.Low Point: The 'was it all a dream?' sequence that drudges up the 2000 presidential election. A low point in our country's history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is the definitive American Patriot. With this movie Moore states unabashedly his views on the most pressing subjects of our day. The coup of the American Presidency, the duplicity of both parties in this action and the resulting actions of a criminal administration that has led the American people like sheep down the path to war,death and a state of perpetual fear. In this sometimes funny,sometimes chilling and often sad movie Moore's counterbalance to the continual propaganda and outright deceptions of the Bush administration is presented in a most effective manner. This is no discussion of points of view, this is a presentation of events as seen by Michael Moore. I for one am appreciative of this work, and greatly enjoy seeing the right wing extremists that have taken over the American Government and are now trying to do the same to the world squirm a little as they send our boys off to die and stand guard over their prized oil wells as they negotiate for business in the garden nation of Iraq and beyond. I must remind all Americans that it is not a right, but a duty to speak up against tyranny. Moore is a great American because he is among the few that recognizes the long term destruction that the Bush administration is doing to the American ideals. Moore is doing double duty in this regard.</fullReview>

Perhaps he should go back in time to Old England and serve a king in a world where having an opinion was a travesty. It's freedoms like our ability to question governmental decisions like Mr. Bush's that makes our country great. Not our military might or loud mouth uninformed citizens like shadow. This is an insightful film that reveals truths that most conservatives would rather sweep under the mat. At times Mr. Moore pushes past the realm of documentary, but instead of documenting, Mr. Moore is a columnist, a commentator on the American situation -- something that is sadly real. If we all followed Shadow's advice, closed our eyes to any truths and simply did as our government was told -- we'd be living behind that wall that Mr. Reagan demanded be torn down all those years ago. I for one am a happy citizen that I have the right to create material that questions my government, no matter what the international climate and perhaps even more so in a time where we're living in a world so unstable.

I have seen people post things about this film being treason and it has amazed me. For someone to be so lost in the responsibilities of a citizen of the US to criticize someone for trying to make this country a better place is sickening. Shadow1995 is a prime example of this, read his posts and you will be amazed. The role of the US citizen is to question the government in order to make it better. WE as a nation should respect Michael Moore's attempt at doing just this and checking the government. His methods are not always great but his intentions are good and for this he is a better citizen than many of us. The American government is flawed and the leaders are as well.

		<shortDescription>Guerilla Documentary Filmmaking 101</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Moore has become one of the best known guerilla documentary filmmakers of this time. Currently, his name and antics are pretty much well known and his films has put quite a bit of change in his pocket. (I see the USA Show '60 Minutes' in his future!) Does this take the heart out of being a documentary filmmaker? Does this skew his perception? Does it push an agenda? Yes and No. And because that is what it is, that's what makes him a captivating documentary filmmaker.It took a lot of guts to go against the grain and do a documentary on a USA sitting President who wasn't involved in a sex scandal. I mean, that would be more entertaining -- wouldn't it? Well, what the USA has now is a sitting President that can't fall back on that, but one who has much of the country questioning everything about him -- his decisions, his administration, everything except sex. This movie starts at the alleged defining moment of George W. Bush's Presidency, the 9/11 Disaster, and tries to make George W. Bush's subsequent actions make sense of it all.Moore is doing what he does best. Laying it out warts and all. I know the supporters of George W. Bush, et al will be upset at the portrayals, I would imagine just as the supporters of Bill Clinton were when they discovered he lied about his sexual encounters. I for one, don't see Moore as liberal or conservative. In his films he hasn't been kind to neither USA Democrat or Republican. He IS issue oriented and George W. Bush is the issue here.If you're open minded, you'll love this piece of work for what it is -- It is, fine documentary work. If you are a die hard, "Bush never did any wrong" kinda person, stay clear away from this film. You'll hate it. You'll think the "liberals" are coming to get ya, and ruin the moral fiber of the USA. That's sad because I think everyone should see this film and agree on one thing: The world is in trouble and if we don't face facts and make positive changes soon, game over.From 'Roger and Me' up to this one, that message is as clear as day. I am looking forward to his next documentary of the Health Care System.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most dishonest piece of trash I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happen to be in the oil business, and all the rubbish that Moore spouts about how that business works is just that -- rubbish.He is shocked -- just shocked -- that there is actually a connection between Americans in the oil business and Saudis in the oil business.If he knew anything about that business, he would realize how silly he is being.Americans were the ones who discovered oil in the Middle East, told the Arabs how to get it out of the ground, and then provided the technology needed to do so.We have never failed to pay for a single drop of oil that we have gotten from the Middle East (not that we get that much; most of our foreign oil comes from Canada, Mexico and Venezuela.) The Arabs (and Persians in Iran) are still heavily dependent on American know-how in order to efficiently find and produce the oil that they sell.In fact, they are so incapable of doing much of anything themselves that Iraq -- for instance -- has no refineries and has to ship all of its oil abroad in order to get it turned into gasoline before it is shipped back to Iraq for use by Iraqi drivers.So when people scream about how "corrupt" it is that American companies like Halliburton or Bechtel are involved in oil exploration and production in the Middle East, it is clear that they have failed to educate themselves.There are only three companies that I am aware that are capable of pulling off really big energy infrastructure projects in the Middle East: Halliburton, Bechtel and Bin Laden Group.My own small California-based natural gas exploration and production company depends on a handful of key companies without whom we could not function. Halliburton is one of them. Does that make me a buddy of Dick Cheney? I've never even met the man.And if anyone remembers the end of the first Gulf War when Saddam Hussein torched Kuwait's oil wells, those who were paying attention will remember that there was just one small company that was qualified to safely put out those raging oil well fires.That company was an American company.You would think that the liberals and environmentalists (of which I trust Moore is one) would award a gold medal to a company that, at great risk to its employees' life and limb, stopped an ecological disaster in its tracks.But no.It is so obvious that Moore's agenda is to portray oil companies, big business, Republicans, Christians, white people, Western Civilization, etc., as The Great Satan, and everyone else as the poor little victims of said Great Satan.Thus, as someone else pointed out here, Moore says nothing about how evil Saddam Hussein was to his own people.He couldn't care less about Israeli men, women and children being blown up by Palestinian suicide bombers.Oil just dropped from $140 a barrel to $70. When it was $140, the liberals and Democrats screamed about price fixing by Big Oil.Well, if they are right that the oil companies run the world, why did the price come down? Um. Er. Never mind.Another amusing but pathetic example of left-wing distortion is the periodic raging by liberals and Democrats about Iraqi oil not paying for the Iraq war.Well, let's see.12 years of UN sanctions and Saddam Hussein diverting what little money Iraq got for its oil into building palaces and buying weapons instead of exploring for new oil and maintaining Iraq's oil infrastructure left Iraq's oil industry a big mess that will take years to fix.And that mess hasn't been helped by the constant attacks on oil infrastructure during the U.S. occupation by disgruntled Sunnis and Al Qaeda-related terrorists.But why concern oneself with such details when all one has to do is say "Bush = Big Oil = Saudis = Bin Laden = 9/11 = AmeriKKKa = rich Republicans = Great Satan?"By the way, for those who believe that the rich do not pay their fair share in taxes, here are the facts: The IRS will be happy to tell you that -- even after the Bush tax cuts -- the top 5% of income-earners pay over a third of all federal income taxes collected, the top 10% pay over half, and the bottom third pay practically nothing while benefiting from all of the goods and services paid for by the rich (who also give generously to charity.) Moore and his left-wing cabal (and I include Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid here) want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.But that goose won't wait around to be killed.The rich -- who risk their capital to create companies that create jobs for Americans and generate the wealth that is taxed and transferred to the needy -- will simply leave this country, taking their companies, jobs and money with them.What a sorry pass we have come to as a culture and a nation that so many supposedly intelligent and well-informed people take "Fahrenheit 9/11" seriously.The sixties left-wing radicals whose Communist revolution failed have taken over the media, the universities, the music industry, the fine arts establishment and Hollywood. We are doomed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>seen in 2008</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a review written in Aug. 2008 to see how it has stood up. A few obvious things stand out. The first is that this is not a documentary, if a documentary is something that documents reality. This is a propaganda piece for the left. The second obvious thing is the method. The method is to present assumptions as the truth and move quickly on. This is a propaganda technique that is particularly effective in film, TV and radio, because you are quickly on to the next thing and there is no time to pause to reflect. If this film had been presented in print with pictures and text, the reader might stop and say to him/herself, "Let me think this over. He just showed me pictures of Bush looking and saying a bunch of stupid things, then he showed me pictures of some radicals looking harmless and pleasant. He might be picking the worst of Bush and the best of the radicals. He just talked about the cutbacks for State police as if it were the fault of Bush. But if this is State police what has this to do with the Federal government? He seems to be biased and this is not conclusive data." Also these media are much better that printed media at projecting emotion. See a woman cry over her lost son and there is no way you can be unaffected. Emotion is not something that should be disregarded. We are all emotional beings, but when it becomes the only governing element, when reason is excluded, then it becomes dangerous and a tool of propaganda. Moore is not the first to use these techniques. Probably the first was D. W. Griffith in "The Birth of a Nation." Moore owes more to Griffith then he would probably like to acknowledge.The film may masterpiece of propaganda, but does he make any real points? Most of what he presents is innuendo, supposition, and only half the story, but he does make some valid points. He asks the question why the Ben Laden family was allowed to leave the U S without being questioned. That is a good one. He also criticizes Bush for 7 minutes of inaction after he was informed that the US was under attack. Although 7 minutes is not a long time, it does seem to be a weakness in leadership.That is the historical significance of this film? Moore's film was timed to attack the Bush re-election campaign. He didn't succeed, Bush got elected by a significant majority. I recall a Democratic commentator writing a column after the election titled "The People Have Spoken - the Bastards." However, Moore did succeed in energizing the left and the successful attack on Bush and the Republicans after the election took its lead from this film. Is Moore now vindicated? His main points: 1. Bush stole the 2000 election 2. He is somehow connected and protecting the Saudis and the Ben Laden family. 3. He used the attack to create an atmosphere of fear which would get him elected in 04 4. He went into Iraq for no reason unless it was to create that atmosphere of fear in order to get re-elected. 1. Even when the film was released there was an answer to this. On Nov 12, 2001 the New York Times (not a fan of Bush) published an article called "Study of Disputed Florida Ballots Finds Justices Did Not Cast the Deciding Vote" (available on line). An independent Consortium of the Press had conducted a Florida recount. Bush still would have won if the recount Gore wanted had been done. But statewide, there were approximately 300,000 votes that were not counted because they were dimpled or because the voter had voted for two candidates. Using different standards of evaluating these votes, Gore would have won or Bush would have won - all by less than 500 votes. With 300,000 votes that are unable to be determined and victory margins of less that four or five thousandths of one percent, there is no real conclusion possible. We will never know what the result true result would have been. However, this data was available to Michael Moore and he chose to paint the situation in a much different light. Clearly a bias and distortion of the truth. The same failing that he accuses Bush of having.2. No resolution on this one either. We can guess and conjecture on this but there is no hard evidence other than allowing the Saudis and the Ben Laden family to leave, and there may be explanations for that, such as attempting to establish a much needed friendly state in the Middle East to combat the terrorists.3. Again no resolution, no real evidence of intent or not. 4. As reported by one disaffected Bush staffer, the Bush administration pressured the CIA to come up with evidence of weapons of mass destruction. They did, and it was not correct. The staffer's data has not been verified but assuming it is true, this does not absolve the CIA of giving the government false or poorly documented information. Since that time, there has been evidence found of chemical weapons of mass destruction and nuclear programs, however, the evidence is that they did exist at one time but were removed. There is also satellite evidence of caravans going from these sites to Syria just before the attack. Are these weapons now in Syria? Again it is inconclusive.So the vindication is not there for Michael, but neither is it there for Bush. Perhaps the real lesson from watching this film in 2008 is in how much of a shadow game politics really is; how little is definite and how much is propaganda - on both sides.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie that should not be taken seriously.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I am a Conservative and I still support President Bush. Most people do not understand why I even saw this movie. Well first I believe in being open minded and I am very open minded to opposing views. I look at both sides before I make my opinion. Second I thought Bowling for Columbine was a great movie so I figured why not see this.Michael Moore desperately tries to pass this off as fact when the truth is it is not fact. In fact the truth is Michael Moore more times then not draws his own conclusion. This is very apparent when it comes to the economy, NCLB, the tax cuts etc. The truth is the economy is in good shape two years later, funding for education is rapidly increasing, the Bush tax cuts were not for the rich and the jobs being made are not low paying jobs most are decent paying jobs. Moore then tries to say Bush lied about Iraq. Now there is actually a lot of evidence to support this and a lot of evidence to support Bush I guess it depends on where you stand. I am not going to say what I think because I think we should investigate the matter. I believe Americans deserve the truth. Moore also tries to say Bush spends more time on vacation then he does working. The fact is Bush can work outside of Washington. I mean honestly do you think this country can afford to have our commander and chief take a month long vacation? NO. Chances are he was working more times then he was relaxing. He probably did vacation a little but worked more times then not. Moore also tries to say Bush did nothing moments after 9/11 and then tries to say Bush was reading the book backwards. Both are lies and have been proved to be lies by witnesses who were there that day. Moore also tries to pin all of 9/11 on Bush. I am not saying Bush is not to blame but as Dick Morris said eight months of Bush doing nothing pales in comparison to eight years of Clinton doing nothing. Moore also tries to say Bush is failing the War on Terror. Yes Bush could probably do more to find OBL but we are currently involved in two fronts in this War on Terror. Iraq and Afghanistan. Iraq is naturally where we are diverting most of our attention to currently but are still fighting terrorists in Afghanistan as well. Moore also tries to say that Saddam had absolutely no ties to Al Qaeda. The truth is Saddam had some ties to Al Qaeda he did not have a huge relationship but the admin. never really said that. Saddam did however have extensive ties to other terrorist oganizations in the Middle East. So really either way the War on Terror has been and always was part of the War on Terror. Bush is doing exactly what he said he was going to do after 9/11. I guess Democrats and Michael Moore simply forget what Bush said.The fact is this is a decent movie that should not be taken seriously. Do the research.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, absolutely a great documentary movie. At the beginning funny, to the end sad...because it is just sad towards where the mankind is heading.I think that from a more global perspective it is like this: You have a free market system (capitalism) on one side and democracy as a framework for actions, decision making and governing.THE PROBLEM: 1. Capitalism supporting individualism in which free individuals are maximizing their benefits and thus not caring about maximization of other peoples benefits.2. Democracy with its basic idea of making decisions in favor of most of the people (majority) and thus not caring about maximizing benefits of particular individuals.So, by nature of both systems, it is clear they are contradictory. The politicians (people who are supposed to serve to the rest of the population) in democracy are meant to make decisions in favor of majority. But in the conditions of free market economy they don't care about decisions beneficial to others than THEM. Well, there is some other thing to be considered - politicians try to get elected for the next term - and thus try to act like they are doing decisions in favor of majority of the people.So putting together free market economy and democracy could just not work fairly for the majority of the people. But there has not been "invented" a more fair and appropriate political and economic system that would actually work.P.S.: Russia and Eastern Europe is a perfect example what happens if free market economy is understood as anarchy market economy and democracy is understood only as "moneycracy".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly appalling indictment of a President who will eventually be impeached</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this movie, I read both "Stupid White Men" and "Dude, Where's My Country" so I thought I knew what to expect. Much of the content of this film comes from those two books and is a savage indictment of George W Bush and of the cronies and other corporate crooks in his administration. Coming from where I do, it is almost inconceivable that so many people in positions of power can be allowed to wield that power in the administration in ways that can so obviously be self-serving.Commencing with the manner in which the election result of 2000 was stolen by Bush Co and progressing from there to corporate crime, to lies and deceit about the reasons for waging a false and dishonest war in Iraq, this film is relentless in its pursuit of Bush and what he has done to the American people and to the rest of the world in the last four years.The part of the film which I personally found most distressing were the images of the poor people of Iraq who are made to suffer because of the lies that Bush Co told the world in the period leading up to the invasion. My country is a member of the so-called "Coalition of the Willing" but I am here to tell you that 70 per cent of Australians were opposed to an invasion of Iraq, perhaps because we were sceptical of the lies we were told about WMDs and the need to free the people (and not the real reason, the oil) in Iraq.The personal toll on the Iraqi people which has resulted from the invasion is graphically and tragically captured in Michael Moore's wonderful film and that alone should be enough to make any feeling human being question the wisdom of being there. God knows how many innocent Iraqi citizens have been killed and injured since the invasion began. I hate to think.It is also tragic that the number of Western troops killed and injured grows by the day. However, the mounting death and injury toll of US troops might eventually rouse the American people to demand action to force the administration in Washington to get the Hell out of Iraq. It worked (eventually) in Vietnam and, make no mistake, Iraq will become another Vietnam, involving the US in a long, ferocious and ultimately unwinable war. Hopefully, somewhere along the line the Australian Government will come to the necessary conclusion and withdraw our troops from Iraq sooner rather than later - yes, Australia has troops there too.I give this film 9 out of 10 for its uncompromising illustration of Bush as the puppet and the fool that he is.In closing, although appalled by the content of the film and by the actions of the Bush administration, I take heart from the words of Mohandas K Gandhi who is said to have made an observation to the effect that there have always been tyrants but that eventually they all fall from power. Think of Bonaparte, Hitler, Mussolini, Idi Amin, Pol Pot and Milosevic. Add GWB to that list and you can see where I'm going.Final comment - well done Mike. Your country and the rest of the world need you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore has really outdone himself this time, a complete eye-opener for me. I would like to say that this is one of the most informative movies that I have ever seen. I would recommend that everyone in the world,especially Americans, see this movie. Michael Moore's view on what happened to the United States after September 11th seems more truthful than that of some of our top political leaders. There is a serious threat to America. To our peace, our freedom, our very way of life. And this threat is not ours alone, but belongs to the entire world. This is not an issue of religion or race or even politics.

		<fullReview>Let me first say that I am a moderate. All I can say about this film is that while some of the information presented may be a bit far fetched in the presentation, Mooore definitely makes you question this administration and Bush's long standing ties to the Saudis. I also found the 7 minute stare and the "conveniently" manipulated Texas Air Guard records to be of interest. Particularly the blacked out pilot's name that is discovered to be the eventual money manager of the bin Laden family in Texas.It is easy to see why some Bush supporters find this movie "uncomfortable" I might add. Bush is portrayed in the film as a shallow, inarticulate person a persona that his supporters fight very hard, but unsuccessfully try to overcome. Everyone liberal, conservative, moderate, etc., should see this film, it is a great eye opener.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

I'm sure God and Jesus are 100% on our side for bombing families and babies that never posed any threat to the United States. Bush was just re-elected by screaming that he was a man of God, that he knew where the FAITH of Americans stood, and blah-blah-blah-blah. Yes, all you Bush supporters...I think it is GREAT that thousands of our poor, uneducated teen boys are being slaughtered on a daily basis..and for what? Bush freaks love to say that "our boys are fighting for our freedom." BULL! When was the FREEDOM of the United States ever in question? George W. Bush is an uneducated, thoughtless, murdering WAR DODGER. He was too much of a sissy to fight in Vietnam, so he gets Daddy Bush to take care of it. Now, he's sending all of our (DUMB, BRAINWASHED) kids over there to get murdered! Why doesn't he send those pill-popping, boozing daughters of his over to Iraq? I can not believe that we are stuck with this dumb hick for four more years. Why did Bush win again? Because so many American people are SHEEP...bah,bah,bah,bah... we must follow!

I've been wanting to write this a long time about the War. Just recently I watched Farenheit 9/11 at my Dad Raymond Catania's union meeting in Lihue. It was a fantastic movie. One of the best I saw in my life. In this movie I saw lots of innocent young and old people die and wondered by would the U.S. Army do such a horrible thing? And then I thought again,well maybe George Bush had something to do with this. Guess what? I was right. Bush is the culprit behind this monstrous Iraq mess. And another thing I want to ask is, why doesn't president Bush go to war? Or, why doesn't his daughters go, their over 18? I also ask why did the U.S. military, aka George Bush's slaves, have to bomb Iraq for no damn reason? Bush had better tell the truth because if he doesn't he is lying to the whole wide world. Oh yeah, If I had the chance I would like to ask him, why did he say he wants to free the Iraqi's when it's not true. The only thing he wants is OIL! I hope this war stops now!

Michael Moore should be commended for this work, and anyone who thinks otherwise is the true Anti-American; ready to believe a presidency based on lies and deceit. Most of the people against this movie haven't even bothered to watch it, but instead formed their own opinion based on simply the controversy surrounding it, which is hypocritical and bias unto itself. 10 out of 10 - a masterpiece that will hopefully contribute to the downfall of an idealistic president who puts the lives of American people in danger for personal interest.</fullReview>

Moore does a good job with 2 things in the movie: the soundtrack, and his nice cut and paste job and his flat out insults against the American efforts to try to thwart any terrorist attack (I know its not likely to happen but better safe than sorry) and the troops efforts to keep the peace in Iraq.

They at least take import information that shows what kind of guy Bush is and shows it in (at least on the surface) not so biased way. This movie's slant was almost as hokey as those UFO shows that interview people with their faces lit up from below for that "spooky" look.Moore makes some very good points. 1) Why were all of Bin Ladens family flown out of the country on 9/13? 2) Why do we have less soldiers in Afghanistan looking for the guy who we know has a link to 9/11 (Bin Laden) than we have cops in Manhattan? 3) Why does this administration censor his military history to hide his relationship with Bath? 4) The links between the Arabs and the Bush's is really strong (Although the video of the Bush's shaking hand with a lot of Arabs is dumb. I'm sure you could get video of any President shaking hands with Arabs a lot. WE BUY A LOT OF THEIR OIL). 5) It is pretty obvious that Bush used 9/11 to invade IRAQ. Multiple people that worked for Bush say they were talking about it before 9/11.Even though it is really slanted, you can watch this and evaluate the fats for yourself and come out hating Bush anyway, so why did have to slant it so hard. It just give the critics of the movie ammo.I liked the "Bowling for Columbine" movie better. 8/10 (8 instead of 10 because of the "spooky" conspiracy narration).BTW Bush is an idiot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regardless of your take on this movie, there is no denying that it is an extremely well done film. While I was not a big fan of Bowling for Columbine because of its many inaccuracies and vilification of Charlton Heston, I believe that this movie is Moore's best work, and quite possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen.While you may disagree with his opinions and assumptions, you cannot argue with the facts. You cannot argue that Dubya sat there for 7 minutes with a look of fear on his face on 9/11, not knowing what to do without someone telling him. That alone is enough for me to vote Kerry this November. How can you defend him continuing to sit there knowing that we were under attack? As Quentin Tarantino said, this is the first movie ever made to defend an Oscar acceptance speech, and it makes one hell of a case.I sincerely hope that people come out of this movie with a renewed sense of patriotism not seen since 9/11, and get out there and spread the message and get people to vote.While Moore may be a bit crazed and speculate to the point of absurdity, it doesn't take away from the truth. Go out and see this movie and do something the Bush administration doesn't want you to do: Think for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do I say this? Because I have never cried or laughed so hard in all my life. To move one emotionally; that is the measure of a great film. What else should I say about this? Brilliant. Yes, and: I went in this movie already a disbeliever in the Bush monarchy, and went out of this film a firm believer that all Republicans are greed ridden evil doers and the source of most of the suffering in the world. So far, everything I have heard or seen or debated with others had made me only believe that more. Please try to convince me otherwise. I am a scientist and appreciated logic. I see the world with a different slant now. I see it more as a war of the haves against the have nots. The haves are those so engrossed in the game of greed that they want nothing more than to get more by squeezing the true providers of their wealth: the working poor of the world. I see the United states as a oligarchical republic and definitely not a democratic nation that seeks to spread its system of enslavement via debt and industrialization to countries around the world by any means possible. Hey you detractors of this film: First see it, then comment on it. I don't want to hear any more "critics of the critic." Why are you afraid to criticize the government?

Well, I am not going to be any of those things, I am actually going to be very old fashioned and tell the truth, however unpopular that may make me in today's 'good', 'hear no evil, see no evil', post modern, neo-socialist western society.I understand partisan politics, I understand militant proselytizing, but such an enormous amount of so blatant lies all in one place is truly difficult to find elsewhere. But, strangely enough, it is exactly what made such a mediocre filmmaker (to put it mildly) like Michael Moore stand out from the crowd, and even become famous in a way. In today's society, anything goes, the end justified the means, all under the shining banner of democracy and freedom of speech. Sadly though, Michael Moore and his disciples are far less democratic and less freedom loving than most of the people they criticize and label as murderers and war profiteers. Like all of his comrades and predecessors in countries where socialism (communism) had a chance to govern and prove itself, Mr. Moore and his followers have shown to be themselves completely intolerant to anything and anybody who doesn't entirely agree with their distorted view of the world.Well done Mr. Moore, keep it up, the French certainly have some more awards they can give you for films like this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's actually made for liberals , Bush haters, and also those who think it's appropriate to enmesh satire with tragedy. Shame on you Mr. Moore for toiling with the sensitivities of those who lost loved ones in wars and terrorist actions. Exploitation never ceases to exist especially a film-maker wanting to make some major bucks. How can you sleep at night, Mr. Moore? Why do this? I admit I never knew a lot about what was in this pseudo-documentary. The Bush family being in cahouts with Saudis, because of their oil interests was news to me. And if it's true so be it. Does it relate to 9/11 and the actions that led up to the terrorist attacks and the main culprit, Osama Bin Laden? I'm not sure and I doubt it. It's interesting information to know, but Moore's reasoning for rationalizing the Bush Administration' accountability for terrorism is foggy and confused. Moore brings some insight on Bush's family fortune and their history in the oil business, but it doesn't quite convince me.The beginning of the film with Bush's inaugural being lambasted by protesters on the streets was chaotic. I know many people don't care for Bush, but there have been other unpopular presidents as well.Moore also attempts to make a syllogism with Bush providing the Bin Laden family refuge and flying them out of the country. In it he says Clinton would have been burned if he flew Timothy McVeigh's family out of the country. That is an idiotic comparison since McVeigh's family couldn't have possibly posed a threat after Tomothy's bombing. It's not a worthy argument.But Moore also makes some other dubious arguments which are too numerous to mention.The war footage is a bit graphic and it's tragic to see people maimed, burned and slaughtered. As in any war in history, there are always casualties and deaths.This film is effective for those who are biased and obviously those who adamantly wish to believe Mr. Moore and his efforts. But it is hard to stomach exploitation and the methodology under Mr. Moore's style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Political activist Michael Moore has certainly honed his craft as a documentary filmmaker and concurrently raised a firestorm of extreme feelings about the Bush administration. Since receiving boos at last year's Academy Awards ceremony for calling Bush a "fictitious President" who was leading us to a "fictitious war", he has fast become a touchstone not only for the agitated left but for all those who have felt increasingly alienated by the imperial hubris of the current administration. Whether you like this film or vehemently hate it will depend far less on the quality of the film-making (which by the way, is excellent) as it does on how you plan to vote in November's election. Ignore this film at your own risk, as it is a powerful indictment creatively executed. Better to view it and discuss its implications, as it won't go away thanks to Moore's constant and savvy media campaign. He was fully aware of the coming firestorm and given his history, I'm sure he welcomes it as his agenda leaves no room for historical context or an analysis of facts or debate. It's a brilliant blame game and frankly quite a convincing one at that. As a filmmaker, Moore has become far less didactic than he was with "Roger and Me" or even "Bowling for Columbine". Instead, he has become an almost subtle alarmist and a first-rate filmmaker.Mercifully, Moore is far less visible in this documentary as his first-person rantings and attempts at ridicule can get tiresome even if the treatment was deserved. The one exception is his admittedly humorous attempt at the end of the film to get U.S. Congressmen to enlist their children for Iraq on their way to work. Otherwise, his presence is felt in the calm yet pointed narration. The film starts with a compelling argument for the illegitimacy of Bush's election. This was actually the most revealing sequence, as we go beyond the chad controversy into all the odd connections and situations that appeared jerry-rigged to ensure Bush's victory. I dare anyone to watch this part and justify not voting in the next election. Moore then goes into the murky, under-the-table relationship between the Bush and the bin Laden clans before he became President, especially the suspicious way the FBI decided to fly the entire American side of the bin Laden family out of the U.S. two days after 9/11 without holding any of them for questioning. Whether his conjecture about the triangulation among the Saudis, the Bushes and oil is true or not, it has credibility in the way it is presented. This sequence catapults us into the grim reality of war, showing dying Americans and Iraqis, and speaking with a few of the thousands of casualties at U.S. hospitals who feel betrayed. There is a shocking sequence that follows a Christmas eve interrogation of a seemingly unsuspicious Iraqi family, as well as another one with U.S. troops ridiculing hooded detainees near Samara (sadly paralleling the humiliations that occurred at Abu Ghraib). Finally, Moore does bring the conflict home with a sadness quite familiar to anyone with recollections of Vietnam, when the heretofore devoted military supporter Lila Lipscomb reads a letter from her son who was killed in Iraq, noting: "He got us here for nothing whatsoever." It is probably the most predictable moment in the film but also its most personal.What resonates most in the film are images most of us never got to see on the news, like the series of African-American congressional members being turned away for their pleas of invalidating the Florida election results; or Marine recruiters manipulating small-town, low-income teens in Flint; or most infamous, the time-lapsed seven minutes as a slightly perturbed Bush reads "The Pet Goat" in front of a Florida kindergarten class. Praise or vilify Michael Moore, but it is difficult to deny that much of what he does claim is at minimum strangely coincidental and at worst immoral. A perfect example in the film is the passing of the U.S. Patriot Act, where at least some of the material in the USA Patriot Act had nothing to do with 9/11, and instead involved long-sought items on the FBI agenda which had previously been unable to pass Congress, but which were enacted by Congress under Bush administration assurances that they were essential to fighting terrorism. It is hard to stomach that kind of logic.Moore has grown significantly since "Roger and Me" in 1989 and not just around the waistline. Believe it or not, this is not the most damning film that he has done, just the most publicized and certainly the best timed in light of the upcoming Presidential election. Moore places less emphasis on espousing his opinions this time around and more on facts, figures, quotes and actual footage from real events that actually make the viewers decide for themselves. The film is not perfect, not nearly, but it is important viewing. My recommendation is to see this film, then read John O'Neill's grudge-laden "Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry" and see which one you find least objectionable to lead the country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although, yes, it is biased in my opinion, I thought Michael Moore did a great job. I was impressed with his views and he stated the facts clearly. He did some great editing and showed the heart breaks of the families who have lost someone in the 9-11 attacks or the war on Terrorism. The film itself is great to watch. Especially if you are not for George W. Bush being president. Than this is the film for you. *And me* :D As a film, I have to say that it was good to watch. I'm not sure if all the facts are true. There is always another side to the story. That's the only thing that I found as a flaw in the film. Other than that, I would recommend this film.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Fahrenheit 9/11' is Michael Moore's best documentary so far. Not because it is anti-Bush but because it is better made than his others. We see less of Moore himself with his usual way of dealing things. Here he lets his material speak for itself. May be you are not convinced by the things he shows us but at least you must find some things very odd.I myself, like most Europeans, am not a very big fan of George W. Bush and admittedly that makes sure you will like this documentary, probably no matter what. The usual easy tricks of Moore are here, simply showing us how incompetent and inarticulate Bush is at times. People in the audience laughed and I was thinking that even when you are not really against Bush you must realize how stupid he can look to other people. A president must realize that there are cameras looking at you a lot of the time. When you address all nations to do everything to stop terrorist killers it is simply stupid to talk about your own golf game a second later. Bush's final words in this movie, when he gets mixed up with the words of an old saying from Texas, or was it Tennessee, could have been the entire documentary. It seems that when Bush have think for himself he is incapable of doing so. I believe this is true, maybe because I do not like Bush, but Moore gives us so much material that proves this. Again, at least you must think he acts a little odd at times.The documentary itself starts with Bush's election, tells us what he failed to do in the following months and arrives at 9/11. At the time the airplanes hit the buildings Bush was reading a book to children in Florida. The way Bush looks when he is informed that a second plane hit the WTC shows us again a man that has no idea what to do next. He sits there for seven whole minutes. Of course, what do you do in a situation like that? I wouldn't know either but I have no responsibilities for an entire nation. I could get up and say goodbye to the children. At least I would have my people around me again.After 9/11 Moore shows us how members of the Bin Laden-family were allowed to leave the country, how Bush used 9/11 to push its agenda until he arrives at the invasion of Iraq. We see some new footage, sometimes pretty shocking (maybe you have to agree with the R-rating at times), of the war and then Moore changes into personal stories. We have a woman who lost her son in Iraq, injured soldiers, and one that will never go back there. Although the personal stories give faces to the points Moore makes they were the least interesting. Especially the woman, although it is a sad story, is too much used to make his point.Not that I cared much. Especially the first half of the documentary where Moore shows us one coincidence after another, for me believable enough, for others probably just coincidence, is strong and very well made. The second half will have an effect on a lot of people, I guess many Americans as well. Again, even if you do not agree with its content, you see that 'Fahrenheit' is better than 'Roger &amp; Me' and 'Bowling for Columbine'. The less Moore you see the more images are enough to make a point. That can't be a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When did the news become entertainment and not reporting. I'm afraid that I, like most of America was caught snoozing. Shame on me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I live in Texas, north of Dallas. A few of us finally got to see Fahrenheit 9/11 today. Although we usually get all the new releases the first week out...this film was not being shown within 248 miles of us till this weekend (at least at Cinemark, which the vast majority of theaters around here are. Wonder why??? I will admit up front that I consider myself an independent but I usually vote republican. That's right. I voted for George, both of them. I was in a minority at the beginning of the Iraq war. I was one of few in this area against it. I didn't feel that we should stretch our forces thinly between Afganistan and Iraq...and although I did believe Sadam had WMD, I didn't think he was joined with Al-Queda. After the war began however, I did feel strongly that we needed to be behind our forces...I was a teenager during the Vietnam war and have a very suspicious nature when it comes to our government. I don't know what I expected to feel about this film....but I certainly did not expect to feel....like an ostrich. What was I doing....where the heck was I when the news stopped reporting and began editing, what Americans would be privy to????????? I, like a lot of viewers around me, had tears streaming down my face.......for all of us.....for our soldiers, the way they felt at the beginning of the war about what they were doing (so like Vietnam)....then to hear the ones that have been over there for a while. They don't understand why we are hated....or they have such guilt about what they are doing/have done. Tears for the Iraqi people and what they are living/dying through. Tears because I now understand why a vast majority of the arabic world hates us. I can't say that I was really surprised at the content, not the Bushes and oil, saudis, the lies, not even a senate who would not stand for the people/country they are supposed to represent. I love America...I love the way Americans are....giving-caring-strong-dependable.I am so ashamed.....not of America....of myself....for allowing myself to be quietly lured/coaxed into an invasion of Iraq (Sadam is no worse than the Chinese, Tienemen square?, the North Koreans, the Saudis) ...ashamed of myself for allowing our freedom to be whittled away in the Patriot Act....ashamed of myself for not demanding loudly for years to eliminate our dependency on oil. There are so many other forms of energy and let's face it....we have let big oil and big government talk us out of demanding what's best for us Americans and not the politicians (both parties) and big oil. God help us all if the foreign money invested in our country is pulled out!!!!!!!!!! God help us all if our deficit is called....our dollar could look like the peso!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Opening weekend of Farenheit 9/11. They were lining up an hour before the movie and the line went down the block. Some may have trouble with the disrespect shown to Bush, the American presidency, and it's staff, but that pales in comparison to the hearing the truth that a deluded and uninformed American public has been given an opportunity to see and hear. I think that was the reason the applause was so spontaneous and heartfelt at the end of the film.Some may find Michael Moore hard to take, but he stands tall as a representative of our Freedom of Speech. I personally want to thank Mr. Moore for his bravery and patriotism in showing how long America's most trusted office has been selling out it's country for profit , and at the cost of it's own sons and daughters. All I could think of at the end of the movie was "Vietnam".</fullReview>

This film reminds me of what an abusive husband would do to portray his wife the victim of his beatings to keep her submissive. That no one who would associate with her because she is some kind of vile scum. This film seems like it was made by some sourpuss terrorist. It's hard to believe that any one who has enjoyed the freedoms of life in these United States could ever lie and try to get so many to believe the lie, like he was Satan himself.

		<shortDescription>Burning Bush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fahrenheit 9/11" is one of those films, like Michael Moore's earlier "Bowling for Columbine" and Oliver Stone's "JFK," that polarizes audiences along political lines. If you like George W. Bush, chances are you'll hate "Fahrenheit 9/11;" if you can't stand Bush, you'll probably love it. There's little room for middle ground in today's sharply divided American electorate.Many critics of "Fahrenheit 9/11" claim the film is factually inaccurate. However, very few details of the film have actually been refuted. What really angers many about this film is its premise: that Bush ignored the threat of terror before the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and then used the attacks as an excuse to advance a radical right-wing agenda that included an ill-advised invasion of Iraq (which had no involvement in the September 11 bombings).Not exactly a cut-and-dried documentary, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is more of an essay film that relies on documentary footage to underscore Moore's hypothesis. The footage and facts are expertly woven into a devastating indictment of Bush's policies. You may disagree with the way Moore connects the dots, but his evidence does come from the public record (including actual quotes from Bush and his administration).For all the political weight it carries, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is entertaining as heck. Most of the comedy occurs in the film's first half. There are montages of Bush vacationing to (you guessed it) the Go-Go's "Vacation" and of Bush Sr. schmoozing with Saudis to REM's "Shiny Happy People." Moore examines the "Coalition of the Willing," finding that our allies include "superpowers" like Pulau, The Netherlands, and Costa Rica. (My favorite line: "Afghanistan? ...Oh, yeah. They had an army. OUR army!") Moore also milks the Patriot Act for laughs, hijacking an ice cream truck to announce its provisions to members of Congress (who admit they didn't actually read it).As events draw nearer to the invasion of Iraq, the tone grows darker, and Moore gradually dispenses with humor in order to focus on the story of military mother Lila Lipscomb, whose son goes to serve in the war. Moore's delicate, sensitive handling of Lipscomb's heartbreaking story belies his reputation for guerrilla film-making.Near the end of the film, Moore offers this profound observation about our troops: "They serve so that we don't have to. They offer to give up their lives so that we can be free. It is, remarkably, their gift to us. And all they ask for in return is that we never send them into harm's way unless it is absolutely necessary. Will they ever trust us again?" Unfortunately, conservatives refused to address this and other valid questions raised by "Fahrenheit 9/11", instead focusing on discrediting Moore himself. They must have felt vindicated when Bush narrowly won reelection in 2004. But the election results do not invalidate the hypothesis of Moore's film. Rather, as our troops remain in Iraq, as American casualties mount, and as Bush's rationale for war fades into obscurity, "Fahrenheit 9/11" remains all too relevant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To simply put it about this "movie". Anyone with a camera can follow anyone around for two weeks and use the footage to make them look like the greatest thing in the world or the biggest pile of crap that ever lived. You don't have to be a Republican or supporter of Bush to see all the lies and fabrication in this film.All Moore does is take some half truths and mold them in a way to support is over liberal egomaniacle beliefs. It is nothing more than shameful propaganda. He failed in his attempt to get Bush out of the Whitehouse this past election. The only thing he was successful at was making a butt load of money off a country full of idiots who saw this a legitimate documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore's documentary on the Bush administration. It accuses him of being an idiot (he is) and not knowing how to handle the horrific events of 9/11. The events of 9/11 are not shown--the screen is black and you HEAR what happened. It's just terrifying. Bush didn't take correct action--he started a war with Iraq where (he said) the organization that did 9/11 was hiding. Step by step it shows that Bush is an utter moron and his administration is basically using fear of terrorist attacks for an assault on civil rights (like the Patriots Act). Obviously I hate Bush so my review is biased, but this movie raises a lot of questions about the war and Bush that just have no easy answers. I do think Michael Moore goes a LITTLE too far at times (I have trouble believing that ALL republicans are for the war) but most of the time he's right on target. There's also the devastating sequence in which he talks to a woman whose son was killed in the war. She reads his final letter and visits the White House to find out why her son was killed. Some say this is exploitation--that's just ridiculous! This woman agreed to be filmed and knew what she was doing. Moore is just trying to show us the anger and anguish of parents whose sons or daughters were killed in Iraq. It also interviews the soldiers over there who wonder themselves why they are there and want to get out.A shattering, disturbing documentary. EVERYONE (regardless of political choice) should see this. A very important film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O George, thou hast robbed me of my idealism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The TV guide described this film as "an examination of President Bush's policies in Iraq," but it's not really an examination. It's more like a vivisection.Anyway, it lives up to its reputation as an inflammatory piece of propaganda. It's probably Michael Moore's least witty, least egocentric, most preachy, and most angry film so far.As propaganda it's not perfect. Too much time is spent on a grieving family in Flint, Michigan. The married couple who lost their son is perfect for engaging our sympathies, large and of mixed race, and the mother's patriotism is shown as unshaken. When she hangs up the flag she never lets it touch the ground and she is proud that she has a military family, and yet there is so much time spent with her that it borders on tastelessness. She carries so much moral authority that we don't need to see much of her.And Moore uses the usual ironic techniques to puff up the already obvious phoniness of the big business types dining on huge trays of Vorspeise and drinking wine and boasting about how much money there is to be made out of the oil fields, alternating with shots of bloodied bodies.And his argument is, as in Bowling for Columbine, confused. Yes, the Bush family is close to the Saudi power brokers, but was the war really just about oil? Moore may be misunderestimating the dimensions of Bush's ego. It is GLAMOROUS to be a war president and Bush has reveled in it. (That faux warrior's jump suit, etc.) To be sure, oil probably has something to do with it, what with Halliburton's involvement and all. Does anyone really believe that we would be in Iraq today if, instead of sitting on top of the world's second largest oil reserves, its chief source of income were its jute crop? That's just about all the weaknesses I'd like to point out. It's a powerful film. Moore is known for his delicate touch in arranging and editing the events we see, so I doubt that the class of poor high schoolers he interviews in Flint were chosen at random. It's probably theater. But is it any different from the audiences that were so carefully screened and assembled for Bush's "town hall meetings" while he was touring the country pitching his plan to revamp Social Security? This is a real punch in the snot locker for Bush and his supporters. (Not that it will change anyone's mind.) It's probably underhanded and full of indemonstrable insinuations. But I don't care. Bush deserves it. He's got Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly, Novack, and all of Fox News and much of the rest of the media on his side, plus an able team of media manipulators. Who've the REST of the country got? Al Franken? And I'm perfectly willing to disregard the likelihood of legerdemain anyway. I no longer care if this administration is in bed with the Saudis or if oil were the chief reason for the invasion of Iraq. (One general uses the word "invasion" in a speech and immediately corrects it to "liberation.") Moore's message comes across as both intact and honorable. The last words of his narration are "wars should never be fought unless they are absolutely necessary." Hear, hear, Mike, our lumpy proletarian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary sums up what I've been trying to explain to people all along. Although I didn't have all the details surrounding Bush's motives, I knew they weren't good. This documentary had me crying one minute and extremely angry the next. Being an average citizen, I feel so helpless against Bush and hope that everyone comes together to "take" our country back. We don't have ownership in America, the Saudi's do and that's quite scary. Another suspicion I've had all along is that the Gas Price epidemic is just another tactic by Bush to get the people behind him and allow him (I say him, because his pockets would be fattened) to drill for oil in Alaska. I'm so angry that our men and women are dying for nothing more than the control of the oil in Iraq. That's all it's been and that's all it ever will be. Why on earth did we ever stop our hunt for Osama Bin Laden? I honestly feel in my heart that had George W. not gotten into office, our The Towers and the Pentagon would never have been bombed. I believe it was something personal aimed at the Bush family and America merely got caught in the cross fire. When the election of Gore was reversed, I literally cried because I knew that our lives as we knew them were no longer going to be the same with him in office.GET OUT THERE AND VOTE!

		<fullReview>The single most important film of 2004 and a must-be nominee for Academy Award Best Picture and Best Director. Michael Moore has caught the Bush Administration with its pants down around its knees. Watching George Bush sit in a classroom reading "My Pet Goat" while people were jumping to their deaths from the windows of the Trade Center Towers, speaks volume about the AWOL-in-Chief's chickenhawk heart. Learning of the close ties to the Bush family, the Neocons, and the Saudi Royal family chills the heart, especially as you witness the Bin Laden family members evac from the U.S. to Saudi Arabia while all other aircraft was grounded without being interviewed by the FBI, CIA or any alphabet! Realization that no one in Congress had time to read the Patriot Act before signing it infuriates to the bone. The biggest eye-openers come at the end when you get to watch senator after senator side-step signing their own children up to fight in Iraq or Afghanistan while Marine recruiters comb the poorer shopping malls recruiting from the ranks of the most economically depressed and poorest neighborhoods. Michael Moore put on film facts that others have avoided and done so in a manner that entertains and informs.</fullReview>

In a detailed gathering of information, footage and statistics this really does offer compelling viewing for audience. Think again about politics, money and power. Think again about those we put our trust into. A must see 'film' for anyone who was against the act of war, and must see film for anyone who wants to enlighten themselves to the hard truths that have been carefully concealed from the public for so long. This 'film' will have you laughing, gasping in disbelief and seething all in one. As always great credit to Moore who creates a film, constructed in such a manner that it portrays all views of the argument, from the lowly patriotic American citizens, the American troops, peace supporters and the heads of politics themselves. Although it obviously suggests we make our own conclusions, you will be left in no doubt who is to blame. Not for the squeamish.</fullReview>

Especially the assembled shots of Bush are not that convincing,although we all know what kind of liar he is(or else,if he believes everything he says,he really dumb).For instance the scene in which names Saddam and Bin Laden is not powerful,the quotes are taken from different press conferences and speeches.Still,the fact is that Bush dragged the world in an unjust war.Let's talk about the positive things of this documentary cause there are lots. Moore's use of old Movies and Television series to make his point is hilarious(especially DRAGNET and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN)and the moments he picks for this technique are perfect. The build up in the movie is also great,it stretches out the four years of Bush's presidency that means from the Coup d'Etat in Florida in 2000 until the 9/11 hearings and the prison abuse in 2004.After a great intro the opening credits appear after which the screen turns black as we hear the terror in the voices of the New York citizens on that dreadful day in September,it looked very much like Kubrick's overture of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.The documentary then reveals the connections between the Bush family &amp; clan and the Bin Laden family.This is where the film slows down a little but it strikes back with fierce images of the war in Iraq,from mutilated Iraqi bodies because of the bombings to the burned American bodies hanging upside on a bridge.The scene in which an Iraqi woman is at her most desolate is very frightening. The last half hour is probably the strongest part.A patriotic family who have also believed in America's power the change the world in a positive way come to minds after their son is killed in Iraq.The scene where the mother reads a letter of her son is heartbreaking,the fact that a lot of American soldiers have lost their believe in their President is striking.The scene in which recruiters of the US Army are convincing(or brainwashing)poor and chanceless young Americans is almost sickening,this entire scene takes place in Moore's hometown of Flint,Michigan.The passionate way in which Moore portrays his wasted town is real in every sense.Only poor,mostly black,people enlist for the army is the message.This is strengthened in the sequence in which Moore tries to convince members of Congress to send out their children to Iraq,this diabolical scene shows the false situation in the USA. On of the last scenes of the movie is the one in which the mother of the killed soldier goes to Washington to visit the White House,she breaks out in tears when a Republican woman tells her to blame Al Qaeda for her son's death.The mother replies:"They don't understand what it's like,I didn't either until my son died". What counts for the Republican passing lady counts also for Bush and for the members of congress and senate.FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is not as great or powerful as BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE,the humor of that documentary is far better than FAHRENHEIT.One could ask the question whether this latest addition to the Moore legacy will be remembered in years to come.The fact that it won The Palme d'Or is probably because of the fact that after this fact it would be shown in American theaters.Moore shows the public what they already know,but it is necessary viewing since a lot was extinguished by the Government. It still baffles me that Bush is so much in the race for President,I really don't understand that.Sure,Kerry isn't a charismatic person but Bush is a liar and a man who caused the death of almost a thousand US troops,not to mention the Iraqi casualties. When is America coming to it's sense?Let's hope before November 2nd. 9/10Today,as I wrote this comment,more than 125 people died in Iraq because of a bombing at a police station.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rupert Murdoch dominated Australian print media has been trying desperately to write this film off as a pack of lies and distortions. After seeing the preview session tonight I know what they're scared of - and that's too many working class people knowing the truth that most wars are run for political expediency and profit, and the working class are the most likely cannon fodder. Fahrenheit 9/11 shows the true human impact of the War On Iraq by the Coalition Of The Willing - and Australia is up to its ankle's in George W. Bush's nether regions as part of that Coalition. We share the blame and shame - and can only hope our defacto-Republican government gets the boot, along with Bush's administration.I appreciate that Michael Moore is revealing the failings of a grossly malignant administration - and he's not just bagging the Republican Party. He highlights the failure of Democrats to take timely or appropriate action - especially when even one Democratic Senator with guts or integrity could have made all the difference.The relief provided by appropriate music and necessary humour are what make Fahrenheit 9/11 an entertaining, compelling and thoroughly effective documentary which deserves every Award available. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While one might understand how you though the movie was a bit over the top, how can you argue the facts? Sure, Moore or anyone could make a documentary based on anyone by using news footage, but the fact is, that footage is FACT.Call it propaganda, but it is no more so than Rush Limbaugh's radio program. Moore is the liberal Limbaugh, it's as simple as that.This movie, while a bit over the top, was a prime example of why bush need not be elected (or however you believe he is in office). What do you see in this man that could possibly encourage you to endure another four years of fascism.While few are praising Kerry, I see him as the best leader for an America that represents the people of this fine country. Don't go telling me about how great things are under bush, because you are wasting your time.I can see how you don't like the manner in which the film was made, but you can't argue the facts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What Americans need to know or consider - even if you don't agree. It IS slightly one-sided, but there is nothing wrong with going and seeing it. If you are for bush or against bush's war ideas, it is good for you to see just to get a sense of what people can at least consider. If you are for bush, all it will do is allow you to decide to be more firm in that choice, but have a look at the other side. If you are for bush, it re-enforces ideas and puts them into you head. If you have no opinion on bush, it gives you a base to start research from and gets you thinking about political activity. Once out of the theater, whatever your view on the topic, go do research and find out what you can from both sides - decide for yourself. DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS OF THE FILM AS YOUR OWN IF YOU HAVE NOT SEE IT - SEE IT YOURSELF AND CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, Fahrenheit 9/11 is the most important film of the year. No need to offer an overview of content; you've all heard the hue and cry. Rather, let us examine this outcry for a moment. Many "reviewers" here and elsewhere rail against the film and then swear to never view it! ?? Many rightist voices throughout the media have rushed to condemnation. Those flaming Hollywood liberals in MPAA issued their absurd R rating, thus curtailing its box-office potential. Organizations have been hastily formed to try to prevent it from being carried by major chains and to try to block its promotion. A particular governor [who shall here remain nameless] pressured a [nameless] distribution company into dropping the film. Shouts of "treason" abound, as if blind, witless support for one's leadership is the cornerstone of democracy. What are they afraid of? Rush Limbaugh, the Will Rogers of totalitarianism, calls it "a pack of lies". But none of these people seem able to pinpoint these falsehoods that are said to comprise this tissue of lies. For me, that is the film's greatest strength; Mr. Moore, though he does infuse the film with his wit, style, and sanity, stands back and lets these criminals speak for themselves. Where are the untruths? Americans are so confused by the "party line" espoused by the media that they still believe that Iraq was a threat to world peace and that the Iraqi people needed to be punished for 9/11, an event in which they did not participate.We need to wake up and examine our place in the world. This film will help. Many thanks, Mr. Moore. We need all the help we can get. 10/10 for entertainment and education.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fahrenheit 9/11" is typical Michael Moore "documentary" - very flashy, very cute, and in this case, blatantly hoping to get Bush out of office (an admirable goal if there was one). **tons of spoilers, you've been warned**Moore does a lot which falls outside of the realm of a documentary, and I don't like him abusing the category that way. The skits about reading the patriot act to congress, and asking congressmen to send their kids to Iraq have no place in a documentary. But he did come up with the most amusing choices of background music I've ever heard (Shiny Happy People, etc.), and I'm sure he's had people checking his facts very carefully.The movie seemed confused whether its main point was 1) the connections among the administration, oil, defense contractors, and Saudis (easily a whole movie right there), or 2) the hijacking of the 2000 election (where Moore failed to assign any blame to the ~50 Democratic Senators who refused to support the House motion to contest the election results), or 3) how foolish our government is to routinely pass a 600 page bill without anyone actually reading it (the patriot act, and most everything else that goes through congress) or 4) the way in which poor people are pushed into the military to fight the wars declared by rich people. Yo, Director!! Can we have a little focus here!?!? The third and fourth points have been going on since long before 2000, so they diminish from pointing out Bush's ineptness, IMHO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally THE TRUTH!!! Moore's done an excellent job of laying out the behind the scenes incest the House of Bush has with the House of Saud. The Neo cons have a habit of saying 2 unrelated things back to back as if they're connected, and then repeating them ad nauseum until people start to believe it, and this has never been more insidious. It's refreshing to get information that doesn't "spin" ya in your seat. The Neo-cons use the media to spread lies, and when caught in a lie just deny you told the lie. Add to that a cup of self righteousness. It's the constant lying and self-righteousness that's so disturbing. Moore shows it as it is. The "Bonanza" clip was great! Bush's violation of church &amp; state has got to stop. Moore shows what war's all about. It's all about killing. See the film. It's well worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Micheal moore is genius. No doubt about that(in my Canadian opinion). Bowling for columbine was great. Dumb white men was excellent, and now this. No doubt about it, the man knows how to entertain, however, I don't think he can actually expect everyone to think that all of his stuff is documentary style informative pieces. He manipulates interviews(The Charleton heston interview in bowling for columbine is a good example) and footage to make his biased opinion be known. I share his viewpoints on Bush and Fear in America, But i don't think that's he's telling the truth in these "Documantaries". I think people are assuming that this movie is intended to tell the truth. It is'nt. Micheal moore never said that this was all factual. He never said that this was all truthful.Political or not, this is a most throughougly entertaining, and though it may not be a non-biased documentary, it is one good laugh. Take from it what you want, i took some good laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this movie I was amazed at the things that were shooting right over our heads. It was interesting to see how corrupt our government could be at times, but also really scary. Even if you don't agree with the film and are an avid Bush supporter I still think it's a good movie to see because looking at something from another point of view is always refreshing. Even if you are a republican it doesn't mean you need to follow your representative blindly. Get the DVD because it has some great extra footage that wasn't in the movie, including scenes from Iraq the day before the bombings and what all the Iraqi's thought about the U.S. invading. Great movie and I wish that the news covered more of the stories that Michael Moore has covered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has been a lot of controversy over this movie. From what I can gather there is no middle ground. Either you think it is wrong, and thereby criticize the content or you agree with it, and it further cements your own ideas. This is a documentary and by definition means that this movie will be biased for filmmaker (usually one sided). It is the filmmaker's point of view. Whether you agree or disagree with Michael Moore, this documentary is a success in that it makes one think about the possibilities. As stated in the movie, people tend make firm decisions based on very limited information. One can never know the full picture, I think we must entertain the possibilities (and possible alternatives). This is a good documentary that brings up some very good points. I think everyone should go and see it, even if you don't agree with the conclusions. You may come away with something. Moore definitely elaborates on the fear theme that he brought up in Bowling for Columbine. It is hard to get into specifics without revealing too many elements of the movie or not to get political. I will simply say that I like Bowling for Columbine better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before i give you my opinion about this film, i have a question to ask: do you know what is the most favorite answer on US forums when you question the strange US foreign politics ? You don't know ? You don't guess ? The answer is "F***k you"You know, from an European point of view, from the point of view of the everyman, America is going mad, self-destroying.It's good to find a film (even a not perfect film)about the America we all love. An America able to think, who loves truth, able to self criticism.We have a strong knowing of our Arab Neighbors, and we are stunned about your action in Irak. The result was really, really predictable: a huge civil war. Good luck, boys ! It's gonna be worse !But go back to the film. Well...It's not perfect. far too long. And i found that Moore's obsession about the Bush family is annoying. Paradoxally, lots of important things have been forgotten to understand the situation, both in US and in Irak...Just try to find documents about the first Irak war. And about Ussama Bin Laden.For example, how YOUR Government had trained the Islam Fundamentalists groups in the 80's. And the links between Ussama and good old CIA...Or WHO sell Anthrax and chemicals to Saddam...I think than focusing on Bush is not the point. If you want to understand 9-11, study the US foreign politic in the 20 last years.The subject of this film is clearly to prevent the Bushs from being re-elected. Good.But if you want a clear view of the subject, you must have a larger point of view.This film is a good, but not perfect introduction to US politics;If you're really interested with truth, don't just satisfy yourself with this film (nor with CBS/ Fox NEWS 'reports').Seek informations. Think by yourself. And don't be afraid of Prozac. it could be useful: the real story is even more depressing than this film.</fullReview>

Opening is much like "For All Mankind", where the author questions the circumstances of the 2000 elections by pointing out just how many bush family members and employees were in key positions to influence the florida elections.excellent cinematographic bookends begin and end the movie. never seen a documentary made this well.The movie has a very powerful set of facts to present, and the facts speak for themselves. There were so many important ones I wish he had diagrammed the relationships between bush, bush family, and financial interests in iraq, saudi arabia, and the bin laden family business ties to the bush family businesses.A slant is present, but not overpowering, nor is it extreme. You could feel the audience squirming visibly about 10 times starting about 50 minutes into the movie.the movie does not move to iraq subject matter until 1:20 has elapsed - contrary to what i had believed, only the last 1/3rd of the movie is about iraq.This is a watershed event. I would have given it a 10/10 but in a few places the slant was gratuitously obvious and not needed to state the important case.People who criticize the movie without seeing it are McCarthyists - as dangerous as stalin or hitler to freedom and democracy as we know it.</fullReview>

I know IMDb is not a site to discuss about politics, and we could fill hundreds of lines talking about this movie, so I'll just comment a couple of things about it: Some accuse Michael Moore of manipulate people's opinion, of being a partisan. That's true, and I would add that he's quite a demagogue. But hey, even if only a 50% of the stuff that "Fahrenheit 9-11" shows were true, it would be one of the bigger scandals ever in the history of Democracy. Nixon resigned for spying the Democrats, Clinton almost had to leave the White House because of some sexual affair... but, what about Bush Jr.?

		<shortDescription>A treatise on a current president and a current war, done in a (mostly) tragic, comic, compelling, propaganda fashion by Michael Moore...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...BUT, after seeing Fahrenheit 9/11, I knew that this is the kind of propaganda that's on the side of good, or at least reason. While a good deal of the footage in the film has already been on television, some of it (like the ironic footage of Al Gore telling congressmen that they couldn't make cause for debate due to no senators signing for the right to debate the election decision of 2000, and of course the casualties of the war in Iraq) has not been seen by too many Americans. What I find in Fahrenheit 9/11 - a funny, disturbing, and involving op-ed film piece from Moore - is that it turns out to achieve a superb level of craftsmanship. I haven't been affected by a film that dealt with such a level of hot (yet appropriate), questionable debate since Stone's JFK. I feel the same reaction coming from the audience, both as I was walking out of the theater and on this site on the message board - they love it or hate it. But what I find so fascinating, when looking at both films, is that you could (or rather can might be a more plausible word) find a few errors in some of the facts, yet there is so much information, so many details about what could be counted as truth or what could be counted as outright bullsh*t that you can't say it's entirely one or the other. And unlike JFK, 'Fahrenheit' uses its dramatic edge without hiring a cast of Hollywood types.The film begins a little like how Moore's book began, Stupid White Men (only that was far more detailed and less in sarcasm): "Was it all a dream?" Moore asks, as the first image is of the camera panning down on a crowd celebrating Gore's victory in Florida. No less than a few minutes later, Moore cuts to Bush on the inaugural day of becoming president, with rain coming down, and hundreds of protesters railing against the cars. Then the story begins to unfold- Bush, after sitting dumbfounded, eyes wandering in a classroom for seven or so minutes after the 9/11 attacks, goes to work to sign the patriot act (which was practically un-read by congress, yet takes away freedoms as random from Americans), puts 11,000 troops ("there are more cops in Manhattan", comments an interviewee) in Afghanistan, and slowly but surely unfolds and executes the invasion of Iraq. While Moore concentrates the first part of the film on Bush 1 and Bush 2's ties to the Saudi Arabian government (as well, in due, to the Bid-Laden family and their business investments), the second part goes more towards the soldiers in Iraq. Like Roger and Me and Bowling for Columbine, the idea(s) that drive what Moore's putting together are commendable, which the topics are controversial, thought provoking, and depressing. It's not a pretty picture he's painting in the slightest, and when he brings his hometown of Flint, Michigan into the mix (this time revealing how Marine recruiters work, young people who have family in the army and in the war, and one mother who loves her country and has kids in the army and overseas), political allegiances aside, one understands what small, low-income cities and towns go through in times like these. One could argue 'Fahrenheit' isn't a documentary in the traditional sense. However, as a document of what a country goes through, in terms of the effect of 9/11, and what the war has done to the people fighting in Iraq and the people at home, it's powerful even when it could come to some as on a slant.And what I loved the most is that, throughout the film, the images and editing styles kept me with eyes glued, and overall the effect of the film can be quite entertaining. There are moments when Moore inserts something that's laugh-out-loud, even as it's not technically meant to be so, and then even more so when it is. On top of that, the music selections are perfectly manipulative, sad, and playful. Like with 'Columbine', the film doesn't come without it's share of memorable moments, such as when John Ashcroft sings "When Eagles Soar", or the montage of countries that decided to come to our aid in the Iraq conflict, or when he flashes to the Oregon coast and finds it is a 180 when compared to the fear and pumped-up 'security' by the police forces and FBI. By the end of the film, I knew it is geared for a purpose. But it's not the kind of purpose that some would have you believe, like it's a 21st century answer to Triumph of the Will or something ridiculous like that. It is what it is; a filmmaker's own take on the current state of affairs via the president of the free world. Take it or leave it. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts Slow and Ends with a Pow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to separate "Fahrenheit 9/11" as an Op Ed piece to just evaluate it as a film. Michael Moore is effective overall in the film's coherent organization, even though it is too long and has some repetition, some played up for comic relief, and news reports have usurped and surpassed some of his revelations, including findings by the 9/11 commission as prodded by The Families. Most of the film is a compilation; unlike a book where one can check the footnotes for the source of a quote, one can only see all the film credits at the end and wonder where a clip comes from and why it hasn't been widely seen before. It is roughly divided into thirds and the last third is the most powerful and what stays with the viewer. The first third is How to Steal an Election 2000 with really pointed attacks on the Bush family and their connections. In between dredging up old news, he does focus on how minorities were particularly affected by the vote, with what I presume is a C-SPAN excerpt of Black Caucus members protesting the election certification, which did not get much attention at the time. It is cheap shots to show various administration officials as they prep for TV interviews. Ironically, it is this background part that might have gotten the film its unnecessary R rating as in showing the Bush's cozy relationship with Our Traditional Allies the Saudi oil potentates, Moore finds grainy footage demonstrating the Saudi Arabian justice system with a beheading that I'm sure is not too different from what has been seen in PG-13 fictional fare. Part 2 is 9/11, continuing looking at the Saudi influences, and the calculated lead-up to the invasion of Iraq. Moore very powerfully does not show any WTC images directly, but instead blackens the screen then focuses on the horrified faces of witnesses, particularly of minorities. Surely it was pool coverage that produced the tape of Bush staying in the classroom reading a children's book for eight minutes after he's informed about the attacks -- so why is Moore the first to show it? While he does make much of tearing off the fig leaf of the Weapons of Mass Destruction and the hypocrisy of the Bush administration about falsely linking Iraq to 9/11, these have been skewered better by Jon Stewart and the crew at Comedy Central's "The Daily Show."Part 3 is the war and is quite intense, involving and moving. He shows how the press was not just embedded but in bed as jingoists, though this aspect was shown from a more interesting perspective in "Control Room," which makes an essential sidebar for this film. Moore is very careful to not repeat a mistake of the Viet Nam War protesters - he is passionate about supporting the troops vs. criticizing their leaders. He refers to the Abu Ghraib prison scandal in bare passing as good soldiers driven to immoral acts by functioning in an immoral situation. Will the G.I.'s who were filmed frankly criticizing the war get demoted like the well-meaning PR rep in "Control Room" reportedly was? Then the film takes a turn more reflective of Moore's distinctive flare as he looks directly at the impact of the war on his hometown of Flint, MI, from the recruiters who zero in on unemployed minority kids to loyal and patriotic everyday Americans who now see that they have sacrificed their sons and daughters based on lies. He also subtly chastises anti-war activists who don't respect their overwhelming grief and betrayal. The universality of the carnage is implicitly considered by showing footage of first a distraught Iraqi mother screaming for revenge and then an equally grief-stricken Michigan mother in D.C. -- is an updated "Lysistrata" tactic the answer? The music selection is excellent, particularly the closing choice of Neil Young's "Rockin' in the Free World.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this documentary along with its counterpart (which not many people know about), "Fahrenhype 911". Watching these documentaries was part of an English class I took on argumentative writing back before the Bush/Kerry election. After watching both films and getting a balanced view of the issues being addressed in "Fahrenheit 911" I realized that Michael Moore's doc was nothing more than cut and paste lies. its counterpart exposes the many flaws and lies of this pseudo-documentary. If you want to know the truth watch "FAHRENHYPE 911"-it will open your eyes!! After watching this Michael Moore film I really can't trust the guy to present anything without having major doubts about his integrity and chalk his efforts up to mere propaganda! Recently, he did a documentary about how bad healthcare is in the U. S.. He claims that that we should follow Cuba and their example of "good healthcare". I personally know someone who was just in Cuba with permission fro the State Department, and he gave me the skinny about Cuban healthcare. Basically, the doctors that are finished schooling leave Cuba-otherwise they make the same money as most other occupations in Cuba-no matter if they are teachers, waste disposal workers, whoever-they all make pitiful wages. Who's left to perform healthcare procedures-medical students!!!! How is this better than our healthcare! If it see the name Micheal Moore as Director on a film-don't even bother!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What really happened on September 11 as told by the Shadow Vice President</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 9/11 is not fun for pro-president Bush people to watch. Here is what really happened on September 11 2001. I as the American Shadow Vice President should know. In the early part of the 21st century it was reported on CNN that a meteor had just narrowly missed the planet Earth but hardly any other News Sources picked up this story. The passengers of at least 2 of the 4 Jet airliners are alive and in American bunkers and not allowed to leave. Your American Government myself included staged the events of September 11th in order to divert the real jets and passengers to safety, possibly at the Area 51 Airfield so they could survive a Deep Impact movie style meteor or comet strike on the Planet Earth. I did not give the order for the American Government to stage the events of September 11th. Now according to American Shadow President Jack Kennedy my boss, drastic measures will have to be taken any day now to stop Global Warming. This could involve the super flu or super cholera that killed lab rats in 7 months. As a Christian I do not believe in murder or suicide so I did not sign the plan. Luckily this abstaining voter was allowed to remain American Shadow Vice President. This is another reason why the rescued American civilians must remain in the bunkers under National Security secret Emergency powers. American Shadow President Jack Kennedy and President George W Bush believe in freedom of Speech and thats why my remarks have been left on the internet. Michael Moores movies are really left wing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Documentaries are not news reports</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be this misconception that a documentary HAS to show a balanced view of a particular issue. That isn't the case. Obviously, one can choose to go that route, but Moore should not be faulted for his admittedly biased views on Bush, or that this is a politically motivated film. Do you think Bush presents more than his side of any particular issue in any of his speeches? The job of a good documentary, and a good documentary filmmaker, is to present his views and theories and fight for them. As long as the facts are sound and correct, then there is nothing wrong in presenting a film this way. If anything, this is the way a good documentary SHOULD be made. I also don't agree with those that say that he focuses too much on entertaining, and not enough on informing. I found Moore's film as having a terrific balance of entertainment and education, which has always been the way that I personally learn and pay attention the best. Where is the rule written that we have to be bored to tears?I've heard a lot of people make the point that Moore's facts are at best flimsy, and at worse, fabricated, but I haven't heard anyone present proof that his facts are inaccurate. Whether or not you agree with Moore's political views, whether you're anti- or pro-Bush, it all comes down to just the facts, ma'am. And the facts are sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an awfully interesting documentary. What's funny about this film is that no matter what you say about it, you're going to make a political remark by saying it. I'll just go ahead and say it. I liked this movie. I wasn't much in favor of Bush in the first place; I was shocked to see some of the atrocities that have been going on in our government. I'm not much of a documentary person, and this is the first time that I saw a documentary in the theatre. I kind of got bored during the second hour. I thought a few of the points made seemed to be a bit irrelevant/stretched. For example, the profane song that the soldiers hear before killing doesn't have much to do with Bush. It sounds and it is very inhumane, but to do such an inhumane act of killing, one needs to listen to that kind of music. Second, Moore made it seem that Flint is in its terrible state because of Bush, when it is actually moreso because of General Motors or somebody giving jobs to Mexico/Canada, as Moore showed to us in Roger &amp; I. Anyways, I am very glad that Moore clarified how Iraq has absolutely nothing to do with 9/11 and Osama Bin Laden. It was very interesting to see the Bush's past associations with the Saudis and Taliban, rigging of the election, Axis of the Willing, and fooling the public. I'm sure I've offended millions of people by now, but please do not take offense. I love America, and this great country needs a great leader whom the people can better trust and rely on to take more informed decisions during his presidency. VOTE!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I stepped up to the ticket booth in Oklahoma City to get my ticket for Fahrenheit 9/11 I had the urge to say, `One for Spider-Man 2 please.' But, I did not.I am not especially fond of attack journalism since Mike Wallace first introduced it. What does it do other than help form mobs of vigilantes? Where is the depth? Where does it come up with the answer to the question `By what method are we going to improve this?' It only seems to come up with the answer, `kick em out or lynch em'.Once again we saw in this Michael Moore film bad guys doing bad things and weak guys, i.e., our congressmen doing weak things and dodging. So, by what method do we improve this? Where is your answer Michael Moore?You did say in the movie, `Hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance.' By what method do we remove poverty and ignorance? Maybe find a method to teach us all to be thinkers, even Bubba the driver of a big block hemi Dodge dually whom the liberals among us at best don't want to associate with and at worst want to eliminate.What will happen to all the manipulators of thought, i.e., the right wing republicans when Bubba learns to think? How will we teach Bubba to think? Remember he might figure out a way to drive his big block hemi and not drive a Subaru and wear t-shirts with politically incorrect thoughts expressed on them and not wear Birkenstocks. Teaching Bubba to think might produce an entirely different world than any of us can imagine . a better world.Michael Moore help us figure out `by what method' please. Your attack journalism does not help . really.</fullReview>

Then dare if they may, ask 'their' government why they haven't refuted ANY of these charges, publicly, at prime TV time. Instead, they have been harassing and threatening us, by enabling Nazi type rules, and trashing the constitution and bill of rights as if we were the real terrorists of this nation. Pitiful situation we live in.More than likely, Moore held himself from involving ALL parties responsible for this massacre and most recent treasonous act against the US. He has to watch over his shoulder only for Bush, unlike JFK, who went after the whole gang in control of these United States, and got himself assassinated rather quickly after.</fullReview>

His supporters dwindle, only leaving the raving lunatic supporters to wave their giant oppressive flags. Good job Moore, much more questioning should be done about those in power. The people in the US seem to waking up more and more as they seek for truth. What is the current president doing to your country? What will his legacy be?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is one thing anyone viewing this film cannot deny, the sound bites. What is amazing to me is how the main stream media has worked very hard for the past four years not to show these bites as they are not flattering to Mr. Bush and his administration. Mr. Moore produced a film, which he has openly admitted is his opinion, that shows the other side of this administration. Please note, anyone disagreeing with the views of this administration is immediately discredited. Somehow, this action seems to go against what is American. If there is no descent, it's not American.This is a great film and Mr. Moore should be commended for stepping up against the insanity now gripping this country. Whether you agree with the content or not, the idea is to begin using your own thought processes to make your own decisions which this movie should spark.</fullReview>

This man, the director of movie, is very cynical and mean scoundrel. His main target was to defile president Bush. He don't want to find the Truth about Bush. He is a fake man. I don't believe he has any feelings about mothers who lost their sons in Iraq.

		<shortDescription>Great work Mr. Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that it's a great movie. I love the way Michael Moore gets his opinion through to the audience. Some of the methods might be a bit harsh like providing us with a close-up at the dead bodies, both soldiers and Iraqis. Other than that, I indeed enjoyed the humoring touch that he gives this film. I especially enjoyed the one with the president in a cowboy-movie with Donald Rumsfeld and Tony Blair at his side (almost like the real world), and also those scenes where he's on vacation, playing golf. These scenes amuse me. There are both strong and unimportant scenes, like there is in any movie, but one of the strongest and most overwhelming is definitely where the mother of a dead soldier tells her, and her sons, story. It made me cry the first time I saw it, because it is so sad. Especially when she's reading his last letter and when she stands in front of the white house. This is any parents' nightmare. These scenes touched me very intensely. It is very clear that Mr. Moore is trying to manipulate us, he even succeeds with many. But I admire his courage to stand up and face the president even though Bush tells Moore to 'go and get a real job'. He is a man with a point of view and a story to tell, and I think his thoughts are brilliantly shown in this film. I love manipulation, and especially when it's shown with a humoring approach. The way he manipulates with different kind of clips, music and quotes from the president has been put together so clearly to manipulate us, provides this film with one single big question. Is this the truth?Indeed it will make a difference. Why else would it be so controversial? Why else would it be discussed all over the world? There are so many opinions about this movie and what it contains, that it would be strange if it didn't make a difference.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't going to right a comment on this film! But after reading the comments written by predominantly Americans but by one Bitish women i had to write something! OK its a propaganda documentary Micheal Moore is biased, he cleverly manipulates images and interview BUT that doesn't mean its not true! It takes shock tactics to wake up an ignorant blinded by bulls**t nation.The whole rest of the world knows this stuff is true, how can the Americans not! You can bury your heads in the sand and say its all lies "by the liberals" (I'm not a liberal I'm from a forces family in England), but i can assure any American that they are one of the most corrupt, hated countries in the world, they have the most misinformed population and are the leading funders of terrorism! They are the biggest cause of political unrest in the west! The whole reason the UN (who did not sanction the war - contrary to what some Americans have written) thought that Iraq MAY have weapons of mass destruction is because thats what they were told by US intelligence officials, ON THE BASIS THAT THE US HAD SUPPLIED IRAQ WITH MASS CHEMICAL WEAPONRY IN THE FIRST PLACE!! Which they used to massacre over 1 million Iranians.The fact is that this documentary showed things that people don't want to acknowledge. The war was used to divert attention from the political corruption in America. Look at what happened in New Orleans the country has hidden its poverty and its own people that it blatantly couldn't care less about! Its all good throwing your weight around the would whilst your the biggest power but in the next 10 years that will be Europe and China. Americas going to get a big wake up call if it thinks it can get away with doing what it likes and invading any country it pleases!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem is that there is little that those who are paying attention won't know. There are, of course, some little things, and some horrible shots of injured and dead Iraqis, but I don't think many will get angrier for seeing F9/11. Worse yet, I think it would bore an audience of fence-sitters, because there's nothing much that conclusive and, really, there's not much that's enormously damning. There are things that even I could think of that he could have brought to the attention of those who don't know, like the staged toppling of Saddam's statue in Baghdad and what it implies that the American media went along with the staging, or how about the Jessica Lynch incident? I guess it's that Bush probably didn't have any personal dealings with these events, but Moore should want to demonize the entire administration, which he only does to an extent (Bush's cronies seem only that). I appreciate what Moore is trying to do, of course, but, as a film, this is his weakest ever. It barely has an arc, and, when it was ending, I couldn't even tell. I'd much rather watch even The Big One. By the way, the funniest thing about this movie is the imdb ratings page. You've got to check that out! I did laugh at the film once in a while. The rest of the audience was laughing and gasping appropriately, loudly so that you could hear them. But the most telling moment was when Bush said something along the line of "We were caught unawares" and a good amount of the audience, probably something like 3/4, laughed hysterically. A couple of people even repeated the word "unawares" with a sharp laugh afterwards. On the other hand, at the end of the film, someone shouted very loudly that Moore wanted to inspire an assassination of the President, so it just goes to prove that almost everyone is stupid. Except me! 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Adaptation of the Polemic "Dude, Where is My Country" to the Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of Michael Moore and I read his impressive book "Dude, Where is My Country" some time ago. "Fahrenheit 11/9" begins with an adaptation of this polemic book to the screen, complementing with a great research of image and sound, what was brilliantly written about the the events after the September, 11th. In the last part of the documentary, Michael presents the effects of the invasion of the Iraq in the breast of some American families, who lost sons or relatives in Iraq, and the testimony of some mutilated soldiers. I believe he should have spent much more time showing the drama of the Iraquian families, who lost their relatives and properties, the destruction of the Iraquian cities, museums and archaeological fields, to show how insane bombing is. The title of this documentary makes an analogy with Ray Bradbury's novel, adapted to the cinema by Franois Truffault in 1966, when in an oppressive future society, books are destroyed by fire. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature where paper burns, while Fahrenheit 9/11 would be the "temperature" where freedom burns. The documentary ends with a great citation to George Wells' 1984 and the magnificent song "Freedom" of Neil Young, from the album of same name. In the future, I believe this movie and "Dude, Where is My Country" will be part of the scholarship curriculum for the next generations. Just in time, from Yahoo! News, "last Saturday at Hollywood's Ivar Theater, President George W. Bush was named worst actor of 2004 in Michael Moore's documentary "Fahrenheit 9/11" at the Razzies, an irreverent spoof of the Oscars. US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and pop singer Britney Spears were named worst supporting actor and actress for "Fahrenheit 9/11". In a passage from the documentary, Spears can be seen vigorously chewing gum and saying "I think we should just trust" the president". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Fahrenheit 11 de Setembro" ("Fahrenheit September 11th")</fullReview>

He is endowed with these freedoms by brave soldiers that fight to keep terrorists from bringing the war here. They started the war and our brave soldiers are fighting to stop this act of terrorism from happening again in the USA.

		<fullReview>When he won the Oscar for Bowling for Columbine, he got booed for saying his opinions of America, I wish I knew why. Anyway, Michael Moore returned in 2004 with another political documentary about three pretty big issues. Basically it was all about the Two Towers (obviously), the US military and political people and of course, the idiotic George W. Bush being president. Moore gave good reasons for Bush being an idiot, the shocking truths of the Two Towers destruction day (September 11th 2001), and the effect that the military and political people have on America (and the world). Personally, a documentary about guns and the effect they have on the world (Bowling for Columbine) is a lot more interesting than this quite depressing film. It won the Cannes Film Festival FIPRESCI Prize Competition and Golden Palm, both for Moore. It was number 8 on The 50 Greatest Documentaries. Very good!</fullReview>
