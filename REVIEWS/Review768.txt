		<shortDescription>"Ricki and the Flash" features a good premise and outstanding acting, but mediocre writing and directing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has to be tough to be the child of a living legend, especially in show business, but Mamie Gummer seems to be handling it quite well, thank you very much. The oldest daughter of multiple Oscar winner Meryl Streep, Gummer is making a name for herself in the family business. Like Emilio Estevez (son of Martin Sheen) and Angelina Jolie (daughter of Jon Voight), Gummer uses a family name (her father's last name) while establishing her own identity in film (and television). Like Jaden Smith (son of Will Smith), Gummer has joined her famous parent on screen while developing her acting skills. As a toddler, Gummer had a role in her mother's movie "Heartburn" (1987). As an adult, Gummer played a younger version of her mother's character in 2007's "Evening". (Gummer also had a brief scene in Streep's 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada" but that scene was dropped in editing.) In 2015, it's the mother-daughter team playing mother and daughter in "Ricki and the Flash" (PG-13, 1:41) ? and it's kind of hard to decide which actress did a better job.Streep plays the title character, Ricki Rendazzo, an aging rock musician. The film opens with Ricki playing a set of musical covers as the singer in a local bar's house band. She obviously loves what she's doing, but it's short of where she hoped she'd be, having to hold another job as a supermarket cashier to make ends meet (and then, just barely). Then, not long into the story, her other identity beckons. Pete Brummel (Kevin Klein) repeatedly calls her cell phone until she finally answers. He's not calling Ricki. He's calling his ex-wife Linda to tell her that their daughter, Julie (Gummer) has been dumped by her cheating husband and dad is worried about her. It's an understatement. Although she can barely afford the ticket, Ricki-slash-Linda hops on a plane from L.A. back home to Indianapolis to be there for her daughter. It's the most she's done for any of her children in over 25 years.As you might imagine, in her kids' eyes, this grand gesture isn't nearly enough to make up for leaving the family to pursue her rock and roll fantasy in the late 80s ? and having precious little contact with them since. Ricki's appearance sends the very depressed and highly-medicated Julie into a rage and a family dinner which includes her two sons (Sebastian Stan and Ben Platt) goes only a little bit better. During her short visit, Ricki makes considerable progress pulling Linda out of her funk, but when Pete's current wife (Audra McDonald) returns from a visit with her sick father, it's clear that it's time for Ricki to leave. It's back to California, back to the grocery store, back to the bar stage and back to her lead guitarist pseudo-boyfriend, Greg (Rick Springfield). As Ricki tortures herself over the sorry state of her relationship with her children, Greg comforts her and encourages her not to quit trying to make amends. As badly as she wants to make this better, an opportunity that arises to do just that still makes for a difficult decision.Considering the great pedigree of "Ricki and the Flash", the movie should have been better than it was. Oh, don't get me wrong ? the acting is top notch, but other aspects of the film were disappointing. Streep does her usual outstanding work (not to take her for granted, but this is Meryl Streep were talking about here) ? and there are award-worthy performances from Streep's fellow Oscar veteran (and former co-star) Kevin Kline, definitely from Ms. Gummer, from McDonald and even from Springfield. I expected more, however, from Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme ("The Silence of the Lambs") and Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody ("Juno").Except for one great line late in the movie, the dialog is unremarkable and often the story feels forced. In one scene, Ricki points out the double-standard for male and female rock musicians who are absentee parents, but fails to acknowledge that Ricki could have still done had more of a relationship with her children than she did. A few references are made to Ricki being a conservative (even though she's a musician in California and her family back in the mid-West seems pretty liberal), but never gives any context for that characterization or even makes it at all pertinent to the story. The script also fails to explain anything about the circumstances surrounding Ricki's departure from the family or much about how her career developed over the ensuing quarter century.Throughout the film, questionable writing and directing choices overplay many characters' disdain for Ricki to the point that the ultimate resolution of the story feels far-fetched. Even some of the camera work and editing seem unnecessarily melodramatic. The theme of family reconciliation is worthy and heart-warming, but for a story of an aging rocker trying to reconnect with family left behind, 2015's "Danny Collins" is a much better story and with equally good acting. The acting is the main reason to see "Ricki". The rest is just a small flash in the pan. "B-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meryl can rock, I mean really</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ricki(Meryl Streep) a 60 something year old former rocker, who plays gigs at nights, and is a big hit at the bar she plays at, but by day she works as a cashier at a supermarket. But one day Ricki gets a call from her ex husband(Kevin Kline) saying there daughter Julie(Mamie Gummer, Streep's real life daughter) is in midst of a mental breakdown after her marriage fell apart. Ricki flies down in hopes that she can help. But will be able to reconnect with the family she abandoned?Meryl Streep is good here, giving a good comedic/dramatic performance, and I really liked her musical talent also, I know she has showed it other films, but still always a joy. And she and Kevin Kline have such great chemistry. It was cool seeing Mamie Gummer acting with her mother, she proves that she is every bit as talented in acting. I hope she will fall into her own, and not being thought of as Meryl Streep's daughter. Rick Springfield is great as Streep's guitarist boyfriend. A great light on it's feet film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film committed to emotion rather than emotional mawkishness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ricki and the Flash" opens with Meryl Streep, boasting acid-washed articles of clothing that looks like it was stuffed away in a 1970's time capsule, half-braided hair, complete with rings, bracelets, and accessorized trinkets all over her body, belting out "American Girl" by Tom Petty. If this doesn't make her one of Hollywood's finest character/method actresses, I don't know what does.Streep plays Linda "Ricki" Rendazzo, the frontrunner of a band known as "Ricki and the Flash" that plays largely at dive bars and seedy nightclubs. Linda, in the meantime, slaves away at a supermarket job, bossed around by a manager half her age, making paltry wages whilst being estranged from her immediate family. One day, her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline) calls her up to inform her that their daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer) is going through a messy divorce after discovering her husband cheating on her. Julie, who has already attempted suicide and since ceased showering and eating, lives with Pete and, upon seeing her mother for the first time in years, is understandably disgusted and appalled that she now wants to play mother. Linda also learns that her youngest son is planning on marrying and subsequently not inviting her to the wedding. Trying to balance out this newfound mess and work things out with her present beau Greg (rock and roll star Rick Springfield), Linda tries to be a mother to those who always needed her and somebody people won't cringe at the thought of putting their faith into as a person."Ricki and the Flash" bears a seriously tragic angle from a character perspective, given the fact that while Ricki was an absent mother, chasing rock star glory and fame, she wound up being a cover band in diver bars, the result of a failed marriage, and the bane of her children's existence. Now, Ricki has hit middle age hard and, reflecting on her life and career, she has little to show for it other than a mess of circumstances and success that was never fully realized.Screenwriter Diablo Cody has a talent for making the most unattractive characters attractive in a way that's not condescending like an Adam Sandler film, yet not depressingly bleak like a Lars von Trier film. Cody is also unique because her films don't focus on characters wallowing in pity and self-loathing, but rather, actively trying to better themselves or making the best out of a bad situation. The latter is what Linda largely spends the majority of "Ricki and the Flash" doing. Instead of wallowing, she's being active in trying to be the mother that she never was to her children.Streep does some very strong work here, being a captivating presence all throughout the film and remaining an actress who can be trusted with any role in terms of delivering quality. It also helps that Cody knows her strong suits, which are complex characters with a lot of emotions yet no really clear-cut idea of how to express such emotions. The end result, however, is a duo that I never envisioned would work together, yet alone work so well together.As far as family drama goes, "Ricki and the Flash" finds itself positioned between the lesser "This is Where I Leave You" and the superior "August: Osage County." It's far more dramatic than I ever anticipated, not sacrificing rich, emotional significance for cheap comic ploys or mawkishness. However, there's a theatrical element to the film that undermines its emotions, particularly at the end of the film. Yet "Ricki and the Flash" exhibits a lot of undertones not routinely showcases by the mainstream, which make it such a commendable project, especially with a great actress at the forefront.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for Meryl Streep's performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ricki and the Flash" (2015 release; 101 min.) brings the story of Ricki (played by Meryl Streep), an aging cover band singer-guitarist. As the movie opens, we find ourselves in the Tarzana (LA) neighborhood bar The Salt Well, where Ricki and her mates are bringing us Tom Petty's "American Girl". The next day we see her at work as a cashier in a local grocery store. Ricki gets a call from her ex (played by Kevin Kline) in Indianapolis, who informs her that their daughter Julie (played by Mamie Gummer) is depressed as a result of her failing marriage. Ricki immediately flies out to Indy to comfort her daughter. At this point we're not even 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: the movie is directed by noted rock documentarian Jonathan Demme (Stop Making Sense; several Neil Young docs). Here he finds himself in familiar territory. The script is courtesy of Diabolo Cody (Juno, Young Adult). I have to tell you that I was surprised how utterly predictable the entire story line is in "Ricki and the Flash", I mean, not a single surprise or other deviation from a straight-forward path. I had expected more from Cody. Demme tries the best with the rather weak material. What should've been real tension between Streep's character and her kids, comes off pretty weak. The best line comes deep in the movie when her ex comments: "It's not the kids' job to love you, it's your job to love them!" So true. The one and only reason to watch this film is of course the timeless Meryl Streep, who easily looks about 15-20 years younger than her actual age (66, if you can believe it). Gummer (in the role of Julie) is Streep's real life daughter but you could easily mistake them for sisters. The movie's shooting was delayed so as to give Streep enough time to learn the guitar (Streep wouldn't have it any other way!). There are some nice side performances as well, none more so than Rick Springfield as her band made and romantic interest Greg. Kevin Kline as the ex is quite good too. The music plays a big role in the movie obviously, and in the end credits it is noted that the live music is performed by Rick and the Flash. Along the way, we get covers of Lady Gaga's Bad Romance, U2's I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, and many others. Bottom line: "Ricki and the Flash" is an okay but ultimately uneven and forgettable movie that stars one of the best actresses this country has ever seen. There is a reason why this movie only has a 59 on Rotten Tomatoes...The movie opened nationwide this weekend. Despite my misgivings for this film, I ended going to see this right away. The matinée screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was very nicely attended actually. If you like movies with a heavy emphasis on bar music, or are simply a fan of Meryl Streep, I encourage you to check out "Ricki and the Flash", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy, Pedestrian Story Saved only by Meryl Streep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As hard as I've tried, I just can't get on the Diablo Cody bandwagon. Yes, I saw Juno and Young Adult, both movies that I thought had great concepts and stories hindered by clunky screenplays. Cody's writing hints at much of what people complain about millennials: narcissistic, overly snarky, and the thought that being a special snowflake makes up for being a miserable, unlikable human being. Ricki and the Flash follows this formula once again.Sorry, but if you're a mother and you just ditch your family to selfishly "follow your dream", the family shouldn't just accept you back like it's no big deal. I just couldn't get past that. The story felt more like a Disney Channel Movie than anything else. I like Meryl Streep and it was kind of funny seeing her as a rockstar, but that was about the only good thing going for it. Her performance alone made up for an otherwise weak screenplay and generic story.Hollywood badly needs more female writers and directors, but Cody's flaws as a writer keep showing up movie after movie. She needs a co- writer or script doctor to help polish up the unrealistic dialogue, characters that appear more like cartoon characters than human beings, and humor that is more eye rolling than gut busting.I think I'll skip her next film, like I should have skipped this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "Ricki and the Flash" I expected an idiotic film, but found instead a shallow (and idiotic) one. Initially, the plot unfolds quite interesting and could develop into a conflict-ridden drama. Instead, the film bobs to a kitschy, vacuous feel-good movie of the vomiting kind. Given the cinema poster - had I really expected anything else from this film?Even the performance of some of the actors couldn't help this dull, meaningless story.P.S.: Is it really a spoiler to reveal the fact, that a Hollywood film has a happy end?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie with Meryl Streep in it is usually worth the price of a ticket. There is no doubt she is an accomplished actor as is Kevin Kline. Ricky and the Flash could have been a good movie, all the bits were there - a variety of personas, all with flaws, back stories, conflicts and interests. So I sat there through the whole thing just waiting for something to happen. And it didn't. All the stories that could have been developed and explored weren't. It was like we got introduced to each one, and then the director skipped straight to the happy ending without the story arch in-between. It left the characters feeling flat and undeveloped, no growth as people, no emotional involvement, no real change. In the end the movie could be summed up as 1/ Meet a bunch of characters who don't get on, 2/ play a bunch of old songs in a bar, 3/ Play some more songs at a wedding and everyone forgives each other and lives happily ever after.if you're a fan of Meryl Streep, or have some nostalgia for classic pub tracks then you might like Ricky and the Flash. If thats not your gig, you will probably wish you had gone to something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good afternoon respite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading mixed reviews for this movie and I make up my own mind - this is a delight, a relatively quiet film with some really good music. A story of a mother who went her own way and how she works to right a few things and make amends with her three children. Meryl Streep working with her own daughter was good to watch. Easy to see the genes working well together. Some of my favorite actors are in this movie - Kevin Kline is another actor that I would not miss a film of his, of course Meryl Streep - I love the variety of films she does and excels at. Audra McDonald - so good as the step-mother. This is a story of a mother who wants to be there for her daughter who is experiencing a heartbreak of her own., You get the impression that Rikki almost misses what she left. But she has a strong man by her side and has trouble letting herself acknowledging it. This is a good movie, a quiet family drama movie and as I said a movie with some great music. The last scenes make you want to get up an dance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard about how "intensive" Ms. Streep prepares for Her roles in Movies. She fell asleep on this one, she doesn't appear to know where to put her fingers for a G,C,D, or any chord for that matter.It would have maybe taken a week with a teacher .. so She wouldn't look like an imbecile, but this whole movie looks like it was made in a week, so I guess they didn't have time.More stereotypes, crammed into one flick I have never seen! I Love Johnathan Demme's musical documentary, but this was obviously made for an "ABC After School Special"! Meryl as a rocker is hilarious, she's about as much a rocker as Qeeen Elizabeth! Very disappointing piece of Hollywood Fluff! Typical jokes about gays, therapists, SSRI medications..TRASH!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than its reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bit gritty but not overly so. This film still has me talking about it the next day with the friend who accompanied me. It's subtle. I don't agree with another user review that it's predictable and trite - until near the end, I was afraid of disaster. Streep is not sweet nor sentimental. Mamie Gummer plays her daughter Julie very well. I thought that the film dealt with some difficult topics in a mature way without harping on too much. One of my favourite scenes is where Streep as Ricki and Kline as Pete, Julie's divorced parents, see Julie's recently strayed ex-husband in a bar with his new girl. Julie starts to head in to make a scene, and Ricki and Pete restrain her, and go make a very quiet scene themselves. Ricki gets off a parting shot at the new girlfriend and the ex that zings hard and is appreciated by the others around the couple. Kline is understated and nerdy, and has a streak of the rebel in him too. This film requires an intelligent, thoughtful view to appreciate its layered look at a woman who may or may not have made the wrong choices in life, who has some regrets but accepts responsibility for herself. I like a movie that requires thought to fill in the gaps. We think that Maureen paid for the whole band to come. IMO, it shouldn't have been released in the summer - too smart for a summer movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Potentially delicious teaming of director Jonathan Demme and screenwriter Diablo Cody with star Meryl Streep results in a surprising washout. Middle-aged bar band singer takes time off from her day-job as a cashier in southern California and returns to Indianapolis and the (now embittered) family she left behind for rock 'n roll success. Cody's writing is so facetious and 'cute' (always with a wink to the audience) that her script--already heavy with amateurish exposition--defeats the cast early on; before we can even adjust to the characters, they've been shaped by their clothes and their quips. Demme is eager to please, but his timing is perpetually off. Scenes that should work don't, while other sequences (such as a family reunion dinner that turns ugly) ramble on without a point. Ricki's family all take turns standing on a soapbox, blowing off steam. Cody can't introduce anyone to us without there being an agenda, and Demme underlines her every superficial point with close-ups that don't reveal anything (reality TV has more convincing confrontations than what we get here). Eternally misjudged and misshapen. We have no idea what Ricki has gone through in her career, what triumphs she may have had; Cody is too intent on giving us Streep as a Republican rocker (another clothesline to string conflicts on), backed by a troupe of musicians who are only there to hug her. The actress is clearly better than her material and fakes her way through. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This a movie designed for that select group of Meryl Streep fans, but not for me. The heavy sighs and 'poor me' attitude is not only getting old...it is old. She is a fine actor I guess, I don't see it, but that is me. She gets all sorts of acclaim, indicating I obviously don't know what the heck I am talking about. Too bad...it's my opinion - so tough luck. Now there are two things Streep is the best at and that is playing the consummate victim and letting out a very tiring, exhausting signature moaning-exhale. Sheesh, stop...please...it is so tooth- grinding irritating. Guess what, I am no fan as you can probably tell. Her scope of character is...well...Meryl...and thats it. I see one of her movies and cant help but think, 'Wow, she is playing Margaret Thatcher as Meryl Streep....amazing!' In this movie she plays a very special kind of person. She is this loser who bales on her family and returns after a number of years. This sluggy-lowlife trollop crawls back to her ESTRANGED family, declares herself the victim, and receives heroic accolades for donating a couple of minutes in rearing her child me is crowned heroine...yippee. Also this movie does not waste any time on its war on men. Bash a guy here, or a guy there...typical and unoriginal. This is movie worthy of missing completely, earning itself top-billing for Oscar Sweep. Hand me the barf-bag. I am glad I am done with this dribble and I want to unsee it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Can a Movie with So Much Talent Go So Wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Revering the director and cast, as well as admiring the screenwriter of "Juno," I was shocked and pained by "Ricki and the Flash." A few gems have successfully combining music and drama without being a musical, especially "Once." Not this one."Ricki" should be showcased in a film school course called "Movies Gone Wrong." (If you are interested in this phenomenon, read the classic article by Pauline Kael about her witnessing the process of the making of "The Group.") The dissection of this disappointing work starts with the script. The director should have either sent it back for rewrites or demanded a script doctor. Someone needed to rescue its relentlessly shapeless scenes, meandering plot lines, unnecessary throw-in details, half-conceived characters and contrived conflicts. This combination inevitably leads to a conclusion full of cheap sentimentality.In more detail, one must next focus on the characters and their arcs. We'll stick with the center of the movie, Ricki, an aging rocker who plays with passion in a bar band. She had long ago abandoned her role as a mother and wife to pursue her singular musical goals. The movie and actress depicts her as a self-centered, thin-skinned, unapologetic, non-introspective mess. Who cares about someone who fails to demonstrates any kind of consistent attachment with her children? The filmmakers' choice is a dead end leading to a no-coming-back dramatic cliff.They could have turned the character into a pioneer, one whose singular artistic drive might be off-putting, but whose uncompromising spirit inspires her children. In her arc, she re-balances her life, finds some humility, accepts responsibility for her neglect through action, but refuses to give up on her passion. She becomes a good enough mother, which is good enough for children. Her sons and daughter might settle for a parent who is flawed, but lovable and forgivable. Instead, the script makes aging rocker Ricki insinuate herself into her ex's life and their shared children, a family that has been basically good enough with the usual dramas. Even if you introduce a severely depressed daughter, played by Mamie Gummer, there's no parallel between the mother's self-centered abandonment and her daughter's recoiling from a short-lived, failed marriage. Then (SPOILER ALERT, but one that's not that big0, it makes the recently bankrupt Ricki talk this depressed daughter into skipping her therapy session and getting indulged at a spa. It becomes a plot turning point, but it's based on a phony conflict. Why not see the therapist together, let the sparks fly, then heal their wounds with a spa treatment. Instead the next scene shows the mother and step-mother arguing over spa treatment versus therapy and uses it as a pretense to create a war between two strong-willed women. It results in drama reduced to a lifeless spat.In the end, I found myself squirming over this self-indulgent movie, where the cast seems to be having much more fun than the audience, a cast hamstrung into depicting honest feeling in a phony, sentimentally contrived drama. We're left at the end watching essentially music videos by talented musicians that have no emotional resonance. It can make you turn your head away, embarrassed for this extremely talented A-list cast and crew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen every movie made by Meryl Streep and I think she is a GREAT movie actress. Having said that, this movie is vile! The only positive thing that can be said is that the other actors did not embarrass themselves like she did. Not for one second did I buy her as Ricki. It is the only sub-par performance of her career. Now the script and dialog - imagine a soap opera from the fifties. PLot - from the silent era in subtlety. Direction - the wedding scene is flat out incompetent in that not a single character reaction rings true. Now, Meryl's voice is not unpleasant, nor is it any good. For some reason, she tortures the audience with mediocre performance after mediocre performance for what felt like hours. By the way, I really hated this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Meryl? Oh Meryl?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, an actor cannot control the director, the editor, the writer, the DP or casting director ? they can only act the best they can. Without doubt, Meryl does just that, as she always does. She does what she does the best she can, never phones it in (unlike her generational male counterpart, Robert De Niro) and she's not afraid to look just *awful* in this role ? both tough and risky for a woman, but it simply is not enough. Even the near immortal Meryl cannot carry 90 minutes without support. But I get ahead of myself.Viewers will go to this movie expecting a tale of a "star" because that's how it's advertised, but that's not what will await them. This is a movie about something with which I have intimate familiarity: The life of a bar-band musician. Anyone who has done it will tell you that It can be fun, it can be mildly rewarding and it *will* give you plenty of good people stories, but there's little glory ? and less money. That they cast a top-notch crew of players (including the great Bernie Worrell on key)to get up and pretend to be amateurs is expected ? we really don't want to see mediocre musicians in movies ? but all they play is tunes we've all heard about 10,000 times. So there we have the bar band, "The Flash" that appears to have one gig and one gig only, at some east-LA quasi dive bar; The rest of the movie is this odd plot less mess about her leaving her family for the glory of the LA music scene and attempting redemption with her daughter (her real daughter, as it happens, who isn't half bad in the role). The film consumes FAR too much time panning across a band of top-notch cats playing '70s radio rock and gives short shrift to dialogue and plot, with the end being some attempt at a feel-good moment - another song - that just seemed? sad to me. Sad and incomplete. I get the feeling that they filmed a great deal of *something* that didn't look very good or just didn't work ? so they declared "More Merly on guitar!", slapped it together, sent it to distribution and ran for the hills.There is one really interesting moment in the movie ? not worth and entire sitting, mind you ? but interesting, when Mr. Streep lays her head down in Kevin Kline's lap ? ala Sophie's Choice ? one of those "film geek" moments? So we have that little nod to real past glory ? but aside from that, there is not much there for a fan of the great Meryl Streep to enjoy. This is, simply put, not a very good movie. Wait for it on Netflix. And wait for Meryl's next performance, which should, no must, be better.</fullReview>

In this film, we teach the future generations of America that it's completely OK to abandon your family and "pursue" your dreams. We also teach that years after the family abandonment, it's OK to just bounce right back in, assume the role, but only has the "cooler" parent that the child never got to meet.A typical low-brow, inadvertent man-bashing festival filled with cliché references and Meryl Streep being painted as the victim instead of the criminal that this movie would not have you to believe.It's truly sad when Hollywood stoops to this level in order to teach the wrong lesson to America, yet, ppl wonder why 20, 30, and 40 somethings has absolutely no regard for authority, responsibility, and maturity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you need a good unintended laff fest, this flick will provide it. Streep is about as rock-and-roll as ABBA. Oh, that's right! She was in Mamma Mia! also. She tries every trick in the book to look like a rocker and none of it works - too much make-up, wearing black all the time, weird hair, tough language. Yuck. Very few actors are convincing as rockers because the type of acting they employ is too theatrical and just not genuine. This is true of Streep. She creates a character through mannerisms instead of just being that character.The storyline is so soap opera that it also elicits laughter. Avoid this dog like you would... a dog... with rabies... and mange... and Ebola.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First at all I love Meryl Streep. I have a lot of respect for her career. Because of this I am chocked she played this woman who abandoned her children, to follow her "dreams". Being a crappy musician playing in crappy bars, struggling all the time, while her children's life is upside down. And, at the end of this movie everything is OK. Because she follows her dream. This is a joke!! After this movie I can see many, many women abandoning their children, because of a dream. Somehow you have a responsibility with the world. People follow you! Bring a message of Hope, Peace or something more meaningful Thank you for such impact in society Meryl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We both hated this film and walked out after 30 or 40 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I (both Baby Boomers) went to see this movie on a Sunday afternoon in August, 2015. The audience consisted of mostly women who were older than the two of us. The movie started off good enough...as we both were enjoying the music in the opening scene/s involving the band. We have seen Rick Springfield in concert, by the way, and we both are big fans of his.The scene at dinner, however, with all the people arguing and hating each other literally drove us out of the theater. This is a comedy ?? Who wants to see this kind of hatred and bickering on the big screen? Not funny at all for us, so we left and I could not wait to write this review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I really wanted to like this movie. It's Meryl Streep. She can act in anything, play anyone, right? Wrong. As much as I tried, I just couldn't buy Meryl as "Ricki" the guitar playing rock 'n roll lead singer of the "Flash." Most UNconvincing role she's played. Having to sit through each and everyone of her songs annoyed me to no end. I'm sorry to say this, but her singing voice was terrible. I know she also sang in "Into The Woods" but at least she was convincing as a witch in that film. Very disappointed that director Jonathan Demme decided to film each Meryl song through its entirety. Just didn't work for me. 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Empty Void with little to no drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ricki and The Flash is like going to a musical, but the musical happens to suck, you can't get a refund, and you're trapped in the theater waiting for some drama to unfold. After the first half of this movie, no drama or conflict happens. I'll get to that in a second but first the plot.Linda or Ricki however you like to call her, comes back home to comfort her daughter who she left to go fulfill her rock stardom dream. It seems that Julie, her daughter got dumped by her boyfriend and attempted to commit suicide. After that, nothing happens... ever.The problem I have with the movie is the chemistry with Streep and Gummer. Not that they don't get along, they do since Gummer is Streep's real life daughter. But after a freak out scene when they first meet again, there is no conflict between them. They get along perfectly fine. Considering the back-story the movie has given us, they shouldn't be getting along this easily. There is barely any drama in this movie after the halfway point. The movie needs more drama because without it, the movie is boring which in this case it is very boring! So what does happen after that? Well, Rick Springfield (Who is great in this film) and Streep have an off screen sex scene thank god and sells his guitar for them to go to his son's wedding and then after the credits they play one more song. Nothing else much in between.One thing I can praise is the soundtrack. "Cold One" is a definite contender for a Best Song nomination this year, the covers are really good and Springfield's guitar playing is absolutely incredible. Overall, nothing else is funny, nothing is sweet, there is little substance and nothing else happens. But I suggest buying the soundtrack for the full soundtrack or listening to it on Spotify to get the best part of the film. Nothing else56/100 C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meryl Streep, Rick Springfield, Audra McDonald and Kevin Klein are all worth watching in this predictable and sentimental movie musical. The problem really comes down to a mediocre script from Diablo Cody. I expected more from Academy Award winner Ms. Cody than this workmanlike and often tedious screenplay. The music is great and Streep is a super singer and along with Springfield, they turn in great performances. Audra McDonald is a gem who I hope to see more of in films in the future. The milieu of the sleazy bar in Tarzana where Streep and Springfield are the house band is fascinating. Too bad it all ends up to be nothing more than a tired wedding and predictable emotional resolution of a mother and her entitled children. Thank God for the music which director, Jonathan Demme, allows to play out at length - perhaps to fill in the time since the script was substandard. We all love Meryl Streep but I couldn't help but wonder, how did her daughter get that job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>She was Julia Child. She was Margaret Thatcher. She was Mamma Mia. And now Meryl Streep is Ricki Rendazzo, aging, nearly bankrupt rock singer living uneasily with a big consequential choice she made along the way?career over family. Her band, The Flash, plays the modest Salt Well bar in Tarzana, California, but they rock it. We already knew Streep could sing, and for this film she spent six months learning how to play guitar, coached by Neil Young (video). Ricki's lead guitarist Greg is played by Rick Springfield, and you can feel his longing to be more to her, if she'd let him. Back home in Indiana, her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline) is dealing with their daughter Julie, abandoned by her two-timing husband, now depressed, and suicidal. He calls Linda?Ricki is her stage name?to let her know, and she scrapes together enough money to fly back to see what she can do. Precious little, it appears?a classic case of too little, many years too late. Mother and daughter struggle to reconnect, and it isn't easy or even certain. Julie is played beautifully by Streep's real-life daughter, Mamie Gummer. (In profile, the two have exactly the same nose.) Some excruciatingly wonderful scenes, including a fancy-restaurant "family dinner" with all three of Ricki's kids, where accusations are the main course. Julie's seething glare could burn holes in a flimsier construction than Ricki. The pain and even humor of the situation are so sharp, you know no matter who gets the check, they've already paid. And, here's something unexpected. The parents act like grown-ups. Pete, his second wife Maureen (Audra McDonald), even Ricki and Greg?show business types of whom not much is expected, perhaps?show what they're made of when it really matters. Director Jonathan Demme keeps the film moving with no unnecessary drag and made the great choice of putting lifelong musicians in the band, including Funkadelic keyboarder Bernie Worrell, bassist Rick Rosas, and drummer Joe Vitale. They performed all the movie's songs live and with no overdubs?Springfield calls this brave of Streep, especially. Academy Award-winner Diablo Cody wrote the script. Rotten Tomatoes critics rating 62%, audiences 55%. I thought audiences would be kinder to it than the critics. The big complaint seems to be the script is predictable, but since there are only what, six plots . . .? it may in retrospect be predictable, but I didn't especially feel that while I was watching, and it was never that corollary of predictable, boring! As Glenn Kenny says in his mostly positive review (didn't like the ending) for RogerEbert.com, "One of the nicer things about the movie is how it avoids overt clichés while still partaking of convention."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're feeling suicidal, then this is the movie for you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If your entire family has been killed in a plane crash and you want to get in the mood to attend their funerals then this is the movie for you. Written by Diablo Cody, who won the Oscar for the utterly pretentious screenplay Juno, this is a grim as death movie about a middle aged woman who deserted her family for a failed career as a singer. Now penniless, Ricki (Streep) returns to visit her family because her daughter is getting divorced. Said daughter has attempted suicide because it's Meryl's fault for everything the dysfunctional family has endured since Meryl deserted them to follow her dream. Meryl's eldest son is getting married and she isn't invited to the wedding because her son hates her. Her younger son is furious at Meryl because she continues to have hopes that he will get married even though he is gay, not bisexual as she suspected. Her ex-husband, now remarried, a boring as hell character played by the talented but luckless Kevin Kline (who should have done ANYTHING but take on this role) just wishes she would shove off and die.) What is impossible to understand is why the whole family doesn't band together, bludgeon Meryl to death with baseball bats and bury her body out in the wild someplace. The endless, endless hatred and vitriolic abuse (and blame and blame and blame) that envelop Meryl from every angle is delivered in a wholly predictable and uninspired manner that with just a slight push could have made a hysterically funny episode for the old Carol Burnett show. Misplaced attempts to lighten the grim mood of the movie are played well by Meryl but seem totally out of place and simply don't work. There are a lot of good actors in this movie but their talents are wasted in a lifeless script by Diablo Cody, who seems to have scraped her ideas and characters from the under-boot of every sitcom currently on TV. EVERYTHING is predictable. The manufactured feel-good ending of the movie is dire, to say the least. As mentioned at the beginning of this critique, this is a movie to put you in the mood for attending a mass funeral. Do yourself a favor and give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this movie that bad it deserves a four? I was thinking about that and realized it was totally harmless and good hearted, but then I realized actually how dull this film is. How totally devoid it is of any originality and coming from Diablo Cody that hurts even more. This film is so by the book, not taking any single interesting turn not even its "rock'n'roll" spin could save it.When you are making a film that is fundamentally character driven, you have to start from interesting characters and interesting performances. Well, somebody forgot that here. There isn't one solid performance that makes it into the film. Every single thing characters say is never ever genuine or hear-felt and worse it is coming from characters that are absolute staples and that never have a three dimensional dynamic that makes them surprising. This is the girl whom her husband left, this is the damaged old lady that gets redemption in the end, this is the guy that seems straight but lets himself go smoking pot and so on. There isn't one aspect of the film that isn't surrounded by clichés, thing we've seen too many times before or predictable plot points. If someone phased out of the film for ten minutes regularly he or she would have absolutely no problems in getting back in because everything feels so been-there-done-that. And lets just talk about some of those montage scenes which seemed to be taken out of a montage parody by family guy, it was laughable.Yet, as I said, this is just harmless stuff. No statement is being made, there is no pretentiousness, there is no over melodramatic stuff that made me loose my temper. Everything is rightly light hearted and so you just go with it and have fun listening to the music and sitting in the theater. You won't laugh or cry. Unfortunately there isn't really anything serviceable from this film except the music, but then again there isn't even anything atrocious about it. It's just another dysfunctional family film we have seen too many times before and that we will keep seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it for Streep's bravura performance as aging rocker and not Cody's pedestrian script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you decide to see "Ricki and the Flash," see it strictly for another bravura Meryl Streep performance. This time the celebrated actor inhabits the body of one Ricki Rendazzo (aka Linda), an aging rocker who years earlier abandoned her family in pursuit of her dreams of glory as a rock musician. Streep's nuanced performance captures both the unrestrained stubbornness of a woman past her prime but one who still retains a big heart and perpetual esprit de corps.Unfortunately, there are not enough real surprises in Diablo Cody's script to warrant many declarations of approbation. The inciting incident appears realistic enough: Ricki's ex-husband, Pete, now a well-off businessman residing in Indianapolis, requests that she immediately fly out to her old haunts and help with their daughter Julie, who has been devastated after discovering that her husband cheated on her.Ricki, who has two jobs including one as a rock musician at a local bar as well as a cashier at a Whole Foods clone, can hardly afford to fly anywhere, but somehow scrapes together enough cash to make the trip. When she arrives there, the affluent Pete doesn't even offer to put her up in his palatial home and expects her to stay at a local hotel. Claiming indigence, Pete gives in and allows her to stay with the family (his stinginess is related to his anger over Ricki leaving him years earlier to pursue her "dream".)The Julie character is hardly what one would term a "feminist icon," as it's revealed that she attempted suicide after her husband's indiscretion. We learn nothing of Julie and her prior relationship with her husband and must be content to endure a rather lame comic scene where Ricki and Pete confront and berate the errant husband and his new girlfriend in a loud watering hole.Also in the mix are additional caricatures including Ricki's sons, one gay with a chip on his shoulder toward his mother and another who is engaged to be married (the fiancée also is hostile to Ricki.) Despite the hostility, Ricki manages to bond with Julie and helps her to overcome the singular event that prevents her from achieving some degree of self-actualization. When Pete's second wife, Maureen, shows up (refreshingly played by Audra McDonald), she reminds Ricki that her decision to abandon her family had negative repercussions. Ricki realizes she's no longer needed or wanted at Pete's home, so she high tails it back to California.The rest of "Ricki and the Flash" revolves around Ricki's relationship with Greg (played by real-life rocker, Rick Springfield.) He manages to turn her around after her bitter experience with the family back in Indianapolis. After Maureen invites Ricki to her son's wedding, Greg makes the unlikely decision to sell his precious Gibson guitar to pay for the trip.All's well that end's well at the wedding when the coterie of hostile family members become entranced by the performance by Ricki and her Flash band. They forgive Ricki for her past transgression and realize that she pursued her true calling for a reason.Ultimately most of the characters, except for Streep's "Ricki," do not pass the multi-dimensionality test. Cody's overall script is best described as "passable," but the plot manages to only attain pedestrian status. Despite this, Streep's performance is once again a sight to behold?and she even learned to play her own guitar parts during the scenes featuring the band playing all those big hit covers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hot mess in fact. Incredible cast and an idea that could have been interesting. I absolutely adore Meryl Streep, but I felt myself cringing every time she and her cover band performed. The last 30 minutes or so were painful, especially the last 10 minutes. Talk about a ham handed ending. I went into this with very low expectations and yet still found it disappointing.I read another reviewer who mentioned Kevin Kline putting his head in Meryl Streep's lap ala Sophie's Choice (which happens to be one of my all time favorite films). I'm glad I wasn't the only one to notice that strange connection. Sadly, I couldn't help but think what a crime it is to have Streep and Kline reunited in this terribly bungled film.</fullReview>

At first I didn't think it was all that bad, but then again I was at home sick with the flu, so I wasn't even in my right mind when I watched it. The characters were incredibly annoying and the story was predictable as taxes. Meryl Streep isn't even trying, Kevin Kline looks embarrassed to be in the movie, the girl who plays their daughter was annoying as hell - just whiny, immature and completely psychotic, same with the their eldest son, Sebastian Stan as the second son looked equally embarrassed as Kline, the girl who played Stan's fiancée was a whiny, stuck-up snob, and the woman that Kline's character married was condescending and self- righteous. The only redeeming feature of the movie was the eldest son's boyfriend and possibly Ricki's boyfriend, they were at least pleasant, particularly the son's boyfriend in the brief moment that he was on-screen. Oh, and they play the same two songs over and over and over again throughout the movie, so watch out for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gag Me with a Spoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do love the concept of a person seeing life through the prism of songs, and the Streep character seems to do that. I liked the opening scene in the bar. She sings a Tom Petty song and then tries earnestly to determine the year it came out. She does this because to a person like her that's important.Later when having a conflict with a stranger in a coffee shop, the guy storms out and says to his little daughter, "Come on Journey." Streep thinks about it and says to her own daughter, "That was a great band." Although "Tarzana" is an upscale community and not likely to feature a dive bar, which is where our protagonist heads the house band.By the way, "bar bands" don't just sing cover tunes. They sing original material that just isn't commercially viable. Streep's band was a cover band. John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band are a real bar band.There a few problems. We hear little or no back story about this old lady's history as a musician. We also hear little or nothing about how she would have been connected to a rich, educated dorky guy like Kevin Kline's character. Also, did she ever have any success or close calls with success before becoming a burn-out? I love Rick Springfield. But how does his character pay his bills? Did they show that? Maybe it was shown during a period when I dozed off, or when I was shopping online for a noose and a stool.I feel like the film makers didn't know if they wanted to make a serious drama, or a romantic comedy. I would have chosen to make a serious drama out of this one. There are so many cool possibilities of how to do it.Let's see more of her little depressing apartment and her job at Whole Foods. How did she meet her band members? What is it actually like to wake up every morning and be pushing 70, working as a cashier, and having all your best days or potential behind you? The cranky, younger, Streep-look-alike, her real life daughter was good. She had the same weird "off" kind of European look like her mom, and she played disgruntled well. The Kline character was interesting, but I would have liked to get to know him better.The gay son and the black second wife seemed obligatory, but I'm o.k. with that. You have to attract viewers, and it is possible for those types to be involved with the Kline character.The real problem, like others have mentioned, is that Streep did a caricature of her character. Of course she's talented and the music sequences are terrific, but I would prefer a more original take on the character, rather than just your basic "skanky" burn-out loser. Why would anyone even like her, let alone love her? Avoid this clinker unless you want to see the novelty of Streep looking like Bonnie Raitt on a hangover day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found Far too many of the scenes unoriginal and derivative. But this was only when they weren't cringe-worthy. That may be a little harsh... The performances may have been okay but what's the point if we have seen the exact same scenes in so many movies? It just makes you embarrassed for the actors. It's a mish-mash of half assed characters from other stories thrown in together in an attempt to make it interesting.Circles some generic, Rebellious mid-life/Parent-child crisis where the Leads argue, then come together to overcome the evils of other characters who we (surprise surprise) are given little to go on, except they must be bad. They ultimately all realise what they have to do by the time the uplifting piano music comes in at the end. Yawn.Additionally, some of the things I picked up on would not concern your average viewer but I think Meryl Streep does herself a huge discredit here. Having taken the time to learn some chords to flesh out the part of a veteran musician, you'd expect it to at least look semi-natural. It didn't. It looks like a science teacher doing 'Rap Music' to make the lesson interesting.18MIL! Spooooshhh.</fullReview>

I could not believe they played that card) 2. women oops: white women have suffered by being loved by average decent men....and its all a man's fault for a failed families(she had a dream man!)..and men are to have no adverse reaction to the mate fling them over 3. bad acting I mean so cardboard...but that is because it is filled with every family plot add on...gay...not real love...suicide...cardboard dad...add a random black person for shock? 4. All is forgiven by a song? no growth just here is a wrecked forest&gt; then full forest, no remorse or regret, Okay, let me smash your life to bits, kill your kids dreams and sing a song find myself and all is okay.I see why young people kill themselves they watched this and saw that there is no harsh truth, no self-respect, all men are scum or wimps, and no matter what people have to forgive you, no matter what you do. LIFE HAS NO VALUE IF YOU DON'T RESPECT THE FACT THAT IT IS ONCE AROUND, AND YOU GET BACK WHAT YOU DISH-OUT. MOMS AND DADS ARE NOT ALWAYS FORGIVEN, THEY ARE NOT BEYOND BEING HATED: AND YOU SHOULD HATE THAT WHICH ABUSES YOU...SHE DID NOT RESPECT HER HUSBAND, KIDS OR THERE ABILITY TO HATE HER ABUSE....would have been 100% better movie if the family had gained more self respect and rejected her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a mostly light movie about some serious topics, with some uplifting rock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing: it was smart for Diablo Cody to write that Ricki (Meryl Streep, of course it's her) and the Flash (one of them Rick Springfield of all people, he's real good by the way) as bar musicians in this present day and age. Would they, or could they, be playing more legitimate venues? Possibly. But it's clear as day that Ricki (not her real name, but as she jokes she was 'born really as Ricki') is not leading some great revolution of music - she just likes playing her covers of classic rock songs (with some new stuff, she doesn't leave the 'young people' out of Lady Gaga and Pink).It shows her and her group at a point in life that isn't the most ideal, but they can get by and play music in front of some kind of audience. This is her at her happiest and most in control, as in her day life, working as a cashier at a chain grocery store (always having to keep a smile on her face, as the condescending boss says), and in her personal life (her family hasn't spoken to her in a long time) it's messy to put it lightly, due to the thing of leaving away to go and follow her dreams.Ricki is not a sympathetic character, and this follows along with Cody from some other protagonists she's had (remember Young Adult), but also for Jonathan Demme, who has his first fiction feature in seven years, and his own previous film, Rachel Getting Married, was about another family f***-up who doesn't know how to get back in good graces, or even how to say the right things. I don't meant to make comparisons through this whole review, just to point out some interesting similarities, which end pretty much there aside from both movies also having weddings. In this case of 'Ricki', her daughter is in personal turmoil - Kevin Kline, father of her kids and ex, tells her that her husband left her for another woman and her marriage has effectively fallen apart - so she rushes to help her. How can she help her? In reality, Ricki's daughter tried to kill herself.Some deep stuff dramatically speaking is going on in the movie. So why is this actually kind of, sort of, a 'light' movie, in a sense? I think Demme is smart to keep Cody's script this way, and to trust the instincts of the material; there's no easy way to help Julie (Streep's own daughter, Mamie Gummer) except to make sure she gets the therapy she needs and attention she needs. In one fell swoop Ricki does one and not the other, by taking her to get her hair and nails done and missing her therapy appointment. It's a fun little scene - uh oh, she's using the family credit card again, wop-wop - but there are consequences. And yet what's also good is that Cody not only isn't shy of going to those awkward, cringe-type of scenes, she embraces them. The obvious one is when the family goes out to a dinner, and Ricki's estranged sons (one engaged, which she was ignorant of, and one gay, also ignorant but not in a good way). But watch as Maureen, the new wife and mother for so many years to Ricki's kids, lays it down as to why she really has to leave: what can she REALLY do here for her daughter? That Ricki's just out of the shower adds to the, shall one say, nakedness of the emotional truth here.Yes, there's some goofy stuff here, like the family finding some pot and smoking it and having some munchies and late-night guitar strumming, but Demme handles it without anything feeling too false or sitcomy. In the wrong hands this could be really disastrous, maudlin stuff. I think it's not a great film by any stretch, but the filmmakers are in sync with one another, and even find ways to make songs played on stage into dramatic beats; Streep and Springfield aren't just singing songs, they're acting and going through some emotional crises of their own, in small and big ways, all down to what it means to be a parent for one's child (love, as it turns out, is the thing a parent must do for their kids, not necessarily the other way around if it comes to it).So while there are some serious issues dealt with here - depression and suicide, marriage and relationships, abandonment issues, and what love can be shown as - music and a light, mostly comic touch, helps to level out the material. Indeed the climax is done almost like one of those old-time rock n roll movies (Demme has in the past decades done his share of rock docs, and his knack for finding the right angle and cuts shows very well), and as the band plays on at a wedding people can either get up and get into the music, or sit down like schlubs and not get into it. It's a nice, uplifting way to reach a conclusion to this story, especially considering what Ricki's done and gone through, an otherwise flawed and damaged individual (and as usual given a nice turn via Streep), and that music is the one thing that a) she's really good at, far as this kind of music goes on this level, and b) the family can see the good in her when she plays it. It's sincere, but heartfelt stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big surprise to me was Meryl Streep with a guitar. Turns out Meryl pulled this off really well, alongside Rick Springfield and Meryl also has a great voice for Rock &amp; Roll. I've seen it in a lot of flicks where it was clearly evident that the actor or actress with a musical instrument was not actually playing, just by observing their hand movements with the musical instrument but in this movie Meryl appears to be playing, and rather well at that.Corny, shallow plot line that's been played out on the Silver Screen so many times it isn't even funny but the novelty of this flick is that we get to see a terrific actress demonstrate yet another talent that proves her versatility as a professional actor. The movie's teaser poster suggests that and that is what we get. I reckon not a lot of actors can pull that off as smoothly as Meryl did in this flick.Definitely worth a look while it is still in a theatre in your town.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ricki and the Flash is a good enough film for fans of Meryl Streep, Jonathan Demme, and Diablo Cody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So Meryl Streep plays a rock singer who had one album that didn't seem to go anywhere and is reduced to playing at a bar for 8 years in this movie. She then finds out her daughter (Mamie Gummer, Meryl's actual offspring) is splitting from her hubby from Kevin Kline, who Ms. Streep was previously married to. There's more but I'll just now say that I enjoyed the musical performances especially "Drift Away". And Rick Springfield, whose song "Jessie's Girl" seems to be the only one of his hits on oldies radio nowadays, is also good as Ms. Streep's bandmate/current boyfriend. Also it was a nice surprise to see Charlotte Rae, who to me is always Mrs. Garrett on "Diff'rent Strokes" and "The Facts of Life", as the mother of Kline. Perhaps not a great film from director Jonathan Demme or screenwriter Diablo Cody, but Ricki and the Flash has its moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rating: (&#x2606;&#x2606; out of 4)This film is not recommended.In brief: No real sparks.GRADE: C+&#xfffc;Ricki has no flash. The film is a simple by-the-numbers story of yet another dysfunctional family who will fight and argue but be brought together before the end credits. It's a certainty whenever one is in this melodramatic territory. Yet with its superior cast and skillful director, expectations were still high. Unfortunately, there is no great build-up, no surprise revelations, no emotional connection. It's run-of-the-mill stuff. And while the musical numbers, of which there are many, give us a few sparks, the plot and characters lack any charisma or depth. Sadly, Ricky and the Flash is a waste of talent and time. The plot involves a free-spirited rock musician, Ricky (well played by Meryl Streep) who deserted her husband. Pete (an underused Kevin Kline) and her family to follow her path and become a rock star. Success still alludes her, although she has a younger boyfriend , Greg (Rick Springfield) who adores her. Now, she is called back into the life of her daughter, Julie (the talented Mamie Gummer, Streep's real-life daughter) who is having a traumatic breakdown. Ricki returns to help out and becomes an unwelcome guest and a liberating force as she must now come to terms with the lasting effects of her lifestyle decision. &#xfffc; Director Jonathan Demme seems more focused on the film's musical segments rather than the behind-the-scenes family drama. There are so many missed opportunities with the characters and their splintered relationships to further involve the movie-going audience, but none are realized.in Diablo Cody's fractured screenplay. Side plots about other siblings' lives are sidetracked and are incomplete in the telling. These could have been more compelling additions to the story, but they are overlooked in order to showcase Ms. Streep's vocal renditions.The actors do their best but the script doesn't give them enough gravitas. Streep is strong as Ricki, although her character's political vent remains an enigma. Kline is good in his scenes but his actions simply do not match his words as written by Ms. Cody. Mr. Springfield has loads of charisma and has a nice screen presence. Ms. Gummer is excellent and brings a subtle vulnerability to her character. Her acting is impressive and would make any mother proud, including her own. Audra MacDonald as Pete's wife adds greatly to her small role and Sebastian Stan and Nick Westrate as Julie's brothers are both fine, even if their roles don't amount to much on screen.&#xfffc;Ricki and the Flash is somewhat entertaining mostly due to its cast, but the film rarely gives off any sparks. It could have been better.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meryl Streep ROCKS Literally!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to think of anything that Meryl Streep hasn't done in a career that goes all the way back to the 1970s. But with RICKI AND THE FLASH, we find out something brand new. She rocks! Literally! Re-teaming up with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS director Jonathan Demme (the two had worked together on Demme's 2004 updating of the 1962 Cold War classic THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, where she played Angela Lansbury's part), Streep stars as Ricki Randazzo, a wanted-to-be rock and roll star who had one brief moment of success in the 80s, but is now consigned to play out her strings (all six of them) out at the dingy Salt Well club in Tarzana with her band The Flash and her boyfriend (played by Rick Springfield, he of "Jessie's Girl" fame). But soon, she has a calling from Indianapolis; the family she left behind to follow her rock and roll dreams is rapidly falling apart, most noticeably in the suicidal tendencies of her daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer, who is Streep's real-life daughter), and her ex-husband (Kevin Kline, teaming with Streep for only the second time, the first being 1982's SOPHIE'S CHOICE) trying to hold things together with a new wife (Audra MacDonald). With real life intruding in, the collision of her love for performing and wanting to set things right with her family, Streep's character sometimes looks like she's closer to having a nervous breakdown than even her own daughter. But with Springfield's help, she comes to her daughter's wedding (with the band in tow, unbeknownst to the uptight, upper-crust crowd there who know very little of her past), and manages to redeem herself in a lot of great ways.Streep, who had done music-themed movies before (having done her own singing in 1990's POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE, and portrayed a music teacher in 1999's MUSIC OF THE HEART), just doesn't seem capable of doing any wrong in films, and so it is sometimes quite easy to take her and her generation for granted (though contemporary Hollywood often seems to take that generation for granted way too many times). Playing Ricki, however, was quite a stretch for her all the same; and she manages to pull it off quite well, doing quite the job of playing acoustic and electric guitars and singing for this role in a way that, dare one say it, could have her in line for yet another Oscar nomination, if not another outright win. This shouldn't take away from the other great supporting performances, including Springfield, Kline (whose wryness and off-the-cuff humor are exceptionally refreshing), and MacDonald, let alone Gummer, who has some extremely interesting scenes with her mother (though reportedly they spent very little time together off the set during the making of the film per Demme's instructions). Demme's direction is also quite good (he refrains from doing the straight face-on shots of previous films); and the film features longtime Eagles/Joe Walsh backing musician Joe Vitale as the Flash's drummer, and a soundtrack that includes a lot of rock classics that Streep sings on her own (quite well, I would add).This is not a typical summer-movie flick with high-octane action (unless one considers Streep's stage presence an example of an "action" scene); and yet RICKI AND THE FLASH will likely end up being considered one of the best films of 2015. It's already one of mine, for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmmm?.I watched this as part of my Sebastian Stan marathon, and when I read in the credits that Meryl Streep was playing the main character, I thought 'good, its going to be a good movie'.Unfortunately I was wrong.I was disappointed with Meryl Streep's performance, but I think it had to do with the weak character she had to play. Here's my point. The story is weak and poorly written. I guess if you're an actor/actress and get this kind of role, you could be a 10 and yet the outcome will be poor.If the idea was to show the love of a mother and make Ricki a victim, it failed big time. Sure, in fantasy land the mother that abandoned everything and everyone to follow a dream and comes back years later expecting everyone to accept her and love her just because she gave birth to those kids? Yeah that would work in fantasy land. It's like thinking that one day Prince Charming will knock on your door holding a crystal slipper. Happy ending, the end.But the things that happen in this movie don't really make sense. And it sends the wrong message: be irresponsible, leave everything and everyone behind because at the end years later, they have to be there for you accepting you with open arms.My comment regarding Sebastian Stan: whoever chose him to play the role of Josh made a good decision. He played well the role of the forgiven son that was the glue between those that didn't want to see Ricki again, and Ricki. If you are a Meryl fan, go ahead and watch it. But if you aren't, Id say there are other good movies to watch before this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Meryl Streep and I have been wanting to see this movie since watching the trailer. Finally got around to it, and this movie is a MESS. Had Meryl's character (Ricki) been a man, this would have been a heartwarming movie about trying to get back into your kids' good graces after leaving years before. In a way, this movie is just that, but the awkwardness of being a poor wannabe rock star going to see their well- off relatives and being more than welcome with talking about their finances, just made me gag the whole time.I get that they were going for "I had a DREAM and it just doesn't pay the bills, but it's okay I'll just joke about it!" sort of view but I am already uncomfortable when my relatives ask for money, I don't want to watch OTHER people's relatives do the same thing. Too real.I enjoyed Julie's lines the whole time, she's sassy and funny, I dig it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ricki and the Flash AKA Meryl and the vanity project</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Getting the obvious out of the way first: Streep is the best actress, perhaps of all time, and she can do whatever she likes in the most natural way. But here she doesn't ...do anything special. She is a rock chick. She done the music stuff much better in Mamma Mia. But what about the movie. The film stars her real-life daughter, who being recently separated, (both in RL and here) becomes an opportunity for Ricki to reunite with the family she ran out of years ago. The script is by Diablo Cody who wrote the amazing Juno, but his one is spark-less. The film simply never gets off. And the message? That you can ran out on your family, have your self-indulged life with boyfriends and rock music and yet, still managed to go back and in a few days be loved by all again? I am a traditionalist, I know, but I simply can not accept a message that glorifies family fragmentation. I reckon this was just a vanity project for Miss Streep. "Hey, did you know I can sing rock as well? Perhaps I'll even learn to play electric guitar for this one. Done all the accents, lets start on the instruments". Or something like that. Waaayyy to many unnecessary songs, unless the above is true.</fullReview>

I feel like the scenes are written for a 5th grader smoking pot and, unfortunately, it just gets worse and worse as the movie goes on until it finishes with an ending that was so bad I couldn't even look!

		<shortDescription>Movie is fairly good, but Meryl Streep is Always great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>27 November 2015: Meryl Streep is one of my favorite movie actresses. Meryl never does a bad performance, the same way that Robert Deniro and Denzel Washington, Julia Roberts and Morgan Freeman never does a bad performance. They are always great.Anyhoo, I did not see this movie in the theater when it first came out. I only saw it because of Meryl, but then I was happy to see that singer/actor Rick Springfield {Dr. Noah Drake of General Hospital} was in a co-star role in the movie. I have always like Rick as a singer and okay as an actor. Rick is perfect in this role because he is playing a singer who plays a guitar and Rick does that in real life. Also I liked the fact Mery's real life daughter is acting opposite of her. Two of my all time favorites of Meryl is her in "August Osage County" and "Devil Wears Prada". There are a-hole bosses like her role in "Devil.Over all, I ended up liking the movie, not a top fave with me, but not bad either. It is worth a matinée price ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Written by the writer of Juno &amp; is very much that style. Dysfunctional family problems that come off as real &amp; not forced.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sometimes a girl just needs her mother." Ricki (Streep) is a full time rock star and part time mom. When she is called home to help her daughter Julie (Gummer) who is going through a divorce everyone remembers why she is only a part time mother. All of the tenseness from the past come back up between her and all of her kids and she starts to wonder if she made the right choice with her life. Meryl Streep is a great actress, everyone knows this. The thing that is borderline annoying is that besides being a great actress she can sing, play guitar and pull off playing an aging rock star as perfect as playing a Prime Minister with dementia. As far as the movie goes I did like it but it's nothing super amazing. This movie is written by the same writer of Juno and is very much that style of a movie. Dysfunctional family problems that come off as real and not forced. This is a movie worth watching, but a hard one to review. There is a lot of real, believable conversations in this and the movie keeps you interested and watching the entire time. Overall, nothing that will win any awards but a good and fun lighter movie that is worth watching. I give this a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm trying to comprehend how such a milquetoast excuse for a theatrical release film came into existence. I imagine there was some type of meeting that went like this.Exec: The Meryl wants to do a role where she plays rock guitar, and Mamie is only allowed to be in A-LIST MOVIES WITH A-LIST PEOPLE. Round up whatever Oscar winners you can find who need a quick couple of million. ... A bit laterExec: Diablo, HIIIII! Write something.Diablo Cody: Um, like what?Exec: Oh, it doesn't matter. Just string together English words that follow each other. Oh, oh, I know. Make it about a mother daughter relationship because then it will be a bit like Postcards from the Edge - but now we have real life mother and daughter actors available. And make Mamie's hair be all messy at the beginning, because we think she can manage to act that. Jonathan Demme: What do you want me to do?Exec: Well, maybe tell someone to turn on the camera at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day shout CUT - do whatever you like in between. OK, so this wasn't the most egregious example I can think of where a movie was made apparently as a paid vacation for the madly-remunerated ATLs while the audience, spending their own hard earned money had zero amount of fun (A Good Year, The American, Last Vegas etc.), but it's up there in the same league.

		<shortDescription>Meryl Streep rocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be the rock film of the year. Meryl Streep plays an aging supermarket cashier who spends her evenings playing Stones and U2 music in a club for a faithful audience of a few tens of people, many of them her age if not older. She has a history. She left her family, three kids, a comfortable life as the wife of a corporate executive about 25-30 years ago in order to follow her dream. Playing music. She does play music, but never could make a living out of it. She actually hardly makes ends. Then, the past calls. Her daughter goes through a divorce, tries to commit suicide. She is called on mother duty. She, who left mothership to fulfill a dream that never happened.The film worked for me on several levels. Music is part of the life of the characters and there is good music in this film, and some of the best scenes are the ones filmed in the music club. Whoever played music or just loves music will immediately relate to the characters that play on stage and those who sit in the audience, vibrate at the sounds they like and are stoned while tunes that they do not like are played, jump and dance when the right music is played. To a certain extend the film is about the differences between the world of passion and the world of conventions and routine. But then it's also a film about the relation between following individual happiness and sharing time and life with the family. Ricki in this film follows her dream and leaves everything behind. She could have been the happy rich wife of a corporate executive and live in a luxurious cottage in a privately guarded exclusive area, but chose a different path. This path practically failed, success did not come, she hardly meets ends, and never did a second disk. The highest price however is the broken relation with her children who grew to call another woman 'mother' and did not even bother to invite her to their weddings. She has just one thing to balance all these losses - her music. Will this be enough? Need I say again that Meryl Streep is phenomenal? It seems nowadays that any role she plays is up to the Academy Awards nominations level, and this one is no exception. She also sings, and she also brings to screen the insecurity, the age and the dilemmas of the character. Mamie Gummer, Streep's daughter in life is also her daughter on screen, and her creation is remarkable. It's not easy to share screen with your own mother, and even less when the mother is Meryl Streep with all her charisma - yet Gummer's Julie is alive and real, fighting her personal daemons and breaking gradually the wall of mis-communication between the two. Rick Springfield does the fine expected role especially when on stage and all the rockers club numbers are credible and emotional. One can see that director Jonathan Demme (of Philadelphia fame) loves music and is also well exercised in documentary. He made a film which looks a little conventional and melodramatic in it's family drama part, but comes to life and is at best when it deals with music. Probably the best rock film of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A light drama and musical buffed up by Meryl Streep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing in this world that Meryl can't do. In her variegated film roles, she has played almost everything. She has gone grim to witty, to fun, to casual. Every cup of tea is hers. Even at the age of 66 she is so full of energy and she doesn't fail to deliver. She keeps experimenting with new personas and always ends up creating a new character altogether in every flick she does.We see another side of her in Ricki and the Flash. She plays a washed-up wannabe rockstar who fails to make it big but apparently walks out on her family. Pete played by Kevin Kline calls her to his home to check on her daughter (real-life too) Mamie Gummer who was going through a hard time. This becomes Ricki's chance to make amends with her children, and at the same time, buff up and fix things with her current love affair band member Greg played by none other than Rick Springfield himself. The drama is brilliantly helmed by Jonathan Demme, although the tone of the drama is deliberately kept jovial. This makes the melodrama look mediocre. I just wished things to heat up and the mother and daughter bits to blow out of proportion like August: Osage County. But it did not.But boy can she sing! Meryl performs many different songs in the movie and all her versions are downright brilliant. The song 'Cold One' which she performs cozily sitting on a sofa is absolutely marvelous. There is one thing terribly wrong with the movie though - its editing. There are full songs that have been shoehorned into the flick that makes the movie a tad long. Also, the screenplay doesn't have much in its basket. The movie also craves for profundity which gets lost owing to the comical theme of the flick. Apart from that the movie works like a charm, and is one hell of a family flick, which I am sure your parents would love too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Having worshiped at the acting alter of Meryl Streep since 1977 (her brief appearance in Julia), this frequent movie-goer takes great delight in seeing her donning a leather jacket and bangles while strumming an electric guitar. Somehow she continues to expand on her already unmatched diverse resume of movie characters ? this time as an aging leader of a cover band that plays to a small but loyal audience at a Tarzana bar.Ricki is no rock star, though she clearly chased the dream. We learn of this when we see her working as a checker at the local supermarket, and then again when her ex-husband (Kevin Kline) calls her home to Indianapolis in a desperate attempt to pull their daughter Julie out of a suicidal depressive state brought on by her husband leaving for another woman. Julie is played by Ms. Streep's real life daughter Mamie Gummer, and their bond plays out well enough on screen.The movie's peak occurs with the family dinner scene, as Ricki is united with her three kids, including sons Josh (Sebastian Stan ? known in the Marvel world as Bucky Barnes) and Adam (Nick Westrate). It doesn't take long before true emotions are bubbling over causing much discomfort throughout the restaurant. See, Ricki left her family to chase her music dream, leaving Kline and his second wife Maureen to provide a sense of normal family life. Maureen is played by six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald, who sadly doesn't get to "flash" her famous singing voice in a movie that is comprised of songs for about half of its running time.Director Jonathan Demme (an Oscar winner for Silence of the Lambs) and writer Diablo Cody (an Oscar winner for Juno) inexplicably drop the family drama soon after the dinner scene and we spend most of the second half watching Streep and Rick Springfield play out their dysfunctional relationship onstage. If you are unfamiliar with Springfield, he was a pop star in the 80's and was the Dr. McDreamy predecessor while on "General Hospital". Lately you may have seen him as the creepy plastic surgeon on "True Detective" ? he looks much more normal here.The band does a nice job with the familiar songs, and Streep is effective as the lead singer and audience favorite. However, even with Demme's stellar track record with musical documentaries (Talking Heads, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen), it's difficult to understand why so much time is devoted to the musical performances after the extensive family drama set-up. A perfect example is that once the final act hits, Julie is given no more dialogue. It's a strange turn.The script does make a couple of very interesting points. The first involves the repercussions of a mother in chasing her dream ? Ricki compares herself and perception to that of Mick Jagger. The second involves addressing the "job" of parents to love their kids. Either of these could be the central theme of a very interesting film, but as with other topics, the surface is barely scratched in this film. Despite the odd choices made by writer and director, it's clear Ms. Streep is loving her time on stage ? her version of Dobie Gray's "Drift Away" is alone worth the price of a ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes a family film can rock too. And Meryl is definitely not too old for this ... well you know what! And while Kevin Kline has some moments to shine too, this is all Streep. And it's nice to see her in a role where she can explore other things too. She's not always likable, especially when it comes to her parenting skills (if some would call it that).But in life you decide certain things and then you either stick with them or maybe sometime along the road you learn from them. It's never too late, or is it? The movie while high on rock and song numbers, is not a musical at all. The drama part is big and the relationships worth exploring not to mention nicely played out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They tried too much to make Meryl's character look bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, it still beats me how a mother could leave a family and thoughtlessly go pursue a "rock and roll" music career, but I am not one to judge. At least, that genre of music (Rock) is what the film is about with established veteran/Oscar-winning actress Meryl Streep playing the mom/rock star: Ricki. However, I still have this feeling in my guts that maybe; I saw a heavily edited version of the film. My reasons for saying so stems from the fact that when you consider the context of the state of affairs, it creates this hunger for some exposure or peek into past events-events that heavily inspire the present if you consider the stiff interplay, not to mention bold awkwardness between supporting characters and the main.The plot is padded-no doubt about that. Looking back at it, I still feel it could work as a family drama if they attempt to ditch the music linkage and core significance to the plot. Nevertheless---- still, it is not a bad idea considering the ambitions of Meryl who puts herself in a role many other actresses her age would avoid. It might even be eye candy for her fans. And in the role, she seems quite believable-thanks to the costuming department as well as the composer of the songs sang on screen. Despite her age, she is still able to bring vigour to her character.But that is not to say I am still detracting from my former statement which is: "the film would still work as a family drama". The whole rock thing still gives it an appealing feel, but the director omits a lot of things while delving deeper and spending time on the "stage". Abandonment issues are mentioned here. Not just mentioned, it reverberates through the storyline of the film paving way for understandably elitist attitude and traces of rancour. The neglect issues should have been explored more. It might make the texture of the film a little bit smooth and simple, but specified the solid identity the director has vested in each character (the family, I mean) ---it would make the few occurrences of bickering much more worthwhile.Rather the music premise overshadows this-blinding us from the central issues-giving an illusion that a wedding performance will elicit forgiveness from the offended. Funny enough, we still don't know if Ricki was pardoned by her kids. Or maybe, the director should have executed the storyline in a more proper chronological manner right from the point she says good bye to her family-another option, but the lesser of two evils. That way I won't feel as if the first act should be the second. And probably, it would give us more insight into rationale for deeds. Even perhaps, make Ricki look less bad in the audience's eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you've ever dreamed of seeing Meryl Streep in concert...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... then this is the movie for you. Unfortunately, neither my wife nor I had that dream. When there was dialog, it was generally entertaining, but way too many songs were played in full, and the movie seems to have been written for the baby boomers who want to reminisce to the music of their youth. The storyline itself was OK, but I'd have liked to have seen more interaction between the mother (Meryl) and her kids. As always, Streep is very good, as are the other actors, but I just don't think there was way too little story and way too much performing. Really, we could get the gist of the meaning behind the songs with regard to the storyline without hearing the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ricki Rendazzo (Meryl Streep) plays covers with boyfriend Greg (Rick Springfield) and her band the Flash at the local band. She had left her family years ago to chase her dreams in California. She gets a call from her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline). Their daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer) is suicidal after getting divorced from her cheating husband. She tries to work out their absent relationships.Meryl Streep is the greatest. Mamie Gummer working with her mom has never been better. Streep's scene with the new wife Maureen is exceptional. It takes the movie to another level. Then the movie stumbles by going back to California. It sputters as the audience tries to care about her relationship with Greg. The compelling family relationships are sidelined and it takes forever to return. It would have been a better move to get Greg out to visit the family so that there wouldn't be such a break. It's good that Streep is able to keep the movie going all the way to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Casting Cher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ricki and the Flash was a most entertaining film and the music was delightful. My only objection to the film is that I personally felt the principal character Ricki was a wrong choice in casting. We all know Merrill Streep can play any Genre with ease and passion. Don't get me wrong Merrill did a wonderful job as she always does, she is an actors actor. Being the character was a rocker I felt Hollywood has a rocker right in its mist and that person is Cher. Sometimes Hollywood has a love affair with certain actors and does not necessarily look for the best fit for a script, I have seen this happen quit often. It was brilliant casting Merrill's daughter to play her daughter, she performed well and it was nice to watch mother and daughter work off of each other. Kevin Cline was great as Ricki's ex- husband. Rick Springfield was a nice choice as one of Ricki's band members, I remember his music well, he also aged well. This is one for a family. Over all the movie was a delight. I just which casting would have considered Cher as Ricki</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable lightweight Streep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you cut out half of the unnecessary songs, this one hour forty minute movie would barely pass an hour's worth of entertainment. You definitely get the feeling that they were padding the band scenes with way more songs than were necessary for moving the story along. Having said that, the music was pretty enjoyable. Streep's voice is sometimes solid and sometimes wanders all over the place, but Rick Springfield, his guitar playing (and his eyeliner) were fun to watch.The family dinner restaurant scene was squirmingly funny. And the scene with Streep dressed only in a towel and having a full and frank exchange of views with the 'other mother' was well done. Difficult to know if the new daughter-in-law was supposed to be prissy and uptight or sweet. She was the one jarring note in an otherwise well-acted story.The couple of anti-Obama political comments by Streep's character on stage were just odd. It made me wonder if they are Streep's views or those of the writer/director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Great Film but Streep Brings It On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How often have people said, it wasn't a great movie, but Meryl Streep is worth watching (I think of The Iron Lady, for example). In this one, a rock and roll singer (sort of reminded me of Bonnie Raitt) continues to ply her trade. In the past, she birthed three children, a girl and two boys, who have left her life. Her ex-husband calls her and says that the daughter is having serious trouble and it would be good for her to come to Indianapolis. She is totally broke and must use every available cent to get there and then live off her wealthy ex. He doesn't mind. But her daughter is hugely resentful of her, blaming her for her foibles. Played by Streep's actual daughter, she is a piece of work. Unfortunately, this slips into a maudlin, predictable presentation, much too contrived and simplistic. The final scenes, while a bit touching, are beyond the pale. But Streep again manages to make silk purses out of sow's ears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite rather negative reviews, I still wanted to see the great duo from Sophie's Choice at work again. Despite the immense talents that are Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline, the movie never really takes off and finally leads to not much to do about anything. The only one, who gets away with a certain authenticity, is the improbable Rick Springfield singer-songwriter and sometimes actor. This slice of life of a slightly dysfunctional family concludes with a song and a dance. It worked in Lindsay Anderson's O Lucky Man a metaphorical to begin with, but falls flat in this pseudo- reality. While Meryl Streep has demonstrated her immense talent many times before, I 'm not sure that even her die-hard fans are so keen to hear her sing as a rocker for more than a third of a movie. This film resembles a lot Danny Collins, Al Pacino last film and is equally disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Ricki and the Flash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2015's Ricki and the Flash (my latest review), Meryl Streep plays an aging, sixty-year old rocker. I know it's a stretch but let's face it, she's incapable of giving a bad performance. And while I'm certain that no Academy Award nomination will arise for her (I could be wrong), "Flash" is harmless and lightweight, with moments that drag (sometimes this film feels like a boring, extended rock concert), moments that are tender (the ending while inconclusive, is perky), and plenty of plot threads (Streep's character connects with her messed up daughter, Streep's character has a moment of clarity with her ex-husband, Streep's character beds the lead guitarist in her band, etc.). Director Jonathan Demme fills his screen with well established personalities, he projects some out of the box casting (real-life rock star Rick Springfield, Charlotte Rae, and Meryl's real-life daughter), and his storytelling sensibilities are adequate. But do we really care what happens to everybody considering that their conflicts are rather minuscule? Not really. And although Streep is likable playing Ricky Randazzo (her stage name), she gives off the stoner vibe half the time. Uh and honestly, could we as an audience, sympathize with someone who abandons their family, moves to California (from middle America), and never really makes it to rock-'n'-roll glory? I think it would be difficult to care but hey, let the music play on.Featuring tunes from the film's fictional cover band (The Flash) that channel the songbooks of Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, and Lady Gaga (ugh), Ricki and the Flash tries to deepen your musical stenography yet doesn't seem to veer deep enough. The story chronicles braided, leather- clad singer Linda (Streep). She used to be married to a wealthy businessman in Pete (Kevin Kline). Now she's on her own, gigging at a dive bar in L.A. She's got an earnest boyfriend (Rick Springfield as Greg), one album that bombed a while ago, and now has to fly back to Indiana's state capital to comfort her estranged daughter who has been dumped after a short marriage (Mamie Gummer as Julie). Her other two cubs (one is happily gay and the other is getting married) are also alienated from her. Finally, she has to deal with her ex's current wife who feels that Linda (or Ricki) has missed out on all of the children's childhood happenings.Absent mommy time and missed birthdays/holidays aside, "Flash" wants us to believe that Ricki actually married Kline's Pete but that seems so forgone. One of them lives in a tight mansion (common in the city of Indianapolis) while the other needs her daughter's ex-husband's credit card to procreate a total makeover (hair, nails, shampoo treatment you name it). Total bullocks!In retrospect, I attended a screening of "Flash" and a friend of mine (in the audience) chatted me up about what a chameleon Streep is as an actress. She can be made to look older or younger. She can play anything from a cancer-stricken southerner (like in August: Osage County) to a conservative therapist (like in 2005's Prime) to a sexy divorcée (2009's It's Complicated). But what baffles me is why her Ricki here is made to be such a louse. This is a woman who takes home a four hundred dollar paycheck, works at a supermarket, and is filing for bankruptcy. What's the point in honoring her plight? Oh and let's not forget who's responsible for the inception of Ricki and the Flash. You have two Academy Award winners (Jonathan Demme and Diablo Cody) on board and this can't be their latest, unequivocal Waterloo, can't it? Cody, who's a brilliant screenwriter (as exhibited in 2007's Juno), litters the proceedings with family dysfunction clichés and garbled dialogue robbing Rick Springfield from distributing any sense of acting chops ("it's not their job for your kids to love you, it's your job to love them", huh?). It appears she's on holiday (look for a cameo of this Lemont, Illinois native dancing freely to The Flash's jams). As for Demme, well he's a music aficionado (from what I've heard) so I'll give him a sympathy pass. But honestly, with his signature camera-work (lots of zoom shots), his shtick looks out of place and there's a sense that he just might be on holiday as well. Together they collaborate on something that's not necessarily uneven, just more akin to a late night rental. My rating: 2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Could Not Get Into It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge Meryl Streep fan and have said for years that I'd watch her in just about any movie, which is why I gave "Ricki and the Flash" a chance. As with all of her roles, Streep does a great job of really getting into it. However, I truly believe this film and this script proved to be a disservice to one of our greatest actresses. As always, Streep looks amazing. The camera loves her, but the storyline in this Demme film seemed contrived. Most of the characters lacked depth, and I was disappointed that Demme chose to feature so many songs in their entirety, with Streep singing lead vocals on all of them. I wanted to to feel inspired, touched or entertained, but, mostly, I could not wait for the film to end. Despite the film's shortcomings, though, I enjoyed the dynamic among the Flash band members. It was nice to see Rick Springfield and Kevin Klein again ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meryl Streep Gives her all in the lazy, tiresome 'Ricki and the Flash'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've all come to know that Meryl Streep is one of the greatest actresses in the world. With each role she plays, she fully immerses herself into her character, which usually leads to Oscar nominations and wins. There almost isn't a year that goes by where Streep isn't nominated for something, and truth be told, she usually deserves it. Over the years, we've seen Streep play many roles, most of which are dramatic performances with a few comedic and musical roles thrown in for good measure. Hell, she even played a witch in 'Into the Woods', but we've never seen Streep like this before in Jonathan Demme's 'Ricki and the Flash'.Written by Diablo Cody ('Juno') and directed by Demme ('Philadelphia' and 'Silence of the Lambs'), 'Ricki and the Flash' plays out like a mix of a dramatic comedy and a concert film. It certainly is far from 'Philadelphia' and 'Silence of the Lambs' for sure, and tends to be a on the lighter side of emotions. Sometimes it tends to want to bang us over the head or pull our heartstrings out, but it never passes over that hump and comes across less than average in that aspect. It's a shame to, because there is real talent here, and it feels lazy. 'Ricki and the Flash' refers to Ricki (Streep), who is a 60-something woman who left her three kids and husband to try and be a rockstar in Los Angeles.After on semi-decent album, her career never really took off, and is now playing gigs at a local run down bar in California for crowds that don't even top out at 20. The Flash is her band and is made up up real musicians such as Rick Springfield and Rick Rosas, who all play cover songs for their small audiences. When Ricki is not playing in her band, she is a cashier at a Whole Foods equivalent to try and make ends meet.When her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline) calls to tell her that their daughter Julie (Streep's real-life daughter Mamie Gummer) is severely depressed over her husband leaving her, Ricki heads back to the East Coast to try and patch up her relationship with her three grown kids, which she has not seen in over twenty years. Her two sons Joshua (Sebastian Stan) and Daniel (Ben Platt) have lives of their own now too, which their mother knows nothing about including a big wedding she isn't invited to. We've seen this story before, where an aging rock star tries to make good with the family they abandoned for stardom and all the awkward encounters that come with it.However, Streep plays Ricki with a genuine charm and wit, despite her character flaws to almost always make the wrong decision. There is a bit of comedy here too, but it's on the light side of things and never musters anything more than a chuckle. Then there is the issue of music here, which is all great. Streep even learned to play the guitar and her aged voice sounds excellent and vodka soaked like a real aging rocker. She sounds excellent for the role and give it her all. It's just unfortunate that the film never really finds its feet in between the long drawn out music sequences and the dramatic moments to pull the emotions out.WAIT FOR BLU-RAY OR NETFLIX!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ricki and the Flash" is a music oriented family film. The film centers on a middle aged female rock and roller (Meryl Streep) who ends up reconnecting with her ex husband (Kevin Kline) and her children. Ricki's daughter (played by Streep's real life daughter, Mamie Gummer) is depressed after the dissolution of her marriage and Ricki tries to help her get out of her funk.This film is not too be taken too seriously but to be enjoyed. It does offer fine performances from Streep, Kline, Gummer, and Rick Springfield as Ricki's guitarist boyfriend. It is definitely worth a look if you like music oriented films or just dramedies in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is so underrated. I mean it is not a great film, but surely does not deserve bashing. One of the rarest appearance on the screen for Meryl Streep. Totally transformed into a rock star and coming together with her real life daughter was another highlight. Impressive performances by others too. The Music was good with a combination of bit emotions and comedy.It was the story of an aging rock star who failed to reach the heights. She once gave up on her family over the passion of music and now she returns after receiving a call that her daughter is in a trouble. So the tale focus on her struggling life, as well as because of her past she won't get a warm welcome. It's time to fix everything and as the years pass what changes brings is the remaining narration.This is life. People are motivated to chase their dreams no matter whatever stands between them. This was a similar theme where a woman goes after what she wanted to be, but her family comes in between. And you know the success is not for everyone, so in that situation, how a person reacts to all the miscalculations in her life is what this film is about. It was actually a well told story, but the critics did not like it and given some lame excuses. To me it was a decent film, definitely not the worst, so all I'm saying is you should try it if you like music.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unleash the Streep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wherever I am, I am what's missing." - Mark StrandDirected by Jonathan Demme, "Ricki and the Flash" stars Meryl Streep as Ricki, a rambunctious woman who leaves her wealthy husband (Kevin Kline) and embarks upon a quest to become a rock star. These dreams don't pan out, however, and Ricki instead finds herself playing at bars and working as a cashier.Demme directed "Rachel Getting Married" in 2008, a film rife with suicides, weddings and cosy unions between different ethnic groups. "Ricki and the Flash" has similar preoccupations; we watch as Ricki reconnects with her estranged sons, helps her daughter escape suicidal depression, and learns to accept, forgive and beg forgiveness from her husband and his new wife, an African American woman who teaches Ricki to let go of various racial prejudices and preconceptions.At the heart of "Ricki", though, is the tension between being a mother - and so having responsibilities to others - and being an independent artist who lives for one's art. What Ricki learns is that the two positions are not necessarily contradictory. She demonstrates this at the end of Demme's film; Ricki may be a giant train-wreck, but her music brings everyone together. Echoing Demme's many music documentaries/concert shows, "Ricki" thus portrays art as something communal and inclusive. Climaxing with Bruce Springsteen's "My Love Will Not Let You Down", it merges the rebellious ethos of rock-and-roll with more traditional family values."Ricki and the Flash" has all the positives and negatives associated with Jonathan Demme. It's well acted (at this point, Streep is practically a national institution), entertaining, sweet and boasts a catchy soundtrack. Like most of Demme's films, however, its attempts to sketch America's underbelly, with its working class anxieties and racial tensions, are mostly overly cute and overly idealistic. Mamie Gummer co-stars.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Music + Great Acting is not quite enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a competent film that nevertheless didn't seem to quite get a handle on what it wants to be: family melodrama or character study. I wish it had committed to the latter, because Ricki the California rocker is fascinating stuff. A disappointed but never say die guitarist and singer who clerks retail during the day to help pay her bills,she sacrificed her family for this. We find that she has big regrets but not enough to wish to undo the life she lives as an all but anonymous rocker playing cover songs with her band in a small bar. That film would have been on the level of The Wrestler, but this one surely is not.The good stuff: Meryl's acting of course, the subtleties she brings to her character are amazing. Meryl's daughter who plays her character's daughter does a very fine job also. I very much like Rick Springfield who plays Ricki's boyfriend and fellow guitarist in her band. And the music is great. I could listen to and watch this put together band all night long.But the less than good stuff: Kevin Kline is miscast. He doesn't gel as the ex husband or as the left behind father who raised the kids. The whole family dynamic seems to fall flat. Angst in the Midwest living in a large but sterile mcmansion. As I've already implied, this is the schizophrenic split in the film I did not like. Too stereotypical and been done to death. And, as much as I liked Ricki &amp; The Flash performing, they devote a surprising long piece of the film showing it. The excess really added nothing to the plot or character. It was almost like they edited in the DVD extras to fill in the time.Overall, fun to watch for the music but that and the acting doesn't rise it to the level of more than a grade C.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ricki and the Flash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being a critical misfire, I found Streep so good I forgave the obvious and predictable plot machinations. An aging rock band singer played by Streep does a run of cover songs at a local watering hole in LA and is asked by her ex husband (Kevin Kline) to return to Indiana to help their depressed daughter (Gummer) overcome a cheating husband leaving her for another woman. Also Ricki's son is getting married while her other remaining son tells her he's gay even if she might be a bit bothered by it. Having left them behind for a chance at rock stardom, she returns to an unwelcome or awkward homecoming.Plot out of the way, you get a melodrama with its usual beats: rejection or scolding against a parent who deserves some blame for abandoning them, a parent, no matter how different her attire or hair style from the affluent denizens of the privilege set, can find a way to mend fences even if the process is uncomfortable and difficult, and how the music that defines the parent and how that passion is used as a means to reconnect. It is material from Diablo Cody that Demme does his best to make interesting through the focus on how Streep's character is far from a monster...and she does love them in her own complicated way.Rick Springfield has a swell supporting part as a guitarist in Ricki's band, another aging rocker whose kids hate him for a bad mistake as a young father on the road trying to make it. Kline is always a pleasure as the father trying to maintain a sense of harmony during a chaotic and stressful time, managing a wedding, his wife being away momentarily with her ALS father, Ricki returning and all those old feelings surfacing, and his hopes of familial reconciliations as a result of Ricki's return. But Streep's addressing her flaws and giving an evaluation over what mistakes she has made and the attempts to rectify them are the heart of the movie. Her work with her daughter is reason enough to see this. Ricki's anxious moments with the other mom are to be expected. The way Ricki is looked at and how she forwards ahead can be respected by anyone who has felt like an outsider with judging, disapproving eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At home, on DVD from my local public library.This is a story of a woman who just wasn't cut out to be a traditional wife and mother. Meryl Streep is that woman, when her kids were still young she left Indianapolis and went west, to California, to pursue her dream to be a rock star. She took the stage name of Ricki. Now in later life she has a band called "The Flash". Ricki and the Flash play at Los Angeles area bars, she works as a grocery store checker in the day time, she appears to always be on the very of bankruptcy.Guitarist and fellow singer in the band is real rocker Rick Springfield as Greg. They have a thing going but she seems afraid to commit.Ricki gets a call from back home, seems her daughter (played by her real daughter, Mamie Gummer) has tried to OD after her husband left her so she travels back to help out. The whole movie is a contrast in sensibilities and lifestyles. While Ricki lives hand-to-mouth, day-to-day, her former husband (Kevin Kline) is a wealthy businessman in a mansion of sorts. His wife (Audra McDonald) has been the ideal stepmom as the three children grew up to adulthood. While Ricki has mostly been absent in their lives. When she gets back into their environment she just doesn't fit at all.The movie does not try to reconcile all issues, no matter what happens Ricki will always be Ricki, it isn't that she doesn't care about her children, she just doesn't know how to care. The final scene is a good one, at her son's wedding she takes the microphone, gives a short impromptu speech, then gets herself and her band to sing as her gift to her son.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performance from Streep but an average storyline! 4/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: It's not very often that I find a Meryl Streep boring, so it feels a bit weird not being thoroughly entertained by one of her films. It's not her A class performance that let's the movie down, it's basically the storyline which hit a brick wall right from the beginning. I thought that it was going to turn into an emotional drama but it's very one toned and there isn't much depth to the characters. Anyway, Ricki (Meryl Streep) abandons her family at a young age, to pursue her career to become a rock star with her band, the Flash. Whilst working as a cashier in a shopping market, she gets a call from her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline), to return to Indianapolis to help there estranged daughter, Julie (Mamie Gummer) through a difficult time. She manages to scrap together her fare and when she arrives at her husbands lavish house, Ricki finds out that Julie has attempted suicide because she caught her husband cheating on her and he's filing for a divorce. After tackling her remorse for her mum, for leaving her at a young age, Ricki finally gets Julie out of her bedroom and she takes her on a pampering trip to try and perk up her mood. They then go out for a family meal, with her son and his fiancé present but her gay son still feels remorse towards her and he gives her a hard time. When they return home, Pete and Julie have a joyful night with Ricki and they end up reminiscing about the old days but the following morning, Pete's second wife Maureen (Audra McDonald) returns home, after looking after her sick parent, and she confronts Ricki with some hard truths. Ricki then returns to her band in California, ashamed about her relationship with her children, so her boyfriend Greg (Rick Springfield) also tells her some home truths, about how she still has a chance to build bridges with them. She then gets a letter from Maureen, who sends her an invitation to her sons wedding as an olive branch but she hasn't got the money to return to Indianapolis. Greg then sells his price possession, which is a unique guitar, to pay for the tickets for them to go to the wedding so she buys herself a nice dress to prove to her children that she is making an effort. When she arrives at the wedding, she is still made to feel like an outsider and she is seated away from the family because she had returned the invitation so late. With no money to her name, she gives her son the only gift that she can afford, which is a special song for the bride and groom and her son decides to dance with his bride which perks up the other guests, who also join them on the dance floor. It's a sweet storyline but it seemed a bit shallow. You get a lot of references of the characters past, which explains the remorse from the kids but it seems like we missed the most entertaining part of the storyline. The chemistry between Kline and Streep is great and I liked the loving relationship between Streep and Greg but it still felt like it was missing something. The music wasn't that great but I have to give credit to Streep for performing the songs live. In all, it's a watchable movie but it could have been much better if there were other elements to the storyline. Average!Round-Up: Meryl Streep always gives a top performance in all of her movies and she definitely gave this movie her all. At 66 years old, she still can past as a rock star and her presence on screen is top class. She is due to star alongside Hugh Grant in the upcoming Florence Foster Jenkins, which has "Hit" written all over it and with another 3 projects on the go, there's no sign of her slowing down anytime soon. This movie was directed by Jonathan Demme, 71, who brought you Silence of the Lambs, Philadelphia, the Truth About Charlie and Rachel Getting Married. He definitely got the most out of Streep, who actually isn't a bad singer but I wasn't that impressed with the storyline.Budget: $18million Worldwide Gross: $40millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/music.comedies starring Meryl Streep, Rick Springfield, Kevin Kline, Bill Irwin &nbsp;Ben Platt and Sebastian Stan. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meryl rocked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean she can really sing and rock out and on top of all that still deliver in the acting department, too bad the was left alone to steer the ship all by herself and I am sorry she needed to have been met halfway. This was not an easy film to watch, the subject matter was more annoying than difficult with equally annoying characters essaying roles right front and center but that said Streep stood out as the marvel among thespians that she is. A mother (Streep's Ricki) who abandons her family in chase of her rock star dreams and fails seems a simple enough synopsis to get you not to like the titular character but Streep is just that good an actress that even in a film where she is supposed to be the most annoying and irritating character she manages to weave her away around being anything but that. Audra MacDonald and Mamie Gummer (Streep's real life daughter) definitely hold their own as worthy co-stars sadly they weren't given enough screen time and it's too bad the rest of the cast just showed up to be nothing short of irritating and silly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just an OK movie for me. Streep did the best she could with the script, but the plot was pretty thin. It was nice seeing real life mom and daughter act together. I think Streep's daughter has a promising career. In fact, I think I liked her performance in the movie better than her mom. They picked good music for the soundtrack, but then had Meryl Streep sing them all. When she wasn't on stage they should have left it with the original artist. I didn't like Rick Springfield as a love sick puppy; too mushy for me. Although it seems he's the only sane person in the group. The personal dynamics in this movie just didn't make any sense. You are never quite sure if people are trying to work together or against each other. Maybe their world is gray, but it makes for a wishy-washy script if the characters don't make some sort of stance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an okay family drama. It wasn't much of a comedy. At first it's about Ricki trying to bond with her daughter, and then drops that to focus on her son's wedding. Music isn't really that important to her character. The only reason it matters is because it's the reason for her not being by her family, which separates her from them and gives her a reason to divorce her husband. Ricki's band covers a few songs, and most are played in full. It's like watching a cover band play: it's not bad, but not as good as the original. So why play the full song? A 30 second clip would have been fine. Her band never goes anywhere, and we seem them playing the same venue multiple times. The acting is fine. The story isn't bad. The music is meh. It was enjoyable enough, but not anything that needs to be sought out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the ending of this film to be very moving. It's the wedding of her son in which older rocker Ricki (Meryl Streep) belts out a Bruce Springsteen song. I think what it's saying is that Ricki has finally found the courage to carve a place for herself in this family in her own unusual way. When you see how far she's strayed from them, and understandably been shunned and rejected, it's quite a feat. It would have been easier for her to say it was all too hard, and stay remote from them in California. But she kind of forgives herself. And her boyfriend, played by Rick Springfield, asks her why, if she's made mistakes, can't she have a second chance? Ricki really has been a poor mother to her three children, but she is still their mother. Although the wedding song is ironic in saying she won't let them down. Maybe she means she'll be there for them from now on. I love how the screenwriter, Diablo Cody, and director Jonathan Demme, give a respectful portrayal of ageing rockers and their fans. It's not laughable or pathetic. The musicians and the audience are genuinely enjoying the music, and having a good time. The story has too many flat moments, such as most of the scenes in Ricki's ex husband's mansion. Kevin Kline, as the ex, means well but is too bland. It's not a great movie but does have a few things to say, such as, if our parents let us down severely, can we forgive them? And why do we criticise women so harshly for following their dreams, when a Rolling Stones male rocker can do whatever he likes, without being judged?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too Flashy, but not too Shabby, either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ricki and The Flash is a bit of a curio. It's the story of a rock singer who left her family to pursue her dream of singing in a band. Which, in some ways, is another take on the kind of story in which some sort of vice or an affair does the same thing. Meryl Streep stars as Ricki, lead singer of The Flash, who are a road house bar with a small following. Although Ricki's day job is serving customers in a supermarket. Written by Diablo Cody, who brings s a more mature sensibility than usual here, and directed by Jonathan Demme, who has always had an ear for good music, Ricki and The Flash is quite effortless by design and easy to like, despite playing all the obvious notes. The story is driven by a request from Ricki's ex-husband, played by Kevin Kline, who asks Ricki to pay a visit to his home because their daughter has taken a breakdown after her new husband left. What ensues is a comedy of manners and a culture clash as Ricki, who lives hand-to-mouth and with her heart on her sleeve, finds herself amongst a family she doesn't know, in a part of America that she doesn't understand, with people who don't like her. Their daughter is played by Streep's actual daughter, Mamie Gummer, who is not only capable enough to act alongside Klein and Streep, but has the benefit of a character written with enough care to actually matter in the story without becoming just a plot device. Cody, in fact, wrote all of her main characters well for this movie, allowing for genuine interest in each of the intermingling relationships. It doesn't take a genius to know that a film of this type isn't out to challenge audience expectations, but Streep is on great form here, looking like a seventies rock chick throwback, and doing a convincing job in the concert segments, where she sings and plays guitar. It only really stumbles in a middle section that knows where it's going, but doesn't know how to get there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so solid as a whole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie had a promising start with the interesting premise. The trailers also managed to capture this potential and interpreted it to a curious audience. But what I found is rather below my expectations, especially considering it has Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline's acting potentials to dig into. Yes it has great music, and also some ironic comedic moments. Yet the scenes kept looking as they stood alone with the transitions not working enough to bridge them. But at least the movie did well enough to focus on the family drama and end it all well with some kind of redemption for Rikki. The acting overall is quite good. Meryl Streep really nailed her role here; I even think that the role didn't quite accommodate her full potential. Kevin Kline also did a very balance performance, being the calm dad at times and also the angry dad when the moment comes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent at times but fails to rise above its novelties.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the outside, it looks like Ricki and the Flash's sole purpose is to showcase a couple gimmicks in order to land Meryl Streep another Oscar nomination. It might work. She plays against type with a rock and roll star archetype. She sings and plays guitar. And she plays her own daughter's mother, with Mamie Gummer's Julie being the catalyst for the story. It's a shame that's the end of it because the promise of learning to mother her struggling daughter was the strongest aspect of the film. Writer Diablo Cody appears to be adhered to some strict character study formula guides that went against its own strengths and although diving away from what seemed to be its A-storyline is a natural consequence of what it followed, the film completely lost momentum and never gained its footing, opting for easier answers.Not that it was going to be a great film beforehand anyway, director Jonathan Demme is slight, but very unmeasured when it came to this, giving it flair when it needn't and no flair when it could've been more engaging. Streep is solid, filling in gaps with her mannerisms, but she's outshined by Gummer, who plays off her mother brilliantly. However, the material didn't lend her to be a developed character so we could never see the other side of her performance, only a glimpse. It had the ingredients for something quite good, but it was a few drafts from getting the recipe right. There's one scene where the narrative stops for 5 minutes just to sing a song. A better team would have had some story in there too. It's hard to tell whether some moments were mocking or serious. I mean, who shrugs at the Bruce Springsteen song at the end? Come on.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for the 'silver screen'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the trends in Hollywood is to offer 'silver screen' options for mature film viewers who want cinematic themes that appeal to their generation. The baby boomers who want more from their film experience than stories from Marvel comics or John Green (Paper Towns, The Fault in My Stars) and attend the cinema with an audience that does not require vampires, aliens, superheroes or toilet humour to entertain them. Jonathan Demme (Silence of the Lambs) provides this type of film with Ricki and the Flash. Written by Diablo Cody (Juno), this is a different type of 'coming of age, again' journey that is seen through the eyes of a senior rocker who is struggling through her life choices. At night, Ricki Rendazzo (Meryl Streep) fronts a local pub band called Ricki and the Flash and during the day works as a check-out clerk at an organic grocery store. The band has a loyal fan base, but is caught between the generational void between their vintage rock heritage and trying to appeal to a younger audience. This musical time warp leaves the group relegated to the local pub scene in Los Angeles. While dwelling on her stagnant career, relational difficulties and monetary woes, Ricki gets a call from her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline), who needs help with their daughter, Julie (Mamie Gummer- Meryl Streep's real life daughter), who is suffering through the trauma of her husband abandoning her. Ricki travels to Indianapolis to help her daughter and to attempt to reconnect with the family she left behind years ago to follow her rock and roll dream. Her children have grown and her ex- husband has been exceptionally successful in business and is happy with his current wife. During her short stay, Ricki has to come to terms with the sacrifices she has made in her life and how those decisions effect all of her relationships. This humorous drama is played out against the backdrop of two different life experiences, Ricki's current lifestyle in the LA pub scene and the privileged life-style that she left behind to follow her artistic dream. Cody's script provides a glimpse into Ricki's life of regrets, the lack of contentment with her current career and a multitude of familial challenges. Even with the serious situations occurring within the storyline, such as attempted suicide, divorce and parental abandonment, the production manages to maintain the essential situational humour that pulls the the script along. In amongst the humorous scenarios, director Jonathan Demme provides the needed discomfort associated with seeing someone past their prime attempting to find their identity in the past. This tension between the reality of life's regrets and humour balance out the storyline and provide a touch with reality that makes the story relatively appealing. The challenge for the film comes in the acting performances. Meryl Streep is not past her acting prime and she seems to be able to play any role that is put before her, but Ricki Rendazzo is not quite the right character for her. The problem lies in the reliance on her musicianship instead of her acting, she manages an admirable musical performance, but she sits well outside her regular thespian comfort zone. Surrounding Streep, the various roles become a hodge podge of stereotypes and the performances become mere caricatures of various walks of life, which is a missed opportunity to develop the depth of the individual characters. Interestingly, the only actor who seems comfortable within his role is Rick Springfield (General Hospital), primarily because he is playing to type as an actual ageing rockstar. When he is on stage, he is believable and adds to the whole experience quite well, but his chemistry with Streep never develops into a believable spark. Also, Streep and Kline's characters do represent a generation that have gone through a multitude of changes in their family and want to figure out what to do with the ageing process, but they seem to be walking though the motions and lack the passion needed to be convincing in their relationship. The scene that epitomises the tension of the film is during one of the pub performances. Ricki proves she can perform Bruce Springsteen and the vintage rock of the 80s, but forces herself to connect with a younger generation by performing Lady GaGa. This scene produces an uncomfortable stage performance that epitomises what audiences will experience while watching this film. A group of people who are trying to prove that they are current, but prove to be trying too hard to make things work. If Demme had done more to develop the characters as opposed to showing so many musical performances, the impact would have been more profound. In the end, Ricki and the Flash will most likely appeal to the 'silver screen' audience, because the humour and situations are written with this generation in mind, but the story will only connect with that demographic. Even if this film does not resonate with all audiences, the multiple messages that come from this tale of the ageing rock and roller provides rich opportunities for discussion. How long do we hold onto our dreams, what do we have to sacrifice for the sake of our families and what should our response be to the inevitability of ageing? All hit at different stages of life and in different levels of severity. This life presents so many obstacles for our personal desires, much less the consideration that it is all fleeting and is gone in an instant. It is hard to imagine that two hours of entertainment can open the door to so many of life's considerations, but hopefully that is not where people remain. There are answers to these questions. The suggestion at Russelling Reviews and Reel Dialogue would be to look into the Bible to find the answers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironically not enough flash on this skeleton of a good idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meryl Streep is great. And so is the premise. However lack of story and character development ruined the film. These pillars of storytelling cannot be replaced by numerous quality music numbers. Mediocre directing further damaged the film. It's simply empty. Supporting actors do not have enough material to work with and their characters are cartoonsih. The author is trying to make up for the lack of the real story (the up-above mentioned "flash") by relying heavily on stereotypes. By forcing the viewers to take these shortcuts, she is robbing them (us) of quality experience and emotion. In the end you just don't care about the characters, you stay for Meryl Streep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The struggle for older actresses to reach the largest mainstream markets might explain why more was not be made of Streep's new film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forbes recently listed the highest paid actresses in the world. All the actresses in the top ten are under fifty years old, with the oldest being forty-seven. At the top of the list is twenty-five year old Jennifer Lawrence, who recently earned fifty million dollars. While Meryl Streep is arguably one of the greatest actresses of all time, the sixty-six year old only ranked thirteenth on the list, earning a meager eight million dollars. Though not a criticism of Lawrence?an immense young talent?the imbalance is indicative of Hollywood emphasis on the young demographic. Lawrence's biggest earners for example are still The Hunger Games and the X-Men films. The salaries stipulates how much harder it is today for older actresses to stamp a major financial imprint?even if they are Streep?when they're not appealing to the teenage markets. The struggle for older actresses to reach the largest mainstream markets might also explain why more was not be made of Streep's new film Ricki and the Flash. It allows her to have fun by dressing up as an ageing rock guitarist, who is estranged from her family, including her grown-up children, one of whom is played by Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer. The film is directed by Jonathan Demme, whose most famous films include The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Rachel Getting Married (2008), which were both very edgy and dark works. Similarly, the screenwriter is Diablo Cody who based this on her grandmother and has in the past written subversive works like Juno and Young Adult. The latter shared a similar premise to Ricki, as it was about a woman out of her time who returns to her old life and relationships. But someone has evidentially put the brakes on Cody's black sense of humour, of which there are some traces, and also a unique direction for the story because the film's trajectory is safety first, failing to venture into new or even interesting territory, perhaps to retain its broad commercial appeal. But like Ricki's music, it's a cover song of modern and old records we've heard many times before.As the ageing rocker, Ricki (Streep) left her wealth husband Pete (Kevin Kline) behind to pursue her dream as a musician. Now she's broke, singing in bars and working at a checkout in a grocery store. Her only significant relationship is an on and off one with one of her fellow band member Greg (Rick Springfield), who is growing impatient with her. When she learns that the marriage of her daughter Julie (Gummer) has ended and that her daughter has gone to pieces, she decides to fly over to meet her at her ex-husband's mansion and stay with them. Pete's current wife, who is African American, is momentarily absent as she attends to her sick father. Ricki does her best to repair her relationship with her daughter, who is still angry and very brittle to her for not being there for her, when instead she opted to pursue her music career. She also learns that other people in her family have drifted away from her. One of her sons is gay and she learns might not be invited to the wedding of her other boy. As a conservative, who openly says she didn't vote for Obama and who is still grieving for her brother who died in Vietnam, will Ricki adapt to the modern times? There are two strong things about this film. One of them is, unsurprisingly, Streep. Even in a mediocre film like this, it is difficult not to sit in awe of this actress who on a yearly basis changes her appearance her mannerisms in major and subtle ways. She learnt to play the guitar for this role and is highly charismatic with her crazy laugh, half braided hair and dry humour. In one scene, she nervously twitches her hands at the thought of becoming reacquainted with her two sons, which is an example of the attention to detail and the angst this actress can draw from her character. She also sings and the music is spectacular and toe tapping, especially in the film's finale. But unfortunately, the plot comes to a halt well before the end of the film, throwing out sizable threads of conflict that seem to be building. Instead, the tension is replaced by a liberal fantasy wedding where everyone resolves their differences and learns to be civilised. Aren't movies these days so polite and so full of hot air? An actress of this calibre?who some argue is the best they've ever seen? deserves richer material that can take her and her character into new places and surprise the audience. After all, this film is about a relic being brought deep into the future and proving her self-worth.</fullReview>

At the same time she has something of a 'youthful bounce' to her step which looked familiar to me, but I confess it's been 20 years or more since I had it...

		<shortDescription>I'm a big fan of Diablo Cody's, and she doesn't let me down here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'RICKI AND THE FLASH': Four Stars (Out of Five)Meryl Streep stars in this comedy-drama flick; opposite her daughter, for the third time, actress Mamie Gummer. Streep plays a mother, trying to make amends with her family; after abandoning them (years earlier) to pursue a career in rock-and-roll. Kevin Kline, musician Rick Springfield, Sebastian Stan, Nick Westrate and Audra McDonald also costar in the movie. It was directed by Jonathan Demme and written by Diablo Cody. I'm a big fan of Cody's, and she doesn't let me down here. Ricki (Streep) is the lead singer/guitar player in a rock-and-roll band, called 'Ricki and the Flash'. She left her husband, Pete (Kline), daughter, Julie (Gummer), and two sons, Joshua (Stan) and Adam (Westrate), many years earlier; to pursue fame and fortune, in the music industry. When Pete calls her up, from Indianapolis, and asks Ricki to help Julie deal with her cheating husband; Ricki decides to make the trek home. She's not greeted with open arms though, by her family, but Ricki still does the best she can; to make things right again.The film is clichéd but it's also uplifting; and filled with good, upbeat music. Streep is (of course) great in the lead; playing a likable, but very flawed, veteran free spirit. The rest of the cast is decent, and Demme's direction is good, but it's Cody's script that really works. She writes great, empowering female roles; and this movie is no different. That's why I saw it, and I wasn't disappointed.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/bOI7ZdxfHTQ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hip and straight unite as family and maybe as America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, Meryl Streep sings and plays the gee-tar real good and once again acts up a subtle touching storm. Sure, this is another funny story about a dysfunctional family. And sure, the film has all the tension and delivers all the satisfactions of a standard American romantic comedy. But its real kick is its political undertaking.The dysfunctional family quickly comes to represent the cultural wars on America's present landscape. Director Jonathan Demme sets up a situation where we're tempted to define the characters as either Red or Blue state, Right or Left, Republican or Democrat, but then denies us that schemata. The harmony that Rikki's bar band brings her son's snobby whole foods wedding is a rejection of the division in US politics. It's a provocative riff on America's political rift.Rikki (Streep) and Greg (Rick Springfield) are old hippies still living their musical lives on the cheap and raunchy. She took the hippie's "I need to be me" excuse to abandon her family and here staves off her lover's devotion. But now she's Republican. One of her first quips is a slam at Obama's presidency. She's one of those who "wants our country back." She's "for the troops." She wears an Old Glory tattoo on her back. She's working LA but her bar and band evoke the Okie from Muskokie. But there's a reason she starts the wedding set with a Bruce Springsteen song ? the same reason Springsteen climaxed the Jon Stewart farewell. Springsteen is the working class hero, Born in the USA, who crosses all political lines. He can criticize the government without imperilling his patriotic cred. And that's what Rikki grows into. The hippie turned redneck turns back to proper liberal values when she returns to her troubled daughter, confronts the bereft girl's ex, and openly embraces her gay son and his lover. Rikki represents an America that has grown out of its cultural split. The film's ethic lies in the lyrics of Rikki's songs, in regard to both the personal and the national dilemmas.Her ex Peter (Kevin Kline) apparently flirted with Rikki's hippiehood but couldn't make the leap. He stayed behind to become a corporate success ? the Republican type ? but trails clouds of his liberal glory nonetheless. He married a black woman ? one with class, culture and wealth ? who gives his children the mothering Rikki abandoned. Now, after an awkward exchange with Rikki, she is instrumental in bringing Rikki back to her family for the son's wedding. Despite the very formulaic sentimental plot Demme continually surprises us with his characters' behavior. The son that didn't want Rikki at his wedding welcomes her most warmly and takes the initiative to start the dance to her Springsteen. She gets his blessing. That prompts the younger members of the stiff crowd to rip up the floor themselves. When Peter dissolves from his medicinal weed we expect him to renew his old nuptial rites (as does Rikki). But he's done with that. He's not the old free hippie. He prefers his new life. So, too, his wife Maureen's generosity, after her acrid exchange with Rikki. When Rikki claims Peter still loves her, Maureen says "I'll let you have that." She is secure enough to allow Rikki that face-saving delusion. Demme has often worked in musicals, from Stop Making Sense through three docs with Neil Young. (There's an even older Young lookalike in the Flash.) Here Demme exercises his love of lyric and rock to dramatize an America where the current split into Right and Left just doesn't ? needn't ? hold up. The country doesn't have to be split as enraged as it is. To recover unity and harmony they have to remember they are one family, America, and reach out to each other. And dance.</fullReview>

I also feel everyone around her got to one up their skills just bouncing themselves off of her. Especially old school Rocker, Rick Springfield, who looks decent for his age and was a great leading man for Streep. Ricki and the Flash has a great tone that allows for a very natural story on real relationships among family who have some matters to tend to. It's very relatable to anyone who has a family.Although I wish their was more original music performed in the film, Ricki and the Flash definitely hits all the right notes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Ricki and the Flash", starring Meryl Streep-Into the Woods, A Prairie Home Companion; Rick Springfield-True Detective_tv, General Hospital_tv; Kevin Kline-Last Vegas, A Prairie Home Companion and Mamie Gummer-The Good Wife_tv, Taking Woodstock.This is a comedy/drama that is written by Diablo Cody-Jennifer's Body, Juno-and directed by Jonathan Demme-The Manchurian Candadate_2004, The Silence of the Lambs. FYI: Cody loosely based the movie on her own personal life-her mother-in-law is a rock &amp; roll singer. Meryl plays a life-long rocker that left her family to pursue her career. Kevin is her ex-husband that has re-married and made a good life for himself. Mamie, who is Meryl's real life daughter, plays Meryl and Kevin's on screen daughter, that is going through a divorce and not doing very well at it. Kevin calls Meryl to come comfort the depressed Mamie but no one else, including Meryl's other grown up children, are happy to see her-they all feel like Meryl abandoned them to become a rock &amp; roll singer, so it is understandable. And to top it all off, Meryl never really made it big. She and her group, Ricki and the Flash, perform in a bar doing cover songs. Rick plays the guitar player-I know, a big stretch for the Jessie's Girl singer-that is also Meryl's boyfriend. There are several performances of the Flash and Meryl does a decent job of singing-but she probably shouldn't quit her day job. It's rated "PG-13" for language, drug content and sexual content-no nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 42 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would probably buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this the night before opening night because I just couldn't wait. Loved it! That Meryl learned the guitar enough in 6 months to play like that is phenomenal! As a Springfield fan since 1972, I am not surprised at all at just how wonderful his performance was, but I'm just as sure others will be very surprised. This was a great cast. So nice to watch a smartly written film; it knows that it's audience is smart and doesn't need to have everything spelled out for them. Wardrobe was great. It really enhances the difference between the two cultures in a way that doesn't even have to be described. The best part? True characters in real situations who don't change who they are. Refreshing! The music? Wonderful! Love that they took the hard road and recorded all the music in live performance. Excellent musicians playing wonderful songs. The original song "Cold One" is a perfect accompaniment for this film. Great care was put into picking the songs to fit the film. I have always loved Dobie Gray's "Drift Away", but from now on I will always think of this scene when I hear it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining Airy Affair?Worth a Watch for Something a Bit Off-Key</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the heavyweights involved in this "Slice of Life" Dramatic Comedy, it lightly embraces the Story of a super-aging Rock n Roller and Her re-involvement with an estranged Family that She let go to pursue Her Dream.The Cast is superb and all contribute to the airy affair and are likable. The shortcoming of the thing is it's decision to make all the angst digestible and delightful. An approach that may have done the weighty material a disservice.But, it's what is at play here from Director Jonathan Demme. The Script from current fan favorite Diablo Cody is none too insightful or profound, just serviceable. The Film, as a whole, is better than the parts and manifests itself into an entertainment and feel good experience. It reminds, at times, of TV. That's not a knock, just an observation.Because in the end it never takes itself seriously and lacks pretension, a testament to the talent involved. Worth a watch for Meryl Streep's transformation to a wholly different Role, the good Cast, and as an antithesis to most Movies made these days that are oh so "Heavy" and overproduced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adequate drama and entertainment in one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a rocker mother who left her children years ago to pursue her rock music dream. She reunites with her children under undesirable circumstances, when her daughter gets dumped by the husband after a short marriage."Ricki and the Flash" is a rock film plus a dysfunctional family film in one. The dinner table scene where Ricki reunites with her children is an intense scene that stands out in the film. The scene where Maureen and Ricki argues is also intense. Fortunately, there's no danger of this film being inundated by constant bickering. It is balanced by music scenes and loving scenes especially towards the end of the story. I think the music scenes are at times too long, but overall this film is an adequate drama and entertainment in one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ricki and the Flash" is one-fifth rocker love story and four-fifths cliché family drama. Hitting all the right PC buttons, "Ricki..." features an interracial couple, a gay son and an emotionally disturbed daughter estranged from her biological mother. This movie could have been saved in post-production, by ending the first song sequence with a flashback to the "family drama," then periodically flashing forward to the romantic relationship between Meryl Streep (who looks great OUT of makeup) and Rick Springfield (who also looks great). If this had been done post-production, a barely digestible meal of a movie could have become, at the very least, tasty fast food. I give "Ricki and the Flash" a "6".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ricki and the FlashThe upside to being an elderly female lead singer is that the crowd no longer chants 'show us your tits'.Mind you, the vocalist in this dramedy never had much of a fan base to begin with.Mature party girl Ricki (Meryl Streep) has been singing in an LA dive bar ever since she left her husband Pete (Kevin Kline) to follow her rock-star dreams.When she receives a call concerning her suicidal daughter (Mamie Gummer) she rushes back to Indianapolis to be with her.However, her estranged family isn't so receptive to having their deadbeat mother back.While Streep nails the immature musician and Diablo Cody's script occasionally discusses the double standards between female and male rock-stars, for the most part Ricki and the Flash is a predictable and forgettable film.Besides, to stay relevant older singers need to align with younger artists and pretend to be their moms.

		<fullReview>Ricki and the Flash is directed by the indie darling Jonathan Demme and written by quirky Diablo Cody. Both are Oscar winners.Streep plays Ricki a rather conservative LA rocker who works in a checkout counter by day and plays local bars in the evening with her band The Flash. We soon find out that she dislikes Obama and loves the troops.The band in the film are real life veterans of the music scene, familiar faces if you follow Neil Young for example. She has an on- off relationship with the lead guitarist of the band, Greg played by Rick Springfield.Ricki abandoned her family to pursue her rock dreams and it has left her estranged with her children. She is also broke. Ricki gets a phone call from her ex-husband (Kevin Kline) who tells her that their daughter has been dumped by her cheating husband and he is very worried about her mental stability.Ricki flies into Indianapolis to be with her and it becomes clear that her daughter and both her sons have become very distant from her and still have anger issues over her leaving them many years earlier. One of her son is engaged and he is unsure whether to invite his mother to the wedding, the other son is gay but implied he was bisexual to her.Ricki gets to contrast the high end life her ex-husband and her children are living in the mid west, who are also more liberal and open minded than Ricki who is struck in a rut back in California. Kline has also remarried and his second wife is black.Ricki manages to get through to her daughter but when Kline's second wife arrives back from visiting her father, Ricki realises it is time to go home and back to the bars and the band.The latter part of the film focuses on her relationship with Greg and attending her son's wedding.Given the talent involved both behind and in front of the screen this is an episodic and uneven film with a light and corny script. Half way through it becomes a complete different film as the issues regarding the daughter are forgotten as we concentrate on Ricki and Greg.We know Streep can sing, she did it in Postcards on the Edge almost a quarter of century ago. However she does look rather long in the tooth belting out adult orientated rock mixed with Lady Gaga.I like to have known why someone like her wanting to live the rock n roll dream, working in deadbeat jobs taking orders from people half her age is doing as a conservative Republican. Maybe Demme is having a laugh by inverting stereotypes.Still the film has a rousing finale with a belting cover of Springsteen's My love will not let you down. It just happened to be the opening song when I first when to see Springsteen live in concert. Of course given Demme is a Boss fan having directed his videos in the past, he has again added an undercurrent of humour in the casting of Springfield who used to get mistaken with Bruce due to the similarities of the name and musical genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ricki's choice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to applaud the realism of the subject approached by the film and that is why I give it an average rating rather than consider it a failure. But it is a failure, too, since the script was mediocre at best and the direction of some scenes was making me cringe. Yes, Meryl Streep is a great actress, but even she could save some of the pathetic scenes in the film.The second issue I have with Ricki is that it doesn't know exactly what it wants to be. Part life story, focusing on the character of a 60 year old woman who still plays in a rock band, but giving a way her chance at a normal motherhood, the film did wonderfully in that aspect. However, other parts were more difficult to reconcile: the defective daughter that gets "fixed" as soon as she arrives for no plot reason, of the full length songs that were not bad, but took a whole lot of time from the story and then the awful "rich folks" house and wedding scenes, with the obligatory gay couple and interracial marriage.I can't not feel that this film could have been a lot better with another director, even with the mediocre script. Amazingly enough the character I empathized most with was Rick Springfield's, who in truth was an average character in the scale of the story. I couldn't care less of the father, the daughter (the actress the real daughter of Streep), the brothers or any of the other characters. Maybe they should have put in more characterization and cut from the songs.Bottom line: people make choices and their lives are defined by them. The film does well in not demonizing any lifestyle in particular, while showing the consequences of life choices. The film fails as a basic unit of movie making, though, and that's too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who admires, collects, and actually listens to real music rock is about as far out of my orbit as you can get with the possible exception of Michael Nyman so on paper this movie wasn't an obvious choice for me. On the other hand I have also seen and admired both Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline in various movies so I decided to give it a chance. Although the scenes featuring people who purport to be musicians were painful the actual acting element was well up to snuff, not least by Streep's real life daughter, Maimie Gummer, whom I was seeing for the first time. It was also nice (for me) to see Charlotte Rae in a cameo as up to now I have only heard her on record. There's not an awful lot that's new in this saga of yet one more dysfunctional family but it's worth seeing for the acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ricki and the Flash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "dysfunctional family relationship" topic has become quite popular in recent years, either in the shape of drama (August: Osage County), comedy (This Is Where I Leave You) or a combination of both genres (Danny Collins). In fact, thinking about it well, director Jonathan Demme had already worked in a film with that topic (Rachel Getting Married), and he now re-visits that formula with his most recent film, Ricki and the Flash, which I liked pretty much due to its solid performances, honest musical sensibility and the incisive screenplay written by Diablo Cody, who shows herself more mature and "realistic", without losing her occasional stances of verbal irreverence. I know that Cody has many haters who can't stand the style she employed in the films Juno and Jennifer's Body, but don't worry; if I hadn't seen her name in the credits, I would have never guessed she wrote the screenplay of Ricki and the Flash, which is developed more or less like one expects with humorous and dramatic moments and lots of music to accompany the emotional evolution of well drawn characters. Even though I'm not a fan of Meryl Streep's, I have to admit I liked her performance in this movie, because she feels credible and enthusiastic in her role. Besides, she displays quite a good voice while singing and she feels comfortable playing the electric guitar and bringing genuine emotion to the covers played during the film. The rest of the cast also makes a good work, from Audra McDonald and the great Kevin Kline to Mamie Gummer (Streep's daughter in the real life... the physical resemblance says it all), Rick Springfield (the famous singer) and Hailey Gates. In conclusion, Ricki and the Flash has a "studio" story, but made with an independent sensibility and conviction. It might not be a great movie, but it kept me very entertained, in company of likable characters who feel simultaneously familiar and unique. Besides, I had never previously experienced the delicious surrealism of watching Springfield playing an amateur guitarist who plays covers of Springfield's songs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>9 September 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Ricky and The Flash. Is there no end to the talent that is Meryl Streep. This film is another chance to see her singing but her performance is much more gritty and raw. Leaving her husband (Kevin Kline) with their three young children Ricki heads off to the bright lights to pursue her dream of becoming a musician. Years later she gets a call from her now ex husband to say their daughter is a mess and she goes to offer her unconventional style of help. This is a tale of a dysfunctional family who are reaching out to each other whilst denying they need help. The daughter Julie is played by Mamie Gummer (Streep's real life daughter) and you can see the chemistry between them even through their acting professionalism. An excellent supporting performance from Rick Springfield who plays Greg, a member of Ricki's band The Flash, and the unsung hero who holds her together without her realising it. A little slow to get going the film draws you into the story until you are willing all the characters each to get safely to their journeys end. A rather splendid soundtrack enhances this pretty watchable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . of Sony Corporation's persistent campaign to undermine American Values. After all, they might argue with some evidential support that the reputations of two American icons--the Big Mac and Meryl Streep--could be Impuned by RICKI AND THE FLASH. Key characters in RICKI make the claim that McDonald's main course, the Big Mac, is somehow embalmed so that it never can "go bad," as does actual food. But even if you concede that RICKI besmirches Big Macs, it may be harder to prove that it has Ms. Streep playing something close to herself as a bigoted native Hoosier who's upset because her kids have been usurped by a Michelle Obama-type. Novelist Harper Lee may have turned Atticus Finch into a bigot for GO SET A WATCHMAN, but BOTH of Lee's Finches are FICTIONAL. Back in the 1900s, Ms. Streep once played someone connected to the Nazis (Eva Braun?) in SOPHIE'S CHOICE, yet that did not make her a Fascist in Real Life. By the same token, RICKI AND THE FLASH does not mean that Ms. Streep is necessarily a red-neck racist Homophobe off-set. Maybe people should give the beleaguered Sony Corp. a pass on RICKI, because its ending rocks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One could easily point out that Ricki and the Flash suffers for a sever lack of freshness. It started off with the main character reuniting with her estranged family, she doesn't get the pleasant welcome she wanted, then we know what happens next as these standard type of dramas go. There's another half where it explores her own life without any luck of achieving her dreams. It's generic, it's predictable, it's running out of novelty that it gets boring. But surprisingly, it's not. The movie manages to keep things charming and engaging at any turns with these characters. There's nothing much special to it in the end, but there's no denying how entertaining it still is.Linda is defined to be one of those unorthodox characters who is trying to change the pace of the stick-in-the-mud people around her and have fun; thankfully this isn't one of those that instantly fell for the character's tricks. It's still quite down-to-earth within their situations, maybe it drops the ball in the climax, but it's mostly has the sense of the real world. The movie doesn't go far on melodrama and solved their problems in actually simpler ways. Nothing big or spectacular happening in this journey of redemption, it's basically just interactions that would make them feel better.The first half of the movie is groan-worthy generic. We already know this trope; we often shame Linda for not being with her family, but the second half does help letting us understand why she couldn't support her children. Must be a selfish ambition? Sure. But it fleshes out her own world of so little luck, but still gaining much from some people, and that shift sort of dodged the bullet of being a total trite. Exploring Ricki's personal life in her own grind wasn't special, either, but it weighs enough at establishing the character. It also stages its musical sequences pretty well, admiring the songs being sung on screen.The acting is predictably pretty good; obviously Meryl Streep building a real person out of this character with charming energy and genuine emotion. She bounces well with her co-stars such as Kevin Kline, Rick Springfield and her real life daughter, Mamie Gummer.Ricki and the Flash is painfully conventional, but it finds charming ways to make something entertaining out of this unoriginal storyline. The performances are wonderful enough, the song sequences bring enough pizazz and the narrative sharply finds ways to empathize each character's personal choices and issues and resolves them acceptably in spite of being almost effortless. Again, it's all about being heartfelt and simple; nothing new, but there is some strong reasons to enjoy it still. Also, Meryl Streep is impossible to dislike in this role. Maybe that alone can make this worth seeing.</fullReview>

It doesn't take long before true emotions are bubbling over causing much discomfort throughout the restaurant. See, Ricki left her family to chase her music dream, leaving Kline and his second wife Maureen to provide a sense of normal family life. Maureen is played by six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald, who sadly doesn't get to "flash" her famous singing voice in a movie that is comprised of songs for about half of its running time. not there as sher ran away as they say its like fighting all over again as skeletons come out of the closet as her son is getting marries she gets to meets his new wife to be but Ricki has a boyfriend in the band who loves her Ricki Springfield played by Greg who loves music but doesn't know if he is just there to make up the numbers Director Jonathan Demme (an Oscar winner for Silence of the Lambs) and writer Diablo Cody (an Oscar winner for Juno) inexplicably drop the family drama soon after the dinner scene and we spend most of the second half watching Streep and Rick Springfield play out their dysfunctional relationship on stage. If you are unfamiliar with Springfield, he was a pop star in the 80's and was play song that describe them perfectly my love will not let you down the band does a nice job with the familiar songs, and Streep is effective as the lead singer and audience favorite. However, even with Demme's stellar track record with musical documentaries (Talking Heads, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen), it's difficult to understand why so much time is devoted to the musical performances after the extensive family drama set-up. A perfect example is that once the final act hits, Julie is given no more dialogue. It's a strange turn.so a they turn up at a wedding this part is worth the price of the ticket with because the people think Ricki is just not worth it but to her surprise she wins over her sons new family as well as her own to rock out tunes like cold ones there a message in her some where that its never to old to be a cool parent great film surprised 8/10 and a great soundtrack you can chase your dreams but don't give up the family it's clear Ms. Streep is loving her time on stage ? her version of Dobie Gray's "Drift Away" is alone worth the price of a ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meryl Streep and Rock 'N Roll, two of the Best Things Ever. She is one of my all-time favorite actresses.I was totally entertained watching this movie. The plot is awesome and has a great story line about a Mom leaves her family in order to follow her dream. It is also about the consequences of choices. The theme for young people is that you can be anything you want to be. Rarely do you hear people talking about the hard work and sacrifices you have to make to achieve your dreams. Ricki, played by Meryl Streep, pays the ultimate price - her children and family. This is a very believable plot with an outstanding cast.Take an old warehouse in Brooklyn, throw in same chairs, a bar and keep the Shirley Temples coming. The band scenes with Meryl Streep singing are some of my favorite. You can tell they are all having a great time and love being there. There are many Rock 'N roll songs that you can sing along with (in your head) and I loved the music.Rick Springfield plays her band mate and boyfriend and they seem like they belong together. I found myself rooting for their success. Meryl has said they he helped her learn to be a Rock 'N Roll Star. This, once again, shows what an A+ actress she is. She excels at portraying different characters constantly. She is fearless. Congratulations to Rick Springfield for his amazing performance in this film and for coaching Ms. Streep.Meryl Streep did not know how to play a guitar before this role and managed to snag a 45 minute private lesson with rock legend Neil Young in preparation for this film.Kevin Kline plays Pete, her patient ex-husband who was left to raise their three children on his own while his wife tried to make it in the Rock 'N roll business.Mamie Gummer plays Julie the daughter. This was not a far stretch since this is Meryl Streep's real daughter. They definitely look alike. At the beginning of the film, she is very upset and depressed and plays this part well. I could not decide if I wanted to get mad at her or feel sorry for her. This movie is really about a mother, her daughter and her sons trying to reconcile their past. Some people should get a second chance but only if they want one.The age range for this movie is 10 to 18. It has a mature topic and there are many bars scenes. Young ones might not like it because it is a drama. I give this movie 4.5 Rock Stars.Reviewed by Morgan B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, go to kidsfirst dot org.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a woman of the same age as Meryl Streep I loved the command Ms. Streep had of the movie and its agenda. She portrayed a character that owned the camera and the audience. The relationship between character Ricki (Linda) and Maureen, Ricki's former husband's current wife, was also a positive dimension. It was a rare yet powerful example of women supporting each other. I found myself fascinated with the on-stage segments of the movie where Ms. Street performed as long-standing rocker Ricki. The band members were perfectly cast, making for the ideal look of stage grizzle resulting from way too many nights of performing. Secondary characters were somewhat cliché to me, but they worked in well with the primary plot of contrasting Ricki with the life she fled from in order to pursue the low-level rock and roll grind. The scenes in the gated home of Ricki's former husband reminded me of Something's Gotta Give, and contributed to some of the movie's pans. At the end of the movie, I was glad to have seen it and especially to experience Meryl Streep's take on Ricki. Magnificent actor - thanks Meryl Streep!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie. It has a great story, wonderful music, and most of all, a tremendous performance by Meryl Streep. She sings, she dances, she is funny and she carries the movie. Streep plays a musician who gave up everything, including the love of her children, to pursue a dream. Her character, Linda, aka Ricki, is heroic and supremely engaging. It is virtually impossible not to like Linda. She is down to earth, unpretentious, true to herself, and a wonderful musician. Although the story follows a certain formula - nice person who wants to reconnect with family - the outcome is far from predictable. But in this movie, the story is not the driving factor. Instead it is Streep's performance. It has to be ranked as among the best in her career. Only an actress with her level of talent could have successfully done her role. This movie is a Meryl Street tour-de-force.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes We All Need Our Mom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Jonathan Demme's "Ricki and the Flash" takes a while to anchor itself, but when it does it strikes a resonant chord. In a touching wake up call for distraught Ricki (Meryl Streep), boyfriend Greg (Rick Springfield) says, "Is that it? It doesn't matter if you kids love you or not! It's not their job to love you! It's your job to love them! That's why you were put here!" Rick Springfield steals this scene as Streep's Ricki comes to the realization that a mother's love is unconditional. There is more to "Ricki and the Flash" than its seemingly superfluous title, and quirky dialogue quips. Meryl Streep is powerful and authentic in a completely unrecognizable role. Some of its diversion and abbreviations are forgiven, because underneath it all the story is about family, love and surrender. Jonathan Demme, who directed "Silence of the Lambs" and "Rachel Getting Married", does some astonishing magic with live takes of "The Flash" doing song covers from Tom Petty to Lady Gaga. Streep sings all the songs and spent months learning to play rhythm guitar. She is good. Demme also assembled some world class rock musicians for The Flash. Springfield truly shreds on guitar, showcasing his artistic prowess?illustrating "Jessie's Girl" is just part of his resume. He also evokes surprising acting chops.Demme directs from a screenplay by Diablo Cody, who wrote "Juno". This is not as brilliant as "Juno". Given the gravity of circumstance that summons Ricki (Streep) to return to Indianapolis to console her suffering daughter Julie (Streep's real-life daughter Mamie Grummer), the narrative gets lost despite establishing visceral family turmoil. Oddly, the first scenes with Streep and Grummer feel forced. Cody takes a strange detour opting for a conventional third act. Demme may forget at times that he directing a linear family drama instead of concert movie. Wisely, he empowers his actors to trust the camera as he captures poignant personal exchanges. Here Streep rescues the movie as her Ricki fearlessly transforms and forgives. She is awesome. As "Ricki and the Flash" opens the band performs "American Girl" in a dive bar Salt Well in Tarzana. Greg is Ricki's lead guitarist and sometimes boyfriend for the relation adverse Ricki. Ricki is also Linda, who left her family to come to Los Angeles to pursue her dream of becoming a rock star. Things did not turn out as expected. She is broke. When she is not singing with her cover band, she is a checkout clerk at the local Total Foods. Ricki takes a call from ex-husband Pete (sad and solid Kevin Klein). Pete, a wealthy attorney, pleads for Ricki to return home to care for their daughter Julie (Grummer), who is in the midst of breakdown. His current wife Maureen (pleasantly arrogant Audra McDonald) is out of town. Julie's marriage ended when her husband leaves her for another woman. Upon returning home Ricki discovers that Julie also had attempted suicide. The initial chemistry of Streep and Grummer is unsettling. Theirs is too much bravado and not enough nuanced anger. Grummer holds her own with her Mom?fiercely vulnerable. As Cody's story unfolds, so transforms their bond. "Sometimes all a girl needs is her Mom." Ricki did not want to forfeit either dream: family and career. The aftermath of her being absent Mom culminates when she reunites with her estranged sons, Josh and Adam. Josh (Sebastian Stan) introduces his fiancée Emily (Hailey Gates), whom Ricki dislikes. Adam (Nick Westgate) explains to his Mom that he is really gay. Clearly, Ricki has not been doing her job as Mom. Fortunately, Ricki's lifeline back home is Greg. Springfield is rock solid as Greg, the voice and heart of humanity in "Ricki and the Flash". Springfield is amazing. He is having a deserved actor's Renaissance. Streep's emergence as Ricki is believable with her raw emotion and her will to make amends. With Springfield's gravitas and lightness, we get that she can transform into the Mom her estranged kids need and will ultimately love. Cody has a glaring narrative disconnect with Julie half way through as the focus shifts to Ricki and Greg. This is forgivable in context. In the end hearing Ricki sing a classic Bruce Springsteen cover will touch your heart and remind us that: Sometimes we all need our Mom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>is there nothing Meryl Streep can't do with finesse and brilliance? Wow, she did it again with Ricki and the Flash. Kevin Klein was just so-so. I am a huge Kevin fan, so this was a little bit of a let down. I wondered if the daughter was her daughter in real life because she showed true respect and love for her mother. It was too authentic, which is what made me wonder if it was her daughter. Even though Mamie Gummer is not listed in the Cast Listing (neither is Kevin Klein) I believe it is her real daughter. Why doesn't IMDb list everyone in order of their presence?Regardless, definitely worth a watch.Wonder what's next?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing!! It's as advertised!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always wanted to see this since the very beginning. It all started with an article saying that Kevin Kline and Mamie Gummer signed up to be in this picture. Then filming is in progress and post production afterwords. Next came a trailer and TV spots. Now I find out it's not an independent movie. This is my very first movie with Kevin that I've seen at the Studio City Mesa in Casper. I've been thinking a lot during this. I do like the font and the color of the title. Meryl has a crazy hairdo that is really tight on the roots. Mamie was just a drama queen till she got her hair and her nails done. When everyone in the Brummel family came to a fancy restaurant. Mostly everyone's been dressed up except for Ricki and Julie. The language is mild. Kevin is and always will be so handsome; even for being in his late 60's. When I watched the trailer, I thought about Darling Companion. When I actually got to see this, I actually thought of the trailers and TV spots I watched on YouTube and Facebook, In &amp; Out, The Ice Storm, Beauty and the Beast (2017) and the January 4th 1989 episode of David Letterman. Though I did think of Darling Companion a little bit when Pete and Ricki were craving sweets. It made me think of a scene where Beth and Joseph were in their cabin drinking wine and eating a sweet pickle. That and when they're arguing with one another before Julie said "It's like the 80's all over again." I had to scream in excitement after it was over. Rick Springfield on the other hand rocked on. I noticed that the moment where it goes "You brought your guitar." "Yeah, just the one." was cut out from the final movie. At moments where Julie hasn't slept or showered made me think of my sister when she was depressed because of seeing her teacher murdered. At the end of the movie, when everybody started dancing to the Bruce Springsteen song, I whispered "Come on, Teddy Bear." (I nicknamed Kevin that because he was nice to me when I first met him at age 16 going on 17.) When he (Kevin) and Ricki were craving in sweets, I also whispered "I can still see your eyes looking at me." Whenever I go see a movie with him, I don't think of random stuff like I do to everybody else. Instead, I would think of good times that I had when I got to look at photos, see his movies and TV appearances, etc. I do hope that his profile is not going down where it's not as high as it once was (like Macaulay Culkin or his "French Kiss" co- star Meg Ryan). Many people came to see this either because of Meryl Streep or Rick Springfield. This is when I decided to say "Cray-cray". Some of the photos I see in the movie were from the ones that I collected. When Julie said she tried killing herself, I thought of other suicides and when Robin Williams died of suicide by hanging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meryl Streep continues to amaze with the range of her talent. Rick Springfield is a revelation. They bring the requisite world-weariness of choices made in the past that weigh down their souls. But their love of rock n roll gives them and everyone who hears them play, joy. This is a complicated emotional journey - being there for your child when you've been absent for most of their lives. Making amends and eating humble pie is never easy. Mamie Gummer brilliantly plays the daughter in crisis. Wonderful contrasts in the lifestyles - turning the idea of the vast success of rock musicians and ordinary people on its head. Somehow, there is no spark. The film is a bit flat and predictable and never really catches fire.</fullReview>
