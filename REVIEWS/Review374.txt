		<shortDescription>Well crafted gags</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked up this movie on IMDb fully expecting to find a lot of comments that reflected my opinion, that this is a great little film. I was quite surprised at how many people don't feel the same way I do.Some of the movies detractors seem to suggest the movie is a bit slow and that it misses opportunities for packing in lots of jokes. I can't agree, I think the pace is just right and that the movie's direction is more deftly handled than you might think. Some of the set ups in this film are developed meticulously over time allowing plenty of humorous moments along the way to the pay-off. And when they pay-off, they pay-off beautifully. For example I love the scene in which a German mercenary enters a really dangerous looking Mexican bar. The room is full of thugs and cut-throats who laugh at the German's prim appearance and so he kills a few of them. He then instructs the rest of the patrons to be more respectful of strangers and to expect some friends of his to drop in later. The mercenary leaves and soon the Three Amigos arrive wearing camp looking Mexican costumes. It's not long before they start to sing an extremely girly song to the patrons of the bar called "My Little Buttercup". The song is accompanied by the most effeminate dance routine committed to film. The mystified bandits all assume the Three Amigos are the German mercenary's friends and go along with the song and dance routine which after a while becomes so cute it makes you feel physically sick.And here is the pay off, the Amigos leave as the real mercenaries arrive, one of the bandits notices the pearl handled revolvers one of the strangers is wearing and yells "Look at the sissy guns". Carnage ensues, the German sharp shooters finish off the rest of the patrons in a bloody gun fight, the confused looks on the bandit's faces throughout this whole routine is hilarious.This film isn't desperate to pack gags into every available space, and because of this it feels more controlled and less try-hard, to me most of the jokes are of a high enough quality they don't need a lot of superfluous back up gags. I also enjoy the overall up beat tone of the film, even the bad guys are actually really nice to each other ( the sweater Scene is touching ). I think it's the warmth between the characters that really makes this film for me, I think if the gags kept coming at a breakneck speed we wouldn't have a chance to warm to the characters, the Mexican atmosphere and music the way that we do. I give this a ten out of ten even though it's not a perfect film, it makes me feel as good as a perfect film would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an homage to many old comedies: Old jokes, Silent movieplot lines. It's like a Laurel and Hardy film that was never made.The movie is the joke. Much like Blazing Saddles or YoungFrankenstein. I don't know why more people don't get the joke andrate this movie higher. As it is, it is definitely underrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>5 reasons to love this film: 1. The sight of Ned Nederlander (Martin Short) telling the incomprehensible, self-indulgent story of when he met Dorothy Gish ("you know, Lillian's sister") to a bunch of patient, albeit bored Mexican kids. 2. Lucky Day (Steve Martin) trying to get his buddies' attention as they break into the studio--progressing from an owl's soft "hoo" to a crowing "LOOKUPHERE...LOOKUPHERE" 3. The opening song and Elmer Bernstein's great score (he also scored the classic comedies "Animal House" and "Stripes") 4. The Three Amigos singing "My Little Buttercup" in a Mexican cantina 5. The Amigos fighting back tears as Lucky Day informs his buddies that, in fact, they have been summoned not to perform, but actually to fight the evil El Guapo--Martin Short's tearful line, "Why am I in Mexico?" is hilarious, almost as funny as Steve Martin's follow-up, "I've been shot already!"This is an intelligent comedy, one that pokes fun not only at the mythology of the Hollywood western, but at Hollywood itself. The three Amigos is a delight to watch, and a great addition to any family's film collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love it. Love it. Love it. This movie is jam-packed with hilarity. The story is good for an 80s comedy as well. Chase, Martin and Short are a power house as the 3 Amigos. And El Guapo has so many good lines I'm laughing just thinking about them, "Do you even know what a plethora is???" Every time I hear that word I think of him, which is pretty sad I guess. The scene with Dusty Bottoms (Chase), singing at the celebrations as if he has a frog in his throat makes me laugh every time, My little buttercup scene in the tavern with Ned (Short) with the hankerchief on his head, the calls they have to make to summon the invisible swordsman, the part in the desert..."lip balm?" I'm embarrassed to say how many times I have seen this movie, I'm just going to say a lot...and would recommend to everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before comedic artists came into Hollywood demanding they attempt a role in a very serious film, there were films like Three Amigos. Riddled with laughs, upon laugh, upon laughs, this wildly enjoyable romp through the open desert could only have been accomplished by three of our favorite comedians.Those are Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short. To say that anyone in today's cinema can come close to the genius of these three powerhouses would be a lie. While I do believe that Ryan Reynolds is a very close to becoming the next Chase, nobody else can match their style, humor, and elegance. Comedy was not just a job for these three, it was an art.Three Amigos places us in a small town that is searching for some heroes that will help them get rid of some local hoodlums. Mistaking the opportunity as work, our three protagonists rush into the town prepared for the show of a lifetime. Little do they know, they are soon going to be fighting life and death. Thankfully, seriousness is in low amounts in this film, and comic hijinks ensure. Our three stumble through bars, the desert, and the final hide-a-way before their creative finale.I remember watching this film with my family when I was really young. I remember laughing at everything these three bumbling idiots did, and how impressed I was by the grace they did it with. As I grew older, this film remained with me. These three actors represent some of the funniest moments in cinematic history, and here they are gathered together to make a film. I loved this movie. I loved the absurdity, the randomness, and the sheer fun of these types of films. I miss this type of physical, pseudo-intellectual humor. I miss laughing as much as I did when I first watched this film, and when I watch it over and over again. The simplistic nature of this film allows it to be enjoyed at any time during your life. Martin, Short, and Chase are at the top of their game and never let go. It is sad to see these actors getting less and less work today. Overall, this film impressed me. It is funny, enjoyable, and so silly that you don't need to wade through the bathroom humor to get to the good stuff. It is all right there. I suggest this film to anyone that is looking to laugh and be entertained!Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might Be The Funniest Film I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was shocked when I discovered I hadn't reviewed this despite writing many reviews, since it is one of my favorite comedies of all time. It may even rank as the funniest movie I've ever seen. It just has a ton of laughs, start-to-finish, and without all the raunch and profanity of today's comedy films - although it's no "Bambi," that's for sure.Not only does the dialog produce numerous laugh-out-loud scenes but so do all the sight gags, nd there are plenty of those. The funniest characters in the film are the villains, led by "El Guapo," played by Alfonso Arau. He is almost indescribable. All he has to do is open his mouth and show his bad teeth and then give his huge smile and I crack up every time.The three leads - played by Steve Martin, Matin Short and Chevy Chase - are all excellent and in the primes of their careers. The film also is directed by John Landis, who has a knack for directing extremely entertaining movies. Just look at his resume on the IMDb. This film was written by Martin, Lorne Michales of "Saturday Night Live," and songwriter Randy Newman. Kudos to all of them for a job well done.In addition to the great comedy, decent language and color characters both good guys and bad guys, was the beautiful cinematography. There is a very colorful-looking film and looks outstanding on DVD.Overall: this is what entertainment is all about.</fullReview>

They find themselves out-numbered 5:1 by the infamous ("More than Famous, He's In-Famous!"), El Guapo (Alfonso Arau) and his Banditos.This impossible situation is soon turned around by quick thinking (Girl A:"I like the one who is not so clever". Girl B:"Which one is that?") and lots of sewing... yes, I said "sewing"!If you listen to this movie closely, you'll pick-up on a lot of humour that would otherwise be lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic comedy, but not for all tastes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Three Amigos is one of those movies that can be hugely entertaining and amusing but only if you keep in mind that it is not a serious film. Chevy Chase, Martin Short, and Steve Martin, some of the funniest men ever to work in comedy, all team up here as The Three Amigos, a group of out of work actors in early Hollywood cinema. The unfortunate thing is that this is not a movie that is greater than the sum of its parts, since I would expect more from actors with the caliber of Martin, Chase, and Short, even working individually, but even the fact that they are all not used to their full potential is not enough to bring down the rest of the comedy here.The story involves the three out of work silent film actors, who suddenly find themselves unemployed and broke when they receive a telegram from a small village in Mexico desperately asking their assistance. I liked how clever the ploy was where the woman who sent the message was so poor that she could not afford enough words to make her desires clear, so the Amigos read the message and think that they are about to be paid a fortune just to make an appearance in this village. Naturally they jump at the chance since they have nothing better to do.Most of the rest of the film deals with their adventures in this village, which they are supposed to be protecting from an evil villain but do not realize that this is real life until one of them gets shot. You would think that they would have caught on sooner, but on the other hand, they DID happen to stumble into the only tiny village in Mexico where no one speaks Spanish, so it's not hard to understand why they thought the whole thing was a set up. If I went to Mexico and was walking around a dusty village with nothing but endless desert on every side and every single person was speaking only English, I would also wonder what movie set I had just wandered onto. There is some interesting biblical content, which is made interesting really only because of the great satire. As the Amigos are walking through the valley in the shadow of death, they come upon not the talking bush or the burning bush, but the SINGING bush, and can't seem to get it to stop singing long enough to answer their question. `Will you please stop singing and tell us if you are the singing bush!' There's a hilarious sequence right after this about the invisible horseman, and just before was one of my favorite moments in the entire film, when Chase attempts to get off his horse but only succeeds in getting onto the horse next to him facing backwards and seems to be unsure about what just happened. A lot of this movie is made up of funny skits which are strung along a thin and less than convincing clothesline of a plot, but even though the plot itself is not very believable the movie is still very entertaining. There are a lot of scenes that seem to go too far or just don't really seem to fit with the rest of the film (such as the campfire scene where all the animals join in to the campfire singing), but for the most part the comedy is very good and there are a lot of memorable scenes (the canteen scene in the desert for example, is one to remember!). Not a film that was meant to win any Oscars, but there is definitely some great comic entertainment to be had with The Three Amigos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We are the Three Amigos! arrriba aaahhaaaa!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is really an interesting comedy film. It's not necessarily the story or production values. More the combination of having super star comedian's Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short share the silver screen in one film. This was the first and last film with this particular cast of talented comedians.The Three Amigos is about three early film heroes with funny names who lose their favor with the film studio they work for. Afterwards, these three doofuses in real life, mistakenly except a show appearance in Mexico. Of course the Amigos have no idea their soon to be "infamous" co-star is actually a real villain, and the show is a real life struggle with a group of bandits. It's a real showdown.By the end of the film, the Amigos become the film stars they were, but in real life. There are trials and difficulties they must face along the way, providing for some interesting and varying situations. There is simple comedy throughout the film, from beginning to ending. This movie will not challenge you to think, but it will appeal to your funny bone. Really intellectual comedy would not have fit into this film, giving the sort of thick headed nature of the main characters.Timing of these comedy masters is excellent, which makes the movie appealing and entertaining and that is why the film is successful. Above all, that is what is so great about this film. It's three stars giving their best, plus a great supporting cast of well-known and not so well-known actors and actresses.Technically this film is put together pretty well. You'll appreciate varying camera angles, nice sets, and colorful outdoor scenery. Production values are at least average, and there's some nice attention to detail. You will notice for example many of the bandidos have bad teeth. Something classic western movies are often knocked for, but this movie takes into account.Over all for most watching this film should be an enjoyable for those with average sense of humor. Trying to take this film too seriously would definitely be a mistake. Those viewers prone to do so should probably pick a different movie off the rack.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Spaghetti Western with Meatballs and Sausage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The spaghetti western meets the three stooges. Martin, Short and Chase deliver one of their most memorable performances as three out of work actors hired, unwittingly, to be real gun fighters. These three comic greats work with a beautiful chemistry, to make you laugh hard enough to split your pants, every time you watch this movie. One scene rolls, painlessly, into another without making you look at your watch once as The Three Amigos attempt to stop the evil banditos (grungy, greasy, cavorting, drinking and shooting at everything - just as in the spaghetti westerns, but with a sillier and lighter edge versus a serious and menacing one) from taking advantage of the poor peasants.This is a classic comic film, with real comics pulling out all the stops, that I feel everyone should see. Guaranteed to make everyone laugh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comedic Masterpiece-- scratch that, A Masterpiece in Film-making of Any Sort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chevy Chase and Martin Short deliver the performances of their lives while Steve Martin's performance is second only to his flawless performance in "The Jerk". In addition to the main stars, the rest of the cast, no matter what the role, seem to produce laughs. Alfonso Arau's performance as El Guapo is particularly fascinating. El Guapo is about as evil a villain as they come yet one can't help but find hilarity in his wide range of emotions, whether it be his utter delight in receiving a sweater for his birthday in the middle of a desert in Mexico or his disappointment at his failure in courting a woman he captured from her own village (literally grabbing her and hoisting her on his horse) and whose village he had repeatedly pillaged and harassed. The scenarios director John Landis creates (in relation to the Amigos thinking their bout with El Guapo's gang is part of a show they were hired to perform), the cultural misunderstandings, the negative effects of stereotyping put on display... it has far more comedic material than can be found in, say, 10 strong comedies of today.There are numerous scenes and lines that, on the surface, may not seem entirely funny at first, but, upon repeated viewing, are appreciated for the hilarious situations they really are. Three Amigos is a comedy that will never be confused with a drama or romantic film, yet the jokes are so subtle and well-delivered that those who do not normally find slapstick funny will appreciate that Three Amigos gives one the opportunity to laugh without being told to do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 Amigos Fan Club - Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always wondered if there was a FAN Club of this movie. This movie is Definitely a 'cult classic'. I've seen it about 12 times. It's not only the lines in the movie but things like the facial expressions of Dusty, Ned and Lucky as they are riding their horses shooting their pistols in the air. I love the close up shots. -- I think there should be a FAN CLUB where people can meet, maybe New York. I bet we could get Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and Martin Short to show up if the Club really gets off the ground.Anyway, at least we have the IMDb to chat in. I was glad to see there were others besides my Family that LOVED this movie and own the video. Between my father, sister and brothers we've seen the movie probably closer to 100 times. :)____OK then...... Until later.... "We ride!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the three buffoonic Amigos to el Guapo and his sweater-knitting henchmen, this farcical comedy-western is a mindless journey of snickers and chuckles. Make no mistake, this movie IS stupid -- on purpose. The singing bush?...the Invisible Swordsman?...campfire-singing animals?...please. But the comedic brilliance of Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short sells even the silliest shtick.On the other hand, there are some classic pieces and one-liners in here that demonstrate the film's writing depth, which shouldn't be overlooked, including the surprisingly deep relationship between el Guapo (Alfonso Arau) and his right-hand-man, Jefe (Tony Plana).All in all, you don't really watch this to digest a movie and follow the evolution of characters, you watch it in chunks as skit after skit that affords endless enjoyment if you allow it.So give it a go and have fun...you might be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a consistently hilarious western spoof, but still an overall good one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a western spoof starring Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short. It was released the year I was born, 1986, but I knew nothing about it until March 2007. I watched it for the first time that month, just before I first watched "Galaxy Quest", which is like a sci-fi version of this film. Before seeing "?Three Amigos!", I had looked at its IMDb rating, which didn't suggest it was that great, but it wasn't enough for me to expect a horrible comedy. So, when I first saw the polarizing western comedy, it didn't surprise me when it turned out to be far from the most consistently funny comedy I've ever seen, but I still thought it was pretty good, even though I could only remember parts of it. A second viewing three years later was much like my first.In 1916, the residents of a Mexican village called Santa Poco have become victims of an outlaw named El Guapo and his gang! A village resident named Carmen goes searching for help, and during her search, she sees a film starring the Three Amigos (Lucky Day, Dusty Bottoms and Ned Nederlander) playing in a church. She sees what they do in this film and thinks they would be able to fight off the intruders, so she has a letter sent to them. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, the three renowned silent movie stars are fired, and they lose their studio lot homes and clothing. They then get the letter from Carmen, which they think is an offer for them to come to Santa Poco and put on a show for 100,000 pesos, and they also think El Guapo is an actor who will be playing the antagonist! So, they steal back their movie clothing and set out to Mexico to take this job offer, totally unaware of the fact that they will be doing it for real this time! I remember the beginning of this film from both viewings, with the Three Amigos riding horses and singing "The Ballad of the Three Amigos" (a song written by Randy Newman), featuring a very long falsetto note, which I found funny both times. After this part, it doesn't stay the same, as the film is no more than mildly amusing for a while, and some of the gags are perhaps a little TOO silly. However, there are eventually more really funny parts, such as the German thug in the saloon, the Three Amigos coming in after him and singing "My Little Buttercup" (also written by Newman) to the frightened men inside who think they are friends of the German, and the actors saying their lines to the village intruders! There are also some highlights later in the film, such as the protagonists riding through the desert, with Lucky and Ned out of water, watching Dusty waste his! Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short all show their talents in this film, and so do other cast members, such as Alfonso Arau as El Guapo and Kai Wulff as German. Some of these supporting characters have some really funny lines. In addition to often being funny, sometimes very much so and sometimes just a little, "?Three Amigos!" can be exciting with the action and adventure.When I first saw this 1986 comedy, I had never seen "Blazing Saddles", a much more popular western spoof from 1974. I didn't see that one until January this year, and I think I found it funnier than "?Three Amigos!" overall, like probably most people who have seen both movies (though I didn't find it as funny as many others clearly have through the decades), but it didn't seem to affect my opinion on this later film of the same genre. Unlike some viewers, I can't exactly call this particular western spoof an underrated gem or something to that effect, but overall, I would say it is a reasonably funny and often exciting adventure, with a talented cast to help out. Randy Newman also did a good job writing the songs ("The Ballad of the Three Amigos", "My Little Buttercup", and "Blue Shadows"). If you're a fan of the three comedians who play the starring roles here, you like western movies, and you want a laugh, you COULD still find this flick disappointing, but it's probably still worth a try.</fullReview>

Steve Martin is the writer and producer of the movie, and he didn't give himself as many funny lines as other 2 stars in the movie.Martin Short is the one who is out of place, he is likable, but he never really established himself as a good movie comedian.

		<fullReview>Wow - some people really miss how wonderful this film is. Every time I watch it, it gets better. The first time I saw it (early 90s), I thought it was funny, but just one film among many funny films. I watched it often, and my senses became dull to its humor. I watched it a month ago, and I realized that this film is really genius.Almost every scene has some element of brilliance in it.For instance - the "Blue Shadows" campfire scene. Its done on a sound stage with ridiculous cardboard cut-outs in the background - like the crappy films of yore - it has the older guys calming the younger guy (who is obviously an adult, not a child who needs a bedtime song), and talking animals. Its so cheesy its wonderful.SPOILER WARNING: And there's the final fight scene. Every shot of the fight scene uses Chevy, Steve, and Martin in it - but when the townspeople come out, dressed like the Amigos, it is obvious that these are not the people we saw during the fight. The fight outfits have all sorts of embroidery on them - not like the townspeople's outfits at all. You know that what the movie has just claimed has happened, has not happened that way at all. And it knows you know that. Its great.The Three Amigos is a great film and you will be rewarded if you go back to it and view it as the great work that it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?Three Amigos!"?Three Amigos!" is a decent comedy ruined by some hit-and-misses and boring areas of the film. It's underrated a bit, but not by much.Steve Martin, Martin Short and Chevy Chase star as film stars in the depression-era; their show is about three Amigos that fight bad guys down in Mexico. Eventually, due to low ratings of some sort, their show is canceled and they are all thrown out of Hollywood. But then, at the low-point of their life and career, they get an offer from a Mexican woman. She has seen their show and, thinking the show and the three men are genuine, wants them to come to Mexico to help rid her town of bad guys that come through every day to steal food, money, etc...Martin and co. think the woman is interested in making a television show, so they eagerly follow her down to Mexico to shoot the film. When they find, upon arrival, that it is NOT a film, but rather all very real. Now the gun-toting fakes will have to learn how to really aim a gun if they wish to succeed."?Three Amigos!" has some pretty weak gags, and the film becomes tiresome after a while, especially some scenes around the town in Mexico. But the scenes like the one where Martin and co. sing "My Little Buttercup" in the local bar in town is unmissable.Steve Martin and Martin Short do well. Chase hinders their comedic timing a bit, but not by much. Overall they are a pretty good comic trio. I've always been a fan of Martin and Short, and...well...I liked Chase in "Vacation," so I think they really make this movie. It would be no better than the dirt on my boots if not for the comedians in this film. Because of them--especially if you're fans of the comedians--this film is worth viewing. It's not particularly great, in fact, it's pretty average material, but Martin and co. make it worth seeing at least once. Definitely worth catching on TV, but don't go out of your way to see it.3/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

She watches a Three Amigos movie and assumes that it is real. She telegrams an invitation to the Three Amigos; Lucky Day (Steve Martin), Dusty Bottoms (Chevy Chase) and Ned Nederlander (Martin Short). Lucky pushes the studio boss too far and gets all three fired. They misunderstand the telegram and assume they are being asked for a simple personal appearance. A German comes looking for El Guapo and misunderstandings ensue.I love this movie. I love these three actors and their easy chemistry. They are idiotic and lovable. Director John Landis keeps it simple and lets the stars shine. There are some good laughs but more than anything, this movie leaves me with a smile. I have seen some of the comedians who are suppose to be in this movie. They are all great but why I love these three guys is because they are loveably idiotic. They are dumb without any superiority. I really root for these guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to watch this movie with my brothers as we were growing up. We watched it so many times we wore out the VHS, that's right I said VHS. If you don't like dry humour you might not get this movie but I thrive on it. Everything from asking if the bush that is singing is the singing bush to the ridiculous 3 Amigos chant that they have. I love this movie from start to finish and couldn't think of a better way to spend an evening with someone, especially if they haven't seen it. Never gets old, never will get old. My little butter cup has been stuck in my head since the early 90's and I don't think it'll ever leave, and I'm 100% OK with that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underrated John Landis comedy with fun music. Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short star as three silent film stars who are asked to defend a Mexican town from bandits. A plot reminiscent of The Magnificent Seven. It's such a fun light-hearted movie I don't see why it has so many detractors. Perhaps the humor isn't crude enough. This is certainly one of Landis' least vulgar comedies. To me the movie has an old-school kind of charm about it. It's full of lots of great sight gags, memorable lines, and cute Randy Newman songs. It moves at a nice pace and seems to enjoy its story instead of overloading you with one "bit" after another. So give it a shot if you like Landis' work or the work of the three stars. It's one of my favorite 80s comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't even count how many times I watched "?Three Amigos!" as a kid. I threw out lines in everyday speech, did the pelvic thrust salute, everything. And watching this as an adult, I found the lines coming back like no time had passed. The cast (across the board) is utterly perfect; these roles seem like they were written specifically for the three leads. And it's not just them; Alfonso Arau was born to play El Guapo. What he does with that role is golden. The script plays like a one-liner factory and several scenes are burned into my subconscious: the studio burglary, the singing bush, the campsite ("Goodnight, Ned!"), the canteen gag in the desert. "?Three Amigos!" is hilarious to this day, and I don't think I'll ever tire of this movie. Total classic.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you see those three buddies in their ridiculous costumes, you expect wisely a poor movie. But as those three amigos were among the best funny guys in the eighties and Landis isn't a baby with a camera, surely, all those great names imply that something good was due to come. And it's true: the comedy ingredients here were able to make me support the dust, the rust, the hot sun, the horses, the gunfight, the saloon, the campfire, the final attack and everything else that makes a western, a genre that i usually dislike.The script is written with intelligence as all the funny moments are not wasted but helps to build a real progression in the drama. The characters are well done: the amigos work like a team, all the others are native, the bad guys having ugly faces and the peasants pretty and kind. If all the clichés of western are indeed twisted in a ridiculous way, the huge regret comes from that the fabulous cast isn't more explosive. In other words, the movie is funny but not hilarious. For whatever reasons, adding Chevy plus Martin plus Steve plus Landis doesn't add the laughs: It's a bit like nobody dare to do something too much personal. However, this kind of humor even shy is still better than the actual comedies (see "Fockers" for example).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Amigos review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Amigos is a film that holds the test of time, the star studded film includes the likes of Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short. These three make an excellent trio together in this adventure set in1916 Mexico in which our hero's (former film actors) are thrust into the heart of a gang war between a beautiful village in the countryside called Santo Poco against a large group of evil, but hilarious banditos under the command of the "infamous" El Guapo (played by Alfonso Arau). The film has some key references to several "Spaghetti Westerns" and the concept of it is very clever, and has itself been adapted into other films such as "A Bugs life" and "My Name Is Bruce". My personal favourite part of the film is when the Amigos sing "Arizona Moon" in the desert, amongst many other small but vital parts of the film that makes it as a whole a good, funny film. The film had the potential to be at least a 9/10 but lacked the madness to do so. Another way it could have improved is making the film longer to allow more time to learn about the characters past, present and there perception of the future.By Nabil Rastani</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently, after 20 years or so, I watched Three Amigos again. Being a teen when it first came out, it was a perfect selection for the 101 must see movies of the 80's. What are you kidding me? Chase and Steve Martin? Even the less known Martin Short was hilarious, throwing around one liners that are STILL used today:"Would you say I have a plethora of pi?atas?" "Do you know what "nada" means? Isn't that a light chicken gravy?" "You son of a motherless goat!" "It's a male plane.... didn't you see the little balls?"I just about fell off my chair when the turtle said "Good night, Ned"Three Amigos neither pretended to be highbrow comedy, nor a spectacular adventure. I think the trio did enough to create a three stooges comedy that doesn't need to rely on high intellect. John Landis has fun directing movies, for crying out loud, he directs some of USA Channel's Psych.If you haven't watched Three Amigos, you're not allowed to sing, use a water canteen in a hot desert, or even wear one of those big sombreros. Hell, I'm not even going to tell you what the movie is about. Go bug some other reviewer for it. Gringo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Any movie with a character named Dusty Bottoms has to be funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few if any movies more hilarious than Three Amigos. In this wild and goofy movie, Martin Short, Steve Martin and Chevy Chase are at their comical best. They are assisted by an outstanding supporting cast, including Alphonso Arau, whose portrayal of the villain "El Guapo" is absolutely hilarious. The movie is essentially a spoof on actors who play actions heroes, mere figments of others' imaginations, yet perceived by the public as being real. What happens when the actors are forced to be the actual characters that they play? The results in this movie are hilarious as the three amigos are confronted with real-life bad guys who themselves are spoofs of Hollywood bad guys. All in all, this is a wonderfully amusing movie. After all, what would you expect from a movie in which Chevy Chase plays a character named Dusty Bottoms?This is one of the funniest and cleverest movies Hollywood has ever made. Not only are the three main characters hilarious, the bad guys are hilarious too, which makes the movie even more ... hilarious. The story is a spoof on the phoniness of Hollywood movies and how easily people can mistake what is shown on the screen for reality. Given the nature of cinema, this is all too understandable. The heroes and villains projected on the screen are but the products of others' imaginations, yet they are presented in such a clever manner that audience comes to believe that those characters are real or at least wish that they were. Martin Short, Steve Matin and Chevy Chase are at their comical best as three bungling actors who find themselves having to play their roles for real. Although some of the humor may seem corny and contrived, it is the very corniness of the humor that makes this movie so laughable. The name of Mr. Martin's character, Dusty Bottoms, is in itself goofy. What would YOU think of anyone with a name Dusty Bottoms</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lucky Day (Steve Martin), Dusty Bottoms (Chevy Chase) and Ned Nederlander (Martin Short) are a silent movie trio known as the "Three Amigos". Wealthy landowners in Mexico, they travel around the country, in their spare moments, and rescue the downtrodden from the clutches of evil forces, like a triplets version of Zorro. Lucky is very adept at rope tricks and the others have their shooting skills, too. Their films are one heroic feat after another and very popular. But, in real life, these three actors are studio property and make very little money, depending on the movie moguls for food, lodging, and clothing. When Lucky decides that they should ask for a boost in salary, the unlucky threesome is stripped down to their underwear and tossed out of the set on their ears. But, wait. From Mexico comes a telegram requesting their services, as a small town is being menaced by El Guapo (Alfonso Arau) and company. However, due to the truncated nature of the telegram, the amigos believe that there are being asked only to star in a film and do their usual "fake" heroism. What a surprise when they land in Mexico and find out they are expected to save the village from a gang with loaded guns! With everyone in town pitting their entire existence on the amigos, can they deliver? This is a very funny film, with wonderful performances, writing and direction. Not only are the three stars terrific, but Arau is side-splittingly humorous, as are the other hispanic cast members. The scenery in Mexico is both lovely and barren while the costuming is first rate, too. As a co-writer, Martin deserves much praise, also, for there are many memorable lines and laugh-out-loud episodes. From Dusty requesting something other than "Mexican" food from his hosts to an accidental shooting of the "invisible horseman" and more, most viewers will be transported far away from life's daily routine with any showing. So, three cheers for the Amigos and get ready to laugh up a storm when you get this one into the DVD player.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good rainy day movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Three Amigos was not a great movie. It was a good movie with moments of greatness. One of the areas in which John Landis and crew excelled was the cinematography. The locations shooting as well as the stuff filmed on the soundstage are colorful, perfectly lit and framed and are basically eye candy. Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack is perfect in every way. Randy Newman's songs are fabulous (and his singing as the 'singing bush' is hilarious). The absolute best part of the movie is the "Blue Shadows" sequence, featuring Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and Martin Short, singing a western ballad written by Randy Newman while surrounded by a campfire, singing horses (with mouth movements hand-animated that are better than much of today's CGI), lots of animatronics critters listening in and probably the most beautiful sunset ever filmed (indoors, on a soundstage I might add). I could never tire of that song or the segment. Otherwise, there are much better movies with Chase, Short and Martin (although not together). Either you love this film or you don't. I fall in the 'love' category, but it's still not a great movie. The predictable plot and sometimes repetitive slapstick can be grating on the nerves at times. Still, the good parts far outweigh the not-so-good, and it actually gets better with multiple viewings. Maybe it's just taking me longer to finally "get it".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By rights, judging by appearance, this comedy should have rated 9 or 10 stars with most viewers. In the mid-eighties, both Martin &amp; Chase were at the top of their field &amp; game, and Short was the new hot kid on the block. It seemed a 'no chance to lose' scenario. This is not a worthless comedy, but the first half-hour is especially lame, almost amateur hour. Rather than getting caught up in the tribulations of these 3 idiotic western/comedic actors of the silent era, you're actually embarrassed to be watching them as they strain to squeeze a few laughs from a clichéd plot. Much of the blame for the beginning can be laid with director Landis, who was unable to utilize their prodigious talents for some reason, indulging in cringe-inducing slapstick. Then, slowly &amp; gradually, the pace and the laughs pick up, until we're all enjoying the three masters of comedy at their best moments. They all have the physicality down pat, emphasizing an almost effeminate way of moving when up against real cowboys or bandits (the 3 are really naive pansy actors, after all).Besides the obvious parallels to The Three Musketeers tale, this is mainly a parody of "The Magnificent Seven" storyline (in this case, with only 3 heroes, rather than 7). Once down in Mexico, running about in the desert or crooning with the wildlife, the 3 stars make the most of it. Some of the scenes turn out to be classic Martin, especially when he informs his 2 compadres that their make-believe show is suddenly 'real' and the whole magic chant stuff involving the invisible swordsman (whacky stuff, but kind of inspired). It's also interesting to watch Martin up against the more clownish and more stupid Chase in this pic. As said, they were both tops in comedy during those days, but Martin seems to dominate in the first half (maybe 'cause he was also co-writer); then Chase sort of comes into his own towards the last third. Short manages to outshine both of them a couple of times when it involves physical mannerisms (check out his horse-riding,gun-playing style). This also reminded me of "The Wild Bunch" in some scenes, what with German arms dealers interacting with the Mexican bandit gang. It's worth a 2nd viewing just to catch a few of the better amusing scenes again, which also means it's an uneven product taken all together.</fullReview>

They soon get hired by a Mexican village to scare off the maniac who's terrorizing them. But the movie stars don't know that this show is for real.Try fitting an invisible swordsman (who gets shot), a singing bush (and a talking turtle) and a room full of hard drinking gun toting Mexican lowlifes who're scared of the sight of Chase, Martin and Short into a workable idea for a film. Somehow this mishmash works, mostly thanks to the film's three irresistible leads. At times the film is laugh out loud funny and fans of the performers consider this film a minor comedy classic. But despite the excellent Amigos it's actually Alfonso Arau, as the villain El Guapo, who completely steals the film. Delivering a terrific comic performance, Arau dominates every scene he's in.Three Amigos has good moments, and lots of them. Good stuff.</fullReview>

One of the best parts of the film:Riding through the desert, HOT. The first Amigo, Steve Martin, opens his flask with great anticipation, only to discover there is about a teaspoon's worth of water in it. The next Amigo, Martin Short, pours the contents of his flask in his mouth. The flask is full of sand. Then Chevy Chase, the third Amigo, opens his flask and it seems as if it has an endless supply of water. It pours all over his mouth and face and shirt. He has enough water to gargle, spit, swish water in his mouth, and spit again. After his fill, then tosses the flask aside. The flask hits the ground and water comes pouring out of it. The other two Amigos have been watching this the whole time. The scene ends with Chevy Chase applying lip balm and then offering it to the other two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "Three Amigos" (Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short) are a silent screen comedy act, who recently got fired from their producer (Joe Mantegna). Because their last adventure bombed at the box office. A lovely Mexican woman (Patrice Martinez) wrote a letter to The "Three Amigos" that her once peaceful village is being terrorized by a fierce bandit gang. Although this woman is quite naive thinking The "Three Amigos" are real heroes. The "Three Amigos" thinking they are in Mexico for fortune and a personal appearance. But they find out, they are dodging real bullets from the fierce bandit gang.Directed by John Landis (An American Werewolf in London, Coming to America, Trading Places) made enjoyable if one-noted silly farce. The film has some hilarious moments and memorable songs, written by Randy Newman. Martin, Chase and Short are extremely well cast in the film. Alfonso Arau is a entertaining villain, if you do remember him as One of the Key's villains from "The Wild Bunch". The "Three Amigos" was a modest box office hit that find more success on video and television. Saturday Night Live Television Producer:Lorne Micheals is one of the producers of the film. The film also has cameos by Jon Lovitz and the late-Phil Hartman. Brain Thompson (From the "Cobra" fame) has a bit part as a German Villain. Most enjoyable for fans by director:Landis or the three lead stars of the film. Written by Steve Martin (Bowfinger, L.A. Story), Lorne Micheals and Randy Newman. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't smile at any point during this movie, your sense of humor is greatly lacking. This movie is set up to make fun of several classics and itself, at the same time. Writers developed the funny and artistic way of getting a couple of out of luck actors to believe they are playing a major gig in Mexico, and they pull it off. Then they add the classic love and heroism in an actual and understandable form. They comedy routines are timed perfect to keep the plot moving and the film from feeling long. The cast they put together has very familiar faces which the crowd easily recognizes as being funny and know they are going to get a good laugh. Truly and artistic masterpiece and a cult classic.A trio of silent silver-screen actors are fired from their job for asking to actually be paid to do the next movie. They quickly get a message that they are needed for a job in Mexico. They arrive to do their show, but find they are not on any stage set and the villains are for real. The story moves as they have to rescue one of the villagers and they have to find their way to the banditos lair realizing they may need help in order to stop the villains from coming back to the village.This is a wonderful treasure for a comedy collection and great to see again on the BIG SCREEN. This is certainly one that falls into college cult classic favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a HUGE fan of slapstick comedy, I find Three Amigos to be extremely funny. Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short team up to bring out what made us all love them so much on Saturday Night Live and all of their comedies to follow.The movie shows us a small Mexican village that is being terrorized by El Guapo (ironically, Spanish for "the handsome one). When all hope seems lost, one of the girls from the village, Carmen sees a showing of "The Three Amigos" about three warriors who protect the peace and (at the end of the particular show she watches) refuse to take the reward money because the justice is their reward. Believing that this is her village's one chance at freedom from El Guapo, Carmen sends for the Three Amigos, promising a huge reward if they come, assuming that they will turn it down like they did in the show.Of course, as we all in the real world know, "The Three Amigos" is merely a TV show that, on the very day that Carmen's telegraph reaches them, is canceled and the actors fired. Lucky Star (Martin), Dusty Bottoms (Chase), and Ned Nederlander (Short) read the telegraph and mistake it as a request for them to act out the show, and in desperate need of money, take up the offer and head down to Mexico. Things get crazy as villagers praise the "warriors" while Lucky, Ned, and Dusty simply believe that these people are just big fans. However, when they discover that "it's real!!", the guys must make a decision to go back to Hollywood or become the Three Amigos... for real.Most people on this message board have said that they're not big fans of the movie, but I personally love it and wish that I could find it on DVD. If you're not a fan of slapstick (or just don't like Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, or Martin Short), then yeah, I wouldn't recommend this movie. However, if you do like it, then I recommend you go and rent this movie... right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Chevy Chase are THE THREE AMIGOS!(cue the Amigo salute, which is a cross between the Macarana and a hernia exam.) This is an funny, but uneven spoof of old westerns, especially The Magnificent Seven(Seven Samurai). The song and dance scenes are the highlights. Martin, Chase, and Short siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing The Ballad of The Three Amigos, Martin and Short, shaking it fast, do a lover's number with Chase on piano, and Martin, Chase, and Short sing one in the obviously fake night trail. Also, watching the three try to scare of bandits by spouting silly dialogue and riding in slaloms is very amusing. The music by Randy Newman(songs) and Elmer "The Magnificent Seven" Berstein(score) add a western feel to the movie. The supporting cast of Patrice Martinez(Beetle Juice), Kai Wulff(MacGuyver), Alfonso Arau(The Wild Bunch, Romancing The Stone), Tony Plana(An Officer and a Gentleman, Monk), and Brian Thompson(The Terminator, Buffy The Vampire Slayer) add value as well as cameos by Joe Mantegna, Jon Lovitz, and Phil Hartman. The movie fails by giving us a village with few people to care about, sometimes jarring scene transitions, overused jokes, and another "hey, I am an idiot" performance from Chevy Chase. Landis tries too hard to stick to the plot of The Magnificent Seven when he should have let the amigos run wild and the movie buckles whenever there is an action scene. This is still a pleasant distraction for fans of it's three leads.P.S. My cousin and I will always be THE TWO AMIGOS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If when you think of an 80's comedy, you think of movies with Chevy Chase, then that would DEFINITELY include this little flick. Funny at times, lame at most, it's just about what you'd expect from Chevy, Steve and that little dude with ADD. No, not Justin Gibson...Never mind. Anyway, the plot of the movie is that three silent film stars, the three amigos (or is it supposed to be capitalized? I don't know; never mind), lose their jobs. They then get a letter from a woman in a small town in Mexico that their village is being terrorized by a vicious baddie. However, the stooges (and hey, there's three of them!) mistake the letter to mean that they are being asked to act in a play sort of a thing. They then go and find out what's going on. Not really something I'd call a laugh riot, but it has its moments, and if you're a Chevy Chase fan, this is DEFINITELY his kind of humor. As is capitalizing the word DEFINITELY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Yes, it is silly, be warned. I have always loved it but when I took my eldest brother, as a young man, he turned to me and said,"What kind of dumb ass movie did you drag me to jackass?" The movie is about three extremely low paid silent film stars who believe they have been invited to Mexico to put on a silent movie. Unfortunately, they were recruited by the village's hottest woman to defend them from El Guapo. It doesn't exactly go like they planned, as they discover that El Guapo is using real bullets and has a very dark sense of humor. "I like these guys, they are funny guys, just kill one of them." Landis has his usual great writing with classics like: "Die with a man's gun, you don't want to die with a little sissy gun like this one." The scene where they put on a musical number in a rough cantina, and the drinkers believe them to be dangerous German gunmen, is worth one viewing alone. You will never hear "My Little Buttercup" the same ever again. The movie follows the predictable template: they are humiliated, the villagers lose faith in them but they learn to become real protectors. Believe me, it doesn't happen overnight. These three are the biggest cowardly dorks ever assembled. You will be imitating the Three Amigos salute for the rest of your days. Another warning for enduring my verbosity, Landis goes quite deeply into parody. My brother's angry question came at the campfire scene where all the animals, including the horses, begin singing with the three. At this point, in the five hundred seat Eastgate, I must be honest with you, a few people got up and walked out. Truthfully, the only Landis movie I hated was Into The Night where he mixed in too much gory violence. Full of great dialog, from the first frame you will laugh. Mantegna steals the movie, at the very beginning, showing you the lowly status that silent film actors had back in the 20's. They dare ask for more money, trust me, it doesn't go very well. Once in Mexico, things go swell for a while until El Guapo shows up. Alfonso Arau shows you the great actor he has always been. Almost every one of his lines is funny, like his men chip in and buy him a sweater in the sweltering desert heat. My header he speaks when the Amigos plan to quietly infiltrate his lair doesn't exactly go the way they drew it up. As Dusty says,"We didn't expect the first part of the plan to work so we have no further plan." There is a running joke with Ned supposedly being the fastest draw on earth.This isn't a good thing as the German gunrunner decides to put this reputation to the test. As your reviewer, it is my duty to warn you this level of camp approaches Buckaroo Banzai. If you go into this movie expecting any realism you will share my brother's scathing appraisal. The ending was the focus of critical attack as being painfully, stupidly absurd. Come on, lighten up, it is like the rest of the movie: silly. It is best described to you as a comic version of The Magnificent Seven. The story-line follows it almost exactly. For me, the dialog is funny from the first image to the very final one. There is great chemistry between the three comedians, Chase plays the dumbest of the three, which, to quote Carmen is rather a hard distinction to make. I watch it over and over since I first saw it thirty years ago, and, no, my brother still refuses to watch that,"stupid ass piece of crap." Just make sure you like deep parody with silly parts or do not put this movie on. The Mexican cast steals the movie with El Guapo and Jefe.

Plenty of hilarious parts. In 1916, the notorious bandit El Guapo (Alfonso Arau) and his gang of thugs are collecting protection money from the small Mexican village of Santo Poco. Carmen (Patrice Martinez), daughter of the village leader, searches for someone who can come to the rescue of her townspeople. While visiting a small village church, she watches a silent film featuring "The Three Amigos" and, believing them to be real heroes, sends a telegram to Hollywood asking them to come and stop El Guapo. However, the telegraph operator edits her message since she has very little money to pay for it.Meanwhile, Lucky Day (Steve Martin), Dusty Bottoms (Chevy Chase), and little Ned Nederlander (Martin Short) are Hollywood silent film actors who portray the heroic Amigos on screen. When they demand a salary increase, studio boss Harry Flugleman (Joe Mantegna) fires them and evicts them from their studio- owned housing. Shortly afterward, they receive Carmen's telegram, but misinterpret it as an invitation to make an appearance with El Guapo.After breaking into the studio to retrieve their costumes, the Amigos head for Mexico. Stopping at a cantina near Santo Poco, they are mistaken for associates of a fast-shooting German pilot (Kai Wulff), who is also looking for El Guapo and who arrived just before they did. The Amigos perform a show at the Cantina, singing "My Little Buttercup", and leave the locals confused. The German's real associates then arrive at the cantina, proving themselves adept with their pistols. A relieved Carmen picks up the Amigos and takes them to the village, where they are put up in the best house in town and treated very well.The next morning, when three of El Guapo's men come to raid the village, the Amigos do a Hollywood-style stunt show that leaves the men very confused. The bandits ride off, making everyone think that the Amigos have defeated the enemy. In reality, the men inform El Guapo of what has happened, and he decides to return in full force the next day and kill the Amigos.The village throws a boisterous celebration for the Amigos and their (supposed) victory. The next morning, El Guapo and his gang come to Santo Poco and call out the Amigos, who confess that they have only been acting and are too scared to confront him after Lucky gets shot in the arm. El Guapo allows his men to loot the village and kidnaps Carmen, and the Amigos leave Santo Poco in disgrace.With nothing waiting for them back home, Ned persuades Lucky and Dusty to become real-life heroes and go after El Guapo. Their first attempt to find his hideout fails when Dusty accidentally kills the Invisible Swordsman who can show them the way, but they spot an airplane and follow it to El Guapo; the plane is flown by the German, who has brought a shipment of rifles for the gang with his associates' help. Preparations are underway for El Guapo's 40th birthday party, and he plans to make Carmen his bride. The Amigos try to sneak into the hideout, with mixed results: Lucky is captured and chained up in a dungeon, Dusty crashes through a window and into Carmen's room, and Ned gets his spurs stuck in a pi?ata hanging overhead.As Lucky frees himself and Dusty sneaks out only to be caught, Ned falls loose and is also captured. The German, having idolized Ned's quick-draw and gunspinning pistol skills since childhood, challenges him to a shootout. Ned wins, killing the German, and Lucky holds El Guapo at gunpoint long enough for Carmen and the Amigos to escape?first on horseback, then in the German's plane.Returning to Santo Poco with El Guapo's entire army in pursuit, the Amigos rally the villagers to stand up for themselves and plan a defense. The bandits arrive in the seemingly empty village, only to find themselves suddenly being shot at by Amigos from all sides and falling into hidden water-filled trenches dug by the villagers. Eventually all of El Guapo's men either desert him or die in the gunfire, and he takes a fatal wound as well. As he lies dying, the villagers, all armed and wearing replicas of the Amigos' costumes, step out to confront him. El Guapo congratulates them on this plan, then shoots Lucky in the foot and dies.The villagers offer to give the Amigos all the money they have, but the Amigos refuse it, saying (as in their movies) that seeing justice done is enough of a reward for them. They then ride off into the sunset.Overall Mark: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be easy for me to say that 'The Three Amigos' goes no place fast if I believed for a moment that it intended to do anything fast. In fact, the movie is so lacadaisy that I think even the stars were checking their watches.The movie has all the earmarks of what could have been. It stars Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short whose brilliant individual work on 'Saturday Night Live' is completely missed here. They play The Three Amigos; a comedy team whose recent box office receipts has caused the studio to hand them their walking papers.Meanwhile down in Mexico a woman sees one of their movies and thinks they are the real deal. She sends a fractured telegram hiring them to save their village from banditos and being in need of work they oblige. Unfortunately they misread the cry for help and think that they are being called to do a publicity show which leads to a long (and I do mean long) series of misunderstandings until very late in the film when they begin to realize that the banditos aren't kidding around.Steve Martin whom I liked in some of his more critically panned films like the underrated 'The Man With Two Brains' seems too in on the joke. Martin Short does almost nothing and Chevy Chase gets one or two moments right and then stands to the side of the screen looking on at the moment.Maybe the problem is that the film feels too safe. We get the feeling that Martin, Chase and Short are in on the joke and that kills the spontaneity of the comedy. The Three Amigos have a trademark gesture which ends with them thrusting their hips forward and coughing. That's not funny because it feels rehearsed. I like it when comedians don't play the moment for laughs. Watch Gene Wilder in 'Young Frankenstein' when he is trying to figure out how to work the revolving bookcase and you'll see what I mean.</fullReview>

The film, spoofing movies like seven samurai and the magnificent seven, has a number of good jokes and good acting from Steve Martin and Chevy chase. Martin short not so much.Landis claims the studio took it out of he's control and it shows because compared to Animal house and Blues brothers, it's nothing special.

		<shortDescription>Just another publicity gig</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Amigos casts Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short as three Latino cowboy heroes of the silent screen where their obvious Anglo speech patterns will not distract from the image they create. Their actors and have the egos and fragilities of Hollywood cowboys. But they also know they're Hollywood cowboys and don't take themselves too seriously.But in a plot gambit taken from The Magnificent Seven, there's a village in 1916 revolutionary anarchic Mexico that's being plagued by a bandit named El Guapo and his gang. Like kids they take their cowboy heroes seriously and they expect these three to act like their screen images.Not so easy for these guys to do that, but once they get going they're actually inspiring in their own ways. Not to mention that in Chase, Martin, and Short you have three of the very best from the training ground of Saturday Night Live. Individually and collectively they make a very good comedy premise come to life.Best scene is in that Mexican bar when the patrons are told three distinctive tough guys are coming to town and even though these guys break into My Little Buttercup for the crowd, the patrons still act scared.How do they rid the town of El Guapo. Why have the villagers use their own special talents. What they are and how they are employed is for you to see Three Amigos and laugh your heads off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is a plethora?....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When silent film stars Lucky Day, Dusty Bottoms and Ned Nederlander get fired, they take a job offer from Mexico, doing a show with El Guapo, supposedly the most famous actor there. Traveling there in expecting good money, they arrive only to learn that El Guapo is a cruel gang leader suppressing people. He abducts the mayor's daughter Carmen, in revenge for the people's cry for help. Now, all hopes of the village folks rest on the weak shoulders of three actors.....Martin was one the biggest comedy actors at the time of this film, as were Chase and Short, so they could do anything they wanted, and with Landis at the helm, that's exactly what they did.The film is way ahead of its time, and its almost Monty Python in its execution, meaning that many of the jokes would go over most people's heads. The first act is pretty slow, but its the build up to the main event.As soon as the Amigos enter Mexico, the film ups its game, and it turns into something not as generic as you would have been led to believe, eg. Its not a studio safe comedy.From singing bushes, invisible swordsman, and song and dance numbers, the movie is beyond bonkers and the three leads play it straight all the way.Its not your typical eighties comedy, hence the poor box office, but its a funny movie, a great companion piece to Tropic Thunder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...This movie will be the cause of it! Of course, I am kidding, as this is really a charming tribute to and spoof of the earlier days of filmmaking, as a silent era Western trio, "Lucky Day" (Steve Martin), "Dusty Bottoms" (Chevy Chase) and Ned Nederlander (Martin Short), find themselves out of work after their last movie flopped and they won't listen to the studio head's suggestion. As fate would have it, a representative of a besieged Mexican village has seen one of their movies and takes it as fact, offering them 100,000 pesos for what they think is a personal appearance when in reality they're being hired to get rid of the fiendish bandit, El Guapo (Alfonso Arau) and his crew who have been terrorizing them. Yes, this is the same basic story also told 13 years later in "Galaxy Quest", but quite likable and funny. Some of the jokes are dragged out a little too long, creating some awkwardness, but overall this is just too hard to resist. Written by Martin (who also takes an executive producer credit), producer Lorne Michaels, and singer / songwriter Randy Newman (who provides the voice of The Singing Bush), its look is just perfect, and for the most part it moves along quite well, providing not one but two scenes of climactic action. The second involves a nice bit of trickery and ingenuity; one can't help but like the characters and the bad guys are also very entertaining in their own right. A few catchy musical numbers add to the fun, with enthusiastic performances by the talented star trio, who definitely look like they're enjoying themselves. Future director Arau, who'd also been a key bad guy in "The Wild Bunch" 17 years before this, is a hoot as El Guapo, and Patrice Martinez as the impassioned Carmen is just gorgeous and immensely appealing and certainly could have had a solid film career after this. It's also great to see Joe Mantegna as the flamboyant studio head, as well as Jon Lovitz and Phil Hartman as his underlings. Particularly funny sequences include the musical number "Blue Shadows" (those horses are hilarious!), the moment where Lucky realizes the danger he and his buddies are truly in, and their assault on the bad guys' stronghold. Of course, the movie isn't just gags; the story is strong enough to sustain its length and keep viewers smiling. There are enough things here to make one laugh out loud and maintain interest (including the fantastic music score by the legendary Elmer Bernstein, whose credits range from "The Magnificent Seven" to "An American Werewolf in London" to "Ghost Busters"), right from start to finish. Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not an award winning film or anything, but it has its moments. It could have been funnier, but it is still amusing enough to watch with your family. Unfortunately, there are a few suggestive jokes so some may be offended. Randy Newman co-wrote this and indeed the songs used in the movie are funny. My favorite scene is the silly sing around the campfire scene. I have to admit that one of the reasons why I enjoy this movie is that it was filmed at Old Tucson studios, and I love seeing the Tucson mountains and beautiful blue sky (and some monsoon clouds as well). Chevy Chase isn't given much to do, sadly enough, but you can tell that the 3 leads are friends and that they had fun making the movie, regardless of the outcome. I don't think this is a total waste of time, and those who are fans of the old Saturday Night Live will enjoy seeing Martin, Chase and Short working together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Amigos is a classic comedy, and not only because of the great sight gags and one-liners but also because of the great acting, great music, and beautiful sets, (both the real ones and the fake ones.) This movie will make you laugh over and over again, even after the hundredth viewing, then you will find yourself repeating the dialog annoyingly while you watch it with your 'amigos.' You can tell, just by looking at their faces on the cover of the box, that this is a great, funny movie, especially with Steve Martin's face seeming to say, "I am the funniest man in the world!," and the other two, with eyes telling you that you will not be sorry by watching this. Perhaps the funniest thing from this movie, besides the beautifully choreographed and hysterical "My Little Buttercup" scene, is their uniforms and the fact that they make 'Mexican movies' and they don't even understand simple Spanish such as "nada," which Chevy Chase mistakes for "a light chicken gravy." Enjoy!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take the title characters from "The Three Musketeers," place them in Hollywood during the Golden Age of Vaudeville, and add a little SNL spice, and what do you have? The Three Amigos! The movie opens in 1916, when a peaceful Mexican village is threatened by the evil El Guapo (Alfonso Arau). When young Rodrigo (Philip Gordon) watches a Three Amigos movie and sees his heroes save a village - a Shakespearean "play within a play" - he sends them a telegraph immediately. Little does he realize that Lucky Day (Steve Martin), Dusty Bottoms (Chevy Chase), and Ned Nederlander (Martin Short) only play these Amigos on stage, not in real life. Moreover, they have been banished from Goldsmith Pictures by its owner, played by Joe Mantegna. After watching the plot a dozen times, you will probably have memorized many of the one liners, not to mention the songs written by Randy Newman. Newman makes a cameo appearance in the movie as "The Singing Bush." As for the one liners, some of my favourites include "Do you have anything here besides Mexican food?" "Take off your hat...hold it over your head...HIGHER! [BANG!]" and "I'll have you shot so full of lead you'll be using your (Richard) for a pencil! / What do you mean? / I don't know." Also take note of a few historical references. Director John Landis alludes to the alliance between Germany and Mexico during the First World War, and, similar to the westerns this movie is parodying, he models the fear of El Guapo's reign of terror after that in Jewish villages in eastern Europe prior to a pogrom. Although Saturday Night Live has come out with very few good movies recently, this 1986 flick is a classic postmodern comedy, and is definitely worth watching. I think I'll watch it again another few times in the next little while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my personal Top 100, Three Amigos is among the first twenty. When seeing this movie (I am one of those lucky guys who found the LD), I feel very good. The performance of Steve Martin, Chevy Chase (who I love anyway for his wonderful innocent face and behaviour) and Martin Short are wonderful and fit together like nothing else. There are no stupid or constructed sub- or by-plots, only the strange chapter from the night in the desert to the singing bush is skip-able without a loss in the plot itself. Alfonso Arau as El Guapo and Tony Plana as his pretty dumb right hand Jefe fit into the whole story perfectly. They, too, perform just great as the not-that-evil, but pretty bad bad guys. The Germans in the film, depicted as evil on a level that cannot be shown in something less than a war, meet their clichés very well. No capability of speaking English without accent whatsoever, no respect for life, even the will to duel with a personal idol due to lack of tolerance. Even in Germany, film-germans like that can only be laughed about. But that's what makes Hollywood so great. Alfred Hitchcock said that what he needs to show Switzerland is mountains and chocolate. By fulfilling clichés, people are captured. And I let the film capture me. Again, one of the milestones of the golden 80's!</fullReview>

Martin wears Chaplin's derby and Chase wears Keaton's boater...otherwise, it contains every Western cliché, and everyone's acutely aware of it.These guys really could've done something smart here. Look at what you have: an audience believing the movie icons are real heroes, and the actors believing the real world is a movie set.The problem is that Martin and Michaels are unable to squeeze very much out of the skits. It's on fumes well before halfway through.And Landis' poor editing just makes it worse. This stuff is paper thin, but he has to stretch every cut to make the end result feature length, thinking the comic presences will be enough. Compare this to the smart editing of "Blues Brothers" or "Spies Like Us" and it's painfully clear.Martin and Chase are both comedians who have to be in the right environment: for Martin, movies about movies ("L.A. Story", "Bowfinger"). Chase can't play an outright imbecile, he has to do layered performances("Fletch") or play it not-as-smart-as-he-thinks-he-is ("Funny Farm").</fullReview>

I first heard of this film while eulogising "Galaxy Quest", and it's perfectly true: "Three Amigos" did do the same idea first. Unfortunately the result for me isn't nearly so funny, because in this case the film doesn't even make a gesture at taking itself seriously -- "Galaxy Quest" manages to have its cake and eat it by being both a spoof of pulp SF and an exciting pulp SF adventure in its own right, but "Three Amigos" doesn't attempt to be internally consistent. A character gets shot in one scene and proceeds to do a song-and-dance routine a couple of minutes later without so much as a wince, for example: a laugh could equally well have been got by having him attempt energetic gestures without thinking and so break off hopping around in agony (I wouldn't have found that terribly funny myself, but it would have been on a level with the comedy in the rest of the film), but that would have involved a petty-minded concern for continuity that the writers of this script clearly shrug aside.Basically, I found the level of humour a bit puerile; if that makes me a snob, then so be it. (Since I didn't like "Blazing Saddles" either, I'm beyond the pale already!) There's a good deal of comic potential, but a lot of it gets wasted: the cantina scene, as has been noted, is probably the best, being set up neatly and capped with a twist at the end. Much of the film, though, came across as a series of improvised skits that needed editing by a less indulgent hand, and it's hard for me to like a picture where I find the characters so unsympathetic: I don't find stupidity inherently endearing.It's unfair to criticise a spoof for misrepresenting its source material (and somebody did a good research job in mocking-up those title cards), but a song-and-dance trio really aren't the most likely stars of *silent* Westerns (singing cowboy films, for obvious reasons, didn't come in for another twenty years), and the characters in the 'film within a film' that Carmen sees aren't making even the slightest attempt at silent film style acting: they're simply reciting lines rather pointlessly at the screen and then having a caption pop up to explain what they said... But then I have a problem. I actually know who Dorothy Gish is :-) I still think the basic idea is a good one, but I don't think this treatment is a particularly funny result. It does have its entertaining moments, but they're surrounded by an awful lot of flat jokes, and I prefer my comedies to have some internal logic, however topsy-turvy their world: where are the three actors riding off to in the finale, for example? They've already explained that they've got nothing and nowhere to go back to, and (unlike for the characters in "Galaxy Quest") nothing has happened to change that. I know you're very clearly not supposed to worry about that sort of minor detail, but in the sort of comedy I'm used to, the finale is the place to tie up loose ends -- not create new ones...It would be interesting to see what the Monty Python team, Ealing Studios, Waner Brothers circa 1935, or Buster Keaton, respectively, could have made of this same material. A lot of potentially very different films could have been based around the original concept, and sadly most of them would probably have suited my taste better than this particular one. I did laugh in places, but overall I found the humour was outweighed by the general frustration factor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is pretty cheap humour but if you're in the right mood it can be a lot of fun. Especially rewarding were Alfonso Arau and a singing Randy Newman in the movie role of his life.This movie is full of drab one liners that can either leave you bored or full of glee. It's a deliberate cut-up and has a lot of memorable scenes.The bartender (Fred Asparagus?) is also a treat, as is Kai Wulff. Small parts by Phil Hartman and Jon Lovitz.This is either hilariously funny or an excruciating bore. Maybe it can be right in between. Maybe you don't think the screenplay was all that good, or even the efforts of the principal cast, but just seeing Alfonso Arau on screen again should get you going. Good work!And don't forget Randy Newman's great medley of extremely annoying songs.</fullReview>

I loved the invisible swordsman scene, and the when they attempt to break into El Guapo's residence...My favorite scene is the one of Steve Martin walking down the hall...its amazing that he can make walking into one of the funniest parts of the movie. The plot line is your basic "man finds who he is" type thing, and its a bit cheesy, but everyone needs a break from deep, philosophical, symbolism-in-everything, or murder mystery, end of the world movies. Chevy Chase and Martin Short put on a great show as well...the stories of Little Neddy are hilarious, and Chase did a wonderful job in the canteen scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very funny movie at many times. Chase, Martin, and Short are all great comic actors, and the script contains many parts for them to showcase this. My favorite part was probably the scene in the cantina in which the German enters, and the ensuing song-and-dance scene that just mortifies the present crowd. The pair of gunmen entering afterwards was grand as well. In addition to being a fine movie in its own right, this one is especially good if you have seen The Magnificent Seven, which it is something of a pastiche of. As for The Magnificent Seven itself, that was a Western re-imagination of The Seven Samurai. So, like it's said, there's not an original thought in the world, but what the hell, eh?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie IS silly, but it is one of the rare just-for-fun kind of movies that the whole family can enjoy together. The kids laugh at the antics of Steve Martin, Martin Short and Chevy Chase and the adults can't help but laugh over the hokey-ness of the storyline as they re-live the movies of the "good old days" of 50's-60's "black hats versus white hats" westerns. This movie is a genuine throw-back to the days when the bad guys were always thwarted even if the good guys were sappy, idealistic and, let's be frank, not too bright. No nudity, no swearing, no real violence (one character gets shot but it appears like a mosquito bite and is forgotten about as the movie finishes up) and has classical lines that my kids love to repeat, such as the insult "You are the son of a motherless goat!" In other words, nonsensical but fun. :o)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Three Amigos' has a few genuine laughs, but overall is not a very good movie. It has lots of silliness, but not coherent silliness that we find in movies like 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.' Set in Mexico in 1916, El Guapo and his men terrorize a small village. Carmen sees a movie with the Three Amigos (Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, Martin Short), believes they are real gunfighters, sends them a telegram in Hollywood asking them to come protect their village and drive out El Guapo. But Carmen didn't have enough money to send the whole telegram, instead had an abbreviated version sent, and the Three Amigos thought they were just making a guest appearance for fans. When they figure out the bad guys are firing real bullets, right before the half-way mark of the movie. Saw it on DVD borrowed from my public library. Favorite role was El Guapo played by Alfonso Arau, the same actor who created the character two years earlier in 'Romancing The Stone', the villager with the jeep that allowed Jack and Joan to escape.SPOILERS are in my remaining comments, tread with caution.After almost being killed at the real guns of El Guapo's bandits, the Amigos escaped, but then decided fighting the bad guys was the right thing to do, found their way to the hideout, and in very silly scene managed to escape again, back to the small village. Asking the townspeople what their 'talent' was, the answer was 'sewing.' So, they had Three Amigo type costumes made for all the townspeople so that when El Guapo showed up again, it appeared the Amigos were everywhere, confusing the bandits, and the villagers got the upper hand, killing his men then El Guapo himself. Each of the three men had to leave behind a beautiful Mexican girlfriend as they rode away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Plethora of Funny Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it is underrated, and yes, as a story it's pretty lame. But the point of this film is the jokes, and there are plenty of great ones to make this movie worthwhile. The big standout scenes are, of course, the Singing Bush, and My Little Buttercup. But there are so many other great little moments throughout the film that come out on repeated viewing.For instance, Steve Martin discussing the advantages of a democracy and bicameral system to the guard bringing Martin down to the dungeon. Or the facial expression that Chevy Chase makes when asked if he knows what "Nada" means. Or Martin Short telling the insanely dull story of Dorothy Gish saying to Short that he "has got it."And, of course, "It's a sweater!"This is the one film where the comedic styles of Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short really works. Whereas many efforts of them have fallen flat in other pictures (e.g., The Lonely Guy, either Goldie Hawn/Chevy Chase film, Clifford) in here everything works. And, especially, if you want to see what Chase and Short were like before they turned into ridiculous jerks this is a good place to start.Also, this is the only film for which Randy Newman helped with the script. The humor which comes across in his bitingly satirical songs is toned down, but still very much present. Wish he wrote more--too bad everyone hated this movie.To clarify one thing: The Three Amigos were stars of silent movie serials. Back then actors were rarely paid for their efforts and were oftentimes considered less valuable than the scenery, hence their having no pull with Flugleman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed Opportunities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Three Amigos" has always struck me as a movie filled with more missed opportunities than actual laughs. It's not a bad movie by any means; the concept is clever and in fact many individual segments are brilliant.But far too often the director, John Landis, seems to have been relying on his three leads (Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, and Martin Short) to simply "be funny" without the aid of a funny script. This approach can work if you happen to film 10 times as many improvs as you need so you can then pick out the truly funny ones (see "Austin Powers"). There are so many long, drawn out scenes where the Three Amigos simply seem to be mugging aimlessly while they wait for Landis to yell "Cut!"BUT--and this is a big but--Steve Martin's screenplay does have several hilariously weird bits and Landis does stage some wonderful musical numbers to Randy Newman's songs. All in all, "Three Amigos" is much better than Landis' other half-assed Saturday Night Live type flick "Spies Like Us". In fact, "Three Amigos" is better than almost anything Landis has don for the past decade and a half (unfortunately, most of his recent movies have sucked big time, so the praise is admittedly faint).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ohh, Lucky! Ohh, Dusty! Ohh, Ned! Let's Ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the funniest movies I've seen, and I enjoyed it from beginning to end. I won't comment a lot about it because there are lots of reviews on here that say the same thing I would say. I would just like to make a couple of observations.One time a friend and I were watching Mel Brooks' comedy "High Anxiety," which is a hilarious sendup of themes from Alfred Hitchcock movies. My friend remarked, "This is just a silly comedy, but I'm getting excited about the plot." I, too, found the plot oddly suspenseful, even though there were laughs galore. Someone has said that's a hallmark of a great parody; it gives you the feeling that you are watching a movie that was intended to be taken seriously, but is so absurd that comedy is the result."The Three Amigos" is a parody of classic themes of Westerns, and also of the history of Hollywood films. While the plot is more simple than that of "High Anxiety," I still found that the story pulled me in. I actually cared about the plot and the characters, and vicariously I went on their great adventure with them. The comedy made the journey that much more enjoyable. When people say this plot is "unbelievable," I wonder what they were expectiing. After all, a movie like this is about things that don't happen just every day. Since most of the film could have happened, why not "suspend disbelief" and simply enjoy it?Also, for those of you old enough to remember, or who are at least familiar with the history of television, there was a famous 1950s TV show called "The Cisco Kid." He travelled the Old West righting wrongs like the Lone Ranger, only he and his sidekick Pancho were both hispanic. That was unusual for the time, and the show was also the first series to be filmed in color (in the early 50s!). The clothes that the Cisco Kid wore bear a striking resemblance to the costumes of the Three Amigos. Clearly the movie borrowed themes from that show, even the ending. After waving goodbye to the viewers, Cisco and Pancho would say, "Let's ride!" and the thrilling music would rise as they rapidly rode away across the desert. I found it thrilling to see Lucky, Dusty, and Ned do that, too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cosy Sunday afternoon matinée comedy feature by director John Landis sees a dependable comic trio (Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short) as silent movie stars that get mistaken for the real deal. Heroes on the silver screen, Lucky Day (Martin), Dusty Bottoms (Chase) and Ned Nederlander (short), but in real life they're far from it. But they are given a chance, as after being fired by the studio they come to the aid of a small Mexican town Santa Poco who offered them 10,000 pesos to rid them of some vicious outlaws led by El Guapo. At first they think it's all a show, but they come to realise that these bandits are actually packing heat.As a kid it was one of my favourites and it's still a charming, silly (some downright silly --- singing tree &amp; invisible swordsman) and harmless little slapstick comedy by Landis. Sticking out with its colourful back-lot sets, the concept is pretty much a bright and breezy send-up of "The Magnificent Seven" and going along way to making it all work is the crackling chemistry between the three leads and their perfect timing of the gags (numerous visual humour) or dialogues. While not always consistent and at times a little too constraint (strange for Landis), it remained amusing. Martin takes the lead with his eccentricity; Chase is dry and laid-back and Short is a nice balance in between. They looked great in their costumes --- with the bar scene being a pick. Alfonso Arau is good fun as the tyrant El Guapo. The support cast is a strong one too with the likes of Tony Plana, Patrice Martinez, Jon Lovitz, Joe Mantegna, Phil Hartman, Norbert Weisser and Brian Thompson. Elmer Bernstein chips in with a playful music score.Decent madcap fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not bad, but it could have been a bit better if they had tried to make one type of movie and stuck with it. The main problem with this movie is that at times it is a sentimental comedy, a total screwball comedy, and even a dark comedy with elements that were not comedy at all. Another problem is that at times the amigos played by comedy legends Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short do not even have the best lines in the movie. No the guy with some of the best lines in this film is the guy playing the bad guy EL Guapa. His best coming when he talks about the pi?atas with his underling. The story at times gets a bit to much too as the Germans and such were a bit much. Still, the film is not a total loss as there are some funny things going on like the ride through the desert where they are in need of water and Chevy is gargling his seemingly do it just to be a jerk for no real reason. After that there is a scene that is one of the problems as their is a singing bush and this just does not seem to fit into the movie at all up to this point as it seems more fitting of an "Airplane" type movie or something that has not been as serious. Up to that point there are funny scenes that are a bit goofy, but nothing involving something that strange. If they could have been more consistent with the comedy and the way the movie flowed it might have been rather good, as it stands it is a not so bad movie that has some flashes of really good comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing better than quoting lines from a film you and your buddies love. "Three Amigos!" falls into that category.But it's not a good film.My friends like this film, I like this film, even my mother liked this film, as have a number of other people I've run into. So what's wrong with it if it has such popularity?Part of it is a certain Star-Power and expectation that's weighed in with the three lead actors who costar in this film. The public expected more from them, and I think that torpedoes the film from the get go. We know the capabilities of Short, Martin and Chase, and expect more from them. We're watching an all-star comedy team who can't seem to gel for something more outrageous and hilarious.On top of that we're also watching a tribute to films of an era that is long gone; silent movies. The antics of Chaplain, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton can be seen here and there, along with a dash of Will Rogers and Laurel and Hardy. Insert your silent icon here. But this three layer comedy cake is a bit uneven. The top layer, which is the heaviest, should be on the bottom. and the frosting is only put on here and there. It's a self referencing film that seems to have missed the mark.But, in spite of all that, it is funny and quotable. I liked it enough to buy a copy, and enjoy it for what it is. Intelligent comedy? No way. A good film? Err... it's passable. Funny? Here and there. Worth a look? I think so :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When silent movie era action stars Lucky DAy(Steve MArtin),Dusty Bottoms(Chevy Chase)and Ned Nederlander(MArtin Short)overestimate their clout and significance,they're completely kicked off their movie studio lot,stripped of their status and left without any identity except their crafted movie personas. Meanwhile, in the rural Mexican village of Santa Poco, some sweet but naive locals,led by a single mother(the stunning PAtrice MArtinez)turn to the "Three Amigos" for help against a brutal crime lord named El Guapo(Alphonzo Arau). The three unemployed actors misunderstand the message of distress and become involved a lot further than they could have ever imagined.A previous reviewer referred to the "inspired gags" of the film. Well,those inspired gags(physical AND verbal)coupled with a fitfully funny musical number or two(co-composed by none other than super prolific composer RAndy NEwman,underscored by another legend:Elmer BErnstein)make for a gloriously fun romp. Director John Landis,always much more comfortable in comedy than any other genre,has the benefit of working with veteran comedy actors and a light,pliable script from Martin and Lorne MIchaels,probably felt like he got a gift from Heaven with this. Great costumes,sets and a inspired photography allows for a story and plotting that might catch a few discerning eyes(i.e. painted,fake sky one scene,natural,full on-location landscape;some plot twists that seem a more than a little contrived and which I won't say so as to let any spoilers go)to be mostly forgivable.I first caught this movie when it was first released over twenty years ago in the theater,back when I mostly only went to comedies starring familiar faces or sort of brainless actioners,and I probably would've caught ANYTHING with Martin,Chase or Short,so I feel quite fortunate as well as edified that I caught this when it was a fresh release and it was as good as advertised. Upon re-watching it for what has to be at least the fifth time recently on DVD,I still find myself enjoying it all the same,making it lasting as well as enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I thought it was alright. In the roughly ten times I've watched it since I've laughed more and more! It gets better each time. Amongst friends, it's probably the most quoted movie we laugh about (yes, Caddyshack and Blazing Saddles are right up there in the top ranks of quotes, too). It's a comedy gem! The heroes have an awesome comedy chemistry, the villains are funny, and the smaller roles have their moments, too. I'm laughing as I write this reflecting on it -- a good sign! It's also timeless. The subject, setting, and dialog will allow it to be appreciated by the next generation and the one after that. The laughs make this picture not just famous... but IN-famous!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 Amigos is the best. No comparison. My entire extended family, my 3 kids, my wife know each line by heart. We still laugh throughout the whole movie. Anyone who pans it simply hasn't seen it enough times. I tell people that they won't understand it the first 4-5 times. You WILL die like dogs! My 40th Bday party was a 3 amigos party. I was Lucky Day. My 2 boys were Dusty and Ned. My wife was CARMEN...see, a rose can bloom in the desert. We had a singing bush w/ a boom box hidden in it. A 7 pc mariachi band. lots of margaritas. Am I up to 10 lines yet? What a strange requirement! Anyway, enjoy the movie and feel free to share your favorite parts with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Little Buttercup...has the sweetest smile...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the greatest comedy that I have ever seen. All three of the Amigos were on SNL, so the comedy is very physical--it's full of sight gags, but my favorite part is when they are singing "My Little Buttercup" in the cantina. Another SNL cast member in this movie is Phil Hartman--he's in the office with that guy who fires them. This film is hilarious and its lines are easy to remember and easy to retell. There are some dirty jokes like the woman at El Guapo's asking Carmen "do you know what foreplay is?"; "neither does El Guapo", but small kids won't get it anyway. If you like old school Saturday Night Live, you'll love this movie. It is like one big SNL skit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am almost personally hurt that more people don't treasure the Three Amigos as much as I do. I have committed most of the film to memory. I remember throwing Mexican themed parties as a child so I could invite friends over, eat burritos and watch this movie. I am so in love with the craft of this movie that I can't poke a single hole in it. And I am someone who rarely says that about any film. It is a classic.I'm one of the few people in this country to sing and dance to "My little buttercup" in the same fashion as the too effeminate Amigos, and I have no problem with it. I'm not sure what people want from the film. I can't think of a scene that doesn't work. Shooting the invisible swordsman, come on. The singing bush, come on. The cowboy song with animal accompaniment, COME ON! That very last scene, as the Amigos are saying their farewells. Martin had his Carmen, Chase does his thing, and Short pulls it out with perhaps the sexiest women ever submitted to print. Completely out of left field, but in keeping with the feel of the film.I strongly recommend one of my all time favs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a fun movie to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On I love the 80's, they had mentioned Three Amigos! It looked pretty funny, I mean not to mention three of the funniest actors of our time are in it: Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Chevy Chase. They showed some pretty funny scenes in the show and I asked my mom about it, she said that it was a pretty funny movie. So, when I went to Hollywood Video, I figured to watch it and have a few good laughs when I got home.While Three Amigos has some pretty good laughs in it, I mean, I did laugh out loud a few times, it wasn't exactly what I expected. I think I was expecting too much with the film. But still I would recommend this for a fun film to watch if you have nothing better to do or are looking for a cute comedy.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Slapstick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this may not be a must-own film, I believe it to be a must-see film, especially for a slapstick comedy lover.As is the case with almost all slapstick comedies, the strength of this film lies not in its plot, but in its extremely creative writing.A mix of physical comedy and flat out hilarious scenarios, the origin of which I cannot possibly fathom - are what sets this film apart from the average slapstick film. Throw in the stellar cast, and this film is an instant classic.Of course, there are a few "groaners," almost impossible to avoid in this genre - and a musical scene - which I've never been a real fan of. However, the overall quality of the rest of the film far outweighs those small detracting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The secrete love child of monthy python and Mel brooks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If monthy python and mel brooks made a movie child together, chances are, the three amigos would be the bastard offspring.The three amigos is one of those film's who captures the style and humor of mel brooks, and the silliness of monthy python, yet, nether were involved in the making of this film.With 3 comic gems of the 80's (unfortuntley they cant be called that today), Steve Martin, Chevey Chase, and Martin Short star as a group of out of work silent film stars, who are mistaken by a small Mexican village for heros because thats who they play on the silver screen. When they head down to Mexico to star with the "In famous" El Guapo, they think its all a show, yet find out that they are in way over there heads. What follows is a classic, non stop laugh riot.The film works because it never take's itself too seriously, much like mel brooks films (like blazing saddles) and interjects monthy python in it as well, yet, none of the jokes seems like a rip off of either films.As for the acting, Steve, Chevy and Martin are in top form. Steve Martain plays the groups unofficial leader lucky day, were Chevy Chase is the group's dim wit, Dusty Bottoms, and the then young Steve Martin as Ned Nederlander, the little brother of the group and each one plays off each other well. There's no real comic star here, since all 3 work perfectly together.As for the villain, Alfonso Arau plays the Infamous El Guapo, with just the right amount of evilness and humor. With his evil head hanco Jefe, the two come off like an Mexican version of Mr Burns and Smithers from the simpsons.Overall, this is a must see film if your in the mood for a good laugh. What is unfortunate, is that the current incarnations of this film on DVD are bare bones, meaning little if any extra features. We don't get any deleted scenes, documentaries, or any other nifty features, just the movie. But, for 10 dollars in your local circuit city's bargen bin (probley less) its a steal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A first rate slapstick comedy about three fired silent film stars that unknowingly get hired by a small village (ala The Magnificent Seven) to fight a Mexican tyrant, the infamous El Guapo. I find with this movie you either really love this film or you don't. For those that don't love it, it is usually because they just don't get it or they don't like the leads (Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short). People that are movie buffs will appreciate it on a lot more different levels. I highly recommend this film. It doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't!

		<shortDescription>Well Known 'Inane Comedy'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Amigos is a well known example of what I call 'inane comedy'. The jokes are silly and unfocused, while the film's comedy strategy and type seems uncertain. It is as thought the writers and comedian-stars weren't really quite sure what to do once the talent was assembled and threw together the first concept that came to mind, and the first comedy ideas they could conjure up to fit into the basic premise of the film.The makings of a decent comedy are here: We have three comedian actors, a workable concept and a good comedic director at the helm (Landis). But names aren't everything. Three stars under-deliver. We get Martin Short doing his prototypical goony movements, Steve Martin's slightly less goony movements and smarminess, and Chevy Chase's buffoonery with vintage obnoxious baritone singing from time to time. But perhaps worse than the lack luster and tired performances is the fact the film has no comic direction to speak of. I'm not trying to hold this film to high standards at all---I just want some laughs from it, but more often than not you need some sort of comedy philosophy and tone to build from in order to make people laugh as much as they should. The film starts out as though it may be a satire, making fun of silent movie Hollywood and the hubris of Hollywood in general. Quickly it gets away from that and moves to making fun of three egotistical idiot-stars. From there the film turns into a 'we thought this was fake, but it is real' farce. Some seriousness is added to parts of the plot to fuel this farce scenario. The heroes then become a version of what they faked in silent movies to end the film, in both a not touching and not funny way. Some of the jokes are misunderstanding driven, some try to satirize, some are character driven (look how dumb this character is, and how egotistical this one is!) some are absurdist, while some of the better jokes are old time gags such as the canteen/desert scene and the troubled plane that lands perfectly after an obviously incongruent cut.But the inanity of the writing, the scattered comedy focus and average performances aren't the only problems here. The execution of potentially good jokes stands out as a feature of this film. The one that comes to my mind is the strange camp-out scene with the super fake set and singing animals (including a tortoise!). The scene is odd and is full of potential laughs, but falls flat. Even those who get a chuckle out of it will be laughing less than they should. An odd feature of the film is that many of these negative aspects make it seem like a rushed, money making project, but the film was made with obvious care. The sets are really nice, the scenery is great and the supporting actors and extras are fantastic (often providing needed little laughs). Even the costumes are well made. I got as much enjoyment looking at the little Mexican village and surrounding scenery as I did from laughs.Landis has directed many fantastic comedies, such as Animal House and Blues Brothers. This is not his best work, nor is it Steve Martin's or Chase's. It is an OK movie to watch if bored---it is slightly above average for a comedy, and slightly below average for a typical film, in my mind. There are many better places to look for laughs despite the big names. Four and ? stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needed More Jokes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short team up for a screwball comedy but it's as though they think their presence alone will make the film funny. The Three Amigos is seriously lacking in jokes, and suffers from the clichéd curse of a comedy being more about action than humour. I kept hoping for the moment when one of the three would step up and steal the show but they're all equally bland.The pieces were all there, it's a great idea for a comedy, but the three principles were wasted. Too much emphasis was placed on getting them together and not enough on the script. It needed another few drafts before it was ready to shoot.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahead of it's time !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I adore this movie. It's the perfect fun film that in my opinion did not fit into a decade where the moto was greed is good and patroitic action films as well as teen movies/special effects/chart music and the latest fashions controlled what was being produced out of Hollywood.I think had "Three Amigos !" come out pre-1984 "Ghostbusters, Gremlins, Back to the Future" it just might have been a much bigger hit. Having said that, it has generated a huge following over the years which brings me to say that, "time always tells !" and period settings in films generally have difficulty finding a young audience, especially in the 80's. The amount of people that laughed at me for saying back then that Three Amigos ! was a great film and now they all say it's a classic !!! It just wasn't "hip'thing to say back then. The same happened with John Carpenter's The Thing and Blade Runner. So, it was either too late coming out in 1986 when the decade took a drastic turn or it was 20 years ahead of it's time. I think box office wise it was didn't have much of a chance but it's great that audiences of today love itWhat I've noticed over the years is that kids who grew up on Three Amigos ! all love it today.However, there is on thing that I have also noticed is that a lot of women I know don't like the film at all. Maybe its an Amigo guy bonding thing, who knows ?So now, let us do the Three Amigo salute !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like the one who is not so much clever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder how it is possible that there are people who do not catch the comedian touch of the movie. True, not every gag is of the most creative sort. But there is such a lot to laugh about: Carmen is asking her girlfriend "Which one do you like most of the 3 amigos (and we know already they are all three masterpieces of cleverness)?" She answers: "The one who is not so much clever!" And like that it goes on. This movie is a proof that Hollywood knows how to produce funny comedies that entertain a broad audience. My 3 daughters liked to watch it when they were small (they understood that the violence was not to be taken serious), meanwhile they are grown up and still they can laugh about the "mas intelligente" El Guapo. I only have to mention "the singing bush" and they start laughing. Sometimes I use the saying of the pilot, who after he shot 3 or 4 men in the saloon because they had been laughing about his strange appearance said: "Be nice to my friends, as they are much less friendly than I am!" Sometimes nonsense is lifting you up.</fullReview>

I think that every single person in the movie, including the amigos, can represent one of my family members. Its a great movie that doesn't need to be lude or vulgar to be funny (if you have kids, this would be a movie I would recommend. Its got some innuendos, but for the most part its kid-approved.)Its got awesome jokes, good songs, and is basically a movie you can laugh and talk through. You probably wont get lost in the movie if you decide to get up to get some popcorn. I don't want to get into too many details of the movie, but if your looking for a fun movie to watch on a Saturday night, this would be it! Bravo to Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and Martin Short on a wonderful performance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I expected more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected more from this movie, after all its widely known and formed the inspiration for later movies such as "A Bug's Life", "Mystery Men" and "Galaxy Quest". Not the least movies in the genre.The premise of the movie also is good but this movie is a typical case of; the premise is funnier and more original than the actual movie itself. The jokes are weak and the movie only relies on its premise, which basically forms the only comical situation of the movie. Even the great three main characters are pushed to the background. There aren't really many jokes present, which makes this movie also far from being one of the best or interesting comedies.The three main characters are good and they are a good spoof on '20's serial-movies. There are being played by '80's comedy icons Steve Martin, Martin Short and Chevy Chase. Especially Steve Martin is at his best as the leader of the bunch. But all of them however get a surprising disappointing amount of fun or interesting to do. The movie really is lacking in jokes and overall the movie itself could had been so much more of a fun one. Also the villains, who seemed to be interesting enough, are heavily underused in the movie. More was to be expected from '80's comedy talents such as John Landis, Steve Martin, Martin Short and Chevy Chase involved.Hightlights of the movie to me were the musical numbers, which were definitely the most fun sequences of the movie. The songs are from composer Randy Newman. The fine musical score itself is from composer Elmer Bernstein, who ironically also scored "The Magnificent Seven", on which this movie is obviously based.Sure the movie is still a fun one to watch, mainly thanks to the premise that is obviously based on the Akira Kurosawa movie "Shichinin no samurai" and it's western remake "The Magnificent Seven". Still the movie is a bit of a disappointment, considering the fact how well known it is over the world and how many later movies it inspired. Only really recommendable to the fans of '80's comedies.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, and Martin Short get the roles of a lifetime in "Three Amigos!", where they have to defend a Mexican town from bandits in 1916. Partly an excuse to have the three stars' personalities bounce off of each other, the movie plays everything for all that it's worth. Needless to say, Chase is pretty much the goofiest character in the movie. Probably the three coolest scenes in the movie are the Roy Rogers spoof, the birthday party, and the whole end sequence (although the chain sequence was also pretty neat).All in all, this is another comedy triumph from the director of "Animal House" and "The Blues Brothers". It's too bad that the three stars didn't all co-star in another movie after this. Also starring Joe Mantegna, Jon Lovitz, Phil Hartman and Alfonso Arau (who also appeared in "The Wild Bunch" and directed "Like Water for Chocolate").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved it the first time I saw it on the big screen way back in 1986, and I love it today... I have seen this movie, with its excellent corny comedy, 30+ times! I rarely view movies a second time around... I remember details easily and am an armchair critic much to the chagrin of my husband. "Three Amigos" is a classic, well-written comedy with phenomenal chemistry between the cast of characters. It provides a mostly family-friendly plot; young children will miss the few bits of language and innuendo. The good guys are a trio of almost squeaky-clean, bumbling, out-of-work actors and the bad guys are a gang of mangy-looking bandits who terrorize a small village in Mexico. The trio head to Mexico with dollar-signs (or shall we say, pesos) shining in their eyes, but leave having gained self-respect and true hero-identity through helping the villagers stand up to and conquer the enemy. And all this is done with a "plethora" of hilarious comedic punches. No movie could truly be a perfect 10, but I give this one top rating for coming close to achieving perfection; it will stand the test of time. Add it to your DVD library!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally I think this is one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen. I remember when I was 8 and saw it the first time, I didn't get many of the jokes but the visuals and voices were funny. It could keep my attention day after day, which is sometimes hard to do. The VHS tape we had of it broke because it was viewed so many times. I just recently bought the DVD of this movie and showed it to many of my college friends who had not seen it before. They all thought it was one of the funniest movies they had seen in awhile. Many critics of the movie talk about missed opportunities for jokes and it's seemingly slow pace. Its a simple movie with simple jokes and simple plot. Some people can't enjoy a simplistic movie, they need constant reassurances they are watching a funny movie. I am not saying that these people should be ashamed. I am just adding my thoughts so if someone is reading these posting trying to figure out if they should watch it or not, they can have another opinion.</fullReview>

Chevy Chase plays off the more outlandish antics of Steve Martin and Martin Short like the comedy veteran that he is. His facial expressions while the three are desperately seeking water in the desert made me laugh my head off.The Three Amigos is by no means a serious comedy. By that I mean that unlike Caddyshack, Trading Places, Stripes or Ghostbusters, it does not even make an attempt at character development or a coherent story line.

My favorite scene is the cantina scene where they sing:"My little buttercup has the sweetest smile Dear little buttercup, won't you stay awhile Come with me where moonbeams paint the sky And you and I might linger in the sweet by and by, oh...Dear little buttercup, with your eyes so blue Oh little buttercup, you' re a dream come true You and I will settle down in a cottage built for two Oh, dear little buttercup, I love you...Everybody !My little buttercup, has the sweetest smile Dear little buttercup won't you stay awhile You and I will settle down in a cottage built for two, ohDear little buttercup Sweet little buttercup, My little buttercup I love you" --------------------- Love this movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie only scored 5.8! Unbelievable! I have seen it numerous times since I was ten and my brother and I are always cracking up. There are a few scenes that should be classics. Movie is about three silent movie actors who take themselves way to seriously. This results in getting them fired. There's the child star, the 'goodlooking/charming' one and the one who considers himself the leader. Once they get a letter from a Mexican girl who asked them to save her village after seeing one of their movies and believing it's real, it's the three amigo's to the rescue!!!I love the part at the Singing Bush and the part where they are trying to break into the film studio, with Steve Martin making all the bird noises. It's probably not the best collaboration of SNL-actors but still...This is good entertainment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comedy is uneven, to put it mildly, and only mediocre on balance. But the song-and-dance routine by Short and Martin ("accompanied" by Chase on piano) to the song "My Little Buttercup" is a classic. It deserves to be included in excerpt reels as an example of great comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't really remember the first movie I ever saw. I'm sure it was something from Disney and I probably loved it, but the first movie I ever idolized was Three Amigos. Ever since, I have thought that Steve Martin is quite possibly the funniest man on the planet. From the time that our VHS tape broke from massive viewings to the movies distribution on DVD, about 13 years passed and I still knew all of words. In my opinion, it is the funniest movie without a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Theory of Why People Don't Like It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have come to believe that many people put down this obvious masterpiece because it makes them uncomfortable. Like every other part of the film this is on several levels. First, Steve Martin's humor (he is billed as head writer) is difficult for many people. People who are uptight have trouble with his 'Jerk' humor; much like the other great jerk, Jerry Lewis. Second, the film deliberately breaks the invisible barrier between 'them' on the stage or in the movie &amp; us; the watchers. Things like switching to the sound stage hokey set for the camp scene are calculated to rub a sore spot on those who must have total continuity of style &amp; no bending of the illusion of a real life experience. We call these people unsophisticated (there are other less kind terms). All these 'change-ups' in style, back references to the fact that this is only a movie &amp; bending of the rules of continuity/ suspension of dis-belief are tailor made to get under the skin of those who cannot separate themselves from the work itself. I imagine that the 'true believers' out there find the film extremely uncomfortable to watch.The humor in the film is amazingly plentiful &amp; runs the gamut from boffo belly laugh physical humor thru delicious sexy lines to very sophisticated word plays. I can't off hand think of another film that displays this remarkable range. In keeping with the 'change-up' I was talking about there are many heartfelt, even tender, references to early film-making &amp; Hollywood. There are many humanity type touches in little bits between the players all of whom, right down to the least bit actor are excellent &amp; perfectly cast. I believe that there was competition &amp; inspiration going on between the three comedy leads &amp; this illuminated the rest of the cast &amp; inspired them to greater heights too. If I could belabor a couple of great truths illustrated by the film. I specially liked the part where the Amigos (admitted devout cowards) rally the townspeople to defeat El Guapo. It's a simple thing but true throughout history; you have to stand together &amp; conquer your fear to free yourselves from oppression. One of America's great core principles. Also what do you think of the naive belief of the heroine in the Amigos. Does she have the ultimate problem with suspension of dis-belief or does she see something no one else does? Not a few men have reached their fullest potential because a good woman believed in them.Finally , Steve Martin stands out as the prime moving force in the film. My personal belief is that the film is his masterpiece. I firmly believe too that the film will stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very silly movie. It is supposed to be a spoof of The Magnificent Seven, but it is just too ridiculous, while it seems to want to take itself somewhat seriously. It appears to be primarily a showcase for the comedic talents of Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short. They are hilarious actors, but the movie is not really worth watching. An interesting item for me is that the villain is played by Alfonso Arau, who played a great supporting role in Romancing the Stone and was also very good in this one. In fact, he is probably the best character in the entire film. I doubt I'll watch this movie again, but will keep it as another example of film roles played by these stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, But Nothing Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Three Amigos" is a funny film that will tickle your funny bone to an extent, but overall it is an average film at best. Movie stars Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short unwittingly come to the aid of some very poor Mexicans in the early 1910s. The premise actually works better than you would think, but it is not enough to save the overall film into going down an obscure path. The three leads are effective and supporters Alfonso Arau, Patrice Martinez, Jon Lovitz, Joe Mantegna, and Phil Hartman all do well with rather small roles. However, the screenplay wears thin during the film's last act and the direction is never quite clear through the entire running time. Average. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Three Amigos is little more than a slapstick comic farce featuring, Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short who portray silent film cowboys. After losing their jobs by insulting their producer, they set out to Mexico and are initially believed that they are putting on a show for the locals. The only problem is, they are now involved with the real thing. The movie shows them trying to assimilate to the culture and people of Mexico, looking for adventure in the country, and eventually discovering that they can ride together to "save the bad guys" in a series of slapstick, Three Stooges, type of comic gags and stunts.I have never cared for Martin Short. However, the talents of Steve Martin and Chevy Chase are shamefully thrown away in this film. I kept waiting and waiting for something memorable to happen. Meanwhile, the film gets sillier and sillier, rapidly descending into farce. The script is strained, and the comedy is forced, where you might get a "ha-ha" reaction from an audience 8 years old or less. But I would rather see Steve and Chevy in the great films that made them legends, such as Steve Martin's "Navin Johnson" in "The Jerk" or Chevy Chase, as "Clark W. Griswald" in the "Vacation" movies. As for Martin Short, I have no interest in seeing him.The writing in this film appears to imply that if these three actors can do good to great comedy on their own, let's put them together and we'll have a classic film. NOTHING could be farther from the truth! The stunts and gags are straight out of "Gilligan's Island" fare. The only thing good is that the Cinematography of Mexico is better than average in some scenes. However, because so many of the slapstick scenes are not the least bit funny, this movie is very boring. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot of "Three Amigos!" would have served for Bob, Bing and Dottie. There's even a talking tortoise like the camel in "Road to Morocco"-- is this a homage? There's also a welcome absence of anachronism, gross-out or Landis's overblown scene-setting, unlike the opening sequences of "Trading Places" and "Coming to America". But the script is perfunctory (why would the studio boss fire all three stars on the spot because Martin asks for more money?) and the misunderstanding about the telegram which underwrites the plot is lame. Inconsistency crops up in the details too. Lucky's demands for constitutional and land reform in Mexico are silly: an airhead actor would know nothing of such matters, and in a straightforward, unsatirical comedy these lurches into "Saturday Night Live", anything-for-a-laugh territory break the mood. Flat spots are frequent and laughs are sometimes thrown away by over-fierce trimming of scenes' ends.Typical of Landis's limitations is the Singing Bush: a funny, Monty-Pythonesque conceit (Martin much admired the Python gang) of which nothing is made once the viewer gets the idea. Comparing Bob Hope with the great silents, James Agee said that modern comics couldn't milk or cap gags, but one feels that the Hope and Frank Tashlin of "The Paleface" would have done more with the Mexican mise-en-scene. Landis's natural length, one suspects, is the sketch (cf "Kentucky Fried Movie") and that may be why his feature-film career ran into the shallows.Duos work better than trios in buddy movies, since the crosstalk dynamic is harder to sustain with three. (The Marxes did not function as a team; the Stooges never aspired to full-length stories.) The Amigos do not interact fruitfully, so we have to fall back on their individual characteristics. Short's dopey effeminacy is often irritating; Chase is colourless; Martin mugs a fair bit. When they realize the bad guys are for real, they cry like Stan Laurel. None has Hope's blustering cowardliness or Crosby's laid-back geniality. Strange that a few years previously Martin, Chase and producer-writer Lorne Michaels had stood for satirical weirdness on TV. Fame and riches smoothed their edges.Kai Wulff is great as the German aviator shooting up the bar, but disappears for ages and does little when he resurfaces except get killed. 'El Guapo' is like Alfonso Bedoya in "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" or one of Clint's adversaries in a spaghetti western. Again, one senses a willingness to lean on cliché when the film should have been critiquing it. That's the key difference between Landis and the Zucker/Abrahams team, who were concurrently creating the finest American cinema comedy of the era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far too farcical to be funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Landis teams again with his star from "Spies Like Us", Chevy Chase, and this time also brings along another of Saturday Night Live's favourites, Steve Martin. Together with Martin Short they form the "The Three Amigos", a comedy co-written by Steve Martin which turns out to be one continuous long running gag, sadly though, its a weak one."Lucky Day", "Dusty Bottoms" and "Ned Nederlander" are popular film stars known as the "Three Amigos", three hopeful men who, after insulting their producer, find themselves looking for work. They take a job offer in Mexico, but when they arrive to "put on a show", they discover they're not working with actors.Written with no seriousness in mind, John Landis' film was meant to be just a bit of silly fun. Unfortunately everything comes off that way and the movie ends up far too stupid, with the comedy and acting performances being very corny.Steve Martin and Chevy Chase are comically boring and Martin Short has long since outdone this disappointing turn. Far too farcical to be funny.Saturday, February 12, 1994 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fish out of water premise rarely works, and here, it doesn't bring justice. Three Amigos is a dry, mediocre comedy that has one central joke, its more than capable leads in goofy, flamboyant outfits. The film somehow thinks the key to its success is dressing up the three main characters and hoping people will find the antics funny just because the characters look funny.I'm here to say it isn't, but of course I don't speak for everyone. The film is cheery, wholesome, but all too dry. There isn't enough desperation with the characters because much of the film they're spent with cocky, boastful attitudes and not realizing the trouble they've gotten themselves into. The story concerns "The Three Amigos," a silent movie comedy team featuring Lucky Day (Martin), Dusty Bottoms (Chase), and Ned Nederlander (Short). The three are famous for their plethora of films together and their utterly fashionable costumes. When they request a raise to continue doing films, they are sent packing and helpless.Before we're introduced to them we see Carmen (Martinez), the daughter of a village leader in Santo Poco, Mexico. When seeing a film with "The Three Amigos" she sends them a telegram believing they are real crime-fighters. So, immediately, The Amigos get a telegram and are off to save the town of Santo Poco. Or so they think. They believe it's a new job opportunity. In reality they have to try and run the legendary El Guapo (Arau) out of town.The premise sounds acceptable and fun, but the real tragedy is Three Amigos never fully knows what it wants to do. Is this satire, homage, or a shameless parody of the western genre? At times it seems to want to put a satirical spin on the western genre. For example, dressing in those utterly goofy costumes and trash-talking the opponents before opening fire. At other times it seems like it wants to pay a tongue in cheek homage to the cheesy style of some westerns. For example, the fake, Technicolor backgrounds like a cheap play. And if the writing had been polished a bit more involving more jokes instead of dead air, it could come off as a David Zucker, Leslie Nielsen type spoof.The talent here is taken for granted. Steve Martin gets a lot of screen time, it seems Chevy Chase is left with the recycled odds and ends from other successful screenplays as he fumbles in search of his own time, and Martin Short isn't given much to perform with either.Three Amigos has heart, but not comedy. It's one of those comedies that thinks it's being funny, when really, its one note joke has gotten old after a few minutes and we've been expecting some more cutting edge ones for a while. Randy Newman's musical numbers provide fun and smiles, Landis's directing is above average, yet you'd find superior in his other works like The Blues Brothers and National Lampoon's Animal House, but the dry setup, the under-used talents, and the flimsy script make Three Amigos a missed opportunity.Starring: Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, Martin Short, Patricia Martinez, and Alfonso Arau. Directed by: John Landis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of work serial movie stars Lucky, Dusty and Ned head south of the border to find employment performing with El Guapo who it turns out is a bandit terrorizing villagers. Rather than turn tail they decide to help the locals defeat the raiders in true Magnificent Seven style. Dressed as three Duncan Renaldo (Cisco Kid, remember?) impersonators SNL cutups Steve Martin, Martin Short and Chevy Chase are anything but funny in this execrable comedy of forced hot air. Under the over the top self indulgent direction of John Lands the bits by the boys land with a thud as they do the same zany mugging that made them TV stars. Short and Martin do their funny face contortions while Chase offers little more than a series of smug and clueless expressions. They the lack the chemistry of a team such as The Three Stooges as they wander off to do their tepid sometimes grating thing that Landis usually allows to run too long in hopes of squeezing some laughter out of the slapstick. In such moments it becomes painfully aware they even lack the sophistication of the Stooges.On paper the moguls must have loved the idea of teaming Animal House director Landis with the three comedians at the height of their popularity, especially with Martin penning the script. Instead it exposes their incompetence in the process as well as the dearth of their talent. Comedy films are not five minute SNL skits and in The Three Amigos the boys wear out fast while Landis' ham fisted style seals the deal. Where's Moe when you need him?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Check out John Landis' filmography. Apparently, in 1985, just after wrapping Into the Night, someone crept into his bedroom while he was asleep and replaced his brains with extra-firm tofu. How else can you explain a director going from Into the Night to Three Amigos in ONE YEAR, and not being able to rise above that level FOR THE NEXT DECADE AND A HALF?Three Amigos is THUNDEROUSLY unfunny. I'm one of the few people left alive who've seen both Under the Rainbow AND Won Ton Ton, the Dog That Saved Hollywood, the previous record-holders for the least laughs in a major comedy - I thought nothing could ever join that illustrious company, but then in 1986 Three Amigos came along.I saw it on HBO right after it came out, smoked on Heineken, with three friends who, like me, were HUGE fans of Martin Short, Steve Martin, and the other guy. We sat there, primed, waiting for something funny to happen. Eventually our exposed teeth got cold and we switched off. Tonight, fifteen years later, at the insistence of a friend who said I should give it a second chance, I sat here stone cold sober, waiting for something funny to happen. Nothing.
