		<fullReview>Michael Shannon as Elvis and Kevin Spacey (the king of impressions as Nixon? You sold me. Elvis &amp; Nixon tells the untold 'true' story behind one of the most famous photos of all time between Elvis and Nixon at the Oval office. Shannon and Spacey deliver captivating performances as two icons in what is otherwise a very forgettable film.At only an hour and twenty five minutes, Elvis &amp; Nixon is a rather short film that is based on a true story, but it doesn't feel like it. It takes a while for the film to get going as it decidedly focuses primarily on Elvis for the first 45 minutes or so leading up to the meeting. You get glimpses of Spacey's Nixon here and there but we don't get the two on screen together until nearly an hour in. I would have much rather watched a full hour and a half of these two guys talking to each other. The story of Elvis' friend Jerry Schilling or anybody inside the White House, I didn't care about.I understand you need to at least follow the true story to a point, but no one truly know the events that went down that day, so you might as well structure it to the strengths of your film. No matter, the time spent on screen with the two leads is a joy to watch. They are far from an SNL impression as they both create their own distinct interpretations of Elvis and Nixon. Even if it's an extremely slow burn, the last 30 minutes are definitely worth watching. If only a better movie surrounded the two great performances.+Two lead performances+Entertaining final 30 minutes-Extremely slow burn-Focus on side characters6.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elvis gets a badge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. The tagline nails the tone of the film: "On August 21, 1970 two of America's greatest recording artists met for the first time." Director Liza Johnson proceeds to tell the story of worlds colliding ? an Oval Office meeting with President Richard Nixon and Elvis Presley. Of course, this is a fictionalized and satirical accounting, since Nixon didn't kickoff his recording passion until the following year.It would be pretty easy to bash the film as heavy on cheese and light on historical accuracy, but that would be missing the point. These two public figures couldn't have been much different from each other, but the script (Joey and Hanala Sagal, and Cary Elwes) finds a way to have these two icons hold a conversation ? bonding over their mutual hatred of The Beatles.The terrific opening credit sequence perfectly captures the time period and is a work of art unto itself. We first see Elvis shooting out the picture tubes in the TV room at Graceland. He's disgusted with the news reports of Woodstock and drug use among America's youth. Constructing a loose plot to meet with President Nixon and offer his service as a Federal Agent-at-large, Elvis is mostly interested in adding a federal badge to his collection.Michael Shannon plays Elvis and Kevin Spacey takes on the Nixon role. Rather than a finely tuned impersonation, Shannon goes after more of an impression or re-imagining of The King. It's a perfect fit for this setting, and there is nothing like watching Shannon give an impromptu karate demonstration for the leader of the free world in the most famous room in America. Spacey, on the other hand, is spot on in capturing the posture, mannerisms, sound and essence of a man who carried much personal baggage with his political power.The chain of events leading up to the meeting plays a bit like a farcical comedy. Nixon's staff of Bud Krough (Colin Hanks), Dwight Chapin (Evan Peters) and HR Haldeman (Tate Donovan) is equal parts incredulous and opportunistic. We get two members of Elvis' "Memphis Maphia" with Alex Pettyfer playing Jerry Schilling and Johnny Knoxville adding even more humor as Sonny West. There is a nice blend of "little" comedy moments and outright laughers ? Elvis impersonators confronting him in an airport, the Secret Service reaction to Elvis' gift to Nixon of collectible WWII pistols, and Elvis meeting with a DEA official played by Tracy Letts.I found myself smiling throughout, with full understanding that this satirical look at a meeting between two famous men with little common ground has no real historical importance ? other than resulting in the all-time most requested photograph from the National Archives. But for 86 minutes of smiling, I say to the filmmakers and actors ? Thank you. Thank you very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big long bore with a brilliant Spacey as Tricky Dick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billed as "The untold true story behind the meeting between the King of Rock 'n Roll and President Nixon", directed by Liza Johnson, this is a wild comedic fantasy built around a brief encounter between Elvis Pressley and President Richard Nixon at the White House in 1974. The introductory credit sequence in dazzling colors and cartoon flavors serves notice that we are in for a wild ride with no holds barred. Unfortunately what the picture offers is a Frankenstein like edition of Elvis (Michael Shannon) in a long tedious buildup to the final confrontation in the Oval Office with an uncannily accurate Nixon, played with zest and four letter zeal by Kevin Spacey in a remarkable comedic turn. The final sequence in the president's office is hilarious enough to make the boring buildup worth sitting through but one wishes the first two thirds of the picture would have been highly compressed -- to maybe twenty minutes. As is, what we get is a view of a super patriotic Pressley which presents him as a very right wing anti-counter culture icon (altho in real life he was a symbol of the counter culture) who despises the Beatles and wants to save the youth of America from drugs, wanton sex and subversive politics by becoming an undercover agent for the government and infiltrating "anti-American organizations". To this end he needs a badge naming him as an official Undercover Government agent, which only the president can issue. His obsession with obtaining such a badge is the central conceit of the film and is a poor excuse for a premise around which to build an entire movie. However, as said before, the tedious introduction (which takes up most of the film) during which Elvis is desperately trying to set up a meeting with the president, and during which we see that Nixon is not interested in meeting a Rock musician and keeps turning such a proposal down, is just barely worth sitting through to get to the riotously funny conclusion in the Oval office when his assistants finally convince the president to agree to a five minute meeting with Elvis -- but just five minutes, no more -- because it will enhance his fading public image -- and on condition that Elvis takes a picture with Nixon autographed for his daughter who is a big Elvis fan. When Nixon finally meets Elvis he finds to his surprise that they have much in common and the five minutes is extended indefinitely, during which time Elvis massages the president's ego and takes off his shirt to perform a karate exhibition as many other bizarre revelations take place. Actor Michael Shannon captured much of the mannerisms and speech patterns of Pressley in a very subtle manner but his look is simply too old and too hard -- Frankenstein in long hair and black bell bottoms! Most of the dialogue of the film as written is just dull and pedestrian until we get into the Oval Office when it suddenly sparkles. Spacey's Nixon is a total riot and more convincing than the Tricky Dick rendition by Anthony Hopkins in the Oliver Stone presidential biopic. Overall I would have to say that this picture is one long bore with a final scene that is comedic genius, especially on the part of Kevin Spacey. Viewed at the Westwood Landmark in L.A. On April 23, 2016 at a special advance screening in the presence of Producer Jerry Schilling who was a lifelong friend of Elvis who avowed that much of the Elvis antics portrayed in the film were "in character" even if they didn't actually happen. Asked if Elvis would approve of this film he expressed honest reservations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been waiting to see this movie for a year or longer. Eric Bana was originally supposed to play Elvis, and he would have been a much better fit than Michael Shannon. Michael doesn't look anything like Elvis, and he didn't show any charisma in his performance. Elvis is one of the best looking and most charismatic men to ever live, so it was painful to see this casting train wreck. There are several scenes in the original Elvis Meets Nixon that were left out of this remake: the beginning airport scene where the airline clerk asked Elvis for payment of his ticket and he says "can you send the bill to the Colonel as he has no cash or check book, the scene where he was taken off the plane for carrying a pistol, and the taxicab scene when a Michael Jackson song was playing on the radio. Those were just 3 missed opportunities to spice the movie up. The only redeeming thing about this movie was the convincing performance that Kevin Spacey gave. He looked and played that part to the hilt. I really wanted to love this movie, and I am so disappointed that I could not do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky, Cute Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really hadn't heard much about this film, and certainly wasn't going in expecting an Elvis impersonator or someone looking exactly like President Nixon. Wasn't disappointed there in regard to Elvis. Michael Shannon didn't look much like Elvis, but he did have the soft voice, the southern charm thing going for him. He did a fine job with this role. And actually, Kevin Spacey did manage to look a great deal like Nixon. Sounded like him, too. Everyone in this movie did a good job, and worked the roles of those involved in this slightly absurd moment in history to justice. So, I guess what I was, was really pleasantly surprised by this picture. Totally enjoyed myself with lots of laughs and a few poignant moments. I dimly remember this episode with Elvis showing up at the White House wanting to become an FBI Agent Abroad. With a badge. And at the time I recall thinking that only Elvis could be that na?ve and yet that brash at the same time. In all honesty, this picture managed to show all of that, and more. What a colorful moment in American history all wrapped up in this fine little film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected more. The actor portraying Elvis is better suited to the Addams family. No looks or charisma. Kevin Spacey did a good job. The movie had so much potential, but nothing really worked the way it was presented. Elvis could have been portrayed by a cardboard cut out and carried from scene to scene. The donut shop scene was insulting and racist. I remember this event well and found it ironic that a big pill user would want to be a drug enforcement agent. The put down of the counterculture was ironic since Elvis was himself considered a threat to decency in the beginning of his career. All in all a poorly made film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be hard to write any spoilers for this film, it was spoiled in the making. There is no plot to give away.If you have been suffering from insomnia, this is a film to help you cure it. Kevin Spacey as Nixon is really fun to watch, but we only see a little of that. It makes one wish that someone would make a movie about Nixon during the Watergate period - sort of like "All the President's Men" but showing some of it from Nixon's point of view, with Spacey playing Nixon. That would be fantastic. But he is wasted in this film.It is hard to believe that Elvis was really so boring in real life as he appears in this film. Not a minute of anything even remotely interesting in this characterization of him. No singing, no performing, just monotone lunacy and phenomenal self-absorption.Colin Hanks is entertaining in his role, reminds one more and more of his father. Maybe he could get some better roles in a better movie to show some of his talent.I give the film 3 points: 2 for Spacey's excellent portrayal of Nixon and 1 for Colin Hanks. But the rest of the movie is so bad that it is not worth watching just to catch the few minutes of Spacey's Nixon, as the rest is so bad that it ruins anything worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elvis &amp; Nixon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elvis &amp; Nixon very much relies on the performances of Kevin Spacey and Michael Shannon, and thrives on what they bring to the eventual meeting between both men. The movie is based on a true story that's better documented than is suggested here. Making Elvis &amp; Nixon fanciful and fabricated in spite of how unusual this event actually was. Which is fine, because most biopics and fact-based dramas exist on creative licence. Although this is a movie that could have been equally successful had more of the facts been more closely adhered to in the script. What matters, however, is how interesting and appealing Spacey and Shannon make the film's central characters. But we find a way into their respective worlds by way of Colin Hanks' Bud Krogh and Alex Pettyfer's Jerry Schilling. Schilling in particular, whose fingerprints are evident throughout the movie ("me and a guy named Elvis" is a line of dialogue at one point") and who acts almost like an audience surrogate.Schilling, who we first encounter working at Paramount Studios, is encouraged back "in" with Elvis as we are taken on a journey to the White House that's foreshadowed in our first glimpse of the man, himself. Watching Dr. Strangelove on one of his three televisions in a nicely recreated Graceland television room. But this isn't just a reference to one of Elvis's favourite movies, the scene from Kubrick's film that's used here foreshadows the nature and tone of his meeting with Nixon. No fighting in the War Room? How about karate in the Oval Office?! Along the way, Shannon, who doesn't resemble Elvis but embodies the role with gestures small and grand, speech patterns, glances and a physicality that's undoubtedly been studied, becomes believable as Elvis. This isn't a caricature. The caricature is what Elvis actually became. Which is appreciated in the way he expresses concerns about his identity to Schilling, and in a touching monologue about his stillborn brother, Jessie Garon. Shannon finds genuine nuance and pathos in Elvis. Although Liza Johnson's direction doesn't quite allow the excitement and elation of meeting Nixon to be juxtaposed with crushing lows or an indication of how such ultimately manifested itself in Elvis over subsequent years. We see him disappointed when things aren't going his way and when meeting Nixon seems lost at one point, but standing slumped and resigned isn't enough to encourage deeper sympathy for Elvis. Whilst the ultimate irony was missed in failing to depict his own problems with drugs. As Nixon, Spacey also finds nuance and manages to make the former President larger than life from behind a desk and despite his reservations about meeting Elvis, and just about everything else. He has less to work with than Shannon, but Spacey gets Nixon just right and manages to refrain from caricature whilst exploring amusing traits and mannerisms. Both physical and psychological. Beyond the two central characters, the screenplay and some variable stock footage encourages political and cultural touch-points that aren't dwelled upon. Although it's clear that Nixon isn't adverse to finding good PR opportunities or impressing his daughters. A trend that crops up throughout the movie, with Elvis using such as a free pass at his convenience. For him, good PR opportunities are also valuable. In many ways, however, Elvis and Nixon suffer the same issues with loneliness, isolation and concerns about their image. Which is something Elvis is portrayed as being more in touch with than Nixon, who laments about not looking like a Kennedy and tries to boost his ego by asking Krogh if he could take Elvis in a fight. Elvis, on the other hand, is aware of his image and the performance that's required just to be Elvis Presley. Which is something that was also expressed by Michelle Williams' Marilyn Monroe in Simon Curtis' 2011 film, My Week With Marilyn. By the time Elvis and Nixon eventually meet, both characters have been fully established, and whilst the vignettes along the way are both funny and geared towards comedy, some miss the mark completely. Such as a clandestine meeting between Elvis and Nixon's aides, that hints towards All the Presidents Men but plays more like a parents' meeting. Although Elvis's visit to a doughnut shop that's populated by a streetwise and vocal black clientele shows him comfortable with all walks of life and able to keep his ego in check. This is in stark contrast to his meeting with Nixon, where Elvis is far from humbled and tries to impress upon the President with bizarre notions and one-upmanship. In one shot, Elvis seems to dwarf Nixon in the way both men are framed. But Spacey plays the President with quick wit and more than a little bemusement at what's in front of him. He sees what see in Elvis. But can't see that he's playing him for his own gain. Unfortunately, the pacing and editing falters during the final act, with Schilling's personal dilemma of getting home to his girlfriend breaking the meeting up at one point. Whilst Evan Peters and Johnny Knoxville's Dwight Chapin and Sonny West, respectively, linger in thankless roles. What's also noticeable is a lack of Elvis's music in the film's soundtrack, which is quite good regardless. Although Ed Shearmur's score is transparent and obtrusive at times. But Elvis &amp; Nixon isn't about Elvis and his music. It's about a quest to find something fulfilling in his life. Which is expressed with profound sincerity in the way Michael Shannon plays Elvis. Getting under his skin and contrasting charisma and personality with a pensive nature and moments of uncertainty. It's a warm, affectionate and earnest performance in a movie that's skewed towards comedy, but has an acute understating of not only Elvis and Nixon, but celebrity and politics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spacey &amp; Shannon Lead the Way Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two stalwarts of the screen Kevin Spacey and Michael Shannon lead the way here, in this quirky and unique film. The movie is deliberately paced and can be awkward at times, but it's also filled with lots of wry and droll humor.Set in December 1970, Spacey is a hoot as the ego-maniacal "stuffed shirt" President Richard M. Nixon, while Shannon portrays the megastar Elvis Presley. Presley had become disgruntled with the rampant protests and demonstrations going on in the country, and as he calls it the infiltration of the hippie-drug culture, and even Communism, into American society.Thus, he's come to Washington, D.C., to press for a face-to-face meeting with the reluctant President to offer his services as an undercover Federal Agent-At-Large, and to help in any way he can. To me, this was the heart of the movie as I felt Spacey and Shannon played off of each other extremely well. It would eventually lead to the actual iconic photograph of Nixon and Presley, that has become the most requested photo from the National Archives.Overall, the filmmakers here present their fantasy of what may have led up to that iconic photo, in 1970. Despite some rough and slow patches, I thought eventually Spacey and Shannon, with a fine supporting cast, made the movie work for the most part, and it became quite a unique viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What kind of man would I be if I didn't offer to help?" The most requested photograph in the National Archives is the handshake picture between Elvis and President Nixon at the White House. This is the story of that meeting. Elvis (Shannon) flies to Washington D.C. in order to meet with the President (Spacey) in hopes of becoming a federal undercover agent for the CIA. This is a crazy movie. There are things in here that are so over the top and absurd that you think they have to be made up. Then again when you think the two characters are Elvis and Nixon you think it could all be true. This is not a movie that will become a classic and one that will be seen for years and years to come. It is also not a movie that history classes will view for accuracy. What this is though is tremendously entertaining and watchable. I laughed quite a bit during this and thought the casting choices were perfect. This is a movie you can just watch and not have to think about. Overall, funny and fast paced. Crazy and makes you wonder how much is true. I did like this one. I give it a B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Happens When Kingdoms Collide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One is the king of rock and roll, one is the king of the United States. Whoever would have thought these two very different minds of two very different backgrounds would ever be seen in the same photo together? No transcript exists on these events, just a photograph that now has become the most requested photo from the US National Archives. Now here, in Elvis &amp; Nixon, director Liza Johnson gives her interpretation of these events. &#x200b; It opens with the president receiving notification that the King has planned a visit, then this rather funny scene transitions immediately into a fun opening credits sequence full of 70's pop art against historical photographs of the two figures. From here, you learn some engaging facts that encourage further research, which sadly is supported by little excitement and little drama.This historical documentation surveys an entirely separate side of Elvis from what the millennials may know about him. Did you know that he had a deputy's badge from Memphis? I sure didn't. It also turns out that he went to meet Nixon so that he could become a Federal Agent At Large in order to influence the American youth that tainted the country's image with the Hippie movement. Being America's most famous icon of the time, he decided to take advantage of his image by proposing possible anti-drug initiatives to the White House, including some drug-themed songs with other singers. The politicians all found it absurd to let someone like Elvis Presley meet the president of the United States, but since he's won the heart of all the voters in the south, the meeting gets the approval seal.Revolutionary Road's Michael Shannon plays the King of Rock, and he talks as smooth, calm and collected as you'd think Elvis would be while not in front of a crowd. Unfortunately, he's not quite the right fit for the role, as he doesn't carry the project as well as he could. It's not that he's bad, he just doesn't put enough soul into the part.It's otherwise intriguing to see what details are used to illustrate Mr. Presley. He still has all his little quirks that you expect from the King: he orders a maple bar from a donut shop, he calls the Beatles anti-American, and he says "thank you, thank you very much" right before sending people off with "sayonara." He watches three different television screens simultaneously and carries an assortment of diamond-studded pistols. There's more: he also had a twin brother who was born thirty-five minutes before him, only to die minutes later, and it makes him question how things would have gone if he was born first. It's stimulating and almost inspiring to see this unknown side to Elvis that actually cared about the American image and took the initiative for his beliefs.However, this fascinating approach is supported by a rather clumsy first half. Elvis &amp; Nixon was intended to generate laughter, but the laughs are far and few in-between, with dull scenes that either go nowhere or are composed of odd pauses between sentences. There are great additions such as fangirls working at the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs obsessing over Elvis's visit; the issue is that it's just too underplayed for what it had potential for. &#x200b; In fact, Elvis's interaction with Nixon should have started right from the get-go without an hour-long setup, because that is where the real funny begins. These moments express some beautifully uncomfortable humor between a celebrity and the president, made all the better by the naturally flowing chemistry between Michael Shannon and Kevin Spacey. I will admit, Spacey probably wasn't the right fit for the part: his mouth looks just like Nixon's but not his eyes. But that's more a bash on the casting director than the actor himself. Spacey still talks just as raspy as Mr. Nixon, and it's easy to tell that he took the character as seriously as if on House of Cards.This is not the most spectacular piece of work you will ever see, you may not even remember it a week after seeing it, but it still gives a thought-provoking perspective on the influence that our celebrities have on our politics. Think of the artists of today. Consider how Taylor Swift's 1989 album influenced everyone's relationship expectations. Think back on the influence that John Lennon's Imagine shaped the hope everyone felt on the world. And don't get me started on all that Justin Bieber's went through. If you aren't dying to see Elvis &amp; Nixon a second or even a first time, you can still bear in mind how our American icons influence far more than what we listen to in our spare time; the actions they take define what makes America the great nation we see it as.Overall Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Spacey is good as Nixon.Don't get me wrong, he is one of my favorite actors. Michael Shannon though just kills it. I absolutely love everything Michael Shannon is in. I admit I would have loved to have seen Kevin Spacey as Nixon a bit more but this is mostly Shannons movie. There are two scenes, one where he's talking to his best friend and another where he's talking to himself in the mirror, these two scenes blew me away.So deep and moving.In a better movie I believe just these two scenes would have gained Shannon an Oscar nomination. Years from now when they are finding Shannons best scenes I hope they pick up the two in Elvis and Nixon. The supporting cast are fine here. The movie runs at 86 minutes which is really like 81 minutes without the credits at the end. It could have been an hour long movie though. At times it drags especially the scenes of Alex Pettyfer's character but other than that Elvis and Nixon is a delightful little movie with a great performance from Michael Shannon. You will have the giggles throughout and you will be entertained for sure by the ridiculousness of the whole movie. I really enjoyed it. ***1/2 out of stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elvis &amp; Nixon isn't trying to be a gripping drama, but comes off an entertaining comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was in High School, I recall skimming through the Government &amp; Politics textbook where I saw the iconic picture of musical icon Elvis Presley and U.S. president Richard Nixon. It was a part of a section that had to do with how different generations viewed their president. It said something about how this simple image was an attempt to show that Nixon was "hip and with it". At the time, the picture had little interest in me except that these two very different people were together for a handshake. Now I think how oddly enough, both men had a lot in common. Both grew up in poor families. Both had served in the military. Both were conservative. But most importantly, both were well known, but for different reasons. Nixon was the leader of the free world and was in total control, but managed to keep his family life secret. Elvis was so famous that his image was practically the only thing people thought about without knowing the real guy. They see Elvis and think about their first concert or song. What was said during that infamous meting remains a mystery, but Elvis &amp; Nixon tries to put a more humorous spin in what transpired. An aging Elvis Presley (played by Michael Shannon) sees nothing but youth protesting on television and this he feels needs to be changed. He flies to Los Angeles to meet up with his longtime friend Jerry Schilling (played by Alex Pettyfer) and reveals that he wants to be made an "undercover agent at large" to infiltrate concerts, hippie communes, and more to catch drug dealers. Despite such a ridiculous request, the two catch another plane to Washington D.C. and literally drive up to the White House gate asking to meet with the president.This sudden arrival from the King puts the entire White House staff, including the secret service in surprise. With only a letter explaining what he wants, a top official Egil Krogh (played by Colin Hanks) brings it up with President Richard Nixon (played by Kevin Spacy). Nixon immediately says no, despite being informed that a short meeting could do well with getting the youth vote. Through means that I won't spoil, Elvis gets his appointment and the two chat about a variety of things; the youth, the responsibilities of both, and for Elvis, his desired undercover badge.Part of me thinks that if Elvis &amp; Nixon was in the hands of someone like the Coen Brothers or Scorsese, this might have been a hard drama with an in depth study on the two. This however is nothing like that.In fact, Elvis &amp; Nixon is closer to a comedy. And I laughed! I was surprised by how much I chuckled at the various ramblings of Elvis and the simply absurdity of his request to the president. I think most viewers will catch right away that this is meant to be a comedy (I didn't even mention that Johnny Knoxville is also in the story as a member of the Memphis Mafia).Much of the pressure is on Michael Shannon to play Elvis, who really hits a home run here. He looks, sounds, and even made me forget that there was an actor under the Elvis hear and sunglasses. My bigger concern was on Kevin Spacy who thankfully makes for an adequate Nixon (though I prefer Frank Langella's version from Frost/Nixon). The meeting depicted doesn't have a lot to say about the time period and the troubles the current generation us under, but the writing makes up for it by simply letting their personalities take over and to simply let them be who they are. I was surprised by how much I liked this.I'll give this eight famous pictures of Elvis and Nixon out of ten. This is a rare historical movie that really isn't trying to be a griping story, but rather an entertaining comedy. I'm glad a saw this. Take a further glance into that photograph and consider going deeper with Elvis &amp; Nixon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tricky Dick plays host to the King. Elvis and Nixon!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe it when they say 'truth is stranger than fiction". This is the bizarre account of Elvis Presley (Michael Shannon) flying commercial to the nation's capital for a secret meeting with the president. Elvis, with best intentions, goes to The White House, with a hand-written letter asking for a DEA agent-at-large badge. It is December 21, 1970, just four years before Richard Nixon (Kevin Spacey) would be forced to resign from office. The Commander-in-Chief reluctantly decides to meet Elvis after urging from White House staffer Bud Krough (Colin Hanks) and his associate Dwight Chapin (Evan Peters).This movie, similar to the meeting itself, borders entertaining and sheer oddity. It is a tongue in cheek look at an actual meeting that had comic and heartwarming qualities. Both men, of importance, boasting and bragging on the other to get what they wanted. Elvis wanted his badge and Mr. Nixon wanted an autographed picture for his daughter. And for the meeting to end! Spacey is hilarious, playing the role a bit downbeat, but has all the Nixon mannerisms down pat. I feel he steals the show from Shannon, who looks and acts nothing like Elvis, but tries to say something with his dead eyes. It is to be consider a comedy and it is. ELVIS &amp; NIXON is worth watching.Note: the actual photo taken at the meeting has easily become the most requested photo from the National Archives.Something also on the odd side, is that the soundtrack features NO Elvis music. Tunes are provided by Rufus Thomas, Otis Redding, Sam &amp; Dave and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The true story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard the story of Elvis' meeting with Nixon, but not how it came about. How true this story is, is open to conjecture. The wonderful Kevin Spacey is totally acceptable as Nixon. The look, the voice and the stooped deportment, are spot on. Unfortunately, I never for on moment thought that I was looking at Elvis. Michael Shannon's wig was about the only thing that was on the money. Elvis was very handsome, with tremendous charisma, and a good build. Shannon had none of that going for him. Colin Hanks is improving every time I see him. His portrayal of a Nixon aide was nicely drawn. Johnny Knoxville was rather wasted, as part of the Elvis 'mafia'. It's not a bad bad film and is not padded out too much, though it would probably have made a better television show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Shannon does not look like Elvis. Well, duh? He did a great job portraying the King and gave us a fine enough visual and imitation of Elvis mannerisms to bring Elvis to life and Spacey was incredible as Nixon. The story line was solid and stayed true to history. I liked this movie for the little funny quirky parts and for how this movie told a generation that Elvis had such magnitude back in the day that to get an FBI badge...all he just had to ask for one.The only thing that was perhaps not factual was the picture Elvis showed Nixon of his Memphis Mafia posing with all their guns and badges.I do believe that was taken in Christmas 1970.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superby fun performances and good, easy screenplay makes this a very watchable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.If you are looking for a accurate and true to it's core biopic of Elvis and Nixon, this movie isn't the one. But if you are seeking for some very light 1 h 26 min escapism involving two of the most known faces of USA during the time of period, funny (but not a straightforward comedy) and involving flick, "Elvis &amp; Nixon" is not to be missed one.Two superbly funny lead performances and uniformly good script are the best thing in this movie. I was kinda involved into the story from the get-go, and it didn't disappointed my till the end. One of the subplots involving Alex Pettyfer's love and rush to get back home wasn't necessary, but everything else works here well. Overall, Michael Shannon and Kevin Spacey kills it as Elvis and Nixon. Script is light and involving, and there is some truly funny scene with Elvis and Tracy Letts's characters involved, just look at the timing of Tracy's and Michael's acting - it is superb stuff. I really liked the picture, because i never took it seriously, although this stuff mostly (probably) did have occurred. Good flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't help falling in love with this movie. I'm all shook up. Elvis &amp; Nixon was a really fun movie. Thank you! Thank you, very much!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazon Studios was created in late 2010s, hoping to compete with Netflix, by joining the bandwagon on producing movies. Although, this low movie is only the second full-feature film produced by them, I have to say, they honestly did a great job on bringing this little novelty movie to the big screen! Even if, the plot &amp; low budget reads &amp; look more like a television movie, than an epic film to watch in theaters. Directed by Liza Johnson, 'Elvis &amp; Nixon' tells the untold true story behind the Dec. 21, 1970 meeting between the King of Rock 'n Roll Elvis Presley (Michael Shannon) &amp; President Richard Nixon (Kevin Spacey). Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, for the most part, this movie was very charming and somewhat humorous oddball movie. While, the plot of the film is often exaggerated in parts for comedic effect; most of the film is actually based on real events and is quite accurate in its telling. However, some parts were not as accuracy, as they seem, such as the case of Elvis's shooting out his television. In truth, the King was fairly restrained in killing TVs and didn't make a particular habit of it. The reason, why this event became, so notorious, was because Elvis shot the TV at a public hotel in Las Vegas in 197, rather than private home of Graceland. Because shots were fired, police had to be escort to the building for safety reason. Another thing, he didn't shot the television, due to the Black Panthers, hippies and Students for a Democratic Society being in the news, but because he saw actor, Robert Goulet, a man, he trust, threaten to steal his wife, on TV. Another thing, the real reason why Elvis wanted to get a badge wasn't because of the couter-culture movement, it was because Elvis had a couple of very serious death threats at the time, and he wanted a federal badge so that he could carry concealed weapons abroad. The whole fight against hippie culture was just his cover-story. Despite those nitpicks, for the most part, I kinda like how they work out the plot of the film. However, the acting in this film, is not the best. While, Michael Shannon is a fine actor, on his own, I really don't see him, transforming well, as the charisma, Elvis Presley. Don't get me wrong, it's nice to see Shannon try to do comedy, after years of being typecast of playing villains or beaten down human beings, but I really don't think, Shannon has the comedy chops to pull this, off. First off, he has a stonewall face, who doesn't do well at convincing any other emotional, besides disgust or anger. Second off, it seems like, he was really, holding back; something that Elvis would never ever do; seeing how love the spotlight. I was really, hoping for more for him. I would rather see, Shannon play him, a bit more over the top, than bland &amp; reserved. Another thing, Shannon has a really aged and scar-full face that looks way too unwell &amp; old, for Elvis Presley in the early 1970s. Elvis still had a baby face at the time, even if the King at the time had, a few rashes, due to an allergic reaction, that Presley experienced from a medication for an eye infection, aggravated by chocolate that he ate, during his trip, which this movie does not mention. His face didn't really go to sh*t, until October 9, 1973, after his divorce &amp; his prescription drug abuse was in full effect. In this version, Michael Shannon's Elvis, looks way too beat-up &amp; boring compare to the real-life superstar at the time. Despite that, I doubt the original choice of Eric Bana would had, much success with the role, as well. In my opinion, I could see, Joaquin Phoenix or Colin Farrell, pulling this role, off! Anyways, as much as I have to question, who is the best for the Elvis Presley role. I have to say, Kevin Spacey makes a wonderful co-star, as Richard Nixon. It's probably the best Richard Nixon's impression, so far, on film, I have ever witness. Even better, than Frank Langella's Nixon from 2008's 'Frost/Nixon', who I found to look &amp; more a little more like President Ronald Reagan than Nixon. Another thing, make-up work that they did to Spacey to make him, look a little bit more like the 37th President of the United States was really amazing. He really does look like him, with all the added weight to his chin. If, I had any nitpick, I just wish, the filmmakers allow Spacey to show more of Nixon's paranoia. It would had added a lot to the plot. Surprising, the actors that made up, Nixon's staff of Bud Krough (Colin Hanks), Dwight Chapin (Evan Peters) and HR Haldeman (Tate Donovan) were a lot of fun, despite over playing the fandom for Elvis. They were very entertaining. It's unlike Presley's entourage of Jerry Schilling (Alex Pettyfer) &amp; Sonny West (Johnny Knoxville) who I found boring or out of place. Another thing that bug me, about this film, is the lack of Elvis Presley's songs. It played, everything from the era, like artists, Rufus Thomas, Sam &amp; Dave to Otis Redding, but not the King. I guess, the filmmakers couldn't get the film license to play Presley's songs, in his own little movie. That's pretty sad to hear, as I thought the Presley family would be more open to allowing his songs, to be played here. Overall: This film turns the most requested photograph in the national archives of the United States, into movie worth checking out, as it highlights the lighter side of politics and that of pop culture. I highly recommended this flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So This movie does not go around explaining the historical or cultural significance of the meet between the two of the famous people of their times.Nor does it mull over the personal lives and problems of those two. the movie chooses a path of storytelling that only includes the fun and ridiculousness of the entire incident,and I have to tell it works like a crossover between The American president and Bubba ho tep. Makers of this movie have utilized people's knowledge on this 2 people and spent 86 minutes of it's run-time exploiting the various circumstances and Ridiculous proceedings that led to this meet.It's superficial and covers only a side of a story,but this are the very reasons you will enjoy the movie without being too political. It also gets additional points for it's cool casting ,Shannon,spacey,hanks make their characters look interesting and funnier,while never truly loosing the dramatic responsibility.All in all I would say go for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elvis &amp; Nixon was a pretty entertaining look at what possibly transpired between them that day in 1970</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I knew this movie only had two showings today which I interpreted as being gone by this Friday, I told my movie theatre-working friend I definitely wanted to watch this one this week. So we did, and I-and perhaps he-were fascinated by all the depictions of what might have possibly been discussed between The King of Rock 'n' Roll and the 37th President of the United States that day on December 21, 1970. There's also some partly interesting stuff involving some of Nixon's staff and Elvis' friends who come with him to Washington, D.C. Certainly, there's also some pretty funny stuff involving some of the young adult females and how they react when seeing the popular singer arriving toward them. I mean, Michael Shannon as Presley and Kevin Spacey as Richard Milhous are entertaining to watch when they are together. So on that note, I say give Elvis &amp; Nixon a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Would you like to see a movie with Kevin Spacey, Michael Shannon , Colin Hanks, Alex Petyfer and the apple cheeked Evan Peters acting up a stormf? Watch this. If you're old enough to remember this time period or are a student of same and want to experience an extremely accurate portrayal of the particular insanity of that time period: Nixon just before Watergate broke, Elvis just before Elvis broke, barriers breaking down, doublespeak as always getting thrown around; friendship and love trying to prevail -'while the war continued in S.E. ASia - this movie. Read the astute reviewer who explains Shannon wasn't doing an Elvis imitation -'he was doing Elvis the man and he did it perfectly. Spacey's Nixon was more of an impersonation but a great one and a great performance. Favorite small things : both "sides" being briefed on the correct protocol; Hanks repetition of the F word &amp; the frequent look of Bewilderment on Peters face. Also sad (but not really) : Peters plays Dwight Chapin and Hanks plays Egil Krogh (sp?): two of "all the presidents men." Played by such likable actors and given likable things to do -you like 'em! But if you know your history .....you know. But everyone is OK now, except Nixon and Elvis. Never a fan of either ( intensely so of the former ) but after this movie a bit of me hoped they were in heaven drinking Dr. Pepper. Just a little bit. Oh and Alex Petyfer -very very easy on the eyes and can act too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that should be redone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casting in a movie like this is supremely important because the content is not favorable or intriguing and as a matter of fact bizarre.It only holds value in that its a true story with two famous people involved.Shannon does a terrible job attempting and failing to portray Elvis as he might have been at the time. His moves facially and bodily are not consistent with Elvis moves. His speech mannerisms suffer greatly as well.Shannon is a very good actor but he should have not taken the part.Did he ever see Elvis in any of his portrayals?Elvis at 35 years old he was an extremely handsome and a vibrant person.Shannon looks lots older and could not begin to look like Elvis.Take a look at the 68 comeback special to see what he looked like then check out Shannon and his looks.Sorry ...we are Elvis fans forever and this portrayal was horrible.Spacey as Nixon was also poor.Its not his fault. He captured verylittle of what Nixon looked or sounded like.With Shannon its the same but of the two Spacey was better.We gave them all the benefit of the doubt but the next day we felt themovie is very flawed.Its a shame that we as fans lost the opportunity to enjoy a performance that would have more celebrated Elvis Life instead of demeaning it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange Event Lovingly Retold For Entertainment...And History.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes fact is strange, sometimes it becomes legendary in it's strangeness. Many times it grows with years of retelling partly because no one really got down everything that happened. I'd say that's perfect for the most unusual meeting between two iconic Americans that ever actually happened. Because of this perfect strangeness it deserves to be resurrected for inspection, well mostly entertainment, every so often. In other words I'm primed already and hoping these blue-chip actors and Amazon deliver the goods.Let's start with the great Michael Shannon. While he's not the obvious choice to play Elvis he hits a sweet spot here. His talent for acting trumps the impersonation thing in spades. He plays up the "coolness in a bubble" factor just right. Nixon could be problematic to be sure, enter the consulate skills of Kevin Spacey. Spacey gets core of the neurotic Nixon along with the reality that Nixon just wanted to be accepted by the public to which, at times, he was desperate to achieve. He also gets that thin sliver of humanity of a man who may have major paranoia's, but he loves his Julie! Shannon and Spacey anchor a fantastic cast of which Colin Hanks (presidential aid Krough) and Alex Pettyfer (Elvis childhood friend) stand out. Even Johnny Knoxville adds rather than detracts as Elvis' LA man on the ground.Elvis &amp; Nixon may be closer to what actually happened than any other movie, certainly more so than the also immensely entertaining Elvis Meets Nixon of the late 90's. The artistic license feels right, for the most part, and the comedic relief is checked at the door, yet weaves in and out continuously. Kudos to everyone involved here as we once more revisit, perhaps, the strangest meeting a sitting U.S. President ever had. True, we have the larger than life photo of Elvis with Nixon to remind us of this being a real event, but, here we have a better reminder for all to simply be entertained by as well as rubber stamp that photo. Elvis &amp; Nixon is simply a movie to revel in one time when fact absolutely trumped fiction. See it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting meeting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of Elvis Presley who really rants a federal badge from the Narcotics Bureau. He relentlessly requests a meeting with the president, hoping to convince the president to give him a badge.The film portrays a relentless Elvis, whose motives behind his quest for a badge may sound strange. It then depicts a very interesting meeting, where power play is unconscious, and authority is not is expected to be. If the meeting really goes as depicted, then I am rather surprised and disappointed that a president would bend over backwards many times to an entertainer. Nowadays this certainly can't be allowed to happen due to security protocols. I hope the meeting depicted in the film wasn't what really happened!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two of the Twentieth Century's "Larger than Life" Icons are Reduced to Quirky Humans, although Ultimately, in Real Life, Barely Recognizable Human Identities to a Chance Meeting of the most Unusual.Elvis Presley, after Suffering through over 30 Pieces of mostly God-Awful Anachronistic Movie Fluff with adjoining Sound Tracks just as Sterile and Self-Imposed Exile from Public Appearance. And Nixon, far Removed from Idealistic Political Republican "Cloth Coat" Goals, were both at a "Crossroads" and the Devil was Demanding Contractual Obligations.The Meeting between the Two "Kings' is a Snapshot of Elvis &amp; Nixon just before the Dues came Due. Elvis would become a Brain-Damaged Obesity and Nixon would Deteriorate into Paranoia, Crimes against the State and its People, and both would Sadly be Remembered as Pale Imitations of Their Glory Days.The Movie Benefits from its Underplaying and Dryness of Wit. Michael Shannon is Channeling Elvis' Soul and Inner Working while Maintaining a Polite Self Confidence that was always a Charming Aspect of the "King's" Personality. Kevin Spacey gives Nixon an Aloof Misunderstanding of everything happening around Him and brings about the Best Side of the Nixon that could Politic with the Big Boys.Delightful and Whimsical at times, the Movie has a Blunted Edge that Never quite Sharpens and it makes for an Easy Going Entertainment, like an Elvis Movie or a Nixon at His most Friendly. Overall, Worth a Watch because of the Fascinating and Flawed Overachievers that were the Real Life Elvis &amp; Nixon.Note...Although no Elvis Songs are used in the Film, they are from the original Artists and Presley did Cover most if not all of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Elvis &amp; Nixon" is one of those movies to watch for fun it's about a serious matter in a serious time, yet the film doesn't try to take it to serious. And the lead performances are spot on really making it a watch over the story. Michael Shannon is right dead on as Elvis Presley and Kevin Spacey is in top notch form as Richard Nixon even right down to his accent and tone. And if you don't know this film is based on a true story.Back on one December morning in 1970 the king himself Elvis(Shannon)made an appearance in Washington D.C. at the white house to meet the man in charge of it all president Richard Nixon(Spacey). And it was a time of social decay that involved war, and most of all the drug problem was noticed by Elvis. And guess what he wanted to be awarded a badge to represent his concern as it would be a special agent badge for his collection. Well on Nixon's end this meeting would help raise his political clout and help him with reelection votes in the South which was the king's home region. And it would all end happy with an autograph for Nixon a badge for Elvis and a White House photo of the two that would be stored in the National Archives! Overall good film that's fun interesting and peace making both on the material and memory side for two legends and the lead performances were top notch making "Elvis &amp; Nixon" a memorable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historic Meeting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect when I heard that this movie was being made. Would it be a parody of the historic meeting between to larger than life personalities? Would it be an insightful look at that meeting? Would it make fun of both of these people and turn it into a comedy? Well having now watched it I can honestly say there are bits of each of these possibilities but on the whole it was a nice examination of that meeting.While watching the news alone in his den Elvis (Michael Shannon) is disturbed by all that he sees. Political unrest, student protests, the Black Panther Movement, drugs and rock and roll far removed from what he performs. So what does he see as a solution? He contacts his friend Jerry Schilling (Alex Pettyfer) now working in LA and tells him to meet him and help set up this meeting.Schilling now has a life of his own far removed from the Presley train but gets on board for one final bow before settling down with his girlfriend. He calls into work sick, joins Elvis on a plane flight to Washington, D.C. and gives the letter Elvis has written to Nixon the once over. When they land they check into their hotel and then drive over to deliver the letter in person.The guards at the gate are impressed with Elvis but following protocol tell him that all they can do is pass it along. Elvis ingratiates himself with the guards and they move it along faster than normal. When it arrives at the desk of Dwight Chapin (Evan Peters) he rushes over to Nixon aid Bud Krogh (Colin Hanks) and the two present the opportunity for the meeting on to Nixon (Kevin Spacey). Unimpressed, Nixon turns it down.Determined to help his friend Jerry meets with the White House duo and through them gets word to Nixon's daughter Julie to intercede on their behalf. The pair think this would be a great help to Nixon politically as well as trying to convince Elvis to be a spokesperson on behalf of their anti-drug campaign. What Elvis wants is to be made a special undercover investigator with a badge to work for the White House.The two finally meet and from there things start to play as much for laughs as for an examination of the meeting they had. But then the situation called for that. There are no recordings of that meeting, surprisingly, but what the writers come up with here seem plausible and probable. These two different men in appearance had more in common and share that during the meeting.What makes this movie work so well is the performances by both leads as well as the supporting players. Spacey does a great job as Nixon using his skill at impersonation well but never overplaying it. No flopping jowls or victory signs, he plays Nixon as a man comfortable in his position of power who still backs down a bit as he talks with the icon that was Elvis.But it is Shannon who gives life to the film. His portrayal of Elvis doesn't rely on a lip curl or a swiveling hip as seen in so many Elvis impersonators that flock to Vegas. Instead he dons the clothes, the sideburns and the shades but only hints at Elvis' slight southern twang. He plays Elvis as more than an icon, a man who had long ago given up any hope of true friends and knew that he was now treated more for the celebrity he has become than that boy from Memphis. Best of all he does this less with words (though there are indeed some great sequences) but more with how he portrays Elvis.The photo of the meeting between these two is the most requested picture from the National Archives as is noted at the end of the film. People are still fascinated with the lives of both men. Few would have expected them to have much in common but the movie shows that though they are indeed different their similarities are striking. In focusing on this rather than what could have been a predictable slam of both men you get a more in depth look at both of them. While their quirks are portrayed here they aren't done so with malicious intent. By not taking that tone the movie comes off as an interesting look at a moment in history that fits in no neat little box making it a movie that keeps your interest from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elvis..........with a special appearance from Nixon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two men at the height of their powers, conscious they could not stay on top forever, both ripped with fear of the inevitable, share one private moment in the most famous office in the world. On the morning of December 21st 1970, the King of Rock' n Roll showed up on the White House lawn to request a meeting with the most powerful man in the world, President Richard Nixon.He had a request, to be sworn in as an undercover Federal Agent at large.......When you have Shannon and Spacey as the leads in a film about one of the most notorious and wildly bizarre things ever to happen in the Oval Office, you automatically think that this will be one of the most gratifying films of the year, and would instantly think that awards would come a calling when the season arrives.And while the film is entertaining in its own right, Spacey plays it down as Nixon, almost sounding like he is doing his Al Pacino impression most of the time.But it's Shannon's film all the way. He is absolutely spellbinding as Elvis, and thank heavens he isn't doing the atypical impersonation you'd find on any corner of Vegas, in fact, it's probably the finest depiction of The King I've ever seen.It's played straight, but all the while, Shannon makes him seem just that little bit odd, that at this time of his life Elvis was a little unhinged (I'm not a huge fan of Elvis, so I've never really delved into his past).And while you would think that the meeting between the titular characters would be the highlight of the film, it's Elvis' quest to get the meeting set up that is the films highlight.It's very funny for the most part, but if it wasn't for Shannon's portrayal, it'd be nothing more than an average docu-drama.He really makes the film watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining &amp; Charming...Are Not Nicknames of Elvis &amp; Nixon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title says it all, the film is built upon this extremely bizarre meeting of two such prominent yet diverse (or so it would seem) individuals.I suppose the question has to be raised of whether this is a one scene film &amp; the answer is...pretty much, but it's a worthwhile journey to get to it.Michael Shannon as Elvis Presley &amp; Kevin Spacey as former U.S. President Richard Nixon give truly entertaining performances, Shannon in particular is superb &amp; well...Spacey is an interesting one isn't he because we have seen a Presidential Spacey on our screens for a little while now &amp; one of my apprehensions before seeing the film was that all I was going to be able to think about was his House of Cards persona &amp; expect him to suddenly turn to the camera &amp; go 'yes this really happened'.So the 'yes this really happened' scenes are how the film gets away with some of its big flaws, one flaw involves the films attempt to give a backstory to a character (played by Alex Pettyfer) who is Elvis's main assistant &amp; I was like 'I really don't care'.Let's face it we've paid the ticket price to witness 'that' meeting &amp; when it finally comes around via a number of bizarre Elvis encounters including one with the bureau of narcotics we are not left disappointed, the character interplay between Shannon &amp; Spacey is superb because Shannon gives off that air of spontaneity/unexpectedness that is required &amp; Spacey gives responses in a way only a man surprised by what he was witnessing could do, it has without doubt many very funny moments, but also in there was actually a very touching moment I thought worked well just before Elvis steps in to meet the President where he talks about a piece of personal family history, it's no doubt out of the blue but I did think it worked rather well.That's not to say that the filmed isn't flawed though, in fact we spend so much time trying to fill screen time before the films 'big' event that a good proportion of it feels inconsequential &amp; pure filler.So yes the film does rely on the titular meeting to tent pole the film but the fact that when this event comes around it entertains from the moment Elvis steps into that Oval Office to moment he steps out makes the film most certainly a worthwhile watch.So overall the film is by no means groundbreaking &amp; the surrounding story is extremely throwaway but the film is sporadically fun and rolls along with a great amount of charm mainly thanks to Michael Shannon &amp; Kevin Spacey's performances in taking two iconic public figures &amp; making you forget these actors were playing these men therefore resulting in some truly charismatic acting &amp; a very entertaining watch indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absurd Moment Yields a Lot of Good Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you remember the Nixon presidency at all?the odd, stiff gestures, the way the man hunkered down like a turtle trying to duck back into its shell, his paranoia and cluelessness, and his straight-arrow staff (all criminals in the making)? you will appreciate how much this odd movie nailed the early 1970s! My expectations weren't high, and perhaps that's the key, because it surprises you at every turn, even though the premise is tissue-thin. It's based, after all, on the fact that the photo of Nixon meeting Elvis in the White House on December 21, 1970, is the most-requested photo in the National Archives. When you think of the treasures the Archives possesses, this is absurd on its face. A more incongruous encounter is hard to imagine, as Mark Olsen said in the Los Angeles Times, "one stiff in a businessman's suit and the other relaxed in a velvet cape." What makes the film so strong are the performances. Kevin Spacey is Nixon in both body language and with his bitter, eye-popping rants. Michael Shannon is a less handsome yet ultimately powerfully sympathetic Presley. He visits the President to offer his help. He's set on obtaining a badge as an At-Large Federal Agent so he can help combat the drugs and youth unrest he sees as destroying the country. In this goal he finds an ally in the President, or, as NPR reviewer Dave Edelstein said, "two lost souls connect." Presley's supreme confidence?arriving unannounced at the White House gate?makes an interesting counterpoint to Nixon's lack of it. The supporting cast?Colin (son of Tom) Hanks and Evan Peters as Nixon aides Egil Krogh and Dwight Chapin and Alex Pettyfer as Presley confidant Jerry Schilling?all play it so straight the two leads are free to let the absurdities of the situation have full rein: Krogh (to Bob Haldeman): The King is here. Haldeman: The President doesn't have any appointments with royalty. Krogh: No. THE King. Elvis. No one knows what really went on in that session. Nixon hadn't started taping his encounters yet, though staff were present for parts of it. The script by Joey Sagal, Hanala Sagal, and Cary Elwes is a plausible and imaginative recreation. Their humor can be subtle as well as laugh-out-loud (as I did, lots) and some great sight gags, too, like when Presley and Schilling run into an Elvis impersonator in the Los Angeles Airport. But it never goes for caricature or the cheap shot. "Nobody really wants to see a big takedown of Elvis Presley," director Liza Johnson said in the LA Times article linked above. "And nobody needs to see a big takedown of Richard Nixon because that happened already."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyed this movie, Elvis and Nixon are so good in there roles. Based on a true story made it even better! It was nice looking back in time that you personally were there to witness. Elvis relationship with Nixon was priceless. He felt equal to him and that he could be of help to our Country. My mind just flashed back to the news and magazine covers of this event in 1970. I live in Memphis and Elvis is one if not the biggest attraction in our city. It seems like he gets more and more popular as time goes on. This movie will certainly be another notch in his belt. So go and enjoy a piece of history from a different view point!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schedule an appointment to introduce yourself to "Elvis &amp; Nixon" at your earliest convenience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truth is indeed stranger than fiction, as the comedy-docudrama "Elvis &amp; Nixon" (R, 1:26) so clearly and gleefully demonstrates. The movie focuses on a real-life meeting on December 21, 1970 between U.S. President Richard Nixon and Elvis Presley, the King of Rock 'n Roll (details to follow in my plot summary). A 1997 TV movie about this incident claims on its promotional poster "Truth is Funnier than Fiction". Yup, also true. A preview clip for that earlier film includes singer Wayne Newton saying, "You can't make this up." Well, you kind of have to ? at least when it comes to the details. The words on the screen at the very beginning of 2016's "Elvis &amp; Nixon" point out that it wasn't until two months after he met with Elvis that Nixon infamously began taping White House conversations (which is why the movie poster cleverly describes the plot as the meeting of "two of America's greatest recording artists"). Without a transcript of this meeting between who were then two of the most famous men in the world, writers Joey Sagal, Hanala Sagal and Cary Elwes had to fill in the gaps between the known facts of this event ? and got to have fun with it but kept away from changing the basic facts or overlooking the humanity of its subjects.Elvis Presley (Oscar nominee Michael Shannon) is frustrated. He's annoyed by his wife and father nagging him about his spending habits. He's deeply bothered by the inability (or unwillingness) of the public to see him as more than "a thing". Mostly (and most urgently), he's very upset about the news. He sits alone in the original man cave (the famous Jungle Room at his home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tennessee) simultaneously watching news programs on three different TVs, as was his habit. He sees reports about the Vietnam War, counter-culture protests and civil rights violations and he has an idea that would address his concerns for the nation ? and maybe deal with some of his other frustrations.Elvis leaves his home (sneaks out) ? alone ? for the first time since he was 21, and books an airline flight. He has some? trouble getting on the plane (I won't spoil it), but he makes it to Los Angeles and meets with Jerry Schilling (Alex Pettyfer), an old friend and former member of Elvis' "Memphis Mafia". Elvis says that he needs Jerry to fly with him from L.A. to D.C. on "a secret mission". Jerry is trying to make his own way in the entertainment industry, but he finally agrees to help out his old friend, whom he calls "E". In Washington D.C., the two later link up with another old friend, Sonny West (the world's most famous jackass, Johnny Knoxville). Elvis drives up to the White House gates (before all the modern barriers were in place) and asks to meet with President Nixon about an urgent matter. He gives the gate guards a letter that he wrote on the plane, asking to be made an official "Undercover Agent at Large" so he can help combat the youth drug culture of the 1970s. Elvis makes a couple other stops in the city (shocking fans at every turn) and then returns to the hotel, waiting to hear back from the White House.President Nixon (Oscar winner Kevin Spacey) doesn't care to meet with Elvis. When he sees the appointment on his calendar for that day, his response is vintage Nixon. "Who the f*** set this up?". He doesn't think that the Leader of the Free World should drop everything to meet with a famous singer who just shows up uninvited. Besides, the meeting is scheduled during Nixon's daily nap time. Clearly, the two young, but high-ranking staffers who want this meeting, Egil Krogh (Colin Hanks) and Dwight Chapin (Evan Peters), have some convincing to do. They believe that a public show of support from the world's most popular single entertainer would help Nixon with the youth vote in his upcoming re-election campaign. Nixon isn't swayed, so Krogh and Chapin resort to underhanded means to make the President change his mind.Obviously, Elvis and his companions eventually get inside the White House, but I won't spoil anything by giving away too many the details. I can say that there's a subplot in which Jerry grows increasingly anxious about the time because he needs to fly back to L.A. in order to meet the parents of his girlfriend (Sky Ferreira). As Jerry struggles with his loyalty to his girlfriend versus his loyalty to his old friend, the meeting between Elvis and Nixon takes place (as we already knew from little things like the movie poster? and history). I'll just say that there's a somewhat bizarre and very revealing conversation, a couple other surprises and then, of course, they take that iconic photo ? copies of which are requested from the National Archives more than any other image ? ever. (Like Wayne Newton said?) "Elvis &amp; Nixon" is a fun and insightful movie ? and it's not just the audience having the fun. Elwes and the Sagals must have had a blast coming up with ideas for this script ? maybe even as much fun as director Liza Johnson had helming it, and Shannon and Spacey had playing the leads. Both men are known to Movie Fans as great actors, and Spacey for his talent doing impressions (seriously ? google it), and both give funny, yet subtle performances which offer up insights into what drove each ? and how fame affected them each. See this movie to marvel at the great acting and gain a greater appreciation for who these men were as people, men who had reached the pinnacle of success in their respective fields of endeavor. The enjoyment of making this movie shows through the work of all those involved ? and it'll rub off on most Movie Fans, who will probably also learn a few things. "A-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A failed attempt at celebrity parody with a huge casting flaw in the middle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Elvis &amp; Nixon" posits a hidden story behind the famous photograph of the King of Rock and Tricky Dick: Elvis Presley, blinded by his patriotism, tries desperately to become an "Agent at Large" for the federal government. This endeavor consists of several meetings of Elvis with government agencies, policemen, and fans in Washington, culminating in a long session with the President. Everyone he talks to is befuddled by his unrealistic proposal and wants to brush him off in a most diplomatic way.This way the movie tries to setup a promising surreal premise and stage two larger than life characters for comedic effect. Unfortunately, most of the time it falls flat. Although there is an attempt to present the situations with an absurdity like a Coen Brothers movie, it lacks witty dialogue, timing, and precise editing.Even more egregious is the choice for the main role: Michael Shannon is a brilliant, fascinating actor yet this is one of the worst castings ever. He impersonates Elvis' mannerisms and dialect pretty well but it is completely messed up by the wrinkled face and the creaky voice. It is unclear whether this is supposed to be a joke, but it is just annoying to watch.On the other hand, Kevin Spacey makes a fine Richard Nixon. He overacts a lot, but that is absolutely acceptable in this kind of comedy. Regrettably, his performance is overshadowed by his character President Underwood from the TV series "House of Cards".There is a subplot with one member of Elvis' entourage who is played as the straight man and secret protagonist. He wants to get home to his girlfriend the whole time, and is (unlike everyone else) completely unfazed by his friend's wealth and stardom. He is an otherwise flat character. Presumably this is a ham-fisted moral on what really matters while the rich and powerful play games.Some positives of the movie are good costume and set design, competent supporting actors, and a handful of funny jokes, but not nearly enough. Much better alternatives to watch are "Bubba Ho-Tep" for a really funny comedy, and "Frost/Nixon" for a more serious portrayal of Richard Nixon and his time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elvis or the Beatles?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I realise the gravity of the question 'Elvis or Beatles' debate, never actually knowing the disapproval Elvis had of the British foursome. Liza Johnson those work I'm not familiar with, namely Return (2011) and Hateship Loveship (2013) directs a screenplay written by small part actor Joey Sagal (Not Another Celebrity Movie, The Chase, Return of The Swamp Thing) his ex-wife award-winning writer, comedian and YouTube entrepreneur Hanala Sagal (assuming they were still married at the time of writing this) and also, Actor, Princess Bride's Cary Elwes who originally was going to make this his directorial debut. It's based on the true story of Elvis Presley, The King, the most famous entertainer of all time seeking an audience with the most powerful man of the free world, President Richard Nixon back in 1970. Apparently Elvis requesting to be an undercover agent-at-large in particular for the DEA, in the hope to combat the nations drug addiction issue, especially with the youth of American. Sounds a little silly right? Michael Shannon (Midnight Special, Man of Steel) plays The King incredibly well with comical effect. The mannerisms, movements and accent is brilliant however he doesn't like much like Elvis, but that honestly doesn't matter and the costume design is highly accurate. Spacey, being a great impersonator of many famous Americans, Nixon is certainly being one of them, his abrasive attitude and demeanour, again to comical effect. Alex Pettyfer (I am Number Four, Beastly) plays Elvis' trusted friend and sort-of-manager Jerry Schilling showing us a more personal Elvis and how he dealt with friendship. Johnny Knoxville plays Sonny West, who, I don't think was necessary for the film apart from maybe accuracy, as both being members of Elvis' 'Memphis Mafia' Tom Hanks' son Colin plays an official part of Egil Krogh who helped orchestrated the meeting between the two and actually wrote a book titled The Day Elvis Met Nixon. X-Men's Quicksilver, Evan Peters plays Deputy Assistant Dwight Chapin and the pair of them together provide quite the comedy unexpected for this film. In fact, the film is surprisingly funny and not in the silly funny way. It's superb scripted and cleverly put together, especially the bouncing scenes of each party setting ground rules of the meeting and then the actually eventually meeting. Ed Shearmur does a suitable score but the actually music that accompanies the film is surprisingly from other artists such as Creedence Clearwater Revival, Sam &amp; Dave and Otis Redding, no Elvis tracks here. It's a great film, and not exactly being a fan of Elvis it was actually highly interesting to learn quite a bit about the man behind The King. This is likely to be one of those films to be unfortunately overlooked, finding more success on the streaming services and whilst not necessarily cinema worthy being a drama it's still an amazing watch. Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 9 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 6 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for the performances, especially Shannon's and Spacey's. 86% 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Elvis &amp; Nixon" (2016 release; 86 min.) brings the true story of the (in)famous meeting in the White House between the King and the Crook. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is "December 21, 1970" and a visibly grumpy Nixon is being briefed by his aides on his upcoming meeting, including one with a "Mr. Presley". We then shift back to "36 hours earlier, Graceland", where Elvis is watching the anti-war protests on TV in disgust, eventually shooting his TV. He decides to go to Washington. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is the latest release from Amazon Studios (yes, that Amazon), and is directed by less-known Liza Johnson (who incidentally was born in... 1970). The movie focuses on the goofy ways of both Elvis and Nixon, leading to at times hilarious results. Check out the scene where upon his arrival in DC, Elvis tries to score a meeting with J. Edgar Hoover. "It's a matter of national security!", Elvis insists, without the slightest of irony. Then there is Nixon, who initially is not interested in meeting with Elvis (why? just watch...). The movie is blessed with some outstanding performances, none more so than Kevin Spacey, who has the mannerisms of Nixon down pat. I also very much liked Colin Hanks (oldest son of Tom) in the role of Egil Krogh (the White House staffer who makes the meeting possible). I wasn't bowled over with Michael Shannon's interpretation of Elvis. Something seemed off to me. Indie music fans, keep an eye out for Sky Ferreira's small role as a young woman named Charlotte, done very nicely. Bottom line: this event is a mere footnote (if that much) in our country's history, and the movie feels a little thin, even with a mere running time of under 90 min. Then again, there were enough goofy moments that kept the atmosphere quite light, and enjoyable."Elvis &amp; Nixon" recently opened without any pre-release hype or advertising at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. Now playing into its second week, the Saturday matine screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (not quite 10 people). Most people around me were absolutely enjoying the movie, laughing out loud a LOT, in particular during the actual meeting between Elvis and Nixon. If you are in the mood for a light-hearted look at a historical footnote (if that), or are just a fan of Elvis, I'd suggest you check out "Elvis &amp; Nixon", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Elvis &amp; Nixon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is only one word I can use to describe 2016's Elvis &amp; Nixon: Fascinating. I remember as a kid, seeing a picture of two exceedingly prominent people and wondering how the heck "Tricky Dicky" and "the King" found a way to get together. Now I sort of have an idea. That is, if what took place is of the non-fiction variety.With a grainy yet sunny look, background tunes by Otis Redding plus CCR, and period detail of the highest order, "&amp;" is small-scale but it's so far one of the best films of this year. It is not in any way, a serious drama or even a pastiche. No Elvis &amp; Nixon is played as a straight comedy with Elvis Presley as an eccentric goofball and Richard Milhous Nixon as a guy who's hard on the outside and soft on the inside. The humor in "&amp;" is sort of dry, sort of coaxing, and all the while deadpanned. And by the time the 37th U.S. President and Tennessee's badass Rock n Roller meet (within the flick's final half hour), you're slapped with a slight sense of delirium. You as an audience member, occasionally laugh and are always smiling. I mean, at least I was.Taking place about four years before I was born, Elvis &amp; Nixon harks back to December 21st, 1970. According to the proceedings, Elvis may have been a singing icon but he sure wasn't as important as California's big man in the Oval Office. Presley traveled to Washington, D.C., unannounced and with an entourage of like two people. He had to try his butt off to get to see Nixon. With his funky glasses, his spreadeagle capes, and his silvery collection of firearms in tote, the man who loves peanut butter and banana sandwiches didn't have anything on debriefing methods or the almighty Secret Service. Anyway, the story goes like this: Elvis Aaron Presley (played by Michael Shannon) is bored. The film begins with him lounging at his Memphis estate, watching the news (on four to five screens) and longing to be a celebrity ambassador to the U.S's anti-drug campaign. At four in the morning, he decides to board a plane to Los Angeles. There, he picks up his good friend Jerry Schilling (Alex Pettyfer) and the two fly to our nation's capital. Presley's agenda: Go to the White House, drop off a letter to President Richard Nixon (played by Kevin Spacey), and hopefully get a chance meeting of five minutes. Elvis happily wants Nixon to swear him in as an undercover agent via the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. Said meeting between the most famous people in America is a hoot (spoiler). While noshing on M&amp;M's, drinking Dr. Pepper, and taking a lot more time than expected, Elvis eventually gives Richard a WWII pistol and shows him a few karate moves (ha-ha). The whole sequence is pretty surreal and uncanny.In terms of the performances, well Elvis &amp; Nixon has three that are near-perfect. Michael Shannon may not look or even talk like Tupelo's favorite son. However, he gets a pass for being a great actor anyway. Plus, he delivers his lines in a manner that just makes him flat-out likable. As for Kevin Spacey, well he obviously doesn't resemble the resigning Republican with the crinkly nose. No matter. The camera turns one way, the lighting is just right, and "Verbal" Kint absolutely absolves himself in this role. The voice, the mannerisms, the head tilted down. It's all perfect. Finally, there's Alex Pettyfer. Ever since he starred in Magic Mike, I figured the dude would go on to be a big movie star. I haven't seen him in anything lately but here, he does excellent supporting work as Presley's reserved aide (the real-life Schilling).In conclusion, the iconic photograph of Nixon and Presley is considered one of the most indelible images in the history of American culture. It's mind-boggling that it took forty-six years to finally bring the subject to the silver screen. Director Liza Johnson (2011's Return) and three screenwriters fashion something whimsical, something special, and something kind of offbeat with "&amp;". Nothing in frame seems to be taken too seriously. And watching the interaction between the title characters along with their journey to meet one another, is mildly exhilarating in a time capsule sort of way. You feel like you're being placed in the early 70's while just observing an ordinary, Monday afternoon. Now another motion picture about the lava lamp decade is about to hit theaters in three weeks (Russell Crowe's latest, The Nice Guys). I sure hope it's as good as Elvis &amp; Nixon. "Thank ya, thank ya very much". Rating: 3 and a half stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre But True</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Elvis &amp; Nixon", starring Michael Shannon-Man of Steel, Bad Boys 2; Kevin Spacey-House of Cards_tv, Superman Returns; Alex Pettyfer-Magic Mike, I Am Number Four; Johnny Knoxville-Bad Grandpa, Fun Size and Colin Hanks-Life in Pieces_tv, Fargo_tv, and yes, he is Tom's son.This is based on a true story. Back on December 21, 1970, Elvis Presley, the King of Rock &amp; Roll, showed up at the White House and he wanted to meet with the President of the United States of America, Richard Nixon. It seems that Elvis was disturbed with the way America was headed, especially with all the drugs young people were always taking-remember Woodstock? Michael plays Elvis and Kevin is Nixon. Alex/Jerry and Johnny/Sonny are 2 of Michael/Elvis's posse that help make the meeting happen. Colin is on Kevin/Nixon's staff trying to actually make the meeting happen too, because he thinks it would be good publicity for Kevin and help with public relations-at that time, everybody loved Elvis. Only problem was, Nixon was not a fan of Elvis and refused to meet with him. Michael already had several honorary law enforcement badges from different police forces-he was a big supporter and gave lots of monetary donations-but he wanted Kevin to give him a badge with the DEA so that he would be an 'Agent at large'. He thought he could go undercover-his reasoning was that he had made lots of movies and knew how to disguise himself. The movie is funny and interesting in how the meeting actually came to pass and the picture of Elvis &amp; Nixon shaking hands is the most requested picture from the National Archives. Maybe it's because I am an Elvis fan-I am old enough to have seen him in concert-but I really enjoyed this one. It's rated "R" for language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 26 minutes. I would definitely buy this one on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only good thing that comes out of this movie is the brilliant performance by Kevin Spacey. His impersonation of Nixon was perfect. Michael Shannon, however, was not a good fit to play Elvis Presley. In fact his portrayal of Elvis was one of the worst I have seen on screen. His performance was cold, he did not look the part, and he lacked the charisma of Elvis. With all the Elvis impersonators out there I am surprised they couldn't find someone better suited to play the role. Despite a few laughs throughout, the movie was overall very disappointing. The actors lacked chemistry on screen and the dialogue was, at the exception of the oval office scenes, very dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did Hollywood Turn Their Punchlines into Heroes by Mistake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh how much hope so many folks probably had for the potential of a political comedy/true life satire of epic proportions, but somehow, somewhere along the way, in a movie about a has-been legendary rocker, wanting to battle drug-taking hippies, planning and then having a secret meeting with one of the most hated Presidents ever, especially unforgotten in Hollywood, both Elvis Presley and Richard M. Nixon wind up looking... pretty damn cool, somehow...Perhaps it's for the opposite reason that Eric Stoltz was fired from BACK TO THE FUTURE and replaced by Michael J. Fox...The FUTURE makers needed a comic actor who could hit the right comic "marks." A mark is something not every actor can do in a comedic sense, and Michael Shannon, while speaking to Nixon about how the youths are really underground Communists; how television and drugs have made them hate the American flag; how he could actually disguise himself, like he did in a decade worth of films, to actually infiltrate the backstage touring with The Beatles, Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead and bust them right on the spot; and how he can use Kung Fu on lethal drug dealers...Saying such crazy things and, especially moments where he delves into the loneliness of being a cardboard cutout that people use for their memories instead of the real person he truly is, opening up to the film's buried lead, Alex Pettyfer as Jerry Schilling, who Elvis feels is the only person who knows him...Actually, it's during ANY scene of dialogue with Michael Shannon as Elvis that seems like NO JOKE at all, not even one of those subliminal nods or tongue in cheek jobs, poking fun at what does turn out quite funny in particular reactions by people around The King and his bizarre daydream. And Elvis Presley, despite yearning for an actual Federal Drug Enforcement Badge and going through a lot harder task in meeting with Nixon than what probably actually occurred, taking us through a groovy modern R&amp;B style GET SHORTY scene-to-scene shuffling glide, seems about as real a person as he was before his fame... And that's the ticket...Despite looking less like Elvis Presley than Kurt Russell or (for those with good memories) David Keith combined, Shannon, usually a dominating villainous type, wields that nefarious, intimidating mug that the real Presley... who was still handsome (and even "pretty") even in his later "mutton chop sideburn" years... had earned by his fame alone: in other words, Shannon, who takes some time believing... especially as young girls and random people go crazy at his very presence... winds up nailing the role during private moments so that his public persona means very little... And perhaps what the people see in Shannon's mesmerizing six-foot-plus, square-jawed menace is represented of what Elvis brought to any location he wound up in: Wouldn't a Universal Monster get the same reaction as a Music Legend? And Hell, even times when he's saying absolutely nothing, the wheels are spinning inside a vulnerable man who could have been turned into pure cartoon without a great actor cast. Meanwhile, as Kevin Spacey seems the perfect fit being such a fantastically evil rags-to-riches President on HOUSE OF CARDS, he's terrific here, sure, especially his slow yield to Presley's chess-like movements within the Oval Office, turning what once was Dick's... from soda pop to candy... into his own. But like everyone else, the man simply follows Michael Shannon's lead, and what a lead it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fluffy affair with some serious intent buried underneath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Know this before going into the theater (or, if you're reading this later on, on DVD/VoD/et al) that this is a slight movie. It's only deep insofar as it tackles a subject that has been dealt with before in movies and media and will be dealt with again: the cult of celebrity. By this of course this movie has as its focus that meeting between Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon, and when the photo of the two of them was taken (which the movie dutifully tells us at the end is the most "requested" photo in the National Archives, which reminds me of TRL from the 90's or something). It's only 86 minutes long and only the second half features Nixon prominently (and I can never get enough Nixon, as far as seeing the worst this country had to offer at the time, but that's just me). But I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a fun time.A lot of it comes back to the celebrity and what impressions people give off to others. Elvis had to make himself "Elvis" whenever he went out in public - as he tells his friend-cum-assistant Jerry (Pettyfer in a sort of thankless role), when people see him they think of their first kiss or when they left seeing Blue Hawaii, not really *the* Elvis - and yet that was something that he carefully cultivated and wouldn't have any other way. It was one of the things that made him special to a lot of people and so recognizable, not unlike a comic book character (hell, along with his penchant for guns and badges he knew his karate, like he was prepared in case he ever got into a street fight - though as such a figure he might've had his reasons, but I digress). And likewise Nixon did this too, and put out this friendly-fatherly figure to the public while behind closed doors he was basically a total nutter against supposed Communists and druggies and anyone out to "get" him (this was also pre-tapes, but it didn't mean much of a difference).So the meeting of these two men does make for some compelling viewing - first for the cringe-comedy factor, of seeing all of the guidelines that have to be put in place for Elvis (and that Elvis' guys, one of them also an ideally cast Johnny Knoxville, puts forward to Nixon's guys), and then how Elvis says 'f*** it' in less words and does what he wants to anyway with the M&amp;M's and Dr. Pepper - and then secondly as something else. A lot of what comes down to men in high positions of power and influence comes with what kind of show they can put on to one another. While this is imagined, I suspect this was closer to how their meeting actually was, with the gift from "The King" to Millhouse a commemorative WW2 pistol, and them comparing the size of their, uh, "estates" of Graceland vs the White House. No, really, that's the metaphor man! Both actors are really wonderful at channeling what the public knows how these men acted, whether it was behind closed doors or in "public", while not really looking much at all like the figures. This is actually more Shannon's movie than Spacey's, as Nixon only comes into play when the letter/request first come to the president's attention. Shannon once again shows why he's one of the most strangely compelling presences in American film, an actor who in his way is kind of attractive, but also has that ability to lunge at any moment. He does do that a couple of times here, and when it happens it's like "oh, hey, here's a SCARY Elvis, not sure we've seen that in movies yet," and yet there's also a vulnerability underneath it. The most captivating scene to me is one of the quietest, as Elvis waits in the minutes before the meeting as he tries to figure what he'll say to Nixon, and rehearses the tragic tale of his stillborn twin brother's birth and death (which is true - see The Identical for more on that whopper), and yet there's this feeling like 'is he saying this to be genuine, or is he saying it to appear genuine, to bring some of the "person" Elvis into the gun-totting, hippie-hating, Good-Ol'-boy Elvis? I'd say a little from column A and B, and Shannon makes that gray area wonderful).Now I should emphasize this isn't terribly deep; the motions to try to bring up Elvis' relationship with his friends/co-horts like Jerry are alright but they seem kind of placed in here to emphasize Elvis' true lonely state of affairs (we never see Priscilla or Lisa Marie by the way, which may be part of the point) and it may be because Shannon's such a powerhouse but Pettyfer comes off just slightly (not totally) weak in acting comparison. But if you look past the fact that it's barely a story, more like a situation, regarding two men with delusions of grandeur and who happened to find power by using their images to maximum effect, it's fascinating and very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>huh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One's primary thought after watching this film through to the end is, why on earth did anyone think to make a movie about this incident?The Nixon/Elvis meeting was indeed one of the most bizarre events to happen in the Nixon administration but exactly why it is worth a whole movie is beyond me. Nothing particularly revelatory or interesting happened at the meeting, which seemed to have no great significance in itself.How much of the movie's dialogue is based on fact and how much on speculation we will probably never know, but the point is that the seemingly interminable lead-in to the actual meeting comes off as exactly what it is - filler and padding.The best thing about the movie is Kevin Spacey's wonderful portrayal of Nixon, but even that in itself is not enough to justify sitting through the whole thing. Shannon's portrayal of Elvis, however, falls short, as other viewers have noted. The flick reminds one of Gertrude Stein's comment about Oakland: there's no there there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wanted to like as am a big Elvis fan and know the story of the meeting well. This is nowhere near as good as the TV movie of similar name. No idea why they made it again. Michael Shannon's portrayal of Elvis is too understated and is boring! Much more interesting is the real story which is on you-tube at some white house event with Schilling and Krogh present to recount the story themselves which does not need anything adding to it. I feel I need to watch the TV movie to cleanse myself of this terribly inferior offering. Every scene is inferior to the TV movie. Sorry - really wanted to like it. They don't need to make a third one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Slight It Is Almost Not There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Elvis and Nixon" is a movie so slight if it had one less word of dialogue or one less dollar for set design it might totally disappear. The concept is terrific ? the backstory behind the famous photograph of Elvis Presley shaking hands with President Richard Nixon. Presley had written Nixon a six-page letter asking for the meeting, and offering himself as a "federal-agent-at-large." A lot could be done with this premise. Why did the King want to be an agent? How might one of the stiffest and least charismatic men in history ? Richard Nixon ? be affected by such a close encounter with one of the sexiest, swerviest men in history? What did they say to each other behind closed doors? Why do people who have the world at their feet ? like Elvis, like Nixon ? crave things that they can't have ? FBI agent status? To manipulate elections illegally? What does the meeting say about the dark side of celebrity and power? The movie goes nowhere with any of these premises. The film is not offensive or exploitative or even especially inept at the technical level. It's just not there. The script is miniscule. You need a microscope to see it. Elvis says something mildly amusing, "I'd like to go undercover" and then the next ten lines are vapid comments about White House protocol or the autographing of photographs ? void of any significant content. Kevin Spacey has a twinkle in his eye that no amount of makeup could disguise. He also conveys a self-aware intelligence and amusement at the human carnival that was very different from Nixon's dark mien. Michael Shannon comes nowhere near capturing Elvis' animal magnetism, but then, who could? Given how much money and prestige is risked in the making of any film, one has to wonder why this film was even made.</fullReview>
