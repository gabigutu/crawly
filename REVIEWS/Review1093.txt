		<shortDescription>Truth is stranger than fiction...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One question that must be asked immediately is: Would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis?The answer is: Probably not.But, thankfully, they are (or were) the cousin and aunt of Jackie.This documentary by the Maysles brothers on the existence (one could hardly call it a life) of Edith B. Beale, Jr., and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (Edie), has the same appeal of a train wreck -- you don't want to look but you have to.Big Edith and Little Edie live in a once magnificent mansion in East Hampton, New York, that is slowly decaying around them. The once beautiful gardens are now a jungle.Magnificent oil painting lean against the wall (with cat feces on the floor behind them) and beautiful portraits of them as young women vie for space on the walls next to covers of old magazines.Living alone together for many years has broken down many barriers between the two women but erected others.Clothing is seems to be optional. Edie's favorite costume is a pair of shorts with panty hose pulled up over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped and pinned around her torso and head.As Edith says "Edie is still beautiful at 56." And indeed she is. There are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was there.There is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension.Their eating habits are (to be polite) strange. Ice cream spread on crackers. A dinner party for Edith's birthday of Wonder Bread sandwiches served on fine china with plastic utensils.Time is irrelevant in their world; as Edie says "I don't have any clocks."Their relationships with men are oh-so-strange.Edie feels like Edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness. She says "If you can't get a man to propose to you, you might as well be dead." To which Edith replies "I'll take a dog any day."It is obvious that Edith doesn't see her role in Edie's lack of male companionship. Early in the film she states "France fell but Edie didn't.Sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said. Both women talk at the same time and constantly contradict each other.There is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film; Edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with Wonder Bread and cat food. The cats (and there are many of them) are everywhere.At one point Edie declares "The hallmark of aristocracy is responsibility." But they seem to be unable to take responsibility for themselves.This is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grey Gardens was riveting and almost unbelievable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We stumbled upon the documentary, Grey Gardens, last Sunday and got "sucked in" without warning. Everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the haunting images of Edith and Edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach, eating ice cream and corn on the cob (which was cooked on the bedside table)--and the cat urinating on edith's bed and her unbelievable words, "i thrive on it [the smell]." We had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in. Spellbinding! a must see!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Sad, Very Human, Oft Funny...but with a whiff of exploitation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this - many parts of GREY GARDENS are very funny and unbelievably surreal - documentary of not, this really gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes. I kept focusing on how these women (who are clinically way beyond eccentric) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways, and I wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue-blood universe, perhaps some abuse, or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its' own. This might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation, without going completely over the edge - as the Edies do their thing, I kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble-strewn bedroom, cats urinating on the bed, racoons emerging from holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - like a child's birthday party gone seriously wrong. Very definitely worth seeing and seeking out - you'll never forget it, but very disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most beautiful, endearing eccentrics of all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I viewed Grey Gardens, I was as mesmerized as the other people who have written comments. So many elements of this film are fascinating, there are so many things going on there. The ultimate passive-aggresive relationship of the mother and daughter. So co-dependent. One moment Edie is blaming Edith for her loneliness, the next she is about to swim in the ocean and saying out loud how she hopes her mother does not pass on anytime soon, she would miss her. Yet one has to wonder if Edie really wanted to leave so badly, why didn't she? Maybe Grey Gardens was where she most wanted to be after all.Edie never leaves the home or rarely sees anyone, yet she still has the rich, white woman's concern over her weight. It is hilarious to see her peering at the scale through binoculars. When you see pictures of the women as young beauties, it takes your breath away. Edie is still a beautiful woman, and her coquettish behavior at times makes her seem like a young lady.The language is entirely witty and it is hilarious to see the two women go on and on. Favorite comments -"France fell but Edie didn't. Edie never fell for anyone." "Why didn't you marry Getty?" "I'm a staunch character! S-T-A-U-N-C-H!" "Lost in a sea of green leaves. I'll never see that scarf again." "This is the revolutionary outfit." "You don't say luh-ove! You're not Czechoslovakian!" "All I need is to find this Libra man!"The cats and racoons are a site to see, as is the faded mansion. A wonderful window into the world of two compelling characters, their lives, and their memories. Yes it is at times sad, but at the same time, these two are fabulous!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Grey Gardens'(1975) is the Maysles' brothers bizarre documentary of Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis'eccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down 28 room mansion on East Hampton, Long Island.'Big Edie' Bouvier Beale,78,witty and dry and her daughter, 'Little Edie' Beale,56,(emotionally about 13) a still beautiful woman who once had a promising future,live in isolation from the rest of the world except for their many cats and raccoons in the attic. They amuse themselves by bickering all day, listening to the radio or singing to each other(They dont even own a television) Their fall from society is amazing to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two very special, although obviously, dysfunctional people.One of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film a couple of weeks ago, and it's been stuck in my head ever since. It stars two spellbinding characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary. To get the true story of the Beales, I had to wade through all of the DVD's bonus material and commentaries and search the web.Although the Maysles and their fans (not to mention Edith and Edie themselves) bristle at the suggestion that this film is exploitative, this is exploitation in the truest sense of the word. Very little effort is every made to explain the Beales or how they came to the condition they were in - the Maysles approach seems to be to just turn the camera on and wait for Edith and Edie to say something outrageous. The sound, even on the Criterion re-release is poor and difficult to follow. Although I appreciate this film was made somewhat early in the history of documentary film, it's ironic to compare it to Geraldo Rivera's (!) far superior series on the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at Willowbrook State School in Staten Island from 1972, four years before Grey Gardens was shot.To paraphrase a review in the New Yorker, there were many things Edith and Edie needed in their lives, and a documentary wasn't one of them.As for Edith and Edie, the thing I kept thinking while watching the film was "where the hell is their family"? They were living in dangerous, unhealthy, unsafe conditions. How is it that Jackie O, married to one of the richest men on Earth (or the wealthy Bouvier family themselves) couldn't afford to get Edith and Edie a decent home? Or at the very least hire a part-time housekeeper or caregiver to come in and keep an eye on them both? It's shameful and a lasting disgrace to the entire Bouvier family.Although this review may sound negative I would strongly recommend Grey Gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries. Perhaps someday someone will come along and do a documentary about this documentary - bringing in the rich backstory (and afterstory) of the Beales and the whole subsection of Hamptons society in the 1970's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found Grey Garden's to be a gripping film, an amazingly intimatelook at too eccentrics who basically have the right idea: forgetsociety and live in a delapidated house with no heating and a hugebrood of cats and raccoons, persuing their own interests rathermundainly, all the while chattering at the camera.Big Edie and Little Edie are the two crazies that the Mazles Bros.have chosen to document. They seem like characters out of aFellini film, only stranger, if that makes any sense. Old Edie isalmost fully bedridden, a pile of papers, clothes and dirty dishesgrowing around her. Little Edie is even more interesting. Sheprances around the house, always wearing a baboushka-likeheaddress around her head, completely covering her hair. Wenever see her hair throughout the film, nor do we ever get a hintthat she still has much. At age fifty eight, though, she is stillbeautiful and full of life.In Grey Gardens, we get the sense that both of these women'slives have become much less than what they once were. LittleEdie is probably the sadder of the two. While her mother, in herearlier years, got married, made a family, lived luxuriously andeven made some recordings (the scene where, at 77, she singsalong with a recording of "Tea for Two" she made decades ago isone of the films best scenes), Edie left her promicing career as amodel to take care of her ailing mother. At 58, she still longed tofind her prince charming. If anything Little Edie is still a little girl,full of dreams of glamour and fame, and of domestic and romanticbliss, that have yet to be fulfilled.Highlights of the film include the opening moments, where LittleEdie explains her outfit to the camera, the "tea for two" sequence,the birthday party, the climactic argument, the grocery deliverscene, and the scene in the attic. The whole thing is incrediblycandid and unpretencious. And it's made all the more remarcablesince it's all real.I suggest seeing Grey Gardens back-to-back with the KennethAnger short Puce Moment. The Criterion DVD is $35.00, but it'sworth every penny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing glimpse into the wonderful, bizarre life of a mother and daughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several years ago when I first watched "Grey Gardens" I remember laughing and finding it hilarious camp. Years later I still laugh out loud when I watch it, but after many viewings I've come to see the beauty in the strange, twisted relationship between the inseparable "Big" Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter "Little" Edith Bouvier Beale.Mother and daughter living together in their decaying 28 room East Hampton mansion add a whole new meaning to the term "Shabby Chic". With innumerable cats, raccoons and opossums as roommates this Aunt and Niece of Jackie O. allowed filmmakers Albert and David Maysles into their mansion to film them living life day to day. The result is a hilarious, beautiful, sad and moving account of true love and anarchy rule.The relationship between Big and Little Edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love. And their lives an example of drive, determination and free-will. This movie has more to recommend it than I can put down into words. It is a rare experience that you must see for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad, depressing, but captivating documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary follows the lives of Big and Little Edie Beale, a mother and daughter, who lived as recluses in their family mansion in East Hampton, NY from the mid-50s through the late 70s. By the time the filmmakers find them, the mansion is falling apart, and the women, one 78 and the other 56, share a squalid room. The older Edie Beale is the aunt of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the younger is her first cousin. The women were originally going to be evicted from the house due to its decrepit condition, but Jackie sent them money for repairs so they could keep living there.At times this movie can seem exploitative, as neither woman seems in the best of mental health, but at other times, the movie is hard to look away from. "Little" Edie blames her mother for her current state, and her mother fires back that Edie was never going to be the success she thought she was. "Little" Edie often seems trapped in the past, focused on choices she made decades ago, and loves showing off pictures from her youth, where she clearly was a beautiful debutante. Her mother seems more resigned to her fate, to live out the rest of her life in terrible conditions. There are definite hints of the glamorous life both women once lead, from the pictures that show a happy family, to the grand portrait of the older Edie next to her bed. From what we see of the house, most of the rooms in it are empty, the walls are cracking and falling apart, and "Little" Edie leaves food in the attic for the racoons to feast on. And of course there are numerous cats running around.At its heart, this documentary is incredibly sad. While neither woman seems particularly depressed by their lot in life, the squalor they live in is utterly awful. It's not particularly clear if there is even running water in the house, and you get the impression that they have essentially been abandoned by their family.However, as a documentary, the film is a wonder to behold, and is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is why i so love this website ! I saw this film in the 1980's on British television. Over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life. With barely a few key words to remember it by, i traced the film here, and much information, including the fact it's about to become an off-Broadway musical !Interestingly, unlike the previous comment maker, i do not remember finding this film sad, or exploitative. On the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a testimony of great strength, honour and dignity. Ironic you may think, considering the squalor of their lives. Maybe it's because i live in Britain, where fading grandeur has an established language in the lives of old money, where squalor is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding; I saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit, deep and profound humour, whose utterly fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it poise and respect. In a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a 'cult'. Over the years, as it faded in my mind, it shone the brightest, above all others as a one off brilliant &amp; outstanding televisual experience. It was such a deeply private expose, it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a New York musical. But perhaps somewhere, the daughter will be amused by such an outcome. It is she who will have the last laugh maybe..(They made a musical out of her before you Jackie O' )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night, having no idea of the film's cult, influence, or that it is currently being staged as a musical.(!) Most of the comments here are on target, it's moving, funny, sad, and yes, a tad exploitive despite the best intentions of the filmmakers. The expanded Chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out. I think you can also see in little Edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared, you can hear it in old films of Jackie O too; people just don't talk like that anymore. I think as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute, Old Edie at least still seems aware of what's going on to a certain degree; couldn't She see the once spectacular home disintegrating? Yet the film's subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now, a real life Tennesse Williams one act. Well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human exploitation by filmmakers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A low point in human interaction was reached by the Maysles Brothers with this film. Do remember, you who used words like "masterpiece"when reviewing this film, that these Maysles creeps didn't just happen to drive to the Hamptons and happen to shoot film on some eccentric people. No, when they found these two poor pathetic people they then had to finance their project (and imagine what they told the money people to sell the project). Then they befriended the two extremely vulnerable women. No meeting of minds here or real consensual participation. These wretched Maysles smiled, kissed ass, did whatever they had to to get the Beales to cooperate and then exploited them as viciously as has ever been done. One would like to think that these hustlers had occasional thoughts of remorse and guilt. But the film-making process, given the preplanning, actual shooting and then editing took a lot of time and their goal had no provisions for actually relating to the Beales as human beings. An exploitation film perpetrated by the vilest of people. As time accrued their film-making reputation has been seriously stained by what they did here. Their reputation as human beings is execrable. That is what people will remember them as. Grotesque hustlers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting, disturbing and sad documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first time I heard about this pseudo documentary, I was fascinated and made a mental note to rent it at some point. Then I saw that HBO is making a film based on the documentary starring Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore and picked it up last night.I have to say that I don't post reviews or comments about movies, books or music unless they really move me. This film definitely affected me! In fact I am still disturbed by what I saw and the voices of these women are still burning my ears.This film was not so much a documentary as it was a peek inside the life of two women who at some point must have been taken care of (and very well at that) by a whole host of people. People to help them clean, cook, dress etc. About 30 minutes into the film, it was obvious that Big Edie and Little Edie had once lived a life of luxury. At some point (and we are not given any information at all about their past) we can only assume that they were abandoned by Big Edie's husband and were left to their own devices to survive with very little money and even less skills to live on their own. In my experience, most documentary films move back and forth from present to past and back as a way of educating the viewer so we can understand what we are watching in some sort of context. This film and the women in it, give us no context at all. From the minute it starts, we are thrown into the world of the "Edies" and are given no information at any point about their past which can help explain the present, except through a few words while they look at old photographs. Not knowing the context can be interesting at times, but I found it hard to swallow in this case. I wanted to know what circumstances brought these two women to where they were.I also found it difficult to understand a word that Big Edie said, and her voice was so unnerving and loud that I gave up trying to decipher anything she said. By the end, I felt like she was a bitter old woman, jealous and un-thankful of her daughter who obviously devoted years of her life to taking care of her Mother. Little Edie on the other hand was charming . A 56 year old who looked 40 and acted 17. She was so happy to have the attention of the camera and made the most of it in a funny and pathetically sad way. Smearing on her black eyeliner and drawing in her black eyebrows with a heavy hand, trying to re-claim her youth. She was a drop dead beauty in her day. It seems to me that her life was based on her looks, as though that was all she ever knew how to be... pretty. It's always disturbing to see women that attempt to deny what is natural when growing older by dressing in tight and revealing clothing and too much make-up.This movie was an exercise in the intricate dynamics of a mother-daughter relationship who had been left with no skills to make it on their own set on the backdrop of a decaying filthy house with raccoons living freely among them and the cats pee and poop on the couch all while the Beale women are gloriously unaware of much of anything other than their own star potential thanks to their former beauty and the Bouvier name that Jacqueline Kennedy made so wonderfully famous.I highly recommend this film if you want to be transported into another world. For me, it gave credence to the saying that truth is stranger than fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title. It now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films. It is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the Maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully. It has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world. I fell in love with this film and with the characters in it. It is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be there away from it all, cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table. It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout. A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. The money had gone but their airs and graces remained, as well as their beauty. It drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself wondering about their fate. Wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. Unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploitive voyeurism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Maysles brothers should be ashamed of what they did. They profited by exploiting the misery in which the Beales lived. There's no value in this so called documentary.Edith and Edie Beale were at the lowest point of their lives. The Maysles' kept showing how beautiful and full of potential they both were at one time in their lives, but for what purpose? The Beales had famous well-off relatives (though never really pointed out in the film.) So what? Lots of people on hard times have relatives that are much better off who would never lift a finger to help.Edith and Edie lived in seclusion, removed from the rest of society, because they had little choice. They were just trying to hang on to a bit of the life they once had but would never regain. Why should this be considered to be a masterpiece in film making? It's nothing but a train wreck that everyone has slowed down for just to take a better look. It makes you feel dirty watching this thing through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in my plays &amp; playwrights course at Tulane. I was awed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was. It is a sincere look into the unedited reality of a life of solitude. The family is fascinating and I thought it really showed Little Edie at her core. **As a side note My professor even told me that throughout the filming, Little Edie became infatuated with one of the camera men.** The beauty, I find, comes from the naturalness of the family's dysfunction. It is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither could function in society alone and you begin to wish for Little Edie's rehabilitation to society. In all, the film is gripping in its aesthetic quality and it's portrayal of surprising beauty. Two thumbs way up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The examinations of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it first came out, this work by the Meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation. Luckily, it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema, especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television, and the bad evolution of most direct cinema.Really, at first, we must say that this isn't really direct cinema, it is more cinema verité. The difference between the two is very slight, but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary, we are made to feel the presence of the Meysels brothers, and they do interact with the characters filmed. This as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation. The Meysels have been allowed in the house, and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household. And both Edith and Edie just love the idea of being filmed.It would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of God narration and shallow interviews. Here, we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house, a madness that does seem to go down well with both Edie and her mother Edith. Their house is a mess, litter and animals everywhere, faded colors and furniture all over the house, and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality. These two people have lived with each other their whole life, and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention, but rather because they can't help talking to each other this way. They know each other too well to hide their inner feelings, there is no need. In the end, though, even as they blame each other for their lives, they really love each other deeply. Edie says she doesn't want her mother to die, because she loves her very much, and Edith says that she doesn't want Edie to leave her because she doesn't want to be alone.But the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age, the two women can't help be girls. They cannot help being one the singer, the other the dancer. Exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera. When Edie asks David Meysels rhetorically "Where have you been all my life?" she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills. A beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again, the way only the Meysels and few others could do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew about but had never seen Grey Gardens, before I saw the Broadway musical of the same name. Friends cautioned me that if I had not seen the movie, the musical would not make sense. It did, but it also prompted me to rent the movie. At first, I thought it was a train wreck, full of strange, shrieking characters, and it was exceedingly hard to watch. But being able to stop it, digest it and go back to it made me realize why Grey Gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary. Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self-consciousness is worth witnessing. Both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age. They have a relationship that will chill any woman (and undoubtedly some men) and make you re- examine your own dealings with your mother. In an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace, it's fascinating to see the Mayleses' work from three decades ago, and realize what an impact the film must have had.I echo what other posters have said: how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family? But beyond that, how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion? Or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped? I would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track, which gave me additional insight into the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grey Gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just couldn't really look away. It was so strange, and funny and sad and sick and ???.. really no words can describe. The move Grey Gardens is beyond bizarre. I found out about this film reading my Uncle John's Great Big Bathroom Reader, by the Bathroom Reader's Institute and it was well worth the rental and bump to the top of my movie watching queue. This movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed. One should watch it for their favorite Edie outfits, which I am sure include curtains. When I get old I almost wish to be just like Big Edie, thumbing my nose at normalcy and society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The review title is offensive? Well, you might have the same opinion if you view the film with an analytical mind. I know and have read about all the fans of this film that are fans of the Beale's as well. That is all well and good, but its beside the point.The Mayles Bros are not slouches and have a very good nack for cinematography and documentation (otherwise they would have not been involved in so many major documentaries). This film does itself justice by showing off that gift. What it doesn't do itself justice with is its exploitation of its subjects.I know I won't get a lot of fans for saying such (true) statements, but it has to be said. Perhaps you'll understand my rational and frame of mind for my two controversial statements thus far by considering a few questions.Why did the Maysles take footage of little Edie prancing around the house like a child? Why were these shots often in extreme close ups? Did these shots make you feel uncomfortable? Did the Beales seem in a clear frame of mind? Would you claim the Beales to be in a healthy mental condition? Were there shots of the Beales getting close to undressing or undressing? If the questions didn't get you thinking, my basic point is the Maysles knew better than to exploit a psychologically troubled mother and child. Framing it as an empathetic slice of life is a cover for compassion trolling and humiliation porn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maysels were enormously proud of the documentary "Grey Gardens" but as a documentary of two mentally fey women of a wealthy socialite family of note, it is a scathing critique of how some families fail to care for their embarrassing odd members and would rather sweep them under the carpet. Where are the "sane" members of the family who should bring in the doctors who could have aided these women. Moreso, where is the help to cook, clean, and tend the house that these sad ladies ramble about in squalor? Clearly what the Maysels reveal is the mental illness of the two co-dependent women who preen and prance for the camera, as well as squabble, argue, and perform. Desperate for attention, the younger Edie goes through enormous numbers of head scarves and outfits for the camera, which is never not invisible reflected in mirrors and on occasion in comments back with the subjects. The elder Edie is lost in time, her belle of the ball days gone with the wind, but nobody remembered to take home these two decrepit prom queens. Young Edie talks to the camera all the more to agitate the elder mother who becomes jealous at the attention her daughter receives. The competition between mother and daughter is obvious and sad.If the Glass Menagerie was fiction, Gray Gardens is sadly factual as a documentary with qualifications. If someone had cared enough to get medical help for these women, it would have been humane. Sadly, they did not and only the Maysels caught the aftermath. Exploitation, yes, interesting, yes, and morbid, absolutely. The Beales were disposable women in a society that did not like to acknowledge the skeletons in the closets of the rich and famous. The Maysel Brothers dragged the Edies out of the closet and before the public which makes reality TV seem mild. That these women were the relatives of the ubber wealthy Jackie Kennedy Onassis makes their situation even more pathetic. O no, Jackie O, the Edies are spooking the horses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the early 1970's socialite Lee Radziwell commissioned the Maysle brothers to shoot a documentary on her life. During some preliminary research they discovered the Beales, close relatives of both Lee and her sister Jacqueline Onassis. "Big Edie" Beale and "Little Edie" Beale, Jackie O's aunt and first cousin, respectively, were living in seclusive squalor in a rat- and raccoon-infested, crumbling 28-room mansion in East Hampton, New York named Grey Gardens. Over the years, both mother and daughter had become increasingly cut off from the world, living on a meager $300 a month (in one of the richest neighborhoods in the world, no less), and supplementing this allowance by selling off family valuables. The eccentric duo came within a hair's breadth of eviction because the local board of health, after a series of raids provoked by reprehending neighbors, threatened to demolish their mansion. Fortunately family ties never unbind, as Jackie's hubby came to the rescue with a $25,000 check for the cleanup and renovation of the property.This is just backstory, covered by the Maysles in the first five minutes by way of newspaper cutouts. The Maysles don't conduct any interviews with the Beales' neighbors, Jackie O, or Lee Radziwell (who, by the way, canceled that commission upon their discovery of her family secret). They spent just six weeks with the Beales, recording frequent spats between mother and daughter and reminiscences of society life and failed romances. The focus is largely trained on "Little Edie," who in younger years was a beautiful model wooed by some of the richest men in the world. The only people we see besides the two heroines are a young handyman named Jerry Torre whom "Little Edie" nicknames, after the Hawthorne novel, The Golden Faun (at one point, not knowing the Faun plays for the other team, she complains to her mother about his intentions); and a couple bewildered-looking people who come to Grey Gardens to celebrate "Big Edie's" birthday. But mostly it's just mother and daughter, lazing away in their otherworldly idyll.A completely absorbing documentary. Albert Maysles later took another look at the Beales in The Beales of Grey Gardens, which was released in 2006 and made up entirely of unused footage that didn't make the cut the first time around.</fullReview>

The aunt and cousin of Jackie Kennedy remove themselves from New York Society and hide in the Hampton's. In the process they become recluses and what is best described as "crazy cat ladies." They would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by Jackie. This film was done after that rescue. All during, you couldn't help but think, "how bad was it before?" It's a look at high society from the darker side, and it is utterly fascinating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why should you watch this? There are certainly no reasons why you shouldn't watch it! Superbly and amusingly directed by Albert and David Maysles, Grey Gardens was originally intended to be a film on the gentrification of East Hampton, but it turned out to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric life of the two Edith Bouvier Beales, the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Their life was certainly an amusing one (Edith spent most of her day in bed singing operas, Edie performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats, one was named Ted Z. Kennedy) The film is interesting because it is both funny and sad - Edith died shortly after the film was released (in February 1977) aged 82 after experiencing some of the fame that she and Edie received after the film (she danced and sang in a nightclub Edie Beale Jr was born in 1925 and is still living in Miami Beach.This film is both engaging and spellbounding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grey Gardens is an unsettlingly intimate portrait of the daily lives of Big Edie and her daughter Little Edie. Formerly upper-class socialites, we now see this strange pairing proudly living in squalor in a dilapidated East Hampton beach house. Cats roam through empty rooms and plaster crumbles from the walls, while relics from their past fade into the filth.The documentary has a home video feel as the camera lingers on the women, allowing them to create the film through merely living their lives. We are invited into their conversations, whereby they live out their past lives in dramatic prose, often speaking over each other in competitive excitement. The dynamic between the two women is bizarrely intriguing with their constant patterns of reminiscing, arguing, erratically shouting, reconciling and of course singing. This script that they've created initially gives us the impression of an old Hollywood movie, yet as we hear the same lines repeated, it becomes a depressing reminder of the mundane spiral that they've found themselves trapped in.For me, what gives Grey Gardens its truly legendary status is the unforgettable character of Little Edie. She spends most of her day tortured by Grey Gardens and the psychological ennui its come to represent. Yet her enigmatic personality continues to shine through in her passionate bursts into song and witty observations. She has rightly become a cult icon, set apart by her ever-changing outfits made from bedspreads or curtains, her unique mannerisms and her memorable quotes ("I'm just pulverized by this latest thing"... "All I have to do is find this Libra man"). Her highly likable, free spirited character is the film's greatest attraction, while her lost potential is its greatest tragedy.This documentary is disturbing in a way that you may not instantly realise while watching. Certain scenes have inexplicably lingered in my mind - raccoons crawling through their walls, Edie ecstatically dancing around the house to an old record and declaring her love for the cameraman, Edith passively observing the cat urinating on her portrait. However, beyond the uncomfortable Lynchian weirdness there is an undeniable heart at the films core, as we find that we cannot help but relate to these two remarkable women. We are simultaneously disgusted by their lifestyle and endeared by their tenacity to rebel against the status quo of prudish East Hampton, where as Edie remarks, "they can get you for wearing red shoes on a Thursday".Grey Gardens is refreshingly original, clinging to the imagination and cementing the Beales' raggedy place in history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If creepy-as-s**t "aristocratic" Americans attachment disorders were McDonald's happy meals, Foxcatcher would be for the boys while Grey Gardens would be for the girls... weird analogy, perhaps, until you realize that one of the Bouvier/Beales (or both) knew the Duponts, and one of their photos is pointed in the film out as being shot by those other delightful bunch of blue bloods.This is the original 'Hoarders', a reality show before that concept had polluted the TV airwaves, only here given a natural boost and clarity by the Maysles brothers - they're unmistakable as being part of this whole thing and even try to sing along once or twice in good favor with these wombats - and thus they are all-too human depictions of decay and disorder. You might almost think going on, as I did, mistakenly, that there may be some laughs to be had, whether at their expense (cruel, but it's part of the whole Schaudenfreude thing with reality TV) or with them (a few of the elder Edith's observations are funny in a scathing way).But it's not really. This is a disturbing film precisely because the Maysles just show the place for how it is. And yet it also has some good historical context amid the mother and daughter squabbling (which makes up a good 55% of the film) - just one panning shot across the various homes along the Long Island sound, homes that were very likely at one time the sort one saw in Gatsby, speaks a lot of words.It's meant to be uncomfortable many times, though there's a lot of tragedy in the air as well. 'Little Edie' may or may not be here against her will in a way; but then the questions arise, and one goes into another. One might ask, why doesn't she just leave? Well then, who would take care of her mother? Maybe it's her mother's 'time' to go to a "home" for the elderly - her eyesight is quite terrible, and though she has some of her marbles she spends much of her time singing (not terribly, it should be noted) to old show-tunes and petting and feeding the stray cats. But then why even keep the house at all? Memories, perhaps. Or just the whole 'Old-Money' thing that came with being the cousin of the former wife of the president of the USA. Marriage is brought up a lot in the film - failed ones, (semi) successful ones, relationships that could have been that Little Edie resents her mother for, and her mother just thinks 'Eh, whatever'. In a way it's almost like the Maysles have no choice but NOT get in the way of these women. They only ask a question here and there to move a thought forward, not to press any point. Clearly, as one can see in Grey Gardens, these ladies can do that all on their own. Of course the house itself is another character, a gangly and rancid thing in the midst of "All those leaves" (as Little Edie points out) looking like something that should at BEST be considered for a *good* cleaning and at worst should be burned to the ground (those cute raccoons in the attic optional). Ultimately, the power of this creepy saga of the underbelly of the upper class is sometimes very hard to watch or take in, but that's the idea. After five minutes you'll either know to go along for the other hour and a half with these pieces of work, or not. I did, and I'm glad I did - whether I return, I'm not sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You should see this unique film because you have never seen anything like it before. A landmark documentary style film that is spellbinding to watch, somewhat like watching a train wreck- you can't take your eyes off of it. An eccentric mother and daughter, the Bouvier-Beales, from an aristocratic French/American family, live in poverty in their crumbling mansion with cats and raccoons. This is all true and shown in stark reality with camera work and editing that is what I would describe as effective in this case, although somewhat unorthodox. It is difficult for me to perceive it as exploitive because the two women seem to enjoy having company and performing before the cameras, but the exploitive/invited paradox is one of this strange phenomenon's compelling aspects. Another factor complicating this aspect is that apparently it was their cousin, Lee Bouvier Radziwill, who initially contacted the film-makers although she later renounced the results. So the film crew did not just wander in; they were invited into the project (as it was originally conceived) by a responsible and highly-placed relative.It is hard to put "Grey Gardens" into perspective, but consider that although these women both lived long lives (both lived to be over 80 years old) we are seeing their lives at their nadir. Would a film showing a short period of anyones's life at its absolute low point be flattering to that person? One can only wonder what types of mental conditions or co-dependencies we may be observing while watching "Grey Gardens", and of course it is somewhat sad, but don't miss this film. You will probably never forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In SALESMAN, we saw traveling salesmen going door to door peddling copies of The Big Book of Jewish Fairy Tales (as comedians Bill Maher, Jon Stewart and Lewis Black call the bible); in GREY GARDENS, we see the Rich as they slowly rot away in their crumbling castles. This is rot as seen from the Inside. No, not "rot," per se; rather, DECOMPOSITION: slow dissolution. Slow decay, on full display. "You shouldn't have a contact with The Outside World," "Big Edie" warns her mostly bed-ridden mother before pirouetting around the house like the young child she proclaims herself to be (her obsession with her looks and her weight aren't necessarily strange, but this self-proclaimed "eternal youth" is). GREY GARDENS is often difficult to watch, simply because there's not a lot going on- and, if not for the family name, it's unlikely anyone would've EVER heard of these two recluses. I wasn't particularly moved by it, but I'm sure the late Shirley Jackson would've understood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting mainly in tandem with the soaring musical version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the overwhelming cult following for this sad "documentary," I must admit to having cordially loathed the film which struck our party as far more a distressing exploitation piece than usefully informative. That said, after seeing the magnificent stage musical drawn from it, one can appreciate what the film might have been in surer hands. One suspects that those many of us who actively suffered through the film may have had any campy delights its crueler fans enjoyed destroyed by the uncomfortable suspicion that too many of us - or those we know - are only a misstep or two away from the deplorable plight of the two mad women depicted who live in and contribute to a squalor they seem incapable of controlling or escaping.The film leaves the viewer desperately wondering how any person could have slid to this level of degradation and, unlike the musical, offers no cautionary clues or explanations, only a horror show unredeemed by humor or insight. This soul crushing flatness of the film makes the achievement of the stage version (hopefully to be filmed ultimately for cable) all the more remarkable. Act II is faithful in almost every detail to the film under discussion but strangely, setting the sad inmates' plight to music, raises the human tragedy to art. Even more important, this act is preceded by a fine Act I where we meet the women before their decent into mutually enabled madness, and are offered hints how their isolated purgatory came about. In short, everything which the FILM is lacking.To the filmmakers' credit (or their successors), the excellent Criterion DVD release includes out-takes and bonus material that partially redeem the main film - behind the scenes photographs, interviews and commentary - filling in some of the blank spots the original editing consciously decided to omit in its drive for unadulterated horror and depression. They can't make the amateurish film itself satisfying, but they can at least make it a bit more comprehensible. Ultimately though, it is only the remarkable stage piece inspired by and drawn from it by book writer Doug Wright, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie which raises the rating of the original GREY GARDENS above a single (generous) star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fascinating yet unsettling look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent infested, rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city. It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53. The content is pretty much made up of two things. The first are the conversations were Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer, actress, and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times amusing. The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. Each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad. In one amazing scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling. Very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it. The filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus, coming each day to record (and chuckle) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about. Ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by. Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in. Despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever. For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness. Most amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom. Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.</fullReview>

In the end it's just exploitation and can make no claim to beauty or art.I wonder what director Albert Maysles, who lurks in the background of this documentary in a way that feels like porn, did with the proceeds from this film? Considering that it was made in 1976 I'm not too optimistic. I sort of think that old Maysles got to have his chuckle and his money too.It is very painful to watch, not even considering the relationship these women had to Jacqueline Kennedy, which, in 2016 is not so relevant. The popularity of the film was probably due to the Schadenfreude it generated in working-class audiences. And we all know that 1% of the population controls 99% of the wealth, so that's somewhat understandable. But only for about second. I would love to have seen these women turn get rehabilitated, get jobs, or connect with their family and become functional again. I know functional people are boring and who wants to see them? But what if they had become conservationists or converted their home into an award winning bed-and-breakfast? It's a shame they did not do better. But would Albert have been interested if they had? Since there is no way to reconcile the decaying beauty of this film with the feelings of sadness it creates for me, I will just point out a few interesting moments: The elderly Edie sings "Tea for Two" really beautifully. White women should wear sunscreen all their lives. They need to get rid of about 7 cats. What is the 20-something dude on the bicycle doing? Is he hoping to score with the 56 year old daughter? He seems questionable but at least he's making conversation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a very complicated reaction to "Grey Gardens," the Maysles brothers' cult classic 1975 documentary. I felt by turns creeped out by Edith and Edie, the mother and daughter at the film's center, and very sorry for them. They rot away in a derelict and disgustingly dirty mansion, swarmed by cats and other wild animals, bickering and reminiscing about the lives each of them left behind, Edith's as a singer and Edie's as a model and dancer. There shouldn't be anything wrong with not realizing your ambitions when those ambitions lie in artistic fields that only a very select few succeed in, yet the fact that these two didn't replace their disappointments with anything else turns them into grand guignol caricatures. Edie especially is like Norma Desmond if Norma had never been successful in the first place. I couldn't decide whether she was just deeply eccentric or actually suffering from a mental disorder. There's a scene where some people they know come over for Edith's birthday party, and the young female guest looks the entire time like she can't wait to get out of the house and away from the weirdness. That's exactly how I felt watching the film. Even though they volunteered to have their lives filmed, and despite the fact that Edie at least thrives on the attention, I couldn't help but feel a little shamed being a voyeur. The film is like rummaging through someone else's dirty underwear.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The documentary Grey Gardens, directed by the Maysles brothers was a groundbreaking installment of the cinema verite film movement. Edith and Edie Beale were eccentric people, and the Maysles took advantage of that with them being the subjects of Grey Gardens. There is no topic or lesson to be taught to the audience, rather it is like a peek into the daily life of of two co-dependent, sheltered women inside their dirty, dilapidated mansion.The heart of the film is the toxic relationship between a mother and daughter. Edie constantly confides to the camera that she "can't take another winter here in the country" and yet doesn't leave, and hasn't for twenty-five years. Her mother said "You can't have freedom when you are being supported", which resonated as a driving factor for why Edie is trapped in her forlorn life. Edie is stuck in the past, and obsessed with being famous and beautiful. She revels in the camera's attention, as if she finally got her big break that she gave up years ago to care for her mother. Their bickering and backwards conversations flanked by piles of filth and feral animals is sickening, but a depressingly true reality for these women obsessed with what could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one heck of a disturbing movie. I'm aware that Little Edie is quite a cult figure with a loyal following even years after her death, but I'm not sure how someone like her would generate "fans" per se. If she wasn't mentally ill when she moved back in with her mother, she certainly was by the time the Maylses showed up, and her narcissistic mother is surely the one who punched her ticket to the funny farm.I understand the Beales were delighted with the film when it was screened for them. Anyone who's okay with being portrayed the way those two women are in this movie is not playing with a full deck, period. One half-naked and screeching "Tea For Two"; the other with her skirt on upside down and an unidentifiable piece of clothing pinned to her head marching to a rah-rah fight song? nope, no adult women I know would be happy about ending up on film looking like that. I'm acquainted with some poor housekeepers who don't feel comfortable letting repairmen in the house? but they don't have huge holes in their walls that raccoons are coming and going through, and they don't have rooms piled waist-high with empty tin cans. This is a problem, and hardly anything to admire.Personally, I was torn between a certain degree of pity and outright revulsion, and I found it very hard to finish the film (took me 2 nights; I needed a break). It's sad that the husband/father and sons/brothers retreated, but who could entirely blame them? In those days I doubt there were the safety-nets in place that are available now; maybe the only thing the men of the family could think of to do was step away and go on with their own lives.To the reviewer who mentioned Miss Havisham: spot on! In living color and stereo!I'm glad for the sake of the once-beautiful home that someone bought it and restored it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grand Delusions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The documentary "Grey Gardens" is now retrospectively regarded as the inception of what would later be termed "reality" programming, and as such, does contain some element of exploitation. The mother and daughter team featured here, former socialites cast adrift from their well-heeled pasts decades earlier, can both be described as 'eccentric', but that's the polite term. They co-exist in a once-grand, now crumbling, trash-strewn, urine-stained oceanside mansion where they exhibit very questionable survival skills. Their relative sanity is also constantly in question. The film, in every sense of the term, is the proverbial car wreck you cannot look away from.Perhaps it wouldn't seem this way had it made some effort to give the viewer a more focused glimpse of who they once were and the circumstances which brought them to their squalid, delusional situation. Therefore, the viewer would be better able to put some needed perspective on what they are watching. There apparently exists some history of family members' attempts to remedy their plight, but we're only made aware of them through random shots of newspaper clipping which are never elaborated on.Instead one has to rely on the often incoherent ramblings of two women attempting to tell their own skewed versions of their lives, almost always while stepping on each others' conversations. Overlayed onto this are episodic bursts of anger, regret, sorrow, seemingly constant bickering, and unintended whimsy. The few 'outsiders', briefly seen, don't get to add their perspectives either, even though they likely have an incredible amount they could tell us...and they seem to want to.This is a fascinating story, to be sure, but we don't really develop any feeling of sympathy for these seemingly deranged women because there's no foundation in which to anchor any emotion, making the proceedings more pointless than they ought to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Grey Gardens" is a riveting documentary about a mother and daughter who live in their deteriorating home, having little contact with others.This is a documentary in the true sense of the word, where the filmmaker does little more than document, without intent to impose a point of view. The camera merely follows the pair of women through their daily routines. On the other hand, it is impossible for the filming to not influence the behavior of the subjects, especially with Edith and Edie, who seemingly love to perform for the camera, and who enjoy having the crew around--probably because they offer a welcome interruption to their relative loneliness.The women live with a multitude of cats. They even feed the raccoons that have breached the interior walls of the rotting mansion. Mother and daughter interact with each other as if the daughter, Edie, was a young girl. They might bicker sometimes, but each is the other's link to the past, a shared history, memories of better days.The result is reminiscent of Miss Havisham from "Great Expectations", living as much in the past as the present.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Little Edie and Big Edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for. Even though their house was filthy, this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness. On the message board a poster wrote that "Little Edie has the coping skills of an eight year old." This reminded me of when in the dramatized 2009 version, Big Edie says to Little Edie, "If you're stuck, it's only with yourself!" These women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, firm belief in their opinions and actions. Perhaps if Little Edie wasn't so hard on herself the first time things didn't work out, losing her hair, her job, and the love of her life, she would have made it. This somehow ties into what I believe is her mental illness: her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead. The world will never know what have happened if she didn't listen to her mom's plea, "Come home, Edie! Let me take care of you!"Yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant, heartbreaking, and lovable, even in their extremely filthy home. These women were extraordinary, and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness. When Edie had one of her emotional breakdowns, dwelling about what could have been, or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl, one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that "everything will be okay!" Great documentary!!9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Living in the neighborhood, one did hear about these two old birds, the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis. You hardly ever saw them, but heard they resided amongst trash and cat feces. The house looked old and neglected. Nobody mowed the lawn. It would never win first prize in the annual L.V.I.S. (Ladies Village Improvement Society) competition. The place looked deserted whenever you walked by, and the Beales were not spotted around town.In this film, "Little Edie" and mother "Big Edie" are seen sunning on the grounds. Inside, they are quite lively, singing and dancing for the exploitive cameras. Obviously, the Beales are animated for the Maysles brothers. Viewing the inside of the house reveals it wasn't as dirty as legend claimed. There were not dozens of cats in evidence, only a manageable few. They "adopted" our family cat once. Thankfully, he wore a collar listing the name "Scribble" and our telephone number...Mrs. Onassis called, and my mother handed me the phone. Probably, she knew I would get a kick out of talking to Jackie Kennedy. In her distinctive voice Jackie said, "We have your cat, Scribble." Edie Beale has a similar voice. We went over to get the cat. Jackie was not staying at "Grey Gardens", she was in a nicer place on Lily Pond Lane. Periodically, she and sister Lee Radziwill would try to help their eccentric relatives clean up, and return the "adopted" cats to their homes.****** Grey Gardens (9/27/75) David Maysles, Albert Maysles ~ "Little Edie" Bouvier Beale, "Big Edie" Bouvier Beale</fullReview>

It is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe, as I'm sure other fans will attest to. After watching it, you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us. At least we have Grey Gardens to remember them! I think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with.

		<shortDescription>DVD's Extra Features Add to Bizarre Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it very intriguing that Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy's sister and the cousin of these women, would encourage the Maysles' to make "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" the subject of a film. They certainly could be considered the "skeletons" in the family closet. The extra features on the DVD include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women. I'd say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating. (i.e. "Are they nuts? Or am I missing something?"). This movie is hard to come by.

		<shortDescription>an intriguing glimpse into another world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting how the train of research can flow. I started out looking at an article about Cristo's "The Gates" in Central Park. The article stated that the Maysles had been Cristo's filmographers for years. Hmmm... Then I got to looking at their body of work. I believe one of them has passed on but the other is still filming Cristo and Jean Claude in their stages of creation. Grey Gardens sounded very interesting. Video Station, in Boulder CO, is the place to look for the obscure or offbeat and of course they had it in stock. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women living in the past, and oh what a glorious past it was. Edith had been well off, born a Bouvier, married well, had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was in her forties. Her daughter Edie had been a débutante, a fashion model and had many beaus. She never married and at some point in her thirties had come home to recuperate. She seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind. Worrying too much about things. It is only a shadow of the world they live in though, because Jackie O. came and spruced up the place so her aunt and cousin would not be evicted. It is a 28 room mansion that is worn down and worn out. But, in the film you will notice fresh paint on the walls. If you look carefully at the newspaper clippings you see it was very much a dirty mess. The outfits Edie comes up with a very clever and creative. The viewer gets the impression that Edith likes to go nude, but she doesn't in the movie. Edith was really quite beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty still as she sings "Tea for Two". Edie too was a beauty in her day and quite attractive at 56. It was a good movie, though not for everyone. When the cat is urinating behind Edith's portait she states, " at least someone is doing what they want"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A legendary documentary by the Maysles brothers. This melancholy look at the ruined lives of blue-blood Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter Edie Jr. is surely one of the strangest movies ever made. Seeing these two as dirt poor and living in a decaying estate, it's difficult to believe that these ladies are relatives of Jackie Kennedy. Watching them ramble on and on, oblivious to their plight will make you feel downright queasy; the movie makes you laugh and feel bad for these women at the same time. "Little" Edie is a train wreck, lost in her own world where she's a very talented singer/dancer. The reality is not so bright. It's very sad, very bizarre and unlike anything else you'll see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a cringe-worthy effort to try to make interesting the sad lives of two lonely people that had given up on trying to improve their lot in life, preferring instead to look back at a more illustrious past, and the missteps that brought them to their current condition. Sadly, I sincerely believe hat if there had been no connection to Jackie Kennedy, this would never have received the attention, and indeed, critical acclaim it has managed to attract. This distant relationship does not redeem the film in any way.I believe this was the Maysles' first real film, and it shows. The camera work &amp; audio would be passable for a film-school project from the 70's, but just barely. This film could have used a lot more editing - it might have made it more watchable. I watched this film as one would an accident on the highway; with sympathy for those involved &amp; with gratitude that I would soon be gone.Sorry, judging from the other reviews I am in the minority, but I've nothing good to say about it.

		<fullReview>Ellen Hovde, Muffie Meyer, David Maysles and his brother Albert Maysles' documentary feature about American socialites Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale (1895-1977) and Edith Bouvier Beale (1917-2002) was shot on location in the town of East Hampton in southeastern Suffolk, New York in USA and is an American production which was produced by American documentary filmmakers Albert Maysles and David Maysles (1932-1987). It tells the story about Edith aka Little Edie and her mother Edith aka Big Edie who whilst living on an estate called Grey Gardens in the mid 1970s where they had been living quite isolated for many years, were faced with eviction after being ordered to clean up the house by the Suffolk County Health Commission.This Direct Cinema documentary which examines the everyday life, relationship and personalities of a singer in her early 80s and a fashion model and cabaret performer in her mid-50s, draws an utterly intimate and condensed portrayal of a very contradictory relationship between a mother and daughter who ever since the daughter put her career on hold and left New York in the early 1950s, lived on their own in a descending house with eight cats and other wild animals. Besides the fact that Little Edie was the first cousin and Big Edie the aunt of former First Lady of the United States and book editor Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (1929-1994), it early on becomes evident why this somewhat eccentric pair was chosen as subjects for a documentary feature.In this close look into the private and personal lives of two human beings who was in a far from ideal situation, one becomes more concerned with the people who are unveiling their lives in the most candid way than the story itself, and begins to question if this is more than just a quest for attention and fame and weather or not they really wanted someone to see as much of themselves and their lifestyle as this revealing portrait shows. As the outgoing and outspoken Little Edie unlike her mother acts as if she is the center of this documentary, she becomes the main character and it is therefore also mostly narrated by and from her point of view. Due to a style of filmmaking where surprises are frequent and where anything can happen at any given moment, this real-life soap opera which was screened Out of competition at the 29th Cannes International Film Festival in 1976, becomes an at times melodramatic and very truthful depiction of two adult women who despite hardly ever, while on camera, being able to maintain a civilized conversation, is tightly connected and cares for as much as they resent one another. A lingering and astonishing true story that underlines the theory about the truth being stranger than fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grey Gardens (1975) *** (out of 4) Bizarre "documentary" about Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter Edie - cousin and niece of Jacqueline Onassis - living in a dump of a mansion where we get to see their day-to-day lives. I'm really not sure if bizarre really covers everything in this film and I'm really not sure that this should or could be called a documentary. The content has come under attack by many critics. I think most agree that it's a very entertaining movie but at the same time it makes you feel more like a voyeur looking in on a couple obviously sick people. I understand the directors getting attacked for filming these two as it seems clear that there's really no point to it other than to show what wacky behaviors they have and to see how someone with so much money and connections to greatness can be living like bums off the street. The film opens up with newspaper clips of the two about to be kicked out of their mansion because of how dirty it is and then we see that Onassis had to place cleaned so that the could stay. From here we see the mother and daughter talk about their lives, scream and shout and do other things including feed the raccoons that are living in their attack. We also see their countless cats that are constantly running around. It's rather funny watching this film today because of all the connections it has to reality TV and shows like Springer where people just show all their troubles, bad behaviors and other issues that really should be kept private. We see the two women go off on wild subjects ranging from who they should have married to whether or not they've made mistakes in their lives and a strange bit where the daughter talks about a local repairman wanting her sexually. There's really no "direction" to the film or story trying to be told. It really doesn't seem as if the directors are wanting us to get to know these people or understand them. It seems like the main goal is just to show these two rather eccentric people go off on rants, wild off-topic discussions and other bits of weirdness. It's not a masterpiece and one could question showing these two but there's no doubt that it's impossible to turn away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My film review is on the documentary Grey Gardens. It is set in East Hampton, New York, in a once beautiful mansion with spectacular ocean views. This is the true story of Mrs. Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter Edie. Our film makers Albert and David Maysles shot the film in 1975, but time seems to stand still for the Beale women who are living in the days of yester year. They film the mother/daughter duo who are wary of their intentions at first, but relent upon learning that they will be in the movies! The once beautiful mansion is falling down around them, but they don't seem to notice that they are living amid squalor. The surroundings are overgrown and choked by vegetation that seems to have swallowed the property and the contents and life within. They spend their time arguing and entertaining each other and our film makers with singing and dancing and stories of days gone by.They share their home with their beloved cats which number in the hundreds and raccoons who make their home inside the walls and come out at night to scavenger on the cat food and bread that Little Edie leaves out for them. Both women share a room and everything together almost as if the umbilical cord was never severed, although Little Edie goes back and forth between a feeling of contentment and bitterness for a life she was denied.The film maker's narrative was very informative and concise and their gentle coaxing and prompting of the two women provided many entertaining stories during the filming. The film makers were subjected to the stench and filth every day during filming as they followed the women around as they gave tours of the home. The women were constantly changing their "costumes" for the men, especially Little Edie who took great care to explain why a "costume" was appropriate for the day.The documentary is both unique and intriguing and the women will keep us entertained with their outlandish ways and views of the world and their scenario. It will leave you in astonishment how with dogged determination the women survived and flourished when all they had was each other. You will walk away with an appreciation of life and family and the special relationships that develop within.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reflection on changes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After much thought this play gave me the impression that its message is about changes. It has been said that the only constancy in the universe is change. Changes in our society, government, moral structure, etc. is ever present. Survivors change with the times, the modes and the structure of business. Act One is about the good times; money, position, prestige, social standing. Act two reflects that these two ladies, totally into supporting each other without reflection on the changes outside their homes in society, lost in the race to maintain their lives in sync with society. To me Act Two is more complex yet glosses over the complexities of the how these ladies go to be into sad a state of affairs. No mention of failures except for the daughter's inabilities to find a career due to constant worry about her mother's well being. Act One does have some degree of fluff but develops well their situation. Act Two should be the more extensive one as it is more difficult to understand how well educated people can get into this sad state of affairs. And without any explanation presented the characters' inability to handle cleaning, money matters, etc. we must conclude the cause to be mental breakdown and lack of family support. To focus on their relationship exclusively, the author depends on the audience to be entertained and to be focused on the personalities of the characters. This is not enough. On a larger scale, changes in our society at the wealthy and prestige levels for the worse is not news. Our landscape is full of families that lived with splendor upon the wealth and social standing of the patriarch only to fall as generations that follow fail to keep up with business, practices and taxes and or spend all of it. Some have been successful. But so many have failed running out of money and unable to change with the times. In short, Act One should be a bit shorter as it is easier for the audience to understand wealth due to business or inheritances (such as the Kennedy family. Act Two needs to expand the why of the change, for the worse in this case, prior to giving us a glimpse into the minds of these two ladies that while unable to have money somehow find money to feed cats galore.</fullReview>
