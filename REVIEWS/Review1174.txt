		<shortDescription>Brilliantly fun, dark humour and satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undoubtedly one of the most perfect, brilliant comedies ever, this movie is extremely fun and revels in its dark, clever humour. What can one say about a comedy centred around a dapper, charming, likable, impoverished young English gentleman who is at the same time an utterly remorseless, ever-calculating killer who has no qualms about killing an entire line of relatives who all stand in his path to inherit the family fortune? On top of that, he all the while takes great care in preserving his demeanor and status as a gentleman; all the relatives he must eliminate are brought to life by the genius of Alec Guinness; and there's an executioner who takes pains to show proper respect to his social "superior." The dialogue, indeed pretty much all of the humour, is a shining example of "British humour" at its best. It is subtle, clever, dark, and full of irony and satire. It is pure, brilliant entertainment that doesn't stop. Comedy really can't get much better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Hamer, the director of "Kind Hearts and Coronets", one of the better comedies to come out of the Ealing studios in the late forties, created a memorable film that still keeps enchanting, no matter how many times one has seen it. This is a film that like a vintage wine gets better with age.Of course, the right elements were put together in this venture under Mr. Hamer's direction, which is probably the best tribute one could say about the film.Louis Mazzini, the young man who should have inherited a noble title that is lost as her mother elopes with an Italian tenor and she is disinherited. Louis is determined to regain what's due to him, by whatever means possible. Things go well for him, but he commits a mistake in entering an illicit romance with the calculating Sibella, while at the same time falling in love with the radiant Edith D'Ascoyne, the young widow.Dennis Price gives a smart account of Louis Mazzini. He is a delight to watch as he keeps scratching off dead relatives from behind the picture frame. Alec Guinness portrays eight D'Ascoynes with an unusual panache. Best of all is Lady Agatha who encounters 'turbulence' while flying in a balloon. Valerie Hobson makes an impression with her Edith and Joan Greenwood is at her best as Sibella.This is a film to treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fine film is an example of Ealing at its very best, with a superlative script and acting of a very high standard. In watching, one is once more all too sadly aware of the difference in quality between British films of this era and today; there can't have been in recent times a screenplay as cleverly comic, economical and incisive as this is. The level of wit is high, and perfectly suitable for a black comedy such as this. Certain lines and scenes linger agreeably in the memory; the part where Price, in his droll narration, slips into verse, is wonderful, as is the "fight" he has with a lower-class rival; "I'm not going to drawn into a scuffle with you!"The element of class satire is strong, and while one is shown the lethargy and complacency of the upper classes through the amusing parade of Alec Guinness' characters, Price's corrupt plans are never condemned as such. His character, vigorous and witty, and the clever tool of narration, which in its tone draws in the viewer almost as a confidant. Similarly, but to an even more effective degree than in "Whisky Galore!" (1948) and "The League of Gentlemen" (1959), the viewer is made sympathetic to wrong-doings. The stunningly executed plot and dialogue are finely put across indeed by all of the actors. In the main role, Price refines and defines the cad Mancini perfectly; it really is a great performance, making the character more than memorable. Alec Guinness is great in his 8 roles, making a distinctive actorly mark in all of them. It says a lot that in a career as formidable as Guinness', in TV, film and theatre, his contribution to this film particularly stands out. The two ladies are impeccably played by Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood, who contrast quite perfectly; Hobson as rich and strait-laced if certainly beautiful, and Greenwood as the distinctively seductive childhood friend. Price's "juggling" of his two women is wonderfully arch and amusing. The film's ending should be noted as quite ingenious and wonderfully in keeping with the film's overall wit.In the context even of Ealing, a studio adept at clever comedies, this is an extra-special film. Along with the films of this era of Powell and Pressburger and Carol Reed, this film makes one nostalgic for the days when British film was both distinctively British and universal in its qualities. Wonderfully funny and compelling, this film is one of my few favourites of all and overwhelmingly recommended.Rating:- *****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kind Hearts and Coronets is Ealing comedy at it's pinnacle.From Alec Guinness we see a masterly display of his acting talent, which we can now look back on with a knowing nod, but in 1949 this was a revelation of a new young talent. From Dennis Price we see the cool, calculated killer, totally focused and utterly charming in every way, and for whom every act of homicide must never, ever, offend the sensitive nature of the English Gentleman. From the supporting cast, we see great performances from Miles Malleson as the hangman, whose determination to address the Duke correctly leads him to practice his bowing, scraping, and 'Your Grace'-ing. Also, there is a great performance from Valerie Hobson as the widowed Edith D'Ascoyne. My favourite role (other than the lead) was Joan Greenwood as Sibella Holland - played in such a sultry, seductive way that I immediately thought of Fenella Fielding in Carry On Screaming! This is a superb movie, and one I'd recommend to anyone who wants to truly understand how movies should be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ealing's finest hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best and most loved of the Ealing Comedies is also the darkest. Kind Hearts and Coronets is probably most famous today as "that film in which Alec Guinness plays eight characters." That said, it is Denis Price as Louis Mazzini, the charming, urbane serial killer, who really steals the show.The film opens in prison, with the Louis Mazzini D'Ascoyne, Ninth Duke of Chalfont awaiting execution for one of the few suspicious deaths in the film he wasn't responsible for. On that, his last night, he is completing his memoirs, which act as a framing device for the rest of the film, as well as allowing for a dry, witty narration from Mazzini himself.Kind Hearts and Coronets is everything modern cinema is not. It is not laugh-out-loud comedy, but a biting wit that often leaves you wondering whether you should be laughing at all. The screenwriter takes seeming delight in the precision of the dialogue, with no unnecessary verbiage. This culminates in an astonishing minimalist performance from Price when he finds himself in the dock of the House of Lords, being tried by his peers.I suppose you could look at Kind Hearts and Coronets as a form of social commentary. It was made after WWII, after the Beverage reforms, and may reflect a growing restlessness with the stuffiness of the old social order. Certainly, Louis is presented with such sympathy, and his nefarious endeavours told with such gleeful abandon that it is difficult for the audience not to identify with him.You could regard it as a form of social commentary but, frankly, why bother? It's just glorious fun and, despite a certain English post-war feel, surprisingly modern and anarchic ? there can be few films, even today, which cast a multiple murderer so firmly in the hero role. And there can be few modern films were the dialogue is so witty, for instance, when excusing his flustered state of mind after his first murder by saying "furthermore, I am not naturally callous".Of course, everyone talks about Alec Guinness' acting tour de force ? playing all eight other members of the D'Ascoyne family; from young Ascoyne D'Ascoyne to the hilariously named Elthelred D'Ascoyne (presumable unready for the fate that awaits him), the Eighth Duke of Chalfont. In reality, few of these characters receive more than a footnote in the film. But this is more than made up for by the splendid cast of other leading British actors ? Denis Price, Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood being the notables.This remains not only my favourite Ealing Comedy, but right up there with Dr Strangelove as one of my favourite comedy films ever made. A wonderful, heart-warming tale of multiple murder. 9? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When possible Duke Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price)'s mother dies, she leaves him a dying wish of being buried in his aristocratic family's plot who have shunned her all her life, he sets about getting it done. Imagine his fury and dismay when they say no. He sets about getting revenge, as well as winning the heart of the mercenary woman he loves through murdering each of the eight d'Ascoyne family members that stand between him and a title, riches, and everything that he feels he deserves.Wearing the Ealing black comedy streak on its sleeve and gleefully black, Kind Hearts and Coronets has got to be one of the funniest films about murder to be made. Much of this owes kudos to Alec Guinness' fantastic performance, a true tour-de-force in comedy. He plays all eight of the family members, from the suffragette feminist Lady Agatha d'Ascoyne, to the dull and dim Reverend d'Ascoyne with commendable diversity, changing his tone, stature, facial expressions and accent to play each character as if they were a completely new person. Such a performance could only prepare us for good things, which Guinness then continued to deliver.That said, Dennis Price takes the lead excellently. As Louis Mazzini d'Ascoyne, he murders, poisons and drowns each of the characters without a sense of remorse that could seem cold and inhumane, but the audience find amusing. We eagerly await his calculation of the death of another, because we know it will have hilarious consequences, and the plot never holds back. However, his dry narration tells a story that hides a sad tinge, as well as delivering sardonic social commentary on post-war Britain, where the gold digging (played with disgusting sugariness by Joan Greenwood) women were everywhere and to some people, rank was all that mattered. This is what makes each of the deaths so comical, giving us a little glee that the snobs are getting what they deserve.For those who don't want to watch a film for the history lesson, no fear ? Kind Hearts and Coronets truly shines as a comedy. Even now, the one-liners and biting irony rings and every scene has a joke to laugh at. Under director Robert Hamer's ultra-capable hands, a warm-hearted satire has been crafted. You really can't get much better, or much intelligent than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Supreme Example of Dramatic Irony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS GALORE Everyone describes this film as a black comedy, but its defining trait is its all-pervasive sense of irony. For starters, whereas DR. STRANGELOVE is a truly black comedy, ending in the destruction of the planet, KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS is a moral tale in spite of its theme of cold-blooded revenge.The "for instances" of irony go on forever in this film. Here are a few: Sibella rejects Louis for being too poor and marries the rich Lionel. Ultimately both she and Lionel turn in despair to the prosperous Louis for support.As Young D'Ascoyne indifferently deprives Louis of his position at the shop, so Louis coolly goes on to replace Young D'Ascoyne at the bank.The two members of the D'Ascoyne family who suffer the most emotional distress by Louis's murders (Edith and The Banker) are the two who do the most to give him aid and comfort.The Reverend Henry, in spite of being a Christian minister, lives in an atmosphere of luxury and pleasure to excess. His very reputation provides an excuse for his poisoning and its resultant cover-up.The Admiral's sheer inaccessibility protects him from Louis but dooms him all the same. Even a man standing beside him can't get through his thick skull in time to save him. He drowns at the salute with a life preserver bobbing nearby.The General praises the fame of the Russians for their caviar, forgetting that they were also infamous for their bombs.Lady Agatha is a crusader for women's rights, but it's her own equality with men as an heir to the Dukedom of Chalfond that marks her for elimination. Her willingness to martyr herself in one cause (women's suffrage and freeborn equality) gives Louis the opportunity to kill her for its exact opposite (patriarchy and inherited rights.) The cruel and judgmental Duke is caught and sentenced to death in a mantrap set by his own orders, and executed with his own weapon.Edith marries Louis as a show of faith in his innocence even though he turned her into a widow once before and will do so again if he's hanged.The eager executioner loses his opportunity to hang a nobleman because his inflated sense of occasion delays the proceedings.Lastly, Louis escapes the noose only to hang himself seven times over when years of meticulous planning are undone by a moment of forgetfulness.The more you watch this movie, the more details emerge each time. They don't write scripts this brilliant anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First class British film-making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As is the case with most great things, the basic premise of this film is simple. There is, however, an essential darkness at the heart of the movie: the cold blooded and calculating murder of all those who stand between Dennis Price and his possible succession to a title. That this is treated in so light and civilised a way is the triumph of the film. The screenplay and performances complement each other perfectly and are a credit to all those involved. I cannot think of a weak link in the film. The casting was beautifully judged down to the most minor character. The leads are, though, just about perfect. For my money, it is the best of Dennis Price's film work (though his Jeeves on television in the 60's was good, too). Guinness was splendid and well supported by Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood. I have probably seen the film more than a dozen times in the past thirty years. Each time it offers something fresh and new. Quite simply one of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this gem half a dozen times and look forward to seeing it a few times more. It's a masterpiece of unsentimental, yet genteel, humor, and features performances by some extraordinary actors. Sir Alec Guiness's eight different turns have been much commented on and deserve every superlative they've received. Dennis Price is too little recognized--in the US, at least--for his gifts, as his work here proves. Valerie Hobson is wonderful, and Joyce Greenwood is...I would happily buy a recording of her reading the OED, just to hear that astonishing voice. And, in a small but marvelous role, Miles Malleson is superb. If you have not seen this film, it's readily available. Give yourself a treat. I know that Hollywood seems to have forgotten that there's nothing to be gained by trying to remake a perfect film. If they ever dare to do it with this one--I don't give a damn who is in it, or who directs or writes--don't bother. See the original. None genuine without the Ealing Label.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Kind Hearts and Coronets" is really an essay in acting from one of Britain's greatest, Sir Alec Guinness, and what better way to remember him than the film which gave him eight roles to play? True, one or two are barely given time to register before Dennis Price dispatches them (Lady Agatha would have been interesting as a fully rounded character), but those which are developed - Henry, the photography enthusiast in particular, are cleverly played and memorable. Price also does well in his role. The ladies - Joan Greenwood and Valerie Hobson - are excellent. The great strength of this film is in its black humour, and of course in its delicious twist ending. I can't bear to think of it remade with a 2000's gloss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My most beloved Ealing film, it's dated but in a good way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I've said on all my Ealing movie reviews, I watched these cause the plots looked interesting but I'm still unsure on how to judge the movies. I'm not one to dismiss them as 'old' and therefore 'boring'; at the same time I don't just jump on the bandwagon saying they're classics just because they've got that reputation and a lot of people without even judging for themselves assume they're great.To quote to further my point - "A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read. A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read." -Mark Twain So, watching this with an open mind, I really enjoyed it. Yes you have to realise it's not a modern movie so the kind of themes and scenes presented are different from the packaged elements of modern Hollywood, but that makes postwar British cinema very refreshing viewing. I think the use of the term 'comedy' is misleading because it most likely refers to it in the classic literary sense from Shakespeare and Greek theatre (probably in the early 20th century people were a bit better read than today so these terms would still have meaning to them) which refers to a story with happy ending and farcial plot and wit rather than obvious jokes like in the modern sense but even these movies have some funny scenes. Also the humour and premise is black comedy and subtle so look for something modern if you need laugh-out-loud movies.'Kind Hearts and Coronets' When I first came across this the plot looked so unique I knew I just had to see it at least once, although I've rewatched it many times since. I do find Guinness's 8 roles are over-hyped because most of them have few lines and the distinctions between a few of them are non-existent though it's still a novelty and a brave act to pull off in a movie. For me, Mazzini's 'bad guy' characterisation is the most appealing element of the movie, with a characterisation that makes even a criminal charming and someone to empathise with a little (and for me some visual appeal). The unique premises of who we see him murder next and the wit and black humour makes it a treasure of a film that I'm glad was made and is still available and enjoyed. One of my most beloved films for definite. Definitely worth one watch just to see something different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Very Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm with those who rate this film as one of the best comedies ever made. Reading the comments, there is much said about the quality of the acting and the bizarre nature of the plot. I regard one of its chief delights as being the ever-present tension between the gruesome nature of the hero's enterprise and the polish and sophistication of his manners. This tension is continually highlighted by the plot. An example of this is the scene where Louis Mazzini is sitting drinking tea with Edith D'Ascoyne in the garden, and calmly continues their conversation as smoke begins to appear behind her in the distance, from the hut where her husband is being incinerated.The other chief delight for me is the language. Every word of the dialogue and narration is precise, conveying neither more nor less that it ought. The examples given on the "Memorable Quotes" section are by no means all that could have been chosen. Lines like those can of course only be delivered by actors who are completely familiar with the English language at its most refined, and who have the composure to speak them as they were meant to be spoken. It is a joy to watch and listen to them.I have watched this film many times, and it never loses its freshness. There is nothing spectacular about it, no flash; just a constant succession of rare treats to be enjoyed again and again.I cannot conceive of a better comedy than this ever being made, so I give it 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful reminder of the 1939 film with Basil Rathbone "Tower of London." In that one Basil Rathbone systematically eliminated members of the family including children to fulfill his goals. It's the same thing here where a young man never forgot that his mother had been slighted by the family for supposedly marrying beneath her.When she dies in poverty, he, as a young man, decides to do something about it. How he goes about bumping off the family members is memorable in itself. It just goes to show you that class distinctions could possibly drive anyone up the walls.What makes this film so good is the ironic twists that we see occurring between our gentleman friend and the two ladies of his life. How fate deals with him in the end is just hysterically too good.Kudos to Alec Guiness for the variety of parts he assumed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though it had been producing films since the 1930s, it wasn't until 1949 that Ealing Studios finally commenced its golden period. In was in this year that they released the first batch of their most entertaining comedies, including Alexander Mackendrick's 'Whisky Galore! (1949),' Henry Cornelius' 'Passport to Pimlico (1940),' Charles Frend's 'A Run for Your Money (1949)' {a little-known gem of which I'm very fond} and, of course, Robert Hamer's 'Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949),' which launched Alec Guinness into a successful career with the studio. Easily one of the darkest comedies of its era, Hamer's film was loosely adapted from the novel "Israel Rank," by Roy Horniman ? among other changes, the main character was renamed from Israel Rank to Louis Mazzini, to avoid any perceived anti-Semitism so soon after World War Two. The title itself was derived from an 1842 poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson, which reads, in part: "Kind hearts are more than coronets, and simple faith than Norman blood." The films of Ealing Studios can often be characterised as good-natured, down-to-earth comedy offerings, light-hearted in tone and always steering towards the attainment of community betterment; characters typically conclude the film having learned a valuable lesson, and the ending is usually most ideal for all concerned. Later films such as 'The Lavender Hill Mob (1951)' and especially 'The Ladykillers (1955)' returned to the murky themes of Hamer's film, but they couldn't avoid reinforcing the age-old adage that "crime doesn't pay," whereas this comedy leaves ample room for the possibility of our killer escaping scot-free {however, for audiences across the Atlantic, the Production Code dictated that this ambiguity be removed}. Likely influenced by Charles Chaplin's 'Monsieur Verdoux (1947)' ? a "comedy of murders" ? Hamer unwaveringly filled his film to the brim with dark themes, dry wit and bitter irony, finding a hilariously suave and classy serial killer in actor Dennis Price, whose unflinching murderous plight attains a twisted sense of empathy through the maltreatment of his mother's memory at the hands of the D'Ascoyne family.I've often remarked that Alec Guinness never plays the same role twice, his character changing unrecognisably from picture to picture. In the case of this film, he virtually changes from scene to scene, portraying all eight heirs to the Dukedom of Chalfont with uproarious charisma and versatility. It helps that most of Guinness' creations, merely targets for the conniving Louis Mazzini, are wholly unlikable or frustratingly senile, though there's certainly a pang of regret when the amiable photography hobbyist is murdered, and the manner in which The Duke is dispatched is shocking in its sheer cold-bloodedness. Perhaps a single complaint is that the murders of Lady Agatha and the General were skipped over much too quickly, and I would have enjoyed a more in-depth examination of the mechanics of the crime. The final act of the film is swathed in a healthy dose of irony, as Mazzini is arrested and charged for the one murder he didn't commit, his fate sealed and then rescued by his jilted mistress, Sibella (Joan Greenwood), who alone guesses the truth about what he has done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a tour de force for Guinness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced an amazing body of work--particularly in the 1940s-1950s--ranging from dramas to quirky comedies. I particularly love his comedies, as they are so well-done and seem so natural and real on the screen--far different from the usual fare from Hollywood.Before I saw this film, I had seen The Mouse That Roared and was spellbound by Peter Sellars and how he played the roles of so many people in that little movie (ranging from the hero to the prime minister to even the queen). I did not realize until later that Alec Guinness had done an equally masterful job about a decade earlier with this movie.Although not quite my favorite Ealing film starring him, it is certainly among my favorites. It is the story of a serial killer who you find yourself rooting for to get away with the crimes! Unlike some sicko, the main character has some understandable motivation for killing off several extended family members in order to obtain the family fortune. And when he kills several of these people, you find yourself wanting him to kill them as well! Now that takes amazing writing and acting to pull that off!! So see this charming little comedy. It has come on Turner Classic Movies several times lately, but if you can find the video, rent it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's more than a touch of Oscar Wilde in this film. There is irony and elegant decadence, both in the visuals and in the script. The narrator, Louis Mazzini (Price), has murdered several people who stand between him and the title to which he feels entitled. Invited to go on a hunt with one of his victims-to-be he agrees to stroll along but refuses to carry a shotgun because he is opposed to blood sports. The protagonist is supercilious, snotty, and a complete egotist who is happy that one of his benefactors dies a natural death since it makes it unnecessary to kill him. It's so uncomfortable to murder someone with whom one has not had disagreements.What also strikes me is the resemblance to Vladimir Nabokov's "Lolita", both in its structure and execution. Of course the movie lacks all of Nabokov's poetry ("Light of my life. Fire of my loins") but so does everything else ever written.Yet there are some isomorphic qualities in "Kind Hearts and Coronets," aside from the elegant irony and the snobbishness of the narrator. Humbert Humbert is guilty not just of killing Quilty but of ruining the youth of an adolescent girl and he comments on his own perversity with the kind of distant amusement that Price's narrator does. Price's own debaucheries amuses him. At a wedding, he congratulates the groom whose virginal bride he seduced the evening before: "You're a lucky man. Take my word for it." And, like Humbert, he feels nothing but contempt for people with "suburban ways". He's fastidious in his wardrobe and grooming. And if Humbert's love for Lolita was real, it was rarely expressed without being undercut by irony. ("I was a pentapod monster.") Similarly, Price has one real engine driving him -- a genuine desire to revenge the humiliation and death of his beloved mother -- although it's only brought up seriously once or twice. Both Price, as Mazzini, and Humbert Humbert are always showing off and quoting poetry. (Price's final quote, "How happy could I be with either, Were t' other dear charmer away!" is from Gay's "The Beggar's Opera.") The movie is extremely funny. The acting is superb all around, with Guiness being the splashiest performer in his five roles. But Price could not be improved upon. The way he manhandles his drunken rival Lionel, throwing him to the floor, then brushing his hands as if they'd been dirtied. And his improvised sample of the Matabele language ("colloquial rendering of course").The director has all of this down just pat. It's a very British movie. The understatement is almost overstated. Only two of the murdered people die on screen -- one peacefully. I cannot see an American remake of this without a lot of on screen blood and violence which, in my humble opinion, would drain the story of much of its humor.I will give just one example of what I mean, out of many possible. One of the men standing between Price and his title of Duke of Chalfont is played by Guiness as an amateur photography enthusiast who keeps a stash of sherry and whiskey in his windowless woodshed, in which he develops his prints. Guiness also hides some whiskey there, his wife being a "prig". Price substitutes an explosive for the kerosene in the lamp of the darkroom. Later, Price, Guiness, and Guiness's wife (Hobson) are having tea and Guiness decides to rush off to the woodshed to "develop" some film, leaving Price and Hobson carrying on a civilized conversation. About one hundred yards behind the couple is a stone wall behind which is the shed. Some time passes while Price and Hobson trade decorous Victorian observations on photography and so forth. During this exchange we hear a slight "thud". A few moments later a wisp of white smoke appears from behind the stone wall, roughly in the vicinity of the woodshed. The smoke increases and becomes a billow, at which point Price comments that "someone must be burning leaves in the garden." Try as I might, I can't imagine a modern remake of this particular scene without a long suspenseful and explicit demonstration of Guiness going into the shed, striking a match, lighting the lamp, and having it explode in his face. There would follow an exterior shot of the shed being blown apart by a fireball, the stones flying through the air, the shrieks of Hobson and Price at their tea. It would simply be a different movie and not nearly as good.Man, this is funny. See it quick before they remake it and ruin it, as they did recently with Ealing's "The Ladykillers."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very entertaining movie with the stars (Price and Guinness) doing a wonderful job but the hangman, played by Miles Malleson steals the show. What a brilliant portrayal of a fellow justly proud of his profession and ready to retire after years of faithful service. I thought he would have a line like, "I don't want to just hang around." Well worth seeing for brisk screenplay and the understated and professional acting. They just don't make them like this any more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the time it was made, one of the aims behind Kind Hearts and Coronets was to showcase the English language. I know of no other film which does this so well. It is this plus the superb performances which make the film, like a good book, worth returning to again and again. It is one of my two favourite films (the other being the 1960 version of "Inherit the Wind" - which also features superb dialogue. It will remain required viewing for any student, not only of the cinema, but of all that was best of a vanished age of English gentility and refinement which had by no means disappeared at the time the film was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Ealing comedy, with Alec Guinness especially outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I loved The Ladykillers, Kind Hearts and Coronets is my personal favourite of the Ealing comedies. One might argue that the narration is overused, I would say the narration added to the darkness, wit and charm of this superb film. The cinematography is crisp and smooth, and the score is great. Then we are treated to a deliciously witty script, that is funny, dark and has bite. The story slips smoothly between dastardly deaths in the guise of a self-satisfied memoir, and is gripping while moving along at a good pace, and the direction is secure. But it is the quality of the acting that elevates Kind Hearts and Coronets. Dennis Price is brilliant as the inventive killer, and Joan Greenwood is delicious as Sibella the vamp. Also convincing as Edith is Valerie Hobson, but the scene stealer in no less than eight roles is Alec Guinness in a real tour de force. While some of his roles are small, they perfectly show off his versatility. Overall, superb and deliciously dark Ealing comedy. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Noblest Of Killing Sprees</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a rare film, even among the good ones, that moves faster the second time you see it. Yet this is but one of the many virtues of this brilliant Ealing comedy, a brutally dark satire of the English upper class that sails along on gossamer wings.The film is best known for Alec Guinness's performance in eight separate roles, all of them members of the D'Ascoyne family, a rare duchy in which succession was possible from the female as well as male sides. Thus, when one D'Ascoyne woman is disowned from the family for marrying an Italian singer named Mazzini, she still retains the power of succession, as does her son Louis, provided the other D'Ascoynes die without issue. A grown Louis, smarting at his mother's treatment and his own lowly position in life, sets out to improve his station by exterminating his kin.Watching this film, it becomes clear pretty early that the central performance is not Guinness's but Dennis Price as Louis. Price not only has to carry the story with his acting and droll narration, but give us a figure we can both sympathize with and be horrified by. An earlier reviewer likened him to Richard III, but even those of us who enjoy Gloucester's skullduggery are glad to see him undone in the end. Louis Mazzini is unique in that we don't want him to fail, even when his victims (like the gentle parson and the henpecked photography buff Henry) are not so deserving of his homicidal attentions. It's a marvelously perverse treatment, done up in a very lighthearted way, and Price in his urbane Basil Rathbone underdog fashion carries the ball for all of us.By the end of the film, there's more upended Guinnesses to be found here than in a Dublin tavern, yet "Kind Hearts And Coronets" is not merely a British version of the much inferior "Arsenic And Old Lace." As Louis rises while his kinspeople fall, he finds himself having to choose between two lovely ladies, one a D'Ascoyne widow (Valerie Hobson) of high principles to which Louis aspires, the other a childhood chum (Joan Greenwood) who shares the darker impulses which got him where he is. There's a good deal of real dramatic and romantic tension in how Louis juggles his affections, along with some more killer comedy.Greenwood is especially remarkable, with lush bedroom eyes, a voice like a dipso courtesan, and a talent for drawing big laughs from her character's selfish pronouncements. She's so monstrous at times, teasing out Louis's early expressions of desire and taunting him about his aspirations for dukedom ("Maybe pigs will fly"), yet as the tale unfolds and she finds herself on the outside of Louis's bright future, we find ourselves pulled as much by her desperate, dark measures as we have been by Louis's. The two, as they agree, are made for each other.Like I said, this movie moves faster the second time you see it, because once you know what's cooking, the sly script and ace delivery makes a more positive impression, and make you a more receptive viewer. In that way, I wish the film had given us another 15 minutes, rounded itself out to two full hours, and given us more of the other Guinness D'Ascoynes, like the General (Guinness's best character with his gravelly voice and tales of bloody debacles) and Lady Agatha. What we get is sometimes a tad too neatly handled, and detracts slightly from the overall greatness.There's a casual brutality to this film that's a wonder for its time, and renders "Kind Hearts And Coronets" timeless. Yet we also have in Louis Mazzini a character to pull for, and an ending that does not disappoint either in cleverness or fun. Give "Kind Hearts And Coronets" a chance, and you may well walk away realizing the Pythons didn't only not invent merry black comedies, they didn't even perfect them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSOften described as one of the finest Alec Guinness films, and one of the finest Ealing pictures, "Kind Hearts and Coronets" is a superb film which remains fresh and funny, over 50 years after it's release.After his mother is expelled from the wealthy D'Ascoyne family, Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price) grows up on a honest wage. When his mother dies however, Mazzini grows angry however and begins to take revenge on the family (all played by Guinness).This film, most notably known for the superb work by Guinness, is a brilliant comedy with some superb twists. Whilst it's no denying that Alec Guinness is wonderful in so any performances, it's the non-stop narration and coverage by Price which really keeps the film moving along.Aided as well by some great performances by Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood, the story simply clicks into place.Really, there's little else which can be said about "Kind Hearts and Coronets". It's a wonderful plot with some superb acting and some great jokes. Lead at the front by eight brilliant performances by Guinness, the story progresses at pace and never fails to entertain. The finest pre-1950's film your ever likely to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind Hearts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Rabagliati Well that was definitely the best film I have seen, which I haven't chosen, thus far. It is one of those old Black and Whites which at first glance you think is going to be another typical piece of 1940s British cinema. This opinion could not be further from the truth. In the 1940s, the majority of British Film released was heavy Drama, and Wartime films, things like Kind Hearts were entirely neglected. So I feel it is a nice break from your average piece of 40s film. There are so many little things about this film which combine to make it one of the most entertaining comedies I have seen. The naration of the lead is brilliant, and without it I feel the film would lose marks. I love the calm, collected and often hilarious way in which he goes through his story and all the terrible things he has done. The picture is totally charming, the cinematography and direction seems to capture the feel of what is supposed to be going on perfectly. I love the fact that the director often manages to give the film a look of charming and happy innocene, whilst the protagonist is in the process of some terrible deed. One particular scene sprigns to mind as the scene in which Henry D'Ascoyne dies. I love how our Hero sits calmy in the idyllic English countryside with his murder victims wife, calmly taking afternoon tea, and when he sees smoke from the explosion he makes some comment about burning leaves. Brilliant.The trial in the House Of Lords is one of my favourite scenes from the film, I again love the collectedness of the protagonist as he sits through his trial. I also really enjoy seeing the House of Lords being used as it should be, not ruined by these awful modernists. The film is awesome. The story is great, a man low down in the sucssesion trying to become Duke. What more could you want? It's a comedy, so I didn't expect well defined characthers and a finely tuned story, so was surprised to get one.The ending of the film is possibly one of the greatest and funniest film endings I have ever seen. It seems to be a recurring theme recently that we never find out what happens at the very end... All in all9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dennis Price stars as a nobleman about to be executed for a murder he did not commit, after having committed eight other murders for which he was never suspected. He was perfectly cast in the part of the ninth Duke D'Ascoyne. But if anyone steals the show it is Alec Guinness as the eight members of the D'Ascoyne family that all meet untimely ends at the hands of Price's character. The great Sir Alec is in fine form as always in one of Britian's finest motion pictures, from the now defunct Ealing Studios. Another gem of a performance is that of Miles Malleson as the hangman. All in all quite a romp. This is one of those films which (thank God) should never be remade as there is no room for improvement on the original, and any other attempt would be demeaning at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ealing black comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Immediately after WW2, Ealing Studios produced a number of black comedies, several starring Alec Guiness who was just starting to be noticed as an actor. One of the last in the series, The Ladykillers, was foolishly remade by the Coen Brothers (starring Tom Hanks) and it stank. The original films had a dark humor, moral ambiguity, ingenious plots and great dialog. The best in the series was Kind Hearts and Coronets - made almost at the start of the cycle.The stars are Dennis Price as Mazzini Jr. whose deceased mother was a member of the D'Ascoyne film before being disowned for marrying an Italian opera singer. Alec Guiness plays the eight surviving D'Ascoyne's (including Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne) whose deaths could lead Mazzini to becoming Duke of Chalfont castle. Kind Hearts is a wonderfully black comedy about how Mazzini disposes of his relatives one by one in order to avenge his mother and become rich in the process. The greatest thing to note is the witty upper-class dialog. Dennis Price has the right mixture of believability and sleaziness while Guiness gives a tour-de-force of colorful performances.Kind Hearts is a very good introduction to Ealing comedies. Other good entries would be The Lavender Hill Mob (more cockney humor), The Ladykillers (which was actually funny unlike the remake) and The Man in the White Suit. All three star Alec Guiness. Then there are those without Guiness like Passport to Pimlico and Whisky Galore!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film in the mode of a Jane Austin novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kind Hearts and Corrents is in a sense an extrapolation of Jane Austin's satire of the English aristocracy. Where Austin gives the reader a sarcastic insight into their ways of life, Kind Hearts and Correnets kills the English aristocracy off, as if to symbolise their slow demise within modernity. But, as this film illustrates the aristocracy has methods of survival via its never ending line of descendants ready to take on hereditary titles. Ironically, the survival of the dukedom in this film is due to the actual banished heir to that title murdering his relatives who stand in his way. If you like, this is an illustration of how there will always be an aristocracy of sorts, in the form of rulers in all types of societies, as illustrated in George Orwell's Animal Farm. This is because as the famous psychologist Erich Fromm says, as a conservative society we have a 'fear of freedom' and depend on being subordinates of rulers, like children to their parents. In Kind Hearts and Correnets we see an example of this when the duke performs his paternalistic duty for his dependant proletariat.The irony is that the lead actor, Dennis Price, in Kind Hearts and Corerenets is a descendant of minor aristocracy, himself deprived of his title due to the paternalistic line being directed away from him. In this case he plays the part of the denounced heir superbly. Meanwhile Valery Hobson shines out as a beautiful, elegant lady, which could be less to do with acting skills and more about playing herself.As for Sir Alec Guiness, it goes without saying that he steals the film, with his range of acting talents, here some of them showcased in all the characters he plays.In the case of the screenplay, it is wittily directed, well paced, entertaining, and never for a second boring. This permits a distraction for the viewer, and the overlooking of the minor flaw of how there were no accusations pointed towards the lead character which are to the viewer easily detectable given that he was present at most of the murders of his arosticratic relatives.Overall, an ageless classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alec Guinness has long been my favourite actor. His performances in Lavender Hill Mob, The Man in the White Suit, Oliver Twist (1948), and The Bridge on the River Kwai are pretty much unmatched by anyone... except himself as eight characters in Kind Hearts and Coronets. Mind you, Dennis Price deserves plaudits for his towering performance and he too plays more than one character (he also plays his father). Their acting alone would have made watching this film indispensable to anyone who cares even slightly about films. But there are other treasures to it: There is a most enjoyable and eloquent use of the English language with possibly the quirkiest and cleverest dialogue I have ever chanced upon; wonderful diction by all (though in smaller parts, Joan Greenwood with her throaty voice and beautiful Valerie Hobson with her polished accent are too lovable for words); the satire of English aristocracy, its self-preserving immunity and its murderous values; the volatility of fate; and the most successful, witty, and intelligent twist ending I have ever seen. To cap it all, Director Robert Hamer is in his best form ever. The performances he extracts from his ensemble and his use of the camera are top drawer. Finally, for all the clever caper and comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets stands as a subtle cautionary tale. You can only fool some of the people some of the time but never your own conscience.</fullReview>

My teen-aged sons saw it last summer (2005) and loved it. Indeed, it is difficult to believe that anyone can dislike it.

		<shortDescription>Wickedly clever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Hamer's 1949 film "Kind Hearts &amp; Coronets" is the epitome of British humor, from start to finish. Louis Mazzini (Price) is a descendant of the D'Ascoyne family, a family of royals, but unfortunately his mother has been disowned by the family for taking up with and marrying Louis Mazzini Sr., an Italian singer whom the family highly disapproves of. When Mazzini Sr. meets an untimely death early in young Louis' life, he sees his mother struggle to give him everything he needs, so after she dies, he vows revenge. He decides that he will get his birthright and become the Duke of Chalfont, except he has to get through the eight people ahead of him (all members of the D'Ascoyne family are played by Alec Guinness) who are in line for the title. Meanwhile, while he is calculating how he is going to commit cold-blooded murder to knock off each heir, he carries on a sort of double affair with Sibella (Greenwood), a woman who he has been enamored with since they were children and is now married to a former classmate of theirs, and Edith (Hobson), the young widow of one of the D'Ascoyne heirs that Louis offs. The story is told in flashbacks as Louis sits in a jail cell, awaiting his execution and writing his memoirs.This was one of the most clever and wickedly funny films I had seen in a long time. I honestly had no idea what to expect from it when I started watching; I only knew that it was an IMDb Top 250 film and it starred Alec Guinness. I didn't have a clue that it was going to turn out to be one of the greatest examples of British comedy I've seen this side of Monty Python. The gags in the film are so dry and subtle (at one point, Louis causes an explosion that means the demise of one of the D'Ascoyne heirs, yet when it goes off while he and the heir's wife are sitting in the garden having tea, neither of them even flinch, and she doesn't notice something is wrong until she actually turns around and sees the plumes of black smoke) and the theme so dark that it could theoretically be easy to forget that one is actually watching a comedy. There are no sight gags, double takes or high hilarity present, which makes this film all the more appealing, because it elicited huge laughs without stooping to typical elements of comedy.I thought that Guinness was going to be the breakout guy in "Kind Hearts and Coronets", and believe me, it's certainly noteworthy to see him dressed in drag as Lady Agatha, but the real star of the film was the fantastic Dennis Price. He plays Louis with the slick charm of a Rex Harrison, but it is clear that his heart and temperament is far more nefarious than anything Harrison could drum up, even when he was plotting to kill his wife in "Unfaithfully Yours". When he utters lines like "The next morning I went out shooting with Ethelred - or rather, to watch Ethelred shooting; for my principles will not allow me to take a direct part in blood sports" when he has not only already killed several, but is planning on killing Ethelred himself, his aplomb yet sincere delivery is comic gold.I really enjoyed "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and sincerely hope that even though it seems to be slipping more and more to the bottom of the IMDb Top 250 list after an initial strong appearance, its placement on the list will make more people seek it out. Frankly, I had never heard of the film before seeing it appear on the list, and I consider myself to be fairly adequate in my knowledge of classic film. And you'd be hard pressed to find a better classic film comedy than this one; it is ahead of its time in its clever wickedness. I would be willing to bet the Coen Brothers are fans of this film. 8/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nasty. Vicious. Delicious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kind Hearts and Coronets is probably one of the nastiest movies ever made. And there's hardly an ounce of onscreen violence in it. I first saw this flick as a child, and although I liked it, I was probably too young to understand it fully. Well, now I do. It's brilliant. Dennis Price as the vengeful, amoral (yet, in his own way, strangely moral) Louis Mazzini turns in a fantastic, beautiful, even sympathetic performance. (Would you believe *sympathetic?*) He is complemented--though not overshadowed--by the inimitable Alec Guinness in eight roles as members of the D'Ascoyne family. And Joan Greenwood is every bit Price's conniving equal as Sibella. I should also mention that the script is mind-boggling. It's all nasty stuff covered up by Victorian gentility. Scathing attack on nobility, too. Also on folks who seem to miss the point about art (like Guinness' portrayal of the priest).I'm running out of ways to express my enjoyment of the film, but I'd like to make a final point. I read a comment allegedly attributed to Lindsay Anderson that indicated the movie's visuals didn't live up to the screenplay. Just want to respectfully disagree. I believe the visuals were perfectly suited to the film, as they framed the action perfectly, called attention to the comic moments without creating any distractions (via camera or otherwise) and provided clean, clear visuals. In other words, a perfect appearance for a nearly perfect comedy. The strong editing also helped. So, while this is not a visually innovative film on the level of, say, "Citizen Kane" or "Battleship Potemkin," it doesn't need to be...nor should it be. The sum of its parts makes a thoroughly delectable whole.How many stars are we allowed to give it? :-)- Simon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was young and I mean early teens, I saw a film called Kind Hearts And Coronets. I knew that this film made many decades earlier was something very special. It is an Ealing comedy unlike their other offerings.So how could this movie, released in in 1949 and obviously in black and white, have entertained me to the extent that I can still class it as one of my all time favourites? Answer:... this is near perfect cinema. The art of making a black comedy is a tough area of film and one that has produced more duds than successes. There are no laughs as such, yet you know that this is a comedy from the start, despite it being dark, moody and serious. To be able to turn the topic of jealousy and death into comedy is an amazing feat and it is not until you realise that Alex Guinness is playing multiple parts that you fully understand that this is not your typical film.I wont give anything away, but I urge you to watch and enjoy this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Meantime go and console my dearest one, and seek to dry the tears from her lovely eyes. Tell her that I have gone to avenge her wrongs, and will return only as the messenger of punishment and death.'The aria by Don Octavio from Mozart's Don Giovanni which plays over the opening titles and during the early scene sets the tone for the film perfectly. By providing a subtle accompaniment to a sequence of events that occur prior to the birth of the narrator ? Dennis Price as Louis Mazzini, first viewed from behind in a prison cell whilst awaiting death by hanging ? it recalls Don Giovanni's ultimate fate for his refusal to repent of his past sins.The story of the immediate past of Louis's parents unfolds in the film's unhurried, languid manner and provides the main reason as to just why he set out as he did to avenge his dead mother, an erstwhile member of the titled D'Ascoyne family: she was ostracised for having had the temerity to put love before a life of rank and privilege and married an opera singer. The more the story unfolds, the more the protagonist Dennis Price seems to cast aside the role of being simply the harbinger of death and becomes more the principal: having made the fateful step upon the path of revenge he seems to grow in worldly power and malevolent influence as he draws nearer to his ultimate goal of becoming the tenth Duke of Chalfont, with the result that he reveals himself to be more and more truly a member of the D'Ascoyne family, in manner and in character, one that he presumed to despise so much.Price is magnificent. His mellifluous and studied voice with its pitch, flourishes and aspirated delivery is a joy to listen to, ideally suited to the film's first person narrative and its Edwardian appeal. He gives a performance of such refined charm and genteel good manners that the listener becomes inevitably and completely entranced, happily paying little or no heed to the contrasting nature of his murderous and vengeful behaviour. Always ready with either a bon mot or an anecdote, has there ever been a wittier, more humorous or more sympathetic villain? Kind Hearts and Coronets simply drips with irony, understatement, drollness and humour of a deliciously dark kind ? which is due in no small part to the brilliance of the screenplay. The director (and co-writer) Robert Hamer had his finger on the pulse of the late Victorian/Edwardian era to such an extent one would feel that he was plucked directly from either one of its garden parties or its many cricket matches. His use of the period language and his awareness of that era's social nuances combine effortlessly and flawlessly to describe that carefree time, so soon to vanish, enjoyed between the turn of the 20th century and the start of the First World War. Based upon the novel 'Israel Rank' by Roy Horniman, the film is enacted by a cast who unite to confer a series of excellent performances upon the audience. From Alec Guiness's superb turn as successively ill-fated members of the D'Ascoyne family ? done away with by either good fortune or in inventive manner ? to the inimitable portrayals by Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood of womanhood, both sacred and profane, and those minor but no less important roles of Miles Malleson, Clive Morton and Audrey Fildes amongst others, all of whom deserve praise for work that can still be appreciated for its sheer craftsmanship more than half a century after its inception. Kind hearts and Coronets is simply a tour- de- force.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been many years since I saw this film. I have fond memories of it and wanted to see if it stood the test of time.Oscar winner Sir Alec Guinness plays eight different parts: The Duke, The Banker, The Parson, The General, The Admiral, Young Ascoyne, Young Henry, and Lady Agatha.Sir Alec is better know today as Ben 'Obi-Wan' Kenobi. Many of us remember him fondly in the role that won him as Oscar: Col. Nicholson in The Bridge on the River Kwai. But, this fourth film he appeared in has always been in my mind as one of his greatest roles.The main character in this film, the serial killer, was played by Dennis Price, himself a very interesting character. He was very high born and expected to go into the military or the church. He chose acting, and had several good roles befitting his status. But life sometimes takes and awkward turn and he ended up making grade Z films for Jesus Franco, the Spanish Roger Corman. This stands as his greatest role.The actions after Price succeeded to the Dukedom was most fascinating and ultimately hilarious, as it was not the murders that would prove his undoing.An outstanding film that does stand the test of time with excellent performances by both Guinness and Price and Joan Greenwood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alec Guinness goes Peter Sellers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people now days seem to have forgotten how Alec Guinness started out his career once. He was a quite successful comedy actor and appeared in several genre movies, often as the leading man. This sort of all changed after he won an Oscar for his serious role in "The Bridge on the River Kwai". Ever since people tend to mostly remember him for his serious roles, which makes his comical appearances and talents perhaps unfortunately a bit under-appreciated.In this movie he plays no less than 8 different roles, which are all members of the same family. Sounds Eddy Murphy like but it's of course done with lots of class and talent. He seamlessly plays all of the different character with great professionally involved but never without a comical touch, without ever making the movie feel ridicules.This was also actually one of his first movie roles and it seems amazing that he already scored so many big parts early on in his career. It shows what talent he had and how many great directors were already confident enough with his skills to offer him a great part in their productions.But it's of course not just Alec Guinness which makes this movie a great, amusing watch. I must say that all of the acting is simply great within the movie. It features some classy British acting, from mostly some unknown actors involved. Especially also Dennis Price knows to impress as the leading man of the movie.But it above all is also a greatly written movie. It features a nice concept, that serves perfectly as one to bring some good entertainment to the screen. It's a very amusing movie, mostly through its story. But it's also well constructed all. It's also a story that provides the movie with lots of pace, which also helps to make this movie better to watch now days than some of the other genre movies from the same era.The movie is being a comedy but it's a quite dark and subtle one. The humor and comedy doesn't ever get exaggerated and it relies often more on its clever writing than any of the movie its visuals or actors physics.A fine amusing movie to watch, that got made very well and with some great actors involved.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic production from the famous London based comedy studios. Whoever came up with having Alec Guiness play the part of all the family remembers is nothing short of a genius. British films back then were produced comparatively quickly and it must have been quite exhausting learning all those different lines and coming up with the various mannerisms, not to mention all the costume and make up changes.Of course you're routing for Mazzini to win, despite his being rather callous, although I wasn't overly keen on the romantic element of the script.Alas, this movie is saddled with that mantra of forties and fifties films, especially those made in Britain, which is to show that crime doesn't pay, hence the leaving behind of the memoirs detailing the murders. However, in this movie it was done in such a way that Mazzini could easily get his memoirs back without them being read by anyone else.I would recommend this film to anyone and suggest you watch it at the next available opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful satire on British class and manners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the decade after WW-II, Ealing Studios (UK) produced many droll comedies, several starring Guinness; "KH&amp;C" is probably its most famous (and blackest) comedy. It's a delightful satire on the British emphasis of class, class deference, &amp; appropriate ritual manners with class, etc., set around the beginning of the 20th century, just after the Victorian era.Dennis Price has the lead role as Louis Mazzini, a VERY distant heir to the Dukedom of Chalmont, inherited through the D'Ascoyne family line. His mother, a D'Ascoyne, married an Italian singer for love and not status and, for that reason, was disinherited, disowned.Louis has scarcely even a remote chance of inheriting the title--there are a dozen D'Ascoynes ahead of his position of inheritance.BUT, some accidents happen; Louis becomes sufficiently ticked off by some of the D'Ascoyne haughtiness that he starts doing away with many of those standing between him and the title.Alec Guinness, certainly one of the great actors of all times, plays eight different members of the D'Ascoyne family (one a female) varying in age from maybe 35 to 90. His changes of voice, facial expression, posture, movements, etc., so perfectly fit each character he's incredible.Dennis Price in the lead role (Louis Mazzini) was excellent and holds everything together: whether as a lad of 16, a ladies' underwear salesman at 25, or an upwardly climbing society member, he fit his roles precisely. A very young Joan Greenwood was a great vamp. "KH&amp;C" is called a "black comedy." While that's true, I think the emphasis should be on the comedy rather than the black. No scenes of murder are seen, only their build-up and consequences.This film was made in the late '40s, long before awareness about racial stereotypes arose. Thus its nonchalant use of the original child's rhyme "Eeenie, meenie, meinnie mow........." rhyme is a sign of what was acceptable in those times, NOT of now.Out of 10 stars, I'd give it 9 3/4. A must see movie, a classic.P.S. -- We saw the Criterion Collection DVD which gave the world-wide ending rather than the original version made for the USA which, in those years, was governed by the Hays Code; this code prohibited ANY hint of receiving a benefit from committing a crime. The non-USA ending is FAR more preferable.ALSO, if you have optional subtitles available for the hearing impaired (as in the Criterion version), consider using them. The film's British accents sometimes make British speech unclear to American ears not used to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind Hearts and Coronets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard of the Ealing comedies (from Ealing Studios), and I never knew this was one, I should have known The Ladykillers was one too. This is a fantastic comedy with some witty dialogue (particularly from the main character), and one actor playing all members of one family (probably one of the first actors to play more than one character in a film). Basically Louis (Dennis Price) is in prison (you know why later) writing memoirs of his recent exploits. His mother died, but she was rejected as part of the D'Ascoyne family for running off with an opera singer, so Louis gets no fortune and cannot be Duke. So he decides to start a revenge for himself and his mother by killing all the D'Ascoynes'. He would get to know them all first, and then eventually find ways to kill them and make it look accidental. All members are played by the great Sir Alec Guinness, they are The Banker, The Parson, The General, The Admiral, Young Ascoyne, Young Henry, Lady Agatha, and of course The Duke. Along the way, there is also a romance with ex-D'Ascoyne wife Edith (Valerie Hobson), as well as his real interest Sibella (Joan Greenwood). He almost gets what he should, but is found innocent for a crime he didn't commit (killing a friend), and the ending is classic. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best British Film. Sir Alec Guinness was number 12 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 2 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 11 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 47 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have much to say that hasn't been said except to note that, despite being 21 and heavily exposed to more modern "side-slapping" comedies, I find this sort of droll humor funnier, and more easy to relate to with my own personality than any other kind of movie. I love the nonchalant-yet-somehow-not-disturbing way in which Dennis Price delivers commentary on the task he has undertaken. He makes the whole thing seem so perfectly reasonable. I've never laughed so loudly at murder in my life. Nor could I tolerate a remake. I think Hollywood, in particular, lacks individuals with this kind of humor today, and would fail to do Price and Guinness justice. If you like this movie you might also enjoy the original "The Ladykillers" and "The Lavender Hill Mob", from a few years later and also with Guinness included.</fullReview>

Hilarious black comedy!I noticed another review that complimented the film by calling it "Quaint". Although I'm pleased that the reviewer liked it, "quaint" just doesn't do it for me. The humour in this film is timeless. "Quaint" is what you call 'The Belles of St. Trinians' or something.

Each performance captures perfection on the screen, and the talents of stars Dennis Price and amazing Alec Guiness deserve all the praise that's been heaped upon them by other reviewers. Certainly one must take note of the stellar performances given by the beautiful ladies involved, Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood. Both lovely, but Greenwood is especially enticing with her trademark voice and petite features.Understatement abounds in this black comedy, and if you appreciate the British "dry" style of humor, this movie is your cup of tea. It satirizes the pompous British aristocracy and military, exposing the banality and decadence evident throughout that closed society. To some Americans, this movie would seem to be set on a different planet for all the similarity to life in the USA. I think that some American viewers wouldn't even realize it's a comedy!</fullReview>

Guinness, wonderful as ever, is truly great but Price is perhaps even better. Ealing gave Price the role of a lifetime as Mazzini, and Price responded with the performance of a lifetime. His voice-over is just, ahem, "priceless".

		<fullReview>This is my out and out favourite of all Ealing comedies even in my eyes surpassing classics such as the Ladykillers. Dennis Price manages to be cold, calculating, manipulative and evil but somehow we still root for him as he single handedly tries to wipe out a noble family who had disregarded his mother many years before. Along with Price's remarkable performance Alec Guiness is also outstanding playing no less than nine separate character (all members of the noble family). The film has a similar tone and style to the aforementioned Ladykillers and if you liked that you will certainly be at home with this. The humour is dark and full of wit a satire on the class system in England at the time (which in some areas is still in effect today). I first thought this film wouldn't show well to a non - UK audience but speaking to a few American and Canadian friends the darker side of British humour works just as well on the other side of the pond.Excellent humour with a wicked streak, great performances, fantastic script 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic Ealing Comedy And A Masterpiece OF Mannered Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The grandson of a Duke whose mother married a commoner and was shunned by her relatives as a consequence, plots his revenge against the pompous D'Ascoyne family who spurned her so cruelly. One by one he bumps off the eight people whose bloodlines stand between him and the Dukedom, but a female admirer begins to suspect his schemes.Arguably the best of the great Ealing comedies, and one of the greatest black comedies ever made, this is a mannered, twisted, delicious peach of a film. As a piece of simple melodrama it would be entertaining enough, but its wit and satirical bite - Oscar Wilde meets Agatha Christie - elevates it to a near masterpiece. Price is unforgettable as the dastardly yet lovable Louis Mazzini; a man whose moral double-standards are both admirable and detestable. His smooth, measured delivery of some of the best British film dialogue ever written is a sheer delight. The rest of the cast are equally to be treasured, especially Greenwood as the vain, preening Sibella, whose hideous self-absorption is matched only by the ugliness of her hats. This movie is most famous however for Guinness' incredible Star Turn as the unfortunate D'Ascoynes - eight of them (a dandy, a banker, a photographer, a parson, a suffragette, a general, an admiral and a duke) - all of whom Price gleefully murders. Guinness is both amazing and amazingly funny; my favourite is the doddery old vicar ("Sir, the port is with you."), but it's Price's movie all the way. Brilliantly written by Hamer and John Dighton (very loosely based on Roy Horniman's novel Israel Rank, with a title from Tennyson's Lady Clara Vere De Vere), with tremendous photography by Douglas Slocombe, this is an absolute gem of a picture, polished to perfection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kind Hearts and Coronets is one quietly amusing Edwardian comedy of manners, famous for showing off the versatility of Alec Guinness. The talented Sir Alec plays eight, count 'em eight different members of the D'Ascoyne family. These folks stand between Dennis Price and his quest for the title of Duke of Chalfont.Seems as though Price's mother was read out of the family when she married an Italian music teacher. She never forgot who she was and brought her son up to never forget as well.Price's supercilious narration which sets the tone for the film as he describes his various acts of murder tell as much about him as it does about the various people of the D'Ascoyne family. He's probably a bigger snob than all of the people he's killing.When you think about it, what is Price doing that Richard III didn't do to gain a throne in Shakespeare's adaption of his story? Interesting how we can be amused at Price bumping off his relations and be horrified at Laurence Olivier doing the same in his Richard III film. Then, that's black comedy.Alec Guinness was given great acclaim for essaying those many roles. My favorite has always been that doddering old fool of a clergyman whom we are told is in the proper profession.Kind Hearts and Coronets is set during Edwardian Britain when class and stature meant far more than they do now. It's a great tribute to the skill of the players and the writers that audiences today, even American audiences can enjoy it set in a world that is unimaginable to us. Besides Guinness and Price, Joan Greenwood as the femme fatale and Valerie Hobson as the widow of one of the Alec Guinnesses do some of their best screen work here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polished Dark Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This polished dark comedy might be most worthwhile for Alec Guinness's multiple role, which is interesting and sometimes quite creative. It also features an entertaining, if morbid, story-line and some quietly witty dialogue and other touches. It is also creative in taking the quaint yet widespread pre-occupation with titles and the peerage, and turning it on its head.All of the humor is of the driest, most "British" and often ironical kind, and indeed some of it is so underplayed that you don't catch it all in one viewing. Likewise, in the lead role Dennis Price is consistently restrained and even distant, and it's easy to wonder whether a somewhat less cool performance might have made the movie even better. On the other hand, too broad of a performance clearly would not have worked at all.Guinness, while always careful not to stretch a character or a scene too far, provides his characters with identifiable and usually interesting personalities. The variety helps out the movie by adding a dimension that's not always there in the major characters.The feature is generally satisfying, and always interesting, because of its refined and often ironically elegant style. At the same time, for much of the time it remains curiously unaffecting, since there is often little reason to care about the characters, other than for their entertainment value. It makes it an unusual classic, maybe not a great movie, but carefully crafted and enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dennis Price plays a young man who murders his way through his bloodline to become a duke. The brilliant Alec Guinness, who has given so many great performances outside of Star Wars, superbly plays 8 roles and dies 8 times. It's not like modern comedies at all, but Kind Hearts and Coronets doesn't feel dated. It's not your typical laugh out loud comedy. It's conveyed in a very dry, detached way, but it's very funny in an incredibly dark way. Admittedly, there are times when you don't know whether you're meant to laugh or not but it still has loads of genuinely funny moments. This is a film which actually manages to make murder funny, but what's most impressive about it, aside from the great performances, is the social commentary. The main character is pretty despicable, yet he is sympathetic and the moment where he confronts the last victim and explains his motives is actually very moving as well as blackly comic. This is an excellent mix of drama and humour, and it is easily one of the darkest comedies ever made. The fact that it manages to make such dark material so entertaining and do so in such a clever way solidifies the film's position as one of the definitive Ealing comedies.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Delicious Satire on Edwardian Manners and Morals is Truly One of A 'Kind'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instead of the usual warm comedy, contemporary setting and familiar cast of lower-middle class worthies, 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' is set in the 1860s and shot through with pitch black humor and biting satire on both the moribund upper class and the grasping venality of the suburban middle class.A waspishly poised Dennis Price plays Louis Mazzini whose mother was cast out from the aristocratic D'Ascoyne family for marrying an Italian opera singer. After her death and a series of provocations from his estranged relatives - mainly their refusal to let her be buried at Chalfont in the D'Ascoyne family crypt, Louis embarks on a plan to murder his way into his inheritance, knocking off eight D'Ascoyne heirs (all played with great relish by Alec Guinness) one by one, in a series of wonderfully absurd set pieces - even polishing off one of his kinsmen, a windy general, by putting dynamite in his caviar. Louis only finds his match in his childhood sweetheart from the suburbs, the vulgar and scheming Sibella. Matters get complicated when he falls in love with Hobson, the widow of one of his victims. But after Price ascends to the dukedom and marries Hobson, fate catches up and something startling ensues.In this delicious little satire on Edwardian manners and morals, the sly and adroit Mr. Guinness plays eight Edwardian fuddy-duds with such devastating wit and variety that he naturally dominates the film. He scores an eightfold tour de force as every member ? young, old, male, female ? of the D'Ascoyne clan, adding an additional masterstroke to the ruthlessly pitched satire about British imperialism backfiring on itself. He's aptly matched by Dennis Price as the Byronic anti-hero, who coolly undertakes a monstrous scheme of killing off all his kinfolk in order to succeed to the family coronet.But don't let this obvious admiration for the leads obscure the fact that the picture itself is a sparkling, devilishly cutting jest. Robert Hamer's poised direction chimes perfectly with his Edwardian setting. He directs the script as a story being narrated as the recollections of a candid scoundrel - the Wildean wit of Price's voice-over an unfailing delight - and the whole development of the scoundrel's calculated career - in this case, of civilized murder - is described in the finest spirit of Gallic wit. Such a story of unmitigated contempt for the fundamental laws or society could only be tolerable when played as a spoof - a spoof on the highest level of cultivated humor and device.The result, Kind Hearts and Coronets, is one of those films that can be seen repeatedly and still offer surprises. As a combination of rollicking black humor and satirical pokes at the English upper crust, nothing else comes close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Working your way up is murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kind Hearts and Coronets is a morality tale and social satire combined into one. Although it is well known for the eight roles played by Alec Guinness, you will discover that some of the roles he plays are rather brief.Louis Mazzini is played coldly and rather understated by Dennis Price. He is the grandson of the Duke of D'Ascoyne whose mother married beneath herself to a singer and was exiled by her rich family and died destitute.Louis is toiling in a shop and ends up losing his job thanks to a D'Ascoyne and wants to get revenge against the pompous family. So he brutally bumps them off one by one and gets nearer to the line of inheritance and at the same time his social and financial status elevates.This film is one of the well known Ealing comedies which has a dark heart. In fact the film opens in prison as Louis is facing the gallows which indicates that he might had not got away with his plans. Even then there are further twists to emerge as Louis complicated love live threatens to derail him.Although Guinness grabs the headlines this is Price's film and he is well supported by a sly, witty and literate script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweetly Twisted and Wonderfully Intelligent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this delightful little picture completely by chance, and am rather pleased in having done so. I was looking through Alec Guinness' filmography one day on a whim after randomly thinking about the film "Lawrence of Arabia". I liked the name "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and thought I'd give the movie a shot. I found the film a while later and sat down to watch it with some home-made caramel and ice cream - I suppose this part isn't too important, though it can't hurt to mention.I was intrigued by the film's plot and was amused throughout the viewing of the film. I laughed at the brilliant witticisms and listened fondly to the protagonist's rather crazed justifications and explanations of his crimes. The film was quite intelligent and very well-written. I became interested in early black comedy films, and similarly so to screwball comedies, after having viewed "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and decided to find other films of the genre. Some of my favourites include "Bringing Up Baby" and "Arsenic and Old Lace", though I had viewed these films before Kind Hearts.The most wonderful part about this film, aside from the story, was Alec Guinness' several performances. I found it hilarious that every D'Ascoyne heir, other than Louis Mazzini, was played by Alec Guinness. This is one of my favourite films of his, and I find him one of the most extraordinary actors of all time. Dennis Price also gives a wonderful, hilarious, and quietly hysterical performance.I recommend the viewing of this hilarious, cynical, and utterly fantastic film to anyone who appreciates black comedies, classical films, or crime comedies. It is sublimely inspired and doesn't get half the appraise or attention that it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KIND HEARTS AND CORONETSIt has been a while since I watched a classic old movie, and a friend of mine recommended this one. I am glad he did. This is a very good movie.It is about a man who grows up knowing that his family disowned his mother because of who she married... but when she passes away, he wants to get revenge on them all for the way the treated her... so he kills them all one by one.The film stars Dennis Price as Louis. Dennis does a fantastic job... he is such a smooth character and even though he is on death row, stays calm through the movie and just writes him memoir. The film also stars Valerie Hobson &amp; Joan Greenwood. These actresses were also very good. Joan played such a horrible woman in this film. At first you start to like her, but then her true colours come out. But the star of the movie has to be Alec Guinness. Alec plays 8 characters in this film. and he does them all brilliantly. He plays young men, old men and even a woman... but he is convincing in all the roles he takes on. The more I see of Alec, the more I think he was a great actor and not just Ben Kenobi in Star Wars.The film was made in 1949, so as you can imagine, the effects were not great, but for the time I can imagine they were very good. You can clearly see that the grave yard scene was just a huge picture background. Also, you can see that the boat scene are model boats. But it does not ruin the movie... if anything it makes the movie better because it shows it's age.The other thing I like about this film is it is the perfect length... i hour 40 minutes. And it felt so quick too. The film played with such a good story that the time flew by. I was hooked to it and was interested by the characters and story.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Another classic Alec Guinness movie... I can't wait to see another one.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film I Have Seen This Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A distant poor relative (Dennis Price) of the Duke of D'Ascoyne (Alec Guinness) plots to inherit the title by murdering the eight other heirs who stand ahead of him in the line of succession.The year is 2012, and this is the best film I have seen this year so far. A few months ago, I had never heard of "Kind Hearts and Coronets". Heck, I had not even heard of Ealing Studios. And I consider myself a film reviewer (although, to be fair, my expertise is horror). But now, wow, I would recommend this film to anybody.No one would argue about Alec Guinness' talent (although kids today know him more from "Star Wars" than "Bridge on the River Kwai"). But this film? Wow. It was a joint effort, with Hamer deserving so much credit for not only directing a masterpiece (with impressive special effects) but for finding the book it was based on. I had also never heard of "Israel Rank", but now I want to read it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meticulously rendered English black comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kind Hearts and Coronets is a lovingly constructed comedy. The dramatic angle is that a murderer keeps his hands clean of the greasy pole by murdering those higher up it instead. The double twist at its close is unsurprising but comes, nonetheless, as a shock. This is almost exclusively by virtue of the beautifully weighted script and its reading on camera, producing almost arcane lines of fine English which both celebrate and lampoon the circuitousness and poetry of the language. It's acted in the same spirit too, with very little unnecessary dramatics. A fire in the first third of the film is all the funnier for it.In addition to this prescripted hilarity is the (misnomer alert) Baroque attention to clothing. The (correct term!) Edwardian costuming is beautifully realised and helps to chart the course not only of the anti- hero Louis' standing but also of his growing self-satisfaction with his murderous project. Dennis Price, wearing all the outfits, is a modern dandy, managing both the high-English and the irony with aplomb. The great role though is taken by Alec Guiness who summons up a portfolio of wonderful, spot-on characterisations as various members of the doomed family. Joan Greenwood and Valerie Hobson are superb as the poles of Louis' experience, particularly Greenwood's increasingly venal, scheming Sibella. A jolly good film, unblemished by the ropey title-card recording of Mozart by the then-only-four-years-old Philharmonia. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a masterpiece despite its age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- - This review DOES contain lots of spoilers but the film is not about the plot or story - -My (new) son-in-law visited for Christmas, saw the well-thumbed DVD case in my film rack and asked what Kind Hearts was like. There was only one thing to do: put it on.He was entranced and it made me a little jealous that I will never see the film for the first time again, to be overwhelmed by its script, the acting and the subtleties.For its time it was very close to the mark sexually. The 'fate worse than death' comment when concern was expressed over what we would now call collateral damage, and the 'I know' when it was remarked how lucky the man marrying his mistress was, were very risqu for the time. The eight murders were not thought to be a reason for criticism.As with so many Ealing comedies there was an undercurrent of political comment, mainly against the ruling elite. The title itself, a compression of 'kind hearts more than Norman blood', is a little dig at the class system. Many people in the lords claimed superiority for being descended from the 11thC invaders who enslaved the population of England.The series of murders is delightfully naughty even now. Everyone empathises with Dennis Price's put down persona (he plays two parts but this is normally ignored and not credited) despite him becoming a serial killer but Guinness's characters are almost universally pompous and perhaps deserving of their fates.There are little twists all the way through, the main one being the fact that he is put on trial because of a lie from his mistress about a murder he did not commit. How could he argue about it? He is also tried by his peers ? again a nice little point as the only way he earned such distinction was by multiple murders.Some of the scenes are perfectly formed. Price's little shake of the teacup when the shed explodes, killing the husband of the woman sitting opposite him, is deliciously understated.I know I'm going against the flow here but I can't help thinking that the film's weakest bit is the multiple roles taken by Guinness. It was rather pointless and the suspicion is that it was done for reasons of cost. Ealing never spent more than was absolutely necessary and often nowhere near what was required. Perhaps two or three might have been funny.The film is a delight. My son-in-law asked to borrow the DVD and I gave it to him, my wife working out that the reason I did so was to give me a reason to buy the enhanced digitally remastered version.I was very happy that my son-in-law watched the film and enjoyed it. I would have resented it if he'd been too slow to appreciate such a masterpiece.I have ranked this as 10 stars, an almost impossible rating I agree. However, it is my favourite comedy. The script is classic, faultless: the story clever and subtle: the on-liners hilarious: the acting (I haven't mentioned the delicious Valerie Hobson who took her part to perfection ? now I have) spot on: the political comment nicely barbed and easily ignored should the mood take: and it is all so delightfully silly.If this film isn't worth 10 stars then no film is.This is no Hollywood blockbuster. It is, however, the perfect black comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has had a limited release in the cinemas in the UK recently and I urge you to take the opportunity to view it.It is the type of film that simply would not be made today.The script is excellent (and how often can we say that of a modern film) and the narration through the film is politely devilish and dark.I never miss and opportunity to view this when it appears on television and I recommend that you ignore the date the film was made and that it is in black and white and you are in for a rare treat.Whilst Alec Guiness tends to get all the plaudits for this film due to the multiple roles he plays. It is Price in my opinion who makes the film what it is, playing a character who finds the landed gentry obnoxious yet longs to be at the heart if it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent British black comedy from the Ealing Studios features Alec Guinness in eight different roles as the doomed D'Ascoynes of Edwardian England, each of whom stand in the way of a disgruntled relative whose deceased mother was shunned by the family after she married for love, not money. Robert Hamer both directed and co-adapted the screenplay from a novel by Roy Horniman; he keeps a steady pace and doesn't allow Guinness to be hammy or overwhelm the scenario (many of Alec's characters are only seen in cameo). There are definite flaws in the storytelling (particularly the lack of an investigation after one D'Ascoyne is killed by an exploding jar of caviar). Still, it's a ticklish affair, with an ironic third-act twist and a terrific finish. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun, a highly entertaining 'Ealing comedy'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years after his mother is disowned by her family for marrying a poor Italian opera singer. Her son (Dennis Price) goes about killing his aristocratic relatives one by one in order to become the Duke of D'Ascoyne.I found this greatly entertaining and a truly satisfying film with a host of quirky character, 8 of which were played by Alec Guinness, and a superb performance in the lead role by Dennis Price.I always enjoy watching Ealing comedies, and even though this was'nt that funny, it had a gentle and more innocent humor than what we contemporary audiences are used to today. The story was very well constructed and came to a fully satisfying ending.In addition it was interesting to delve into a snippet of English film-making of a by gone age. It seems almost worlds apart to what we are used to in modern movies. Without wanting to sound old fashioned, here was a film that did'nt use extreme violence, swearing etc etc to appeal to the audience it just had a simple and well constructed story, great character acting and a fine pace to it.I think it is a treasure of a film, highly watchable and entertaining to all types of audiences if they are willing to give it a go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films I ever saw!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is still more evidence of the brilliance of Alec Guiness's acting ability. The characters in this film seem to speak volumes about the "English" way of life, or at least the perceived ways, of aloofness and eccentricity. The "stiff upper lip" and "Good show, chaps" attitude of the English is shown in the excellence of the acting. The role taken by Guiness in "The Bridge On The River Kwai" as the officer-in-charge is similar in many respects. The absurdity of behaviour in exceptional circumstances seems to be restricted purely to the English; the Americans could never get away with playing similar roles. This film should really be among the classics and I would recommend it to anyone. Being English myself, I feel a certain pride that films of this caliber are now returning to the world's attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Couldn't disagree more--much better than The Ladykillers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw both movies back to back, and I was disappointed in The Ladykillers. While it was good, I thought it relied far too heavily on slapstick. Kind Hearts and Coronets is chocked full of hilarious satire and wit. It moves along nicely, is extremely well acted, and has a great script. Little moments such as the introduction of the suffragette D'Ascoyne, Mezzini's reaction to the news of Lionel asking for a divorce, and countless others may not evoke any belly laughs, but they are priceless. The social satire is so stinging, that I often did laugh out loud a second or two after the subtle jokes. And, of course, Alec Guinness is amazing. At times I forgot it was Alec Guinness. His eight characters are each distinct and hilarious in themselves. This is one of my favorite movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A word of praise for Dennis Price.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Alec Guinness justly deserves rave reviews for his eight brilliant characterizations in "Kind Hearts," one must not overlook the brilliant performance of the lead, Dennis Price, one of the great character actors of the period. Price, a genuine war hero in World War II, had a career that lasted for nearly 30 years, during which he played comic and serious roles with consummate skill. No one could portray the arch, sophisticated rogue better than Price, as is evident not only in "Kind Hearts" but in another of my favorite comedies of the period "The Naked Truth" (1957, where he plays the elegant but sleazy tabloid editor/blackmailer, opposite the likes of Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, and Peggy Mount. He was very funny in a small role as the "gentleman con man" in Sellers' great hit of 1962, "The Wrong Arm of the Law." And for dramatic intensity one can point to his role of Major Charlie Scott in the gripping regimental drama, "The Tunes of Glory." (1960). So three cheers for Price as that charming rogue, "Louis Mazzini," in "Kind Hearts and Coronets."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect black comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie ranks as one of my personal top 10 favourite films of all time. Alec Guinness gives a wonderful performance, playing all 8 members of the d'Ascoigne family, murdered by Dennis Price as the black sheep claimant to the ducal title. The writing is incredibly witty throughout, making full use of classic English understatement. One of my favourites is of Guinness as a boring army general, perpetually replaying his battles at his club. As he is brought a jar of caviar he stops his recitation to remark, "Used to get a lot of this stuff in the Crimea. One thing the Russkies do really well." Whereupon he sticks a knife in the jar and a bomb hidden inside blows him to smithereens. The writers assume the viewer will realize that historically, bombs were the other thing the Russkies used to do really well, but I begin to wonder if young viewers today, with less knowledge of history, would get the full flavour of the joke.Dennis Price has a difficult task facing off against Guinness in so many scenes, but he does a fine job. His voice, reciting the history of his terrible crimes against his own family, is smooth and untroubled throughout, blandly describing the unfortunate death of each d'Ascoigne, and even a few bystanders. When his first murder takes place, he also kills off a young lady with whom the snobby Ascoigne d'Ascoigne is having a dirty weekend: "I was sorry about the girl, but I consoled myself with the thought that she had presumably already undergone 'a fate worse than death.'" Such an elegant way of using the old expression that meant "to lose one's virginity outside marriage", and such a wickedly funny way of excusing the inexcusable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cold, delicious dish of revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kind Hearts and Coronets" is a truly remarkable dark comedy that not only boasts a legendary eight part performance by Sir Alec Guinness, but explores a plot that we idealistic Westerners would never dare touch. This film dares to address a widely ignored fact: that adversity does not always make us stronger, better people, but can make us petty, vindictive, bitter, and completely devoid of basic morals.Our film's antihero is verbose, narcissistic Louis Manzzini (Dennis Price), who is awaiting his own execution for the murders of eight members of the d'Ascoyne family. That's the "what" of the story? the "who" and "why" are revealed as the Manzzini, ever the egotist, jots down his memoirs in his jail cell. Manzzini's mother, it is revealed, was once part of the d'Ascoyne family but was disowned for marrying beneath her class (to a tenor, no less!). As a result, she is forced to raise Louis in poverty and never lets him forget her misfortune. Louis's frustrations in life come to a head when his mother dies and his true love Sibella, a smarmy gold digger, dumps him for a dull but wealthy beau. When Louis discovers he's technically ninth in line for the title of Duke d'Ascoyne, he schemes to kill off each successor one by one until he gets what's rightfully his (his job is made a little easier when one dies from illness). That's where Sir Alec Guinness comes in. In a chameleon-like performance that puts Peter Sellers's in "Dr. Strangelove" to shame, he plays all eight of Louis's victims, including a fisherman, a photographer, and even a feminist (in which he bears a startling resemblance to Susan B. Anthony). When Louis murders the photographer (by planting explosives in his darkroom), he perversely woos his widow, the lovely and morally upright Edith (Valerie Hobson). Louis is so cool and calculating that it comes as no surprise when he gets what he wants. What he doesn't count on, though, is an unpleasant hindrance known as karma? What a deliciously dark comedy this is! Price really walks a fine line with Louis. You hate him for being such loathsome, shortsighted, murderous mama's boy. One even hates Louis's mother for instilling his appalling sense of entitlement with her self indulgent, woe-is-me attitude toward their situation. At the same time you have to admire his witticisms and his carefully plotted murders. They range from simplistic (trapping an avid hunter in a bear trap and shooting him) to hilarious (one is riding a hot air balloon and Louis nonchalantly shoots an arrow at it, causing it to plummet). There's also no contrivance where Louis sees the light or is transformed by the love of a good woman. You don't buy his romance with Edith for a second: you know she's both the rebound girl for Sibella and a trophy for his killing. I won't give away too much, but Louis does get exactly what he deserves, just not in the way you'd expect.One of the greatest films of all time, this is the twisted tale of how revenge isn't just a dish best served cold, as Louis points out, but sprinkled with arsenic.</fullReview>

Alec Guiness, "The Bridge on the River Kwai",'57,wants very much to become a Duke and manages to find a solution to his problem, he takes on the personalities of many people and spins a web all around his victims and has a great time trying to get away with murder. Joan Greenwood, "Mysterious Island",'61, teases Alec Guiness every chance she gets and really has the hots for him in no uncertain terms. If you want to see a really good classic film, don't miss this film whenever you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style And Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Britsh Cinema has, of late, been one of substance - it tells the story, but it lacks any sense of style, it lacks anything you could describe as 'cinema'. Sure, it tells the story, often sticking like glue to the novel or play on which it was based - but it's frightfully dull, it's screenplays must read like a novel - whereas American and indeed French film manages to make the big leap and express itself as something which could only ever be film. Even trashy movies from the world over know that they're movies and play by the rules dictacted to the genre. "Kind Hearts &amp; Coronets" is something else. Back in '49, Ealing made something that stands up to today's criteria - why, it really could be made by one of the Andersons (Was or Paul Thomas) or the Coens. It starts with flashbacks within flashbacks and moves on, or backwards, telling a story that is pure cinema with a deadpan narration in the very modern style. Price is brilliant as the central, amoral angel of death, Guinness good in parts - his vicar is equal to the best of anti-establishment genius Peter Cook's judges (or once again vicar in 'The Princess Bride'), and Joan Greenwood breathtaking as the heartless, calculating middle-class gal with aspirations - and yes, she and Price *really* do deserve each other.It's a pleasure throughout and surely a high water mark in British cinema - because for a change it *is* cinema. The Brits make bad movies, this is an exceptional exception.</fullReview>

It's well-acted by Price,Guinness who plays the eight victims, Hobson and all the others. I loved many features of the film eg. the cool way Price carries on his conversation in the garden after watching his bomb blow up one of Guinness's characters; his matter-of-fact comments (James Bond style?) after he commits the murders; the twist at the end.

		<fullReview>If life gives you lemons, make lemonade. We like Mazzini, we can empathize with him and admire his man-of-action philosophy. Instead of being mired in woe, poor orphaned Louis takes control of his destiny and shapes it just the way he wants it, sort of Clouseau-like, less the slapstick. I saw it on late night TV and it looked interesting so I taped it. Little did I know I had stumbled onto a gem...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old fashioned light sadistic comedy at it's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that the only reason I was interested in watching this movie was that I heard Sir Alec was in it. I was pleasantly surprised to find it a movie fully of light and ever-so-graceful wit and charm, while at the same time being one of the most stomach-turning and disturbing displays of human sadism I have recently seen. The end was left rather ambiguous, something which is both a blessing and a curse, as you want to find out what happens to our protagonist; but you don't want to be dissapointed by a simplistic ending. All of the acting in this film is simply splendid, with the notable example of Sir Alec, whose role in this movie I will not spoil for those of you who have not read his credit yet. I will say that I spent the entire movie wondering whether or not Sir Alec was in this picture, without his delightful voice I probably never would have figured it out. All in all, a must-see for Guiness fans, and a real treat for those who enjoy black comeddy in the tradition of the british cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A masterpiece even today. I only watched this film a couple of hours ago and i felt compelled to write a few lines about it. Firstly as many have said before Alec Guiness is brilliant in the many roles he takes but for me the real star is Joan Greenwood as Sibilla. This film has to rank up there as one of the finest English films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of British film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best from the Ealing studios. I watched the film after reading two volumes from Sir Alec's autobiographical diaries. This is British cinema at its best. Now that there are attempts at reviving the Ealing studios again, one hopes that at least some of the magic seen in this film will be recaptured.Alec Guinness' performance is a tour de force. There are many touted as being great actors today, but very few of them can pull of playing eight different types of people in the same film. Entirely convincing as an old woman, a dyspeptic lord, a pleasant young man. Guinness was indeed a master. He had the knack of becoming the part he was playing, so that one forgot that one was watching Alec Guinness.The plot is fairly straightforward and moves at the right pace, with never a boring moment. The camera work is similarly exact, with the gloom of London houses and the emptiness of old manors coming through quite well. Most of the film is shot indoors, and it is remarkable that the scenes are as one would imagine them to be. A classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quaintly Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kind Hearts and Coronets is such a classic film, that I am compelled to furnish a small review to fill the astonishing current void in the annals of the IMDB."Kind Hearts ... " is a tale of serial murder interwoven with English manners. The comedy is all the blacker because each ghastly crime is quaintly executed with a self-mocking delicacy.The performances are exquisite - Joan Greenwood's darkly seductive Sibella makes audiences fully understand why the hero is led astray. The dialogue both aspires to poetry and is the very definition of wit. As with the plays of Wilde and Shaw, the comedy does not date. The film's structure is as Byzantine and elegant as the murders themselves.The integrity of the drama almost causes us to miss the tour-de-force eight role performance of Alec Guiness forging a gem-like collection of bitter-sweet satires on the English character.Historically, the film is one of the series of quality comedies emerging from the British Ealing Studios. However, in true character it is unlike all the others, possessing the one-off quality of genius. It appears to juggles irreconcilable contradictions. It is a comedy with an outrageous plot; yet the drama is compelling and credible. It is a stagey production, based on mannered dialogue; yet it is a genuine classic of pure cinematic.This film is one of the few I can watch again and again - in the way I can listen repeatedly to musical perfection. It is chronically undervalued (except by all who have seen it) both in its country of origin and especially in the rest of the world.David John Johnston</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the rare movie that had me smiling all the way through. Alec Guiness and Dennis Price were equally great as the victims and the plotter respectively. Comedy doesn't get any better than this and the manner in which every move is made makes this the near perfect movie. It makes you wonder what is currently passed for clever would have been considered in the day of Kind Hearts and Coronets. As an Ealing Studio neophyte, I feel I have a lot of catching up to do and for those of you who want to get started at it, this is the perfect place. Wicked in every phase with the mannerly banter disguising the story's events, you have to appreciate the intelligence involved. My vote on IMDB gets a 10. Oh, and by the way, the ending is one of the best ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly endorse the discernment of those commentators who draw particular attention to the performance, in this diabolically urbane comedy, of Dennis Price, so often ignored in our wonder at the Guinness eight-part tour de force. Sir (not then, but later!) Alec pulls off a masterly stunt, but Price sustains an immaculate, imperturbable through-performance that is the making of the film; a particular kind of actorly security is required to bring off this kind of suave irony. The Longfellow parody is defining: we see the Suffragette Guinness beginning a balloon-ascent in favour of Votes for Women; cut to Price, kneeling by an apartment window, drawing a longbow.Price: (voice over) "I shot an arrow into the air."Cut to an airsick Suffragette in the basket of a balloon in trouble.Voice over: "She fell to earth in Berkely Square."The infallible Miles Malleson and coolly regal Valerie Hobson also deserve mention; of the delicious Joan Greenwood I hardly dare to speak, lest the tremble in my voice betray me.</fullReview>

Dennis Price plays a man forced out of his inheritance by his rich and arrogant relatives and sets about murdering them whom are all played by Alec Guinness, until he is in line to inherit the fortune. This is stiff upper lipped Ealing comedy in all its glory and a superbly witty script with several twists to it make for a wonderfully enjoyable hour and a half. Price is excellent, as the calm, would be heir, but its Guinness who you'll remember in an early screen, putting on a spiffing show in all 7 roles.

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully droll script delivered with two (ten?) great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sitting in his cell with an 8am death sentence awaiting him, Louis Mazzini decides to write his story to last after he is gone. His story starts with his mother marrying outside of her class by going with an Italian singer (who dies on Louis' birth). With her money all gone, Mrs Mazzini decides to appeal to her relatives in the D'Ascoyne family ? who reject her without reply. With her birthright denied she schools her son in her family tree in the hope that he will someday gain his inheritance. When she dies suddenly, her only wish is to be buried in the family plot ? a wish that is denied, enraging Louis. Selecting the living members of the D'Ascoyne family, Louis decides to kill them one by one in revenge.It is a shame that this film has slowly started to be lost to modern audiences and is not as highly regarded by younger viewers as it is by older ones (look at the voting history for IMDb ? not proof but an indication). The reason for this in my mind is that this is not a rip-roaringly hilarious comedy that will have you rolling in the aisles but one that is dark, clever and wonderfully droll. The script is dripping in humour but it is the drip of bile and blood ? a very cruel humour that is as deadly as an assassin. The plot is pretty simple and it's main thrust works very well. The only bum note is Louis' relationship with Sibella, which serves to slow the film down a little bit and take away from the slick pace that it manages to have for most of it's scenes. For audiences who expect a comedy to have them laughing every 30 seconds, this film will be an enigma ? where are the laughs they will shout, where is the comedy? It is likely that those that would say this would be unlikely to come to such an 'old' film but it is sad that they will likely not have the patience to see the beauty in the film. To me the humour of the film seeps from every pore ? it is in the droll dialogue and in the absurdities of the characters.Of course this film would not have been so good were it not for two fantastic performances from two actors who totally 'got' the film's sense of humour and deliver their characters absolutely spot on to make the humour work. Although he is naturally overlooked in favour of his co-star, Price is great (and also plays more than one character). He has to carry the less showy side of the film (ie his plot with Sibella) but his delivery is great both in performance and in his droll narration. He could have played it up for laughs but, as I say, he understood the humour and delivered accordingly. Guinness is simply brilliant. Some of his roles are very small (the Admiral for example) and others are rather ordinary but others are wonderfully absurd and he delivers them perfectly. His Parson is my favourite character as he is the most obviously absurd and enjoyable. His delivery of them all is great ? very different characters even if most of them do look unmistakably like Guinness himself.Overall this is a marvelously classy film that will still be a great film no matter how much the tastes of a modern audience plummet below the patience that the film requires to enjoy it. The script is darkly humorous ? dripping in dark humour throughout (albeit with few actual laugh-out-loud moments). The two leads are wonderful and their performances show a real understanding of the film's aims. It is sad that this is not shown more on television ? a fact that may be due to the use of the n-word several times in the final 10 minutes rather than anything else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It is so difficult to make a neat job of killing people with whom one is not on friendly terms."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS is very tasty and satirical film. I will not be so much heed to the black humor, which is certainly present. I will describe as mentioned skilled British satire. Well, the film's main protagonist is a murderer. The secondary protagonist is each of the eight victims.Alec Guinness as eight members of the D'Ascoyne family: Ethelred "the Duke", Lord Ascoyne "the Banker", Reverend Lord Henry "the Parson", General Lord Rufus "the General", Admiral Lord Horatio "the Admiral", Young Ascoyne, Young Henry and Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne. He also plays the seventh duke in brief flashback sequences to Mama's youth. I do not want all the credit rewrite to him. Performance is unusual. Some roles are short, but they are quite impressive.The dialogues are perfect, in every moment you expect a gruesome joke. Impoverished and humiliated young man kills all your relatives (almost all), so that inherited wealth and the ducal title. There is a reason. However, the killings are so clumsy and humorous, and therefore the reason it sounds frivolous. This film for general wonder lack inspiration. I'll explain. I do not think anything bad. This movie can serve as an inspiration with with anything. After the film, remains a void in which extinguishes a slight smile. The narrative is a constant, monotonous and reminiscent of the confession.It is interesting how everything works with elegantly and flawlessly. Often you can fall into the trap and think that all of this is true.Dennis Price as Louis Mazzini is a young man, who made a entertains scheme of his own kills. Dennis Price in this role seems quite skillfully. His play with women is much more interesting. After all, can continue indefinitely.The story can be seen as a kind of contempt for the society in which they are pranks, lies and kills some kind of justification. However, great humor and satirical performances give the film a completely different picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle humour but maybe too subtle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kind Hearts and Coronets is funnier in concept than in execution. I can think of things from it and laugh at the idea but thinking of the scenes doesn't make me laugh. It leaves me confused. I found the movie a bit slow and boring. Perhaps I need to know more about England, literature and class systems to properly appreciate it. Some humour may have gone over my head. But good comedy should transcend barriers, it should speak to every keen audience member. And it should fire on all cylinders if possible. This Is Spinal Tap has funny dialogue, sight gags, a mockumentary style, funny gestures and facial expressions, everything. But this movie seems to depend almost solely on words with only a handful of visual gags.Alec Guinness doesn't get to do a whole lot. Mostly he wears various costumes and sits and talks like an old man or says nothing at all. It's an acting job that many would be capable of. Why not make better use of him? Dennis Price is too plain and calm for my liking. I found this to make him forgettable and uninteresting. He doesn't seem to feel anything. I get that there is subtlety but then it should be witty or ironic the whole way through. The problem is that half of the lines aren't funny at all and we're left with too many dull moments. There is no drama or romance to speak of so why not go all the way with the comedy? It's confusing. I spent scenes trying to find the humour and couldn't. What are those scenes there for?A handful of parts were hilarious. Price puts gasoline in a photographer's camera. Eventually the photographer goes off to develop the film. We hear an off-screen "boom" and then smoke slowly rises in the distance. The characters barely notice but eventually Price goes to investigate. "Needless to say, it was too late." One character he wishes to execute is in jail. So he helps petition for her release. He expresses his gladness when another one of his targets dies. He somewhat liked them and is now relieved from the duty of murdering them. A captain of a ship confuses the sea terms for left and right and gives instructions that lead to an easily avoidable crash with another ship. Both sink and everyone comfortably survives except for the captain - he stubbornly chooses to go down with his ship. The image of him saluting as he goes down is hysterical.I can see what Kind Hearts and Coronets is trying to do. But that's the problem - I should love this movie. I love sarcasm and irony and subtle wit and juxtaposition. The idea of a gentleman planning the vaguely justified murder of a series of rich relatives (played by one actor) and then running into numerous little difficulties is appealing. But this movie feels a bit too slow and pretentious for my liking. It presumes our attention rather than working for it. Not all of the jokes are great and I think most could be done more effectively. Too many scenes are unnecessary and waste time. They don't build tension or develop important plot points.I definitely need to give this another viewing at some later date, perhaps after becoming more familiar with Ealing movies and British humour in general. But I also have to trust my current judgement and say that aside from an overall mildly amusing undercurrent and some laugh out loud moments, Kind Hearts and Coronets is quite plain and underwhelming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another delightful black comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...from the studio who brought you THE LADYKILLERS. KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS is an even more inventive piece in which a man obsessed with his family history decides to kill off rival members of his extended family in order to claim the inheritance for himself. This is a crisply-shot period piece that benefits hugely from a blacker-than-black performance from Dennis Price as the ice cold murderer working his way through a large list.Despite the grim subject matter, KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS is never less than funny, and there's plenty of original material here too. It's best remembered today for featuring numerous performances from Alec Guinness playing no less than eight members of the same family (females too). Guinness is clearly having a ball and the resultant film is a lot of fun to watch, although tame by modern standards. Watch out for a few familiar faces lower in the cast list: a delightfully dry Miles Malleson, plus Hugh Griffiths; Valerie Hobson (BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN) is the love interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you look up the Great Droll British Satire in the dictionary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things I noticed on my first watch of Robert Hamer's Kind Hearts and Coronets (from the studio that later brought you The Ladykillers), is that it aims and achieves for much more than it could have. This could have been just a silly comedy about an ambitious man trying to reach his way to the top of the Duke-dom - specifically with the D'Ascoyne family, all played by Alec Guinness by the way - and it might have some edge to it but would be more about the funny make-up and outfits that Guinness puts on. But what makes it more is that there is a real film here, and attention is paid to supporting characters - especially the women, and another man named Lionel who will prove to be a big part of the plot - and it has the underlying air of a film noir: a criminal, the dames in his life, and narration leading the viewer along on the way.At the same time, Kind Hearts is a raucous satire of the upper class and nobility, and what it means to have privilege and status in society. Dennis Price plays Louis as a man who is nearly always with the utmost, upright character. He may be half Italian and half the son of an Italian singer (who, as we learn, dropped dead of a heart attack before he really knew him), but everything in his actions as he goes one by one in killing most of the D'Ascoynes is that of a complete gentlemen. If he wasn't so fervent about rising to the top in his calculating and homicidal manner, he might make for a great (if strict) teacher of manners for school-boys... which is part of the point: this is a society that prides manners, good speaking, poise, fashionable dress, and even Price's accent is just right. If he had the bad luck of being raised Cockney, he'd never make it through the front door of the Duke's home.Guinness is a performer-genius, and this is one of the films that shows that with riotous effect. Some of the characters may not even get much screen time, like the Admiral who goes down with the ship by going Port instead of Starbord (not one of Louis' victims, but what a way to go), or the Lady D'Ascoyne, who meets maybe the funniest end as she flies over the people promoting Women's rights in a hot air balloon (it shouldn't be funny, promoting women's rights, but when it's Guinness in a dress waving to the public, I'm sorry, I lost it). Maybe my favorite of his creations is the religious man, The Parson, who is one of the older figures, slow and yet loving to ramble and drag things along about the D'Ascoyne legacy in the church he works at, and watch as he is under no impression of fakery listening to Louis reciting some obscure language. Guinness may not look like it, but he's having the time of his life with these roles, going so far as to change his height when necessary, and it's surprising to see what he'll show up as next.In the more straightforward part of the story, this too is solid and goes along with the satirical part, if a little more leaning towards a conventional story. There's the two women in his life - one of them, a D'Ascoyne wife (soon to be ex), is actually admirable and attractive to Louis. It's interesting to see how our (anti)hero sees other people and actually does have respect for them (the one member of the family who dies of stroke he admits "glad" to have not had to kill), perhaps because they share the same upstanding manner of him, or have a sense of dignity in his warped perspective. Hobson is Edith, the (ex)D'Ascoyne, and is a pleasure to see on screen opposite Louis. The other woman is one who fancies him more than he does her, Sibella (Greenwood), maybe more of the 'femme fatale' of the story. She may have some level of dignity, but it's below Louis' standards, whatever those they may be. How she comes around at the end, however, is one of the more clever twists in all movies. I mean, ever.So much of Kind Hearts and Coronets is based upon the droll manner that becomes English society, specifically the 'noble' class, or even those who may be closer to "working" like the Photographer who imbibes in secret in his development room. In some ways this would make a good double feature with Chaplin's Monsieur Verdoux, also about a murderous character we grow to kinda love while also about class, but perhaps an even better comparison is with The Rules of the Game by Renoir. Deep down this is cunning, savage work on how for centuries the British have seen themselves, and I have to think this could only be done, at least this way, from the UK. We all know Royalty gets it way too good, they're up at the top, so a movie like this is practically necessary - a beautiful, cynical, and a dastardly tonic for everyone not of royalty, and right after WW2 to boot (though, who knows, maybe they love it as well, if only in secret).A lot of this is funny, but even if it's not it's captivating stuff. Even the "Villain Monologue" trope is not only acceptable but riveting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delightful Black Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fancy seeing a black comedy that was released in the 40's, featuring Alec Guinness portraying eight different characters? Then 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' will definitely suit your taste. It's devilishly delicious from start to finish centering around Louis Mazzini (a cunning Dennis Price), the tenth Duke of Chalfont who awaits his death by hanging, which is to come by morning. Mazzini is convicted of murdering the eight heirs who stand before him in the line of accession to his family's wealth. The plot is simple, we explore this tale through Mazzini's memoirs which he writes before he is to be hanged. As we go further into his tale, troubles arise and his deceptively clever plan begins to unfold. Price is excellent in the leading role, but the largest praise must be extended toward Guinness, who plays all eight of the heirs. Yes. Both Genders. All ages. With the assistance of excellent make-up and alternate behaviors, Guinness delivers his best performance(s) in many seemingly hidden performances. But why? Why use the same actor for eight different road blocks in Mazzini's way? That's the beauty of it. His goal is the same, and he doesn't exactly see the heirs as "people" anymore. They're just goals, targets in his way, with the same figure at the center of them all. Hamer decided to use Alec Guiness as the figure, and what a fine choice it was!So I urge you to see Kind Hearts and Coronets. The film's use of violence is quite subtle, but oddly hilarious and it has aged quite nicely over the years, thanks to a dark and terrific screenplay written by Robert Hamer (the director) and John Dighton. "As in an Old Italian Proverb: Revenge is a dish which people of taste prefer to eat cold".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art! And the Art of Murder, without any of its Concomitant Crudities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the finest if not the finest British comedy of all time, only thoughtful and ironic not slapstick and in-your-face - as black as I like black comedy to get. The Ladykillers from the same team later provided more in the way of slapstick. I've just read the comments from some of the haters on here and found them most illuminating ? however kind words are more than criticisms in my case.A poor distant relation in a large rich family determines to get rid of all in the way of his succession to the family fortune by foul means. This involves the murder of eight Alec Guinness's which is taken to with gusto, and with some success. It was the urbane Dennis Price's finest performance, the one for which he'll be remembered, and coquettish Joan Greenwood played her heart out too. As for Guinness, his various performances have gone down in film history, although most of the collection were merely walk on parts. The plot and dialogue was incessantly erudite, witty and thought-provoking, the entire film sparkles with ingenuity. The attention to detail was total, and the elegant photography of it all by Douglas Slocombe was too. The American end version was interesting but unnecessary as the ultimate retribution was clear and clearly impending. The nword used was unnecessary but normal as part of the then popular children's rhyme and simply reflects back to us a time when white people could use that word unthinkingly; nowadays lovely premeditated obscenity and profanity is the accepted norm for all. The scheming Greenwood suggesting the possibility of the two dependent miracles to the scheming Price in the interview room are the money shots for me, it's the mesmerising logical culmination of the intelligent script.Imho it's almost perfect in every department and really beyond all criticism as completely in a league of its own as a unique work of Art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All-Time Classic Black Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS is one of those classics that never ages, even after repeated viewings. The rags-to-riches tale of Louis D'Ascoyne (Dennis Price), who ascends from lowly shop-worker to the dukedom through a series of brutal murders, is told in low-key fashion, as Louis spends his last night on earth prior to his execution. Price's soft-voiced, understated method of delivery makes the film sound as if murder is a normal occurrence; the kind of thing anyone might do if they wanted to acquire power. But this is director Robert Hamer's point; in an unequal world dedicated to privilege and high birth, even the most mild-mannered personality might be tempted to step the wrong side of the tracks.With consciously shadowy photography (by Douglas Slocombe) and ingenious set-designs (William Kelner), Hamer's film created a claustrophobic world, in which the lower middle classes (represented by Louis) are doomed to live in over-stuffed living-rooms and work in fusty shops, while the upper classes live in high ceilinged, paneled castles full of dusty furniture. No one, it seems, enjoys any real comfort. Hence the only way to survive is to adopt the "every person for themselves" philosophy, which is precisely what Louis decides to do. The film is very much of its time, released and shot in the post-war era, when aristocratic privilege seemed an anachronism, redolent of a bygone age.Price's performance contrasts starkly with that of Joan Greenwood's Sibella - whose honeyed tones suggest willing connivance in his schemes yet turn out to be nothing more than a facade. Like Louis, she is out for what she can get and will employ every stratagem at her disposal to achieve it.At the film's center stands Alec Guinness, in a virtuoso performance of eight different roles. Some of them are no more than cameos, but his portrayal of Young Henry as an open-hearted, basically kind person stands out in a corrupt world. Sadly Henry lacks the guile and the nous to survive, and he is soon dispatched to a better place, much to Louis' mock-regret.The film ends with a classic cameo by Arthur Lowe (later to become a household name in the television series DAD'S ARMY) as a reporter who unwittingly seals Louis' fate, proving beyond doubt that it's best to remain silent about one's past if one wants to survive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***While both reviews have spoilers, I recommend Felix-28 ("One of the Very Best", Felix-28 from Melbourne, Australia, 5 February 2006). Also, ackstasis ("It is so difficult to make a neat job of killing people with whom one is not on friendly terms", ackstasis from Australia, 27 March 2008).***"Kind Hearts and Coronets" (1949, Robert Hamer) is a masterpiece of black comedy. Set during the nineteenth century (i.e., the 1860s), it is one of the best acted, written and filmed comedies about murder and class relations ever made. This quintessentially British film is an exquisite pleasure, and make sure you watch it on the big screen.A poor but ambitious cousin of a family of royals takes on the project of removing all the obstacles preventing him from becoming the Duke. He is sentenced to hang only after being convicted of a murder he did not commit. While not (for me) laugh-out-loud funny, there is a great deal of dry wit on hand. Each cast member is superb. Joan Greenwood embellishes the vamp Sibella with her much-envied voice, which has been often compared to a cat's purring. Valerie Hobson (Edith), adds beauty, grace and poise. (I've become a real fan of hers, having also seen her as the Countess in "The Card", three weeks ago.) Miles Malleson, as the agreeable and respectful hangman, has his own cult following. However, the two male leads are amazing. Alec Guinness&#xfeff; famously plays the entire royal D'Ascoyne family comprised of eight (!) members. While each is doomed, Guinness portrays them all differently. Even though some of the D'Ascoynes have few lines and limited screen time, this is still an astonishing feat. Guinness (then 35 and largely unknown to the public) finds so many details with each character representing a wide spectrum of ages (i.e., 35-80) and both genders (Lady Agatha is the sole female) that thespians everywhere should be inspired. It has been said of Guinness that every role he has ever played is different than any other, and here he puts on an acting master class.In most movies, this would be enough. However, Dennis Price&#xfeff; as Louis, the smooth-talking, serial killer with aristocratic ambition is another character not soon forgotten. In his career performance, Price inhabits the role of Louis and is just as interesting as Guinness throughout. Price also portrays Louis's opera-singing father. I assume that Price is actually the tenor singing early. This fragment sounds great to my ears. The title is inspired by a poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#xfeff;. The screenplay is (by Robert Hamer and John Dighton) and is loosely-based on Roy Horniman's novel. The dialogue is very precise. The story has some unusual plot turns. I like how each murder is off-screen and accomplished in a different way. Visually, Hamer's direction is excellent. He uses the entire frame; and it is always interesting to see the background details. It is impossible to appreciate the skill with which "Coronets" is made without seeing it in a movie theater."Kind Hearts and Coronets" is a crowd-pleasing screen gem with legendary qualities. Once the concept of "comic serial killing" can be explained, it is kid-friendly, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alec Guinness gets to die eight times, playing a line of successors to a dukedom, in the Ealing black comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets. Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price) is ninth in line to inherit the dukedom from the aristocratic D'Ascoyne family. Louis vows to kill all eight people who stand between him and the duke's title. Aside from two cases of natural causes, Louis works through the list, eliminating rivals (all played by Guinness). Along the way he romances Sibella (Joan Greenwood), a childhood friend who ends up marrying a dullard, and Edith (Valerie Hobson), the beautiful widow of one of his victims with whom he plans to share his title. But just when Louis is ready to assume the D'Ascoyne mantle, a bizarre irony strikes. ~ Paul Brenner, Rovi</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Praises for Alec Guinness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts with Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price) the Duke of D'Ascoyne in prison on the verge of execution. Then the movie flashes back as he narrates his life story. He has always resented his mother's family who shunned her for running away with an Italian commoner. Her family even refuses to allow her to be buried in the family vault. As a young man, Sibella refuses his proposal of marriage to such a poor man. Then he is fired from his lowly job as a draper's assistant after an altercation with Ascoyne D'Ascoyne. He decides to take the title of the Duke of D'Ascoyne by killing all other heirs in front of him.The movie is best known for Alec Guinness who plays all the D'Ascoyne heirs, 8 characters in total. One of my pet peeves has always been overly long unnecessary narration. The problem here is the long low energy narration that acts as Louis' inner voice. It takes away all the tension. It is fascinating to see Alec Guinness play each character with personality. This is a vicious skewering of the English class system. Dennis Price does a fair job but I can't take the almost constant narration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Understandably a landmark comedy; this sort of deviousness would have been rare on the big screen in the late forties of the twentieth century, I assume. Alec Guiness plays a string of funny roles, Dennis Price is more than adequate as angry young man, and Joan Greenwood is just fabulous, period.The story of the bastard son who, much aided by circumstance and sheer luck, is thoroughly amusing in the black comedy way, even if it does become a long string of killings at some point. Then, near the end, some intrigue and twists make for a worthy finale.The best part of the whole is probably the writing; very British and understated, yet very eloquent, and very accurate in capturing the gist of all things, be it bitter, sweet, bittersweet, ironic, dark or other. A good reason for me to watch this one over and over, because I certainly did not catch all of it perfectly, not even this second time around.A good 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyable enough black comedy although the comedy elements are quite sparse and at most it raised an internal snigger just once or twice. Probably the funniest bit was the blowing up of one of the D'Ascoyne family in the shed/darkroom while Louis entertains the victims wife in the garden and after a quiet bang smoke starts to appear over one of the garden walls.I was looking forward to seeing Alec Guinness in eight roles but was disappointed in his performances which at best were average, although all of his characters made minor appearances.Dennis Price was very watchable but my favourite performance was John Penrose, playing the drunk Lionel at around 1 hour 10 minutes into the film.A very satisfying twist ending finishes off the film, with Louis being released from prison for the murder of Lionel (the only murder he didn't commit) on new evidence, only to remember he left his memoirs in his cell, admitting to killing eight members of the D'Ascoyne family. So, fairly decent film overall but probably unlikely to want to watch this one again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of England's great comedy classics, now a great Broadway musical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not seen this film in many years, I re-visited it after seeing the musical version based upon the original book, "A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder". Like this film version, the victims are all played by one man (film: Alec Guennis; stage: Jefferson Mays), and the leading character (Dennis Price in the film) is so suave and dapper that who could believe that he was really in the league of Tod Slaughter? Having been banished from his legacy of being part of a wealthy family because his mother married a commoner, Price seeks revenge in the most sinister of ways, and as a result, the body count increases. While the musical version utilizes farce to visualize the killings, the film is much more subtle in how it is done. In fact, you are hardly aware throughout most of the film that you are watching a comedy, and when you do laugh, they come out of irony rather than the silliness which makes the Broadway musical a genuine crowd pleaser.Alec Guennis could flip pancakes while reading the telephone book and make you laugh. Here, he's a variety of character, male and female, imperious and charming, yet each of them ends up with the same fate. Price makes his demon cousin so likable that you can't blame him for seeking at least some sort of retribution. There's no doubt in my mind that Guennis's one drag character certainly didn't look like a woman at all, yet there's poetry in the way Price dispatches of her, and there's irony in what finally catches the law up to him. British beauties Joan Greenwood and Valarie Hobson are both excellent eye candy and charmingly comic as they find themselves dragged into Price's web. Yes, the plot is certainly amoral, but when done with such droll charm and subtle sparkle through the eye of the killer, you can't help but find yourself mesmerized by the whole package.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Black Comedy That Works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many black comedies are supposed to be darkly humorous, but instead wind up merely being distasteful. This is an example of one that does it right.A woman of a British noble family is disowned because of whom she married. She has a son, and then dies, and the son is working as a store clerk. He is pushed over the edge when he has a run-in with one of his distant relatives and loses his job, and for revenge he ends up causing the relative a fatal boat accident that has the effect of embarrassing the relative after death. Then he gets the idea of wiping out the rest of his relatives until he can get the noble title himself, though in doing so, his intentions do not go unnoticed.Alec Guinness plays each relative, so it tends to soften the idea of their being murdered (you see the same person again and again), and the killings are done in clever ways, which has the same effect. Not that the murderer will necessarily get off scot-free; his machinations will come back to haunt him in the end, some way or other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly never has there been such a subtle but savage satire on the Upper Classes as in this delicious classic Ealing, the highlight must still be Alec Guinness doing what Peter Sellers accomplished in Dr Strangelove 16 years later - playing a vast array of caricatures, including women!The genteel pace, aided by lead character's Dennis Price informative narration, involves giving an almost poetic evenness to activities such as brass-rubbing in churches as to those of quietly murdering people. The schemes and methods of annihilating the gentry have to be admired in their cunning and resourcefulness.The plot is clever and witty and the writing even more so yet despite this, Kind Hearts can be enjoyed by all, from ages 0 to 110 - there will certainly be aspects that will appeal to all, whether highly educated, or not.This truly is essential Ealing and one of the finest films to have been British - and a rare 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuine genius is Sir Alec Guinness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best of the Ealing comedies. Alec Guinness plays eight different characters in this movie which has an equal amount of crime and comedy or rather 'Crime with Comedy'. Ascoyne murders and prays for the death of those who are ahead in the line to Dukedom, after his mother marries an Italian which makes his chances of becoming the Duke very slim. The movie begins with the Duke in prison, who is to be sent to the gallows the next day. The Duke narrates the movie as he pens his auto-biography. It is a wonderfully-written and brilliantly-acted movie in which every main character or the characters that the main character chooses to terminate are all played by one single man, Alec Guinness. The murders are carefully plotted and executed insidiously, the humor is sensible, timely and concurrent to the crime. The movie has its portion of 'twists and turns' and the way the movie culminates couldn't have been better. The movie may not be a laughter riot but the humor, i reiterate, is sensible, timely and concurrent to the crime. Whether the guards in the prison tighten the noose or cut the cuffs loose is for you to watch and know it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with Alexander Mackendrick's "The Ladykillers," "Kind Hearts and Coronets" came to epitomize Ealing comedies. There are no knee-slapping, slapstick moments that are so prevalent in contemporary comedies. No, the comedy in this masterpiece is all in the performances, the mannerisms and the language - the brilliant, understated humor that makes one appreciate fine writing.Alec Guinness has never been funnier. Multiple roles, each one hysterical. For those who appreciate clever writing and marvelous humor, this one is a must-see. I only hope that Hollywood keeps its hands off this film and does not remake it. The Coen Brothers already butchered "The Ladykillers." Let's hope they (and whoever else) don't even think about remaking "Kind Hearts and Coronets." They just don't make comedies like this anymore and the world of film is lesser because of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sweet revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody loves a good rebel. Movies like "Fight Club" and "Ocean's Eleven" are popular because they depict clever, marginalized heroes who take on "the man." But I'm not on board with this subversive formula unless the rebel is a very sympathetic protagonist; there's nothing worse than a movie that glorifies a criminal's behavior for no particular reason.Thankfully, "Kind Hearts and Coronets" features the most complex and compelling anti-hero I've ever seen - Louis Mazzini, a rebel with a cause. He sets out to avenge his mother's death by murdering every member of the noble family that wronged her. He's a wholly evil b**tard but I root for him anyway, because he's fighting snobbery and privilege, and because he's so smart that it's impossible not to admire him.It's amazing to see a movie this old pushing so many envelopes. There's innuendo aplenty in the scenes involving Louis and his lover Sibella, and some very "modern" black comedy related to the murders. There's a certain "nudge-nudge, wink-wink" quality to the humor that could be too coy for some viewers, but I find it hilarious.I'd be curious to see a remake, believe it or not, maybe involving an American taking on a powerful family like the Bushes...the issues involved are universal enough that such an update could work beautifully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For my American ears, it's the painstaking politeness that's most notable in this British comedy of manners. At times, Mazzini seems close to asking permission just to breathe among the wealthy and titled. In fact, I suspect that was a big attraction for many Brits (&amp; Americans), watching all those high-and-mighty D'Ascoyne's get bumped off in humorous fashion.The clever screenplay makes the most of Price's icy, clipped demeanor. In fact, looking back over the narrative, it's surprising how much Mazzini changes. At first, he's really sympathetic for being cut out of the snobbish family and watching his mother suffer as a result. But slowly, as he executes his vengeful scheme, he becomes more cold-blooded and even dislikable. This appears a neglected facet of the movie as a whole.What an inspiration having Guiness play all the D'Ascoyne offshoots. That way we avoid feeling guilty over each demise since it's so obviously tongue-in-cheek. On the other hand, I suspect the more realistic dispatch of the duke himself was done in order to emotionally justify Mazzini's eventual execution.Overall, the movie remains a marvel of astute craftsmanship, while Greenwood's coy little vixen remains a masterpiece of feminine amorality?and catch those dress-up hats deployed like battleships on her head. At the same time, her various transgressions go unpunished by movie's end, something unthinkable in American cinema of the time. Anyway, as a comedy, the film may be as brittle as they come. Nonetheless, it remains even 60-years later a brilliant one-of-a-kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Undoubtedly a classic of its era, "Kind Hearts and Coronets" may be unfortunately a difficult experience for modern viewers; though not a particularly long film, its relentlessly dry humour and wit acts as a double-edged sword, making it hard to sit through in one single viewing without growing a bit - dare I say it - bored. That is not to say that it's in any way a bad film, merely that it's a definite product of its time, with a slow pace and theatrical direction, dialogue and performances that may not be to everybody's tastes.However, if you give "Kind Hearts" a fair chance you'll uncover an absolutely superb story that has its decent share of plot twists and ironies. The script, though wordy, is magnificent and delivered impeccably by the actors, particularly by star and narrator Dennis Price who one suspects was born to read such lines. Price gives the standout performance of his career and it's a shame in a way that it's so often overshadowed by Alec Guinness' turn as the entire D'Ascoyne family, though of course Guinness is note-perfect and his achievement is startling. Joan Greenwood is also particularly noteworthy, proving that strong female characters on film were not an invention of later decades, and Greenwood was one of the best actresses we ever had.I must admit that "Kind Hearts and Coronets" is a film I admire more than I actively enjoy, though it has a great deal of merit and is well worth watching at least once. I fear, though, that it's a cinematic entry destined to always adorn "100 Best Movies" lists with fewer and fewer people having actually watched it. Perhaps it'd be worth updating for a modern audience - the only film that I think would benefit from a remake - so long as the essential charm and genteel elegance were retained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'I think I have married the most boring man in London. In England! In all of Europe!! &lt;Sibella&gt;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to look up this little British movie with the strange title, ranked very high on the all-time British movie list. I didn't have to look very far, my public library has the DVD, and a superb DVD it is. The picture is amazingly nice for a 50+ year old movie, and has an interesting 'extra' which chronicles the film career of Sir Alec Guinness, who early in his attemps was told, 'You'll never make it as an actor.' I watched it, fully expecting it to be overrated, as many other classic B&amp;W movies are, but boy was I in for a surprise. 'Kind Hearts and Coronets', a dark comedy of revenge and murder, is one of the better movies I've seen in recent months, regardless of age or genre. All the actors create memorable characters, but it is Guinness, playing all eight characters of the doomed D'Ascoyne family, from a naive 24-year-old to a minister in his 80s, plus one woman, that gives the most memorable performance. That alone would make this movie worth watching, but it is much more. Anyone who hasn't seen it yet should give it a try, a true classic comedy.The rest of my comments contain some SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS, please read no further, under penalty of possible disillusionment.The movie starts with Luis Mazzini in his prison cell, preparing to be executed the next morning at 8AM, and beginning to write his memoirs, in case anyone would want to read then. The movie is then told as a flashback. One potential D'Ascoyne heir to the Dukeship, a woman, married an Italian tenor who died young but left a son, Luis Mazzini, potential heir if everyone between him and the current Duke were to die. Angered when his mum died and her remains were denied burial in the D'Ascoyne family cemetary, he became obsessed with revenge. he had a plan, and a family tree pasted to the rear of a picture hanging on his bedroom wall. As heirs died, he would gleefully cross them off. Not to leave too much to chance, he decided that killing them off would be appropriate. Alec Guinness played each of the seven heirs to be eliminated, plus the Duke, each uniquely. The first came when the man and his sweetie were on a boat, tied, in a canal, Luis untied the boat right at 2PM, when the overflow would suck them over a dam to their death. The next, he bought photographic equipment to attract the photo buff, gained his confidence, substituted petrol for paraffin, and had tea with the wife as her husband burned to death in his darkroom. He had just killed his bosses son, then got a raise and new position, and also decided to court the deceased son's widow, the pretty and sophisticated Edith. Meanwhile, his first love had married someone who she later confided was the most boring man in all of Europe, so began sneaking to Luis's apartment for discrete affairs.The next D'Ascoyne to go down was the old minister, slipping poison into his sherry. Then, an arrow to the hot air ballon of Lady D'Ascoyne did her in. An Admiral went down with his ship, saving Luis the trouble of rubbing him out. To a General, he sent a bomb in the caviar. Then Luis' boss, a D'Ascoyne also, made Luis partner, then died shortly after, eliminating the need for another murder. Now only the Duke remained. In a visit there, he led the Duke into a 'man trap', then shot his with his own gun before running for help, claiming that an intruder run off earlier had returned.So, with everyone else gone, Luis Mazzini became rightful heir, had his coronation as Duke at the elegant castle, the widow Edith had finally accepted his proposal, and surely the spurned lover, Sibella, would cause trouble. Especially after her own husband Lionel, bankrupt, turned up dead after Luis, also his banker, refused to extend another loan. An uninvited guest at his coronation was from Scotland Yard, Luis was arrested for Lionel's murder. At trial, he was to his surprise found guilty, partly because Sibella testified that there was no suicide note. The spurned lover now had her revenge, and Luis who got away with six murders, now was destined to be executed for one that he did not commit. Lionel really did kill himself with the large knife to the chest.Sibella visited Luis the night before his scheduled execution. They spoke in 'code', about a possible miracle, maybe a suicide note would show up, maybe somehow Edith would die and Luis could then be reunited properly with Sibella. The next morning, as Luis is being led out of his cell, having written his complete memoirs overnight, explaining everything we see during the movie, a guard shows up hurrying to say, 'Wait, a suicide note was found, the execution is put on hold.' Shortly we see Luis exit the prison, a heavy metal gate closing behind him, a small crowd is cheering his release, and two carriages wait, to the right, his wife Edith, and to the left, his former lover Sibella. As his mind is working frantically to come up with the best solution, a reporter approaches him, 'Duke Mazzini, the newspaper wants to know if you will write your memoires?' Luis' expression changes, the view switches to the table in his recently vacated cell, his completed tell-all memoirs on the table, and he cannot get to them. All he can speak is, 'My memoirs!' THE END.</fullReview>

Guinness has nowhere nearly as much screen time as Dennis Price, who plays a vengeful family outcast who decides to murder the eight other family members standing between him and a dukeship. Though Guinness plays all eight of the doomed relatives, he doesn't get much time as any of them, and he doesn't give them the colorful characterizations I was expecting. The film is humorous at times, but quite slow and even rather boring at others. It's capped by a clever ending, but overall the movie is not the masterpiece it's been hyped up to be.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing that struck me about this movie - which was one of several Ealing Comedies that are currently being given away with a National newspaper - was its similarity to Sascha Guitry's Le Roman d'un tricheur; Guitry is writing his memoirs at a cafe table rather than a prison cell and one of the earliest is how he unwittingly wiped out his entire family, who ate poisoned mushrooms en masse after banishing him from the dining table as a punishment for some minor sin. Louis Mazzini (Denis Price) on the other hand sets out to eliminate the members of a family that stand between him and a title with the cold-blooded calculation of Richard, Duke of York - another work from which it borrows. On the whole it stands up reasonably well, much better than another recent giveaway, Brighton Rock, which has aged badly. It is replete with typically 'English' touches such as Miles Malleson's hangman enquiring in all seriousness of the prison governor (Clive Morton) how he (the hangman) should address the titled victim when they meet formally just prior to the execution and then, having been told 'Your Grace', walking away repeating this to himself complete with the pertinent obsequious gestures. Denis Price captures the right note, a blend of impeccable manners and ruthless cunning but most of the parts played by Alec Guiness lack diversity with nothing, for example, coming even close the complete unrecognisable quality he brought to Fagin within a year of shooting this one. On balance a very passable effort but one that may not stand up to repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only impediment to a man's ascent to Dukedom is about a dozen members of a royal family. So he offs them one by one in this dark comedy that sounds great on paper but falls short in execution. The fine cast includes Guinness playing eight members of the royal family. The potential for comedy is there but there are only sporadic chuckles, thanks to an uninspired and episodic script. The killings become rather tedious and the romantic subplot involving Price, Hobson, and Greenwood doesn't become interesting until the end, which is all too predictable. Still, the acting is good but otherwise this does not measure up to the other Ealing comedies of the period.</fullReview>

In this case we have one actor (not a great one) playing all the murdered people. We have a double blackmail plot and we have the gimmick that attracts me: The story is presented as a book that is read as it is written about past events. We see those events in a slightly comic telling.Then the movie ends. Except the hero walks away from the book which now will factor in the story that follows what we see, and we know it will be his undoing. There is nothing along the way other than this. It still is the case that the financiers of a movie will base the whole thing on a few gimmicks like this and assume that with moderate quality elsewhere it will pass. Comedy is particularly prone to this problem.The reason such a thing happens is not because how films are financed. I thought it would be thus, because financiers need a few phrases on which to bet the farm. But I discovered that the studios at least had people with pretty deep awareness of the whole composition and why it might work.No, I discovered, these gimmicks come from the shorthand used to coordinate all the players and the artistic team. Its what Spielberg calls the concept, sometimes the high concept. If you can say something about a movie in a few words, then that becomes the movie.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

For the first hour the tone is rather unfunny (It explains too much plot via narration) and some of Price's victims are rather nice people. Although I can imagine it plays differently in a movie house, for home viewing it's more of a curio. This is more like a slightly funny Romantic novel filmed (Imagine Great Expectations with more humor) rather than a rollicking black comedy. Dennis Price made me mindful of how few young, attractive British actors make it into their films. There seems to be some sort of system to insure that only average looking, doughy, phlegmatic men over 40 ascend.Guinness is funny even without too many lines. I wish the plot had encompassed the daily news' reaction to so many deaths in a single lineage. Surely, the trend would be noticed. This is my 3rd Joan Greenwood movie. I find her to be a rather annoying actress. For my money The Ruling Class is much, much funnier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw this "classic" and was hugely disappointed. The photography is excellent and some of the actors (Greenwood, Guinness, Price - in that order) are good, but there are two major problems. First, this is supposed to be a comedy but I smiled only once: when Louis, after several murders, reluctantly has to go hunting and tells the viewer that he disapproves of bloodsports because of his principles. Second, the story is just not interesting. This is mainly because there is not a single character whose fate I could care about. The victims are only caricatures, and Louis is such a bore that I soon kept hoping that they would hang him and get the film over with.This is not the first time a supposed Ealing classic has left me stone cold. I also found "Whisky Galore", "The Lavender Hill Mob" and "The Ladykillers" almost totally unfunny. I know that this could cause me to be refused to ever enter Britain again, but such is life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film is highly overrated on this site. Unlike the Lavendar Hill Mob or even Ladykillers this one isn't very humorous. Alec Guiness is in much less of the movie then I expected (especially since he is like 8 different characters). Several reviews found him to be "hilarious", but he is hardly that. I guess a few of the characters were funny, like the General but are hardly given enough screen time to do anything. There are lots of scenes with the main character courting one of the two ladies with absolutely nothing humorous going on. This isn't an awful film, and I kind of liked the story, but it could have been a lot better. They should have just done away with the pointless and unfunny romance scenes and lengethend the murders and given Guiness more screen time. If you want to see a funny Alec Guiness movie, I recommend the Lavendar Hill Mob.Zoopansick</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DISAPPOINTING EALING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is revered as one of the Ealing greats. So I have to say whilst enjoying, applauding and admiring it; it didn't quite live up to the hype. It takes ages to get going, will bring a smile rather than a chuckle.Is it perhaps Guiness' acting that deserves the merit? "The Ladykillers" it is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, am I ever on a different page for this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say I hated it, but I found it an extremely lame and tired attempt at wit. It tries so damned hard to be clever, but never succeeds. The biggest obstacle is the main character and the actor who plays him, Dennis Price. I can't think of a more boring protagonist in any film I've ever seen. He's so dull he almost put me to sleep. And the gimmick of multiple roles with Alec Guinness. It should have worked; I think Guinness could have done wonders with his eight parts. But no, his segments are so thinly written that all eight roles are imminently forgettable. I mean, the very funny picture of Guinness in a dress for the one female role he plays is completely squandered. Not only does Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne get a mere one minute on screen, she doesn't even get a single line! If it weren't enough that Alec Guinness is wasted eight times over, the wonderful Valerie Hobson is equally wasted. The sole performer who pulls off their role is Joan Greenwood, and even she's not great. I seriously cannot see how people find this movie worthwhile. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the clichs of the cheaper kind of fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kind Hearts and Coronets tells the story of Louis Matzini,a half Italian man whose mother was disowned and ostracized because she eloped with an Italian tenor.The movie starts with the last night before Louis is to be hanged.He writes his memories and he reads his story aloud( as voice-over) as we go along back in his life.His tenor father dies on the day of his birth.Just after the father's death the family is reduced to poverty because his mother's aristocratic family doesn't answer to her appeals for help.Louis' mother still hold out her hope that her son might inherit the dukedom title and can make a career instead of doing a menial job.After he loses his mum he loses the chance to use his genealogy then he takes a vow of revenge and plans to kill all the eight relatives ahead of him.(all played by Alec Guinness.)and he actually succeeds in killing six of them. During the time he realizes his insidious plans he has had two affairs--one with Sibella-the daughter of the family where he stayed after his mother's death and the aristocratic Edith D'Ascoyne, widow of another of his victims.Sibella (played by Joan Greenwood)is a typical femme-fatale who marries a different guy just because she thinks Louis has no prospects.She is selfish and self-serving mostly.The latter one Edith seems more like an affectionate and genteel lady but it's just like a surface value.She is just related with money and noblesse. To be honest I did not find the plot bad.But it's just full of lame acting and lame performances. At one point Louis shoots down Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne's(one of his victims) hot air balloon with an air balloon, while she is distributing suffragette leaflets over London. This is a very stupid and unrealistic scene.With a decent research and investigation they could have found who made it.You may say "oh come on this is a comedy"!But this is not how we are supposed to take comedy in real life. And how come Louis became such a sharp shooter?Plus I did not find the first river murder scene(where he dispatches the first D'Ascoyne over a weir) believable at all.You can find many more lame scenes which sound like plot-holes.Not the least but seeing eight performances by the same actor is not something I relish either. And hearing the voice-over from beginning to the end of the movie feels like you have been following an audio-book told from a cheap romance story. The movie does good when it makes a genteel mockery of the church and the judiciary system but that's it.There is nothing else you can see in this movie if you are looking for a really refined comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prize for most BORING MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this waste of time because of all the rave reviews it got regarding Sir Alec Guiness playing something like 10 parts. For all he did they may as well have taken 10 pictures of him in different make up and then put the movie camera on them. It would have been more exciting. There is no redeeming quality to this piece of crap. I'm well versed in all genres of movies from all countries and this is not a matter of the British dry humor. It's a matter of just plain boredom. My girlfriend still has not forgiven me for making her watch this. You don't care about any of the characters, you don't care about anything but the end and only that because it has FINALLY ended. I would have hit the stop button much earlier but my girlfriend for some perverse reason has to finish every movie NO MATTER HOW BAD IT IS! Then I get the blame for terrible cinema. Don't waste you time on this tragic waste celluloid. How any critic, person found this to be enjoyable is way beyond me. This is one movie that could have easily been destroyed by fire and the world would have been left a better place. Don't fall for any of the lies that praise this tribute to boredom.</fullReview>
