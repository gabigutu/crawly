		<shortDescription>One of the most fascinating documentaries about visionary film making; funny, charming and a must for Sci-Fi fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you love Sci-Fi films, you have to see this. Or no: If you love films you have to see this. Even better: If you love art in general, you absolutely have to see this. This documentary had me grinning at first and drop my jaw soon later; the grinning was induced by the witty, charming narration by Alejandro Jodorwsky himself (a natural born story teller, if there ever was one) ? the jaw dropping came by way of hearing the most incredible anecdotes about how one person got some of the most famous and daring pioneers of their respective arts to participate in one single project: Jodorowsky's 'Dune'.In 1975, Alejandro Jodorowsky got a group of "warriors" together to make the film version of Frank Herbert's 'Dune', and the way he did this (or the way he tells he did this) is so outright unbelievable and entertaining that it simply must be true (actually, there's an amazing story for another film right there). Can you imagine Salvador Dali, Orson Welles and Mick Jagger all starring in a Science-Fiction film scored by Pink Floyd? Watch this Documentary if you want to know how this - nearly - came about. Or did you know that Dan O'Bannon, Moebius, H.R. Giger and Chris Foss all made fantastic designs for a Science-Fiction film that was NOT 'Alien'? Watch this documentary If you like to know more.Telling the story of arguably the most influential Sci-Fi film never made, this documentary is a pleasure to behold and essential viewing for Sci-Fi geeks, film fans and lovers of art alike. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the only movie I watched twice at the True/False film festival in Columbia, Missouri in 2014. I am a fan of Frank Herbert's Dune and was pulled into the epic mythos of this 1970s film that never was.Although the story of this "failed" project is fascinating, it was Jodorowsky's passion and drive that made me pay to see this movie twice. This is an absolute must-see for sci-fi fans but should also be viewed by artists, writers, film makers, sculptures, dancers, foley artists or anyone who has creative passion.It is inspiring to see a man, albeit a near lunatic, with such vision, scope and ambition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dune We All Deserve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And we never got it. Due to Hollywood being shortsighted. I appreciate the Dune movies we have, but I know they barely scrape the surface. The Jodorowsky treatment would turn the movie world upside down.The storyboards themselves make Star Wars look like a movie about Leggos.I am sad that so many SciFi movies blatantly stole from it yet I am happy that portions live on in film.It is a horrendous crime, though, that this completely planned movie was torn in pieces to make money for many, while leaving this masterpiece raped and torn and left bloody after the studios cannibalized it.I can only hope, that, within my lifetime, I can see better Dune movies that encompass all the books. I am a Trekkie, but I know the Dune world is more vast and beats both Star Trek and Star Wars hands down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie Never Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary tells the story of director Alejandro Jodorowsky's unfinished masterpiece: his attempt to produce a film adaptation of Frank Herbert's sprawling science-fiction novel 'Dune' in the mid-1970s -- a project which was never completed, in part because it collapsed under the weight of the director's incredibly ambitious vision for the movie. It was to have been a larger-than-life epic, as grand as Stanley Kubrick's '2001.'All that survives of Jodorowsky's 'Dune' are the script, storyboards, and concept artwork. Using these, combined with talking-heads interviews of those involved, the documentary tries to show us how the finished film would have looked.What makes all this so captivating are the interviews with Jodorowsky himself, and his incredible passion as he recounts the tale of an unfinished project from 40 years ago. Entering into Jodorowsky's world is like falling into a visionary dream where anything and everything is possible. And as his vision progresses, it becomes more and more ambitious: Salvador Dal?, Mick Jagger, and Orson Welles agree to star. Dan O'Bannon and H.R. Giger will design the sets and costumes. Pink Floyd will provide the score. It's hard to imagine a more ambitious movie, considering the technical limitations of the time.Yet, as the documentary shows, the ripples from this never-completed, ahead-of-its-time film spread out in many directions, inspiring different ideas that made their way into later films such as 'Star Wars' and 'Alien' -- and which continue to inspire filmmakers today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most influential film never actually made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you love movies and/or eccentric characters, you simply must see "Jodorowsky's Dune." It's one of the best documentaries about the (un)making of a film I've ever seen. It's a terrific documentary and a thoroughly fascinating character study.It covers the story of a feature film that Alejandro Jodorowsky never made. He came close to making an adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel, Dune, before David Lynch did it in the 1980s. Jodorowsky was a very successful cult film director during the '70s and made films like El Topo, The Holy Mountain, and Santa Sangre. When you listen to Jodorowsky talk for this length of time, you come to understand how he got his films made: he simply hypnotized people! ;-)Although it was never actually made, Jodorowsky's sci-fi film went on to influence later sci-fi movies like "Alien," "Blade Runner," and even "Star Wars." And it also opened the door for the film careers of people like Dan O'Bannon, Jean Giraud, and H.R. Giger, who later worked on Ridley Scott's "Alien.""Jodorowsky's Dune" gets a big thumbs up from me! I highly recommend this documentary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A documentary about a mad visionary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary chronicles the exceptional history of the 70s movie version of Frank Hebert's Dune by Alejandro Jodorwosky, a film that was never actually made. It gives you a short filmography of Jodorowsky and then leads you through his vision of the movie he was going to make. However, Jodorowsky's Dune would not have been a movie version of Frank Herbert's novel, but rather a re-imagination of the basics of the book in the mind of an avantgarde director who himself said that he wanted to make movies for people who wanted to experience LSD, but didn't want to take the actual drug, and Jodorowsky acknowledges the former fact with the words: "I was raping Frank Herbert... but with love." People in this documentary keep saying that the film would have been ahead of its time. This may be true in some way. However, I am more confident in saying the following: It would have been one of the worst movies ever made. They show you Jodorowsky's finished costume designs and storyboards, and it looks intriguingly weird at best, and boastfully horrible at worst. The colors you will see are truly like an LSD trip. Some of Jodorowsky's crew went on to make Alien, and his costume design and color scheme (i.e. use all the colors there are) can be seen in Flash Gordon.Jodorowsky says that when he saw David Lynch's 1984 version of Dune, he was glad because the movie was so much more terrible than what he would have produced, even though he felt sorry for Lynch. Yet I believe that there is no way on earth that Lynch's movie could ever be worse than Jodorowsky's vision. Jodorowsky's film would have been a bastardization of Herbert's work for the sake of an attempt to, for lack of better words, "enlighten the world" according to Jodorowsky's own understanding.However, his casting choices were, admittedly, inspired: Mick Jagger as Feyd Rautha? Udo Kier as Piter De Vries? Hell yeah. His own son as Paul? Well, I don't know him, but Jodorowsky made him undergo rigorous physical training for 2 years before the movie was to go into production, and then it never did!The best scene in "Jodorowsky's Dune" is when the Chilean-French director rants about Hollywood film making and how money controls everything. Amazingly honest and true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MUST-SEE documentary for any movie buff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jodorowsky's June" (2013 release from France; 90 min.) brings the background story on what is referred to as possibly the greatest movie never made, the adaptation of the science fiction book "Dune" by "high are" director Alejandro Jodorowsky. As the documentary opens, we get a crash course of Jodorowsky's earlier work, including experimental theatre in Mexico in the early 60s and a couple of cult movie in the early 70s that did surprisingly well in Europe. So Jodorowsky gets the opportunity to assemble a team of "warriors", as he calls them, to make his vision of Dune into a visual reality. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, if you are a movie enthusiast, you are in for a finger-lickin' good time! Credit for that goes of course to director Frank Pavich, but let's be honest: he couldn't have had a more enjoyable subject than Alejandro Jodorowsky, who turns out to be a master story teller. The way he convinces people, one after another, to give their cooperation to the movie, is just priceless (one of the best stories involves the movie makers making a trip to London to ask Pink Floyd to provide the soundtrack--just watch!). Jodorowsky is now in his mid-80s but he looks about 20 or 30 years younger, and most importantly, he remains as feisty and as ambitious as ever. There is a nice soundtrack to the movie, by Kurt Stenzel (of the band SpacEKraft).I had seen the trailer for this movie a number of times in recent weeks, and this was for me once of the most anticipated releases so far in 2014. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, and I went to see it right away. The early evening screening I saw this at was very well attended, I'm happy to say. If you are in the mood for a top notch documentary that gives the spotlight to a creative genius who could've/should've brought Dune to the big screen the right way, by all means see this. "Jodorowsky's Dune" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning film about passion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've ever dreamed of making a movie, this story is the dream. Except, despite Chilean-French filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky's epic drive and commitment to make "Dune", the sci-fi novel by Frank Herbert, a reality, Hollywood could not bend to allow the film to go ahead.It's truly unbelievable that any of Jodo's dream becomes a reality in every way. Until, unfortunately, he dreams too big. And he blows it.But his legacy continues. Not only does Hollywood use his amazing team of artists, they use shot after shot from the bible he created. With interviews with director Nicolas Winding Refn and basically everyone involved in the project, the world of Jodo is laid bare - and it's a breathtaking sight.Director Frank Pavich simply lets Jodo talk - and that is what makes the documentary such a success. The piece also features amazing animations of Jodo's storyboards, that bring his version of "Dune" to the big screen at last - proving that his vision was indeed epic and beautiful.There is a sense of campaign here, in that "wouldn't it be great if someone would fund this movie now?" and Jodo quips how ripe it is for a feature-length animation. Let's hope this happens, because if it does, it would change the way we see art on the big screen forever. A stunning film about passion, obsession and life itself that has to be watched by anyone involved or with a love of filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another one for the film buffs! In the mid 70's Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowsky (best known for his trippy cult western El Topo and the mind bending The Holy Mountain) set out to make a film based on Frank Herbert's seminal classic, but long thought unfilmmable sci-fi novel Dune, even though he had never read it. Jodorwosky spent two years working on the design of his movie, only to find that the major Hollywood studios ultimately wanted no part of it, despite all his extensive preproduction work. Frank Pavich's fascinating documentary features an extended interview with Jodorowsky who talks about his epic vision for the project. Pavich spent three years interviewing Jodorwosky about the movie that never was. He wanted Pink Floyd, who had just released their Dark Side Of The Moon album, to do the music. He got British graphic artist Chris Foss to provides many of the key designs; graphic novelist Moebius to draw the elaborate storyboards; and Swiss artist H R Giger to contribute. He cast Salvador Dali, who, at $100,000 per minute for five minutes work would be considered the highest paid actor in Hollywood at that time, Mick Jagger, and Orson Welles in small but important roles. But even though the film was budgeted at $15 million, Hollywood studio executives balked at the project, and it is easy to see why they were suspicious of the flamboyant and idiosyncratic director. Eventually Dino De Laurentiis' daughter acquired the rights to the project and gave it to David Lynch (Eraserhead), but the film was ruined by studio interference. Even though Jodorwosky's ambitious Dune was never made, its fingerprints can still be seen in a number of sci-fi films that came afterwards, from Star Wars through to Alien, which had a number of the same creative people working on the production. Jodorowsky's Dune is not just another talking heads documentary, though, as there are plenty of illustrations of his epic and ambitious vision, as well as some film clips. And Jodorowsky candidly talks also about how a movie is a work of art, full of passion and intellect, a far cry from the rather bland and derivative blockbusters being regularly churned out by Hollywood studios. And he can't quite hide his joy when he talks about how awful Lynch's version of the film proved to be. This is an enthralling, entertaining and informative documentary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jodorowskys creative world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched that Dune documentary with Alejandro Jodorowsky what a creative man. I really like his motto if you fail its not important try anyway you need to try. Sadly he should have tamed his ego because that became the issue in the end having no compromise, no grey areas just black or white. He loved his concept but he was over passionate and everyday his mind was open. The director of this film achieved the purpose. To engage the audience fully in Jodorowskys world and leaving them with their own debate regarding Jodorowskys proposal for DuneIt attracted my interest even though Jodorowsky was like a wild horse of creativity, ideas let loose and quite rightly so he was against the system but overlooking he was in the system as a film-maker forgetting this and in the end it cost him his opportunities to have his film. That book of great work alongside the incredible talent from all who had supported him that too was his failing he was so involved in his own creation and ideas he forgot to find the importance too in the people and the methods and evaluations of all the others should be inclusive too for things to work in the end. Ultimately he himself was unable to compromise and had to see in the end it failed him. He never got his film although elements from the concept book eventually got made into a comic bookThe Hollywood magnate stole his ideas if only he could have calmed his ego He could have compromised and took on board others point of view. What a film that would have been even though it is on the dark side of science fiction. I'm glad he got the documentary made as this led to his reunion with his old friend and he helped influence others most of all. More importantly for him, he got all that creativity out his head as one mans dream needs to be out there physically.A genius before his time much to be learned from his actions tame the ego but do something anyway life is full of good things you just need to try to focus your energy rationally in areas where you can make things happenHow will your day be today?.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jordorowsky has been my favorite director for a long time although I knew little about him as a person. This movie made me really like him. Really inspiring movie. Back in the pre internet days when you wanted to find someone you had to go out and find them via an agent of just word of mouth. The people Jordorowsky enlists are insane: Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger, Pink Floyd, Orson Wells. I did not realize this project involved Dan O'bannon (RIP), his window gives a nice interview. Eventually he and HR Giger (RIP) go on to do Alien so everything works out for them. Moebius (RIP) is still one of the most under rated artists. Also a nice rant about money ruining the art of film by Jordo who sounds like he could have gotten green lighted if shortened it to 1.5 hours. Greatest film never made. Fantastic documentary, made me want to go out and direct. Such a positive and life affirming doc, if it had been me I would have been crushed, good to see he still has the fight in him. I highly recommend Dune.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about genius, obsession, and disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We saw this last week (April 2014). I wanted to go because I'd read Dune (many years ago); because I knew that the De Laurentiis version was pretty bad; and because I had no idea who this Jodorowsky is.The documentary starts by reviewing AJ's earlier films. To say that he was then a surrealist would not be an exaggeration. Then it takes up his plan to film Dune; it follows his efforts - successful - to get the best artists, technicians and actors to work on the film.On the list: Dan O'Bannon, H. R. Giger, Chris Foss, Mick Jagger, Pink Floyd, ....He wanted Orson Welles to play the Emperor. He tracked Welles down in Paris - eating at his favorite restaurant - and though he wasn't interested in doing any more movies, AJ promised him that if he took the job, AJ would hire the restaurant's chef and OW could eat as he wished. OW accepted.He wanted Salvador Dali for another role. SD wanted $100,000 an hour - so he could be the highest paid actor. AJ asked the script writer how long SD would be on screen - about 4 or 5 minutes, total. So AJ went back to SD and offered him $100,000 a minute.AJ is a fascinating, interesting, engaging, complex man - the kind that the world could use more of.The interviews with Giger, Foss, Dali, O'Bannon (we only hear audio clips - he died before the film was made) are fascinating (Giger is a bit older than the last time I saw his picture).In terms of a single-minded effort to realize a dream, it reminds me of another documentary, "Tim's Vermeer" (check IMDb). Tim Jenison takes 3 or 4 years of his life to show - by doing it himself - that Vermeer might have painted "The Music Lesson" using a form of optical projection. He goes as far as building a perfect replica of Vermeer's room - in his warehouse in Texas, learning to read Dutch, going to see the original in Buckingham Palace).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Epic That Never Was.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jodorowsky's Dune" was a documentary I've been meaning to watch, since I heard about it the previous year. Granted I knew nothing about it or its creator whatsoever. The buzz it created was definitely noticeable, and we've still yet to see a home release in the U.K. I generally love watching a few obscure documentaries here and there, due to the fact it's real life and when their put together right. The passion for the subject make them highly enjoyable to watch.For the first time, I hear of the name Alejandro Jodorowsky. A man now 86, whose passion for his work continues to shine. Regardless if the project got made or not, it's hands down utter charming. If I ever make it to 86, I surely hope I still have the energy and youthful bounce this man has in his step. Immediately I sought out his filmography and just to say whilst I'm still searching through them, "El Topo" (1970) is already somewhere in my Top 20 favourite movies. But alas, I apologise for this slight detour and now onto the review.The film chronicles Jodorowsky's efforts to adapt the legendary Frank Herbert novel "Dune", in the mid 1970's. Though Alejandro somewhat deviated from the original source material, both he &amp; Herbert had an "amicable" relationship. Jodorowsky then began assembling an Uber team of artists and special effects people, namely Jean Giraud (Moebius), Chris Foss, Dan O' Bannon &amp; H.R. Giger (In his first motion picture work). Next some very noticeable talent would be acting, such as Salvador Dali as the evil emperor, David Carradine, Mick Jagger and a funny story of how Orson Welles also became involved with the production.Assembling a phone book size document of storyboarding, costume and spaceship designs etc. Jodorowsky's sci-fi epic would've been some 14 hours long, and $2 million of a $9.5 million budget was already spent during the development. Unfortunately, though many production companies were enthusiastic with the project, they just didn't understand Jodorowsky's method of directing and decided against funding it. As you can imagine for anyone involved with a project so large that doesn't get made, it would leave you utterly distraught. The wonderful obscure aftermath is that Hollywood began using the team and ideas Jodorowsky assembled, and would go on to create almost every single science-fiction movie you love today.That's as much as I'll say, because I still highly recommend watching this documentary. It's very well conducted, and flows seamlessly throughout it many interviews and animated segments that help give a sense what the movie would have looked like. The documentary (I think) also contains the last interview H.R Giger did before his unexpected passing.Final Verdict: When all is said and done, Jodorowsky's efforts were not all in vain. Ridley Scott had also attempted and failed to make the movie after "Alien" (1979), and David Lynch's production is an outright failure. It's a fascinating story amongst many other shelved projects we'll probably never see. 8/10. It feels criminal it never happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well that has left me pining for this film to be made,even if its just an animated version which embodies the spirit of his vision. he's poured his heart and soul into trying to make dune become a reality and you could really see from his enthusiasm and his passion for this come through in this documentary as he explains fervently his creative ideas and processes. you also get a sense of how much it crushed him when the movie industry turned down his proposal and in his sons own words, slit the throat of the film. it was a tragedy this movie was never made, seeing lynch's version I can't help but feel its a lesser, more compromised film. jodorowsky said it himself , the film was not comparable. his idea was much more grandiose. more elaborate, more forward thinking, more exploratory, more visionary and artistic. it would have been a monumental piece of cinema,potentially more epic than star wars. the ideas and creativity that was buzzing in the conjuring up of this film went on to influence many major science fiction theatrical pieces of the proceeding years as the ideas proposed ended up spreading and filtering down to other blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overexcited and generous to Jodorowsky's eccentricity, but it eventually justifies its point.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In hindsight, it's surprising how small Alejandro Jodorowsky's filmography is. With only around half a dozen feature films to his name, most notably the astonishing The Holy Mountain and bizarre El Topo, he has quite a legacy for himself, but evidently not enough as he and director Frank Pavich are hungry for more credit. Granted, he does deserve it, but you can't help but feel that Pavich is being a bit too generous to Jodorowsky. He is certainly an eccentric character, one that's almost frustrating to listen for too long in English (not his native tongue). The documentary details the development of Jodorowsky's Dune, before David Lynch got his mitts on it, but it struggles to give a reason to care as deeply as Pavich does. These people are very passionate and worked very hard and that kind of creativity and ambition is admirable and infectious, but the documentary struggles to communicate why Dune is particularly important. It's like a constant buildup with little payoff, try as it might with crude animated portrayals of how a scene may have looked. However, that payoff does come for its last 10 minutes when it finally elaborates on the influence of Dune in cinematic history, though many of them may be reaching, but now I can't help looking. A lot less celebrity name drops would've made this a stronger documentary, but it's still fascinating to see the development of a piece of film history, something that's only justified near its end.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sycophantic, miserably off-target salute to yet another so-called "visionary"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Visionary" is the most misused term in film circles of late, thrown around by idiots who wouldn't know a D.W. Griffith film from a Warhol. Such is the fate of Alexandro (proper spelling) Jodorowsky, a darling of cultists.Unlike the particularly lame set of experts rounded up here (fan boys as film critics and untalented film directors Richard Stanley and Nicolas Winding Refn), I was a film buff in the '60s and '70s and properly placed Alexandro's work ("El Topo", "Fando &amp; Lis", "The Holy Mountain") in the context of his betters: Glauber Rocha from Brazil and the fabulous European surrealist Arrabal.Frank Pavich who directed this documentary fails to mention even in passing that "Fando and Lis" was adapted by AJ from a play by Arrabal. "Viva la Muerte!" by Arrabal was just as influential a midnight movie at the outset of the '70s as AJ's "El Topo", and all the art-house directors of that era owed plenty to the innovations of Rocha in a series of films from which "Antonio das Mortes" stood out, and would still be a reference point if folks did their homework. In covering AJ's work this documentary is incomplete and misleading. The most famous anecdote regarding "The Holy Mountain" concerns star Dennis Hopper going crazy during filming and leaving the set, forcing AJ to replace him. Nowhere is that level of historical research encountered here.Instead we have AJ pontificating, gesticulating, and basically acting the part of "the mad genius" for Pavich's camera. This routine, favored by Werner Herzog in recent decades gets old in a hurry and made watching "J's 'Dune" a real chore. I interviewed Terry Gilliam in 1981 in Manhattan on his promo junket for the release of "The Time Bandits" and he behaved in person one-on-one quite similar to the way Jodo acts here. Both men are so full of enthusiasm and passion concerning making movies that they literally seem about to blow a gasket at any moment. Both Jodorowsky and Gilliam have become famous over the years for the outlandishness (and scale) of their projects, and their becoming folk heroes by going Don Quixote-like up against the windmills/giants of the Film Establishment, i.e., the guys who hold the purse-strings.Much is made here of Hollywood's inability to see the power of AJ's meticulously (and permanently) enshrined shooting script that is bound in hardback the size of an unexpurgated Webster's dictionary. Both he and Gilliam seem to have a mental block against recognizing the difference between making a large-scale, say mature David Lean- scale, movie and writing the Great American Novel or crafting the ultimate Broadway Play. Self-appointed "visionaries" need not apply - only fools like Bob Guccione and his "most expensive porn film of all time" Caligula can do that. Artists like these should sensibly follow in the footsteps of avant-garde filmmakers, Maya Deren, Ed Emshwiller, Stan Brakhage and Stan Vanderbeek: create independent, no-budget, uncompromising underground cinema. Leave the $200,000,000 projects to hacks like Michael Bay.It was Dino De Laurentiis (along with Joseph E. Levine and Alexander Salkind) who initiated the era of big-budgets we currently live with: back when Dune by AJ was being worked on and shopped the entire film industry was functioning under very tight budgetary restrictions following the near-collapse of the studios in 1969: no film in the '70s was being green-lighted with a budget as high as $15,000,000, which Dune would entail.For the record, it was 1976 when Levine's "A Bridge Too Far", Dino's "King Kong" and Salkind's "Superman" were independently produced at much higher budgets, opening the floodgates. And not coincidentally it was Dino, through his daughter, who ended up producing the David Lynch flop of "Dune".So the doc's argument about AJ's war with stupid studio execs is completely off- base and ignorantly presented -their hands were tied at that time.Worse than that, the movie's implication about the power and influence of AJ's Dune, even without it being made, is 180 degrees off the mark. Sure, we see trotted out a who's who of ultra-creative talent that was working on preparing the movie: Giger, Moebius, O'Bannon, even hangers-on like Welles and Dali. Ridley Scott is rightly shown to be the chief recipient of the fruits of their labors -going from the promising art-house director of "The Duellists" to fame and fortune (via hiring AJ's technicians) with increasingly bigger- canvas epics like "Alien", "Blade Runner" and ultimately "Gladiator" and many others all of which not coincidentally resemble the '60s epics that sank Hollywood's fortunes and led to that moratorium on big-budget projects in the first place.The legacy of this unfinished film is not launching top technical and creative talent in a host of blockbusters but rather the industry's ongoing fascination with flashy, mindless crap, currently emblazoned by the application of 3-D (a tarnished medium from the early '50s) to so many pictures as well as fake IMAX (not using the IMAX photographic system) to market the junk.What Pavich presents as AJ's strengths are in fact his fatal flaws. Rounding up the top talent - it seems like he has the Midas touch in finding the best in each field, does not disguise the obvious fact that had he actually been able to make "Dune", AJ would be calling all the shots, like a Robert Rodriguez (writer/director/cameraman/editor). Evidence of this creeps into the doc with the segment dealing with Doug Trumbull, who is sloughed off as arrogant or not a team player when AJ rejects his participation out of hand, when in fact it is obvious that AJ is the arrogant s.o.b., not Doug.AJ would have a firmer and more legitimate place in film history had he remained independent and tackled smaller-scale films that expressed exactly what he wanted to say, a la the models of Jim Jarmusch or Woody Allen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this film is a fairly marvellous documentary, how it effects you is largely down to what you already know, and also what you remember of the 70s.I had heard rumours about an original attempt to create Dune (something similar happened to LotR) but didn't know it was an attempt by a mad Svengali who hired some of the greatest talent available.As the names were mentioned, my mouth started to drop open - was this a hoax? Why had I never heard of this? Did he really track down Orson Welles by searching for good restaurants in Paris? Was Jodorowsky a fantasist? The interviews they did get were fairly stellar. During which the alarmingly nutty director himself mangled English and reality describing his glorious quest to create the greatest human experience.This has more than a shade of a mockumentary about it simply because of the grandiose material. And on reflection, we should have seen more. Just seeing Gigers models was astonishing. Keeping Jodorowsky on screen revealed what the film could have been, as well as why it could never have worked. The moment when he finally saw the trite Dino de Horrendous version of Dune that sank without trace in the 80s was lovely.(Seen at the London Film Festival)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching Jodorowsky's Dune I have seen only 2 movies from the director however instead of a feeling of lack I appreciated the other movie footage and background on Jodorowsky's life and works. It isn't mostly what about but how Jodorowsky talks during the movie that shows the ways of how a great mind functions. The movie's settings remind of a play with minimalist theater as mostly characters are seen and heard speaking with no special effects or visuals but one can catch a glimpse of a circle of masters of several fields who need to come together for a masterpiece to be created. So much laughter and applause I have never heard during a documentary played in a cinema as this time. While the "Jodorowsky Marathon" was one of my first film festivals to visit in Budapest and was one of my first times in an art cinema, I plan to continue visiting such festivals and cinemas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>JODOROWSKY'S DUNE as laid out in this documentary could've rivaled 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY for sheer Nerve. 2001 crept along at a snail's pace, to be sure, but it eventually attempted to give us a glimpse of what lay at The End of the Universe. Good or bad, right or wrong, it crept along doggedly until it presented its Conclusion (such as it was). DUNE would've DWARFED 2001 just in terms of Story: the book touched on so many themes that to do the idea(s) justice would've required a SERIES of movies (of considerable length). David Lynch did a commendable job, all things considered, but his version of DUNE lacked the mind-bending FEEL that the Spiritual transmutation of Paul should've engendered; THAT would've taken a filmmaking savvy that the eccentric Lynch just didn't possess. (Maybe only Werner Herzog could've given us a closer approximation to what Frank Herbert had wrought.) The Harkonnens remain some of the vilest villains in the history of Science Fiction (especially in view of worldwide events over the past four decades), and it would be great to see them done justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With having found auteur film maker Alejandro Jodorowsky's The Dance of Reality to be a dazzling surreal title,I was pleased to spot on a thread on IMDb's Film Festival thread that a doc about a project Jodorowsky failed to get made was chosen for viewing,which led to me getting ready to step on Jodorowsky's Dune.The outline of the doc:After his movie The Holy Mountain is an unexpected hit,film maker Alejandro Jodorowsky is asked by the producer about what he would like to do for his next project.Hearing about the book,Jodorowsky decides that he would like to do an adaptation of the Sci-Fi novel Dune.Once the producer gets the rights, Jodorowsky begins writing a screenplay for a 14 hour long (!) adaptation.As he Jodorowsky starts hiring people for the film,the project starts to face cash troubles.View on the film:Displaying a number of the superb storyboards and drawings that Jodorowsky had done for the project,director Frank Pavich offers a bittersweet taste to what could have been by bringing the storyboards alive with a delicate use of CGI.Along with the CGI preview,Pavich dips the film into Jodorowsky's surrealist ink,thanks to images of the stars and pre-production meetings, (from Mick Jagger to producer Dan O'Bannon being high when he first met Jodorowsky!)giving the movie a dreamy fantasy atmosphere.Despite the project not reaching the screen, Alejandro Jodorowsky displays a burning passion for the project which shines across the screen,as Jodorowsky reveals what came out of the ashes of Dune.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long before Frank Herbert's 'Dune' was adapted into a movie in 1984 and a miniseries in 2000, 'Santa Sangre' director Alejandro Jodorowsky originally attempted to bring the novel to screen and this documentary details how his ambitious project failed. The film consists of interviews with Jodorowsky and his former collaborators, as well as archive footage of those no longer alive. Through these interviews, it becomes clear that the project was always doomed from the start, but that it may have been a surefire interesting movie had it gotten off the ground. Obstacles to production are revealed to include cautious financiers, unwilling to fund a sci-fi film that would run for more than 90 minutes, and egotistical actors (Salvador Dalí apparently wanted $100,000 per minute for the privilege of appearing). As the documentary progresses though, it starts to veer off the deep end with its repeated wild claims (not suggestions) that 'Dune' would have been the new 'Star Wars' and the greatest science fiction film of all time had it gone ahead. Even wilder though is the conspiracy theory presented towards the end, with the filmmakers suggesting that everything from 'The Matrix' to 'Prometheus' took inspiration from Jodorowsky's storyboards for 'Dune' that (they reckon) were passed around all the big studios. While the film goes a little overboard in this regard, it is still fascinating viewing throughout. Animation is used particularly well to bring some of Jodorowsky's storyboards to life and to add extra detail to a record interview with Dan O'Bannon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Jodorowsky's Dune' is one fine documentary that gives you a small glimpse into the chaotic scene of what it was like to make one of the biggest pictures ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure you have either seen, read, or heard of the sci-fi epic tale of 'Dune' by now. You know the film by David Lynch that starred Kyle MacLachlan, Sting, Max Von Sydow, Virginia Madsen, Patrick Stewart, and Sean Young? Well, if you saw the film, you would know that it is very similar to a lot of science-fiction movies that we have seen over the past thirty years, but it never was a box office smash or held up in later years. Sure, there is a small cult following for it now, but it has nowhere near the amount of fans that 'Star Wars' or 'Star Trek' fans have now.'Dune' was a book from 1956 by Frank Hubert that was adapted for the big screen by Lynch ('Eraserhead', 'Twin Peaks', 'Mullholland Drive'). But did you know that before Lynch started directing his cast of characters, that cult icon filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky ('El Topo', 'The Holy Mountain') was set to make 'Dune' into a ten hour feature film that was going to have Salvador Dali (the painter) and Orson Welles star in his film, amongst others? Well that's true, as Jodorowsky set out on several countries constructing a dream team of filmmakers to make this epic sci-fi film that Jodorowsky himself was convinced would change the world. And even though the film was never made, his dream of changing the world or changing the ways movies were made came true.Director Frank Pavich spent quite a few months with Jodorowsky, interviewing him, and some of the people (who are big names in Hollywood now) who worked on this movie with him, and how this project ultimately fell apart. One thing is for sure, as we see Jodorowsky flip through his two thousand page illustrated book and screenplay of his version of 'Dune', his spirit and soul are as lively today at age 85 as they were back in his much younger days. Jodorowsky was and is still not about making money for the suits in Hollywood, but rather showing an artistic and entertaining piece of cinema, no matter how obscure or insane it might be (Yes, his movie 'The Holy Mountain' incited riots in Mexico when it came out).Pavich shows us through interviews, digital stills, and old footage what happened in those couple of years as Jodorowsky tried to make 'Dune'. Come to find out, Jodorowsky, traveled to meet actors he heard of or were fans of on screen, and point blank asked them to be in his film, to which most all of them said "yes". He also took this method to find his storyboard illustrators, special effects team, and director of photography, as he asked them all to drop what they were doing and move to another country to make this epic film. Among these people were H.R. Giger and Dan O'Bannon (the 'ALIEN' movies), who were both no names at the time.When it came to casting, Jodorowsky asked Salvador Dali to be in the film, to which Dali responded with "yes, but only if I'm paid $100k per hour." Jodorowsky ended up offering him $100k per minute of screen-time, and he snatched Welles up by offering to hire the head chef of his favorite restaurant to cater every meal to him personally. Needless to say, Jodorowsky had an unorthodox way of making a film. But back then, studios weren't wanting to make ten hour movies or trilogies yet, specifically not one that would be rated R by a virtually unknown in the states director. And now way over budget and not receiving any more money from the studio, the project eventually fell apart after all the work that had been completed. And Jodorowsky still believes that this version of 'Dune' could have been the best film ever made, and nobody ever will see it. However, his ideas for special effects and Giger's drawings of the planets and buildings in 'Dune' were featured in other films like 'Alien', 'Star Wars', 'Total Recall', and 'Masters of the Universe'.So in a way, Jodorowsky's vision came to life in other films, and his dream team of filmmakers went on to be the cream of the crop in Hollywood, as his gigantic illustrated screenplay made the rounds in Hollywood, and other directors took what they saw and used it as their own. This truly was one of the greatest films never made, and after watching this engaging documentary, I wanted Hollywood to give Jodorowsky money to make his version finally. But I know that will never happen. And there are many instances like this that has happened over the years, but one thing is for sure. Alejandro Jodorowsky has kept true to his nature and himself in making movies and will never yield to the execs of Hollywood. 'Jodorowsky's Dune' is one fine documentary that gives you a small glimpse into the chaotic scene of what it was like to make one of the biggest pictures ever made, only to have it not happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Greatest Movie ever made about the Greatest Movie never made. That's all I have to say about this beautiful info-graphic Documentary, following the most ambitious project by then well known and critically acclaimed Director, following it's over priced production and then it's inevitable destruction by Hollywood who at that time never supported Movies with that big an ambition like Jodorowsky's Dune.Told in the form of Interviews by the people who were involved in the Film like any other Documentary but what makes Jodorowsky's Dune stand out is it's doomed story itself, every minor detail mentioned only makes want to see the Film more but then again it will be made like it was envisioned and shown in Jodorowsky's Dune. To the one's who are unaware about this Film will enjoy it the most for what is more Gracious and Glorious than seeing Dune come to life in the form of drawing and animation for the first time. What might astonish you the most about Dune are the people who involved in it, the likes of Orson Welles and Salvador Dali and many other greats were involved with this Film, great visionaries who would go on and make great contributions to Film inspired by their work on Jodorowsky's Dune. Try and imagine Orsen Welles playing a cruel narcissistic Film living in a Fortress which looks like him which is protected by spears arranged on the path which leads to it, set in the desert planet whose skies also run red and the winds carry sand.Alejandro Jodorowsky narrates the story of his passion project, he starts very Enthusiastically to tell the world what happened to his beloved Dune and gradually falls to despair when he has to tell who his Dune was never made, to a point of despair that he begs people to take his material and make his Dune. The Film's concepts and story is brought to the audience in the form of drawings and animation, the very drawings and animations from which "Alien" was created, almost all the visuals in Alien was inspired from the work done on Dune. Few of the drawings are brought to life in form of animation which look strikingly beautiful. Not being able to see this movie will be the greatest regret I will ever have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having loved the movies for a long time now, is incredible to see this film with only 8 as rating. Jodorowski's Dune proposes the inside look of a genius at it's own way. Jodorowski's movies are not for everybody, you need to see it with some kind of effort and taste for the artistic wave. However Jodorowski's Dune shows not only the work of this man, but the man himself, showing us a beautiful human being with an inspiring message: Don't you ever give up! Even if all the doors remain closed, Don't give up. Is one of the most amazing things I have seen in my life. So You have Jodorowsky's work, Jodorowsky himself, Hodorowsky's Legacy in sci-fi what else do you need to give it a try?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jodorowsky's Dune allows viewers to peer into the mind of an artist fully committed to seeing his vision become reality. This film is not just for sci-fi fans, it's for anyone who is fascinated and inspired by the creation of art. It's hard not to be amazed by Jodorowsky's passion and excitement as he walks the audience through every stage of attempting to create his masterpiece.It's easy to view Jodorowsky as an over-idealistic man with a screw loose, thanks both to his mannerisms and his zealous approach to art. But that's what makes the story so interesting. He almost turns down Pink Floyd because the band didn't stop eating their hamburgers while discussing the musical score of Dune. He introduces himself to Dan O'Bannon by immediately presenting him with some of his "special marijuana". He offered Salvador Dali $100,000 per minute to act in the film (granted, it was stated that Dali was set to be in the film 5 minutes at most). You feel Jodorowsky's pain when he discusses receiving the news that all major studios were uninterested in the picture, and that the film's production had to stop right when things seemed to be heating up. You want to laugh with him when he expresses his euphoria at realizing the David Lynch adaptation of Dune was a disaster. You respect and revere him when he talks about the abundance films he had an impression on and the artists he helped inspire. And you admire him when he suggests that Dune has lived on through those films, that his hard work, effort, and vision have not, in fact, gone to waste.The film is not for any one segment of the population. It's for those who love human expression, commitment, and diligence, and for those who are truly in awe of individuals who are driven by the love of their artistic craft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love good documentaries and this is one of them but one thing to keep in mind about most of them is their need to steer and corral you into a point of view. The point of view of this one is that Jodorowsky's Dune wasn't made because of inflexibility and lack of vision by the Hollywood studio machine.The film ended with me thinking that was an unfair judgment. Two key factors would kill this film even today: One was the demand by Jodorowsky that the film be 15 hours. Imagine if the original Star Wars trilogy was made all at once into a 6 hour film. We'd certainly enjoy it but would many 13 year olds who fell in love with the first film be able to handle sitting for 6 hours straight even with an intermission? Also, three movies made 3 times more money than one.This film COULD have gotten made! If Jodorowsky started out from the Planet Caladan and ended on Arrakis just after the Baron had killed Duke Leto and Paul had escaped, for instance. The budget would have been reduced and even if Hollywood had rejected it, he could have filmed from a private investor (no doubt Salvador Dali and Orson Welles could have made some phone calls) In the end, ironically, the studio execs were right: Jodorowsky simply wasn't practical enough of a director to get the film cut. He was ingenious in negotiating and compromising with the biggest egos of all time including literally Orson Welles and Dali but couldn't figure out a way to make this project viable to a simple minded Hollywood exec? His genius could have manipulated such a simple mind if he had allowed himself to.So it's thoughts like that which make this documentary into one of the best thoughtful experiences ever. Even if you disagree with my conclusion, the vision of what this film could have been, and why it wasn't, is as engaging as any of the three Star Wars "prequel" films. What I think the film could have been like is a 100 times better than what Lynch's Dune turned out to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is Jodorowski a genius? He certainly sells it well. on the other hand, it took me two viewings to get through Holy Mountain, and I would not describe it as mainstream entertainment - or even general entertainment for that matter.The genius of Jodorowski is in cherry picking other geniuses to work with, and developing a team that was later poached by mainstream Hollywood.The team of Moebius, Giger, O'Bannon, and Foss is inspired on so many levels for a choice of artistic design. It's no surprise that the best we could have hoped for after the failure of this project was a classic in its own right, 'Alien'.On the music front he was trying to bring in Pink Floyd for the Atreides score, and Magma for Harkonnen.And actors... Dali for the emperor, who immediately demanded the highest pay in Hollywood - what better choice for emperor than such an arrogant, spoilt, self-absorbed know-it-all? Orson Wells for Baron Harkonnen is also another masterful choice.Love him or loathe him, Jodorowski knows people. He chose some pretty incredible people to take on this project, and succeeded in pulling them all together. It's a damn shame that it failed.Sure, Jodorowski's Dune would probably have been a financial and critical failure, but I think it would also have developed a cult following as the best film of all time.In the end it was just too 'European' for the pay masters. Hollywood and the States love a clean cut hero in a black and white story. Philosophical and metaphysical does not go down as well there as it does in Europe. Although, that seems to be changing a bit now.This project was far ahead of its time for Hollywood, though they do seem content to poach parts of it to splice into more mainstream and less thoughtful movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spiritual enlightenment in a documentary form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a spiritual enlightenment in a documentary form.Let us start with this: I own the blu-ray version of the movie. Never saw any Jodorowsky movie, but I am huge fan of both books and David Lynch's "Dune".So far somebody would expect me to judge this documentary from the perspective of a "Dune" fan, but honestly I tried to be as neutral as possible. Of course, part of me was the "Dune" fan when I was watching, part of me was trying to get into the mind of this crazy genius, as Jodorowsky appears to be.Some quick facts and impressions: I have never seen the theatrical version of the documentary, but the blu-ray version do contains additional footage, giving even a bit more insight from both Jodorowsky and Michel Seydoux on the events and relationships of Jodorowsky and the crew. I consider this bonus material a very valuable add-on to the whole story, so I do recommend you to buy the blu-ray version.What to say... The movie pretty much speaks about itself. It is well done and very interesting to see, especially it touches such a mysterious subject in the world cinematography, as the never made movie about "Dune". What the movie shows however in addition, is a valuable insight on Jodorowsky's mind and we are given the chance to experience from first person perspective the creative process of the mind of a genius.Yes, I said I have never seen a Jodorowsky movie. However experiencing the way this man thinks and creates, I cannot deny he is a true genius. While we are not given the chance to see the whole book he prepared for the movie studios, showing the storyboard of "Dune", we almost feel like we could watch the movie from some of his words.Jodorowsky's "Dune" would have been a true spectacular movie. David Lynch's "Dune" is already spectacular - we have the monsters by Kit West , the same who created the monsters in "Star Wars", we have the music of the legendary TOTO and Brian Eno, we have a whole constellation of famous actors, including Sting in addition. Jodorowsky was about to offer much more - different music for every Dune house, starting with the cult Pink Floyd, even more constellations of stars - Mick Jagger, Amanda Lear, Orson Welles, H.R.Giger and even, oh my, Salvador Dali! And all this experienced in a totally different palette of colours trough the prism of Jodorowsky's mind.Honestly, while I think the movie would have been very very different than everything we saw and maybe considered too "mature-rated", if not even little "pervert" by some, I think the world really lost by not having this movie created.The moral of the story however, is that even true geniuses have to consider the budget and some boundaries in the end. Otherwise we are left with nothing, but legends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jodorowsky's Vision is Vapor Cinema; Conceptually Brilliant and Thoroughly Mind-Teasing, But Inherently Doomed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of talking heads sit down to chat about the "most ambitious sci-fi epic never made." Which, I realize, sounds like some rather exaggerated, overplayed hyperbole. Thing is, between the director's intense dedication to the project and remarkable eye for talent, it quickly seems like a pretty reasonable statement. Alejandro Jodorowsky, who single-handedly provides much of the documentary's narration, is both the best and the worst thing to happen to this launchpad-implosion of a film. His confidence can often come off as egotism, and his absurd track record quickly turned off any potential Hollywood suitors (ultimately damning the picture) but in retrospect there's no arguing with the impact his hand-picked team made on the world of science fiction at large. Then-unknowns like HR Giger and M?bius would go on to enormous careers, both in the cinema and art scenes, while many of their collaborators found themselves poached for future hits like Star Wars and Alien. There's a certain irrational appeal to the man himself, which immediately comes through in his speech and mannerisms. It's no wonder major celebrities like Pink Floyd and David Carradine would attach themselves to the project, mingling with brow-furrowing supporting acts like Orson Welles and Salvador Dali. The big question of how the film could make the translation from eccentric paper-bound concept to vivid on-screen special effect (in a pre-Lucasfilm world, no less) is never adequately answered, and that hurts in the long run, but as an exercise in unbridled, unhinged creative discharge it's fascinating. Utterly tripped-out, surreal and nonsensical at times, but fascinating.</fullReview>

Dali etc, brilliant stories, i won't spoil it just watch.I really don't think his movie could have worked in 1975, or in 1985. or 1995. it's debatable if it could even be made today, so perhaps it's for the best it didn't get made (ignoring Lynch's version, which I also haven't seen!).Particularly enjoyed Jodorowsky's honesty about how he felt watching Lynch's movie. I don't particularly care for Sci-Fi but anything made with that passion is interesting to me. So many great characters and artists, Giger (Alien) etc. This is in no way an objective piece of journalism, but it's not meant to be.

		<fullReview>I watched this last night on netflix, and was really entertained by it. It is a much see doc for any Dune fan.The Dune movie that could have been. Alejandro Jodorowsky's Dune was grand in scope, and would have been one of the most mind bending, and trippy things to have come out of the 70's.This film goes into a great deal of detail about how the movie would have unfolded. Showing off tons of art, and story boards. He lead everyone involved in this movie like a cult leader. His passion for his project completely infected everyone involved.As a Dune fan I would have like to have seen this take on the story. Alejandro did stray quite far from the source material in areas of the story. I don't know how Dune fans would have reacted to that.I've read some comments on here that say Alejandro Jodorowsky, came off has arrogant in this movie. I don't agree I think he was extremely passionate about this project.I love strange off beat sci fi movies of the 1970's. Zardoz is one that comes to mind. So I no doubt would have loved this one too had it been made. It truly would have been one bizarre Sci fi movie.If you love Dune you will find this movie quite interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am glad the man is alive and still making films, though they don't drive my soul the way some work does. I like that he is aware of parallel narratives, is visual and fearless. His notions of sex and oppression are decoupled from the physical, and that is remarkable.For my taste, his notion of narrative is less full of irrepressible need and more of butterflies. And they all have to rely on connectives he keeps in his imagination. So many years ago when I heard of the rumored Dune project, well, I was interested. If he indeed tapped that material, his weaknesses would be covered, because the whole Dune series is one that well integrates the spiritual, political and personal (meaning individual drive).Now I learn that he roped in the artistic team that later went on to give Alien its edge. And Welles! Also some simple but then famous celebrities were cast in some roles. Seeing the thin excess he put together in his storyboards, I believe the thing would have been a mess.But now here we have this remarkably well made documentary that gives the film more value than it ever could have had! We have that almost film in many still images. We have the memory of the original book, still strong in many of us.We have the outer wrapper of an excellent filmmaker in putting the thing together as a narrative. And we have Jodorowsky's telling, as if the film were not a project but a child destined to become Jesus.This manifold narrative is really effective, and the film grows and grows in importance as if it were a fictional but hardly understood celestial character. Destroying the film ? he says near the end ? gave it more power than it could have had.As much power as spice flowing through urge without image.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's a good thing that Alejandro Jodorowsky didn't get to make his version of Dune. I haven't seen any of his films, just some trailers, but from what the trailers look like and what is shown in this documentary, his version of Dune would have been too, um, weird. It probably would have been even farther from the book than David Lynch's version (which I actually kind of like, to tell you the truth). Actually, it definitely would have farther from the book than David Lynch's version. It surely would have been a film to be reckoned with but that doesn't necessarily mean it would have been of very high quality.Still, this was a very interesting documentary to watch. Alejandro Jodorowsky talks in quite a compelling manner. He is never boring to listen to. I became excited when he was excited and sad when he became sad (yes, even though I think it's good his Dune was never made). I also liked the soundtrack.I would have liked this documentary a bit more if it weren't for some unsupported assumptions made by some of the interviewees. I think Nicolas Winding Refn says something like (just paraphrasing here), "The studios didn't make Jodorowsky's Dune because they were afraid of his imagination." No, they just didn't think it would be a commercial success, which isn't the same thing as being afraid of his imagination. And another guy says Jodorowsky's Dune influenced "Blade Runner, William Gibson, The Matrix." Blade Runner, I can understand, since Blade Runner was influenced a bit by the work of Moebius, who would have worked on Jodorowsky's Dune. And I guess The Matrix was influenced somewhat by Blade Runner, since I think Blade Runner had some influence on the Japanese anime and manga that directly influenced The Matrix. But William Gibson couldn't have been influenced by Jodorowsky's Dune. How could he have seen the "Dune Bible"? Neuromancer was influenced by postmodern literature and the punk subculture. The documentary would have been better if it showed more proof that Jodorowsky and Moebius's Dune Bible was really mined for ideas by studios.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fantastic documentary film, and while it is true that it's success wouldn't be possible without the fantastic charisma of Jodorwsky himself, I think the director also should get some credit for weaving all the interviews to create the feel of a tight story. It's essentially a "gathering" story, sort of like Seven Samurai, where Jodorowsky travels around the world to find his 'spiritual warriors' necessary to aid him in executing his vision.There's an interesting blend of naivety and guile in Jodorowsky's actions as he is both able to bribe Orson Welles by appealing to the man's psychology while at the same time he is manipulated by Dali's patently unrealistic and unfair demands. Although an artist in his own right, he was clearly lower on the totem pole than figures such as Dali or Welles.I've heard people express skepticism at the idea that Mick Jagger would've actually appeared in the film, claiming that it's unrealistic. It's important to remember that he had ties to the art- film scene, performing in Performance and working with outsiders like Kenneth Anger. It seems totally realistic to me that Jagger would be willing to show up in a codpiece in this film at a very reasonable price, given the association Jodorowsky had with Warhol's art community just by itself. Although the man loves money (who doesn't?) he also seems to value being a part of the art scene, the art world, and he would definitely want to be a part of this.One note that I'd like to make - Jodorowsky uses the word "rape" in one of his interviews to describe how he approached adapting Dune. I really don't think he meant it the way it is used most commonly in our current culture, as in nonconsensual sex. Rather I think he was more trying to convey a sense of, to quote the dictionary, "plunder, violent seizure, or abuse; despoliation; violation." I think it would be foolish to argue that the man is pro-rape. Still, there are plenty of people who will feel at liberty to take things out of context in order to feel either righteous or smart. One lingering question that the movie leaves us with is, just how insane is Jodorowsky? He's described often as a visionary madman, a modern day prophet. This is a pretty deep question actually, and reaches into further questions of psychology and philosophy. Is there no mysticism to the world? Is there nothing beyond the seemingly- straightforward mechanism of the atoms of the universe? Modern physics, with its newfound uncertainty, gives new age beliefs more wiggle room: everything is energy!, they exult. But is this just a cheap justification to cling to comforting superstitions? How do we differentiate between superstition, religion, and mysticism, or do we? In the end, will the question of Jodorowsky's "sanity" devolve into an argument of semantics? That seems likely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the only movie that I could decently watch during my flight as it has subtitles and the subject was indeed intriguing : A bit like Gilliam's « Don Quichotte » or Marilyn's « something's got to give », this movie is famous because it was never shot! I did heard before that Moebius and Giger had worked on the project but watching their contributions for real is stunning ! The hardcover production book they edit is a must-have for any SF fans ! It's sad that this movie has never been green-lighted because he could have changed cinema history before « star wars » done it just after !There's however a justice because the movie also explores the « spin-offs » that this failure produced : the amazing comics « Incal » done by Jodorowsky and Moebius, the « Alien » franchise as O'Bannon, Moebius and Giger worked together again. It's funny to see that « Flash Gordon » has just rip off all the ideas but without the talent ! Sure, Jodorowsky has a big head and his previous movies as some of his ideas for « Dune » are crazy. But he has a vision and it's always great to have somebody fight for his art ! The fire that he has mixes well with the calm of his french producer, actually known as a soccer manager and the father of a young actress ! However, i disagree with him about Lynch's adaptation : As much as Jodorowsky's one was his interpretation, his feeling, Lynch's one has his touch. Thus, if Dune fans are maybe disappointed, Lynch fan are nevertheless happy !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The most influential unfinished movie of the sci-fi film history". This is what you will be thinking if you watch this documentary about Chilean filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky and his vision of a "Dune" film from the Frank Herbert sci-fi novel. Through Jodorowsky himself and the team he assembled for the project, we will recall how he envisioned a titanic piece of work that even today would be breathtaking. Whether you are a fan of the Frank Herbert books or the David Lynch movie, this is more about the passion of an artist, a vision way ahead of his time, and how it has had an influence on subsequent sci-fi classics. Names like Dalí, Orson Welles, David Carradine, H.R. Giger, Pink Floyd...all of them were icons of culture in their own right, ready to be a part of a project never seen before. Guided by a man enlightened by a vision, a leader for some, a lunatic for many others, if it had become a reality, it would have changed modern filmmaking, storytelling or technical, even reaching an intellectual and spiritual revolution. Listening to Jodorwsky himself, his contagious passion, is fascinating and as we watch the documentary, we realize that maybe that is what is missing in modern day filmmaking: more passion and a bit of madness. It is the right for an artist to dream big, to revamp someone else's work. Nowadays we are enjoying a new media for this purpose: TV series, in which big stories can be properly developed, so it suits the scope Jodorowsky wanted to display. It might not be as elevated as a film for the filmmaker, but that's another story. David Lynch's "Dune" (1984) turns to be an interesting but crappy-looking movie, hard to believe it was made in a post Star Wars era. It is a shame to glimpse what Jodorowsky's Dune could have been, but after this documentary we are well aware that it had a big impact of some sci-fi cult movies that came later, much more we expected.</fullReview>

Between 1960 and 1980, the world of science fiction evolved from cheesy robots and mad scientists to something far more visionary. Other given credit are "Alien", "2001", "Star Wars" and others... but perhaps it was this film that never got made.H.R. Giger? Dan O'Bannon? Orson Welles? This is an incredible story, and really bridges a gap.

		<fullReview>What an inspirational and meaningful story. When I first started watching this film, I thought it was a story about a director but, it is completely different, unexpected and unique. It is the marvelous story about Jodorowsky's Dune journey. This documentary has tons to offer if you are a sci-fi fan or simply interested in inspirational stories. It is thrilling, funny and interesting, especially for cinema enthusiasts like me. I also believe that anyone who loves classics will enjoy it as well. The documentary is unique and different, in its own way. The story is about a "French Steven Spielberg" named Alejandro Jodorowsky who made famous and mind-blowing films that always had a deeper meaning behind them. He had a dream of making a movie based on the famous book "Dune" by Frank Herbert. We join this extremely inspiring adventure where he tries to make this film but sadly fails after two years of hard work. Fortunately, his work is not wasted as it became the basis for many sci-fi movies that followed thus making Jodorowsky's dream become bigger than he could have ever imagined. I absolute loved this documentary. The angles of the camera are very different, never fixed on one person or one place, which makes it look like you are there in the same room with the people that are talking. It includes narration by people that helped make the film which fits really nicely. The director also includes clips from some of the films that used some of Jodorowsky's ideas to support what the narrator is discussing. That made me want to watch those films. The layout is unique and clean because it shows the passing of time. Since the film was never made, they animated the drawings to give you an idea of how it would have look had it been finished. That, in turn, made me want to watch it over and over again. The story inspired me and will inspire others. My favorite part is when they talk about the very opening scene. The scene opens in a galaxy than zooms in on a specific area. For the 70s, this was very advanced and hard to do. Since they drew it, the animators made it come to life in the documentary. Also, at the end, the film shows how this work inspired other producers to create similar shots. There is a secret meaning, which I love, and that is advanced and was never before done. This movie has a lot of adult content and terminology so I recommend it for ages 13 to 18 and give it 5 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

		<fullReview>Jodorowsky's Dune (2013)**** (out of 4) Have you seen Alejandro Jodorowsky's DUNE? Of course you haven't because sadly it was never made but this documentary gives you a great idea of what it would have been like. Director Jodorowsky is interviewed as he discusses his early films and why he then wanted to make Dune even though he hadn't actually read the book. From here we learn about the pre-production, which included getting Pink Floyd on-board for the soundtrack and David Carradine for the main role.JODOROWSKY'S DUNE is a terrific little documentary that gives one a great idea of what the movie would have been like if it was made. The film goes into great detail about what the look of the film would have been like as well as giving you a great idea of why it might not have been possible even if they had turned the movie cameras on. As one person says, this was two years from STAR WARS yet Jodorowsky was wanting to do stuff that wouldn't even have been possible twenty years from then. If you're a fan of the director or just filmmaking in general then this is a must see.</fullReview>

Lynch may not want to take credit for the film, he may feel more disappointed about that movie than anything else he's done, but the alternative would have been an even greater departure from the source material...would have been abysmally dismissive of the novel and the subsequent additions to the series that was Dune. There are some aspects of Jodorowsky's vision that impressed me, and some stylistic choices that would have been interesting to witness...but the end that he planned would have been enough to ruin the movie for me. Paul dying and beginning to speak through the mouths of everyone else present followed by Arrakis becoming a verdant paradise with a consciousness of its own is just stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As mindboggling as El Topo and The Holy Mountain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you loved El Topo and The Holy Mountain in the 1970s, even if you think that you've now grown up and put such mystical mumbo-jumbo behind you, you've still got to see this documentary about a movie that was never made. How, you may ask, can a film be made about another film that never existed? Well, in the tale spun by Alejandro (and his tale- telling, even in his broken English, is as fine as that of Spalding Gray), someone told him about the book Dune, by Frank Herbert, and, at a time when producers were willing to shower Alejandro with money, Alejandro said, "That will be my next movie." He had not read the book. It's not clear from the movie that he EVER read the book. But he went about hiring the best illustrators to create the most fantastic storyboard ever made, a huge volume the size of an artbook merged with the Unabridged Oxford, that illustrated the complete film, beginning to end. It only roughly corresponded to the novel, but to Alejandro, that did not matter. He told the story that he wanted to tell, about how one messianic figure, Paul (who would be depicted by Alejandro's son), would liberate, not just the planet Arrakus, but the entire universe. And all of this would have been depicted visually with special effects, in 1974. In Alejandro's tale, this film was $5 million away from being made. And it would have starred David Carradine, Orson Welles, and Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger among others. Alejandro's tales of finding these various stars and offering the roles are fantastical in themselves, and highly dubious, but for my to retell the tales here would spoil some of the best parts of the movie.I attended the movie with someone who had not seen Alejandro's movies, nor had he read Dune (although it's on his must-read list), but he loved the movie because (1) it's a great tale, and (2) the comic book artists and special effects people that Alejandro employed, and who were working on the film when they pulled the plug, have gone on to great fame in other films and in comic art. And my friend was mostly nonexistent in the 1970s.I remember Alejandro coming to speak at my college in 1971, and he was spellbinding, and he is still spellbinding in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story of the science-fiction epic that never was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I already was aware, through THE HOLY MOUNTAIN, that Alejandro Jodorowsky is a visionary when it comes to film. He has a unique way of combining surrealistic imagery and a spiritual aesthetic that is nearly unparalleled. Watching one of his movies is an experience like no other, which makes just a bit sad that his DUNE never materialized into a film. However, there was a lot of pre-production work that went into it and that is what this documentary is about. I was astonished at how much work actually went into this project before studio heads said no to it. Jodorowsky had recruited some of the greatest people in their fields to create for him: people like H.R. Giger and Dan O'Bannon, who created some of the conceptual art for the film. In fact, the entire film exists on paper. There is a script, storyboards, concept art, the whole works. And even though the film was never made, it was a treat to hear all of these people talk about the project and the hopes they had for it. DUNE was ambitious, and maybe just a bit too ambitious for its time. Still, as this documentary points out, it left its mark on science-fiction and its fingerprints can be seen in a lot of films that came after it, from ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER, to THE TERMINATOR, CONTACT and PROMETHEUS. This documentary was fascinating to watch and I highly recommend you check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Calling All Film Buffs, Mad Men, and Lovers of the Avant-Garde, this Documentary is about Alejandro Jodorowsky and His Quest to Make a Movie called Dune from the Book by Frank Herbert, a Work of Mammoth Proportion and Extreme Importance. The Time is 1974 and Big Budget Sci-Fi Cinema was Shunned, Despite the Commercial Success of Kubrick's Odyssey (considered an anomaly). Despite an Enormously Detailed Pre-Production Storyboard, Extremely Talented Crew On Board with the Likes of Dan O'Bannon, Artists Chris Foss and H.R. Giger, Orson Welles, Salvador Dali, David Carradine, Pink Floyd and Others, the Film Never Got Green Lighted and this is that Story.The Disappointing Trek to Hollywood that the Director Embarked On is Detailed here by the Man Himself with Help from the Producer, and Interviews with Fans like Director Nicolas Winding Refn, Giger, Foss, and Others.This Documentary is Inspirational and the Passion of Jodorowsky (at age 80) is Infectious and Admirable. Despite His Messiah Complex and Visions of Grandeur, the Director Comes Across as a Warm and Likable Svengali with Rasputin Eyes and a Big Heart.It is Exciting to See the Machinations of the Process, both Artistic and Administrative of How this Visionary Did Not Sacrifice Artistic Integrity to Peddle His Wares to Suspicious and Unresponsive Hollywood. In the End the Documentary Makes a Case for the Influence that His Unmade Movie had on Blockbusters like Star Wars and Blade Runner Among Others. Maybe the Hollywood Types that were Shown the Gargantuan Storyboard Book did not Photo Copy it or Make Copious Notes, at the Very Least the Powerful Vision did Makes it Way into the Collective Consciousness through the Doors of Perception and its Influence can Hardly be Unnoticed as the Film Lays Out Pages of Artwork from the Book.Overall, Highly Recommended for Film Fanatics, Pop Culture Historians, and Anyone Interested in the Inner Workings of a Creative Genius and a Very Likable, if Eccentric, Artist and Filmmaker.</fullReview>

Jodorowsky is a greatly fascinating person and really this film is about him, not Dune (although it is called Jodorowsky's Dune because that was a focal point of his career and where he gained his greatest life lessons).No need to be a sci-fi fan or film student.

		<fullReview>'JODOROWSKY'S DUNE': Four Stars (Out of Five) Documentary about popular cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky's attempts to make his ambitious film version of the classic 1965 sci-fi novel 'Dune' (in the mid-1970s). The project was abandoned and the book was later turned into a movie by producer Dino De Laurentiis and director David Lynch. This documentary was directed and produced (with Stephen Scarlata and Travis Stevens) by Frank Pavich and it features interviews with Jodorowsky, the late (and great) H.R. Giger, Nicholas Winding Refn, Dan O' Bannon and many others. It's a very interesting and informative film and makes a compelling argument for why Jodorowsky's 'DUNE' could have been a masterpiece.Frank Herbert's beloved novel 'Dune' was originally optioned (to be turned into a film) by producer Arthur P. Jacobs in 1973. He died before he could make that dream a reality and the rights were then passed on to cult director Alejandro Jodorowsky. Jodorowsky spent $2 million (and years) developing his project (in pre-production) by traveling around pitching the idea to people like Giger, O' Bannon, Orson Welles, David Carradine and many others. He managed to assemble his ultimate dream cast and crew (by convincing them what an epic masterpiece it would be) but he failed to make that same point with investors and couldn't secure enough money to finally make his movie. This doc spends a lot of time with Jodorowsky and interviews many others involved as well; as it details the epic 'pre-production' of 'Jodorowsky's Dune'.I love film and filmmaking, and I make my own ultra-low-budget movies as well, so I have an extreme amount of passion for the art form and of course this movie is very moving to me. So is watching Jodorowsky explain his passion for that same art and (most specifically) the 'DUNE' project. His version of Herbert's classic literature was going to take a lot of creative liberties with the source material; so it probably would have upset a lot of fans (but it couldn't have possibly infuriated them anymore than Lynch's version). No one knows for sure what kind of a movie it would have been but Pavich makes a very convincing case (through this documentary) for why it would have been a revolutionary masterpiece. He also explains how it influenced countless popular and successful sci-flicks that did get made (which followed it). If you're a fan of film and filmmaking this documentary is definitely worth a look.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm4Vh8MBwoQ&amp;feature=youtu.be</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indeed, this felt like a sand castle washing away upon the surf. The documentary directed by Frank Povich, tells the story of cult film director Alejandro Jodorowsky's attempt to made Frank Herbert's novel into the big screen, but ultimately failing. While, I'm a huge fan of Alejandro Jodorowsky's work in 1970's El Topo. I can't get behind his version of Dune. It's a lot worse than David Lynch's 1984's Dune movie. It has little to do with author Frank Herbert's work. Alejandro Jodorowsky even admits to raping Frank Herbert's work in the film. To understand the mess that Jodorowsky made of Herbert's work, a brief discussion of what Dune is about, must be in order. The novel is about, a young hero, call Paul Atreides whom family is killed, when an interplanetary emperor fears the rising power of his family clan. The youth man find shelter on Planet Arrakis, a harsh and arid desert planet in which only two things thrive; mélange (spice currency) and Fremen, a nomadic warrior tribe. Wanting revenge, Paul use the tribe, to send out a holy war or Jihad against the Emperor. The book is supposed to represent the unforgiving growing conflict between Western beliefs and that of its Arab World. Instead, Jodorowsky wanted a dream-like sequence of self-revelation. Jodorowsky states that his intention was to replicate for his audience the experience of LSD-induced hallucinations, without having to take the LSD. He wanted to open the minds of viewers to possibilities. By doing this, he has chosen a trippy happy ending where the book did not had. What the hell is with that ending, he wanted!? Without spoiling too much of it, it made little sense and felt like a spiritual cop-out. Over 30 minutes of deleted scenes go further into the plot and differences between Herbert's vision and Jodorowsky's planned film in the documentary special features and you can see, clearly why this movie wouldn't had work. What made it, worst, is the fact that Jodorowsky chose to adapt the novel without ever having even reading it! If made, the movie would certainly lose some themes that Frank Herbert wanted to put. I do give some credit, some of Jodorowsky's themes were indeed complex meditation of society, but the way, he wanted to make it, didn't look so clear. First off, the length of the movie, he wanted to make. 14 to 10 hours sit is a hard watch, even for any die-hard Sci-Fiction fan. The acting choices for the film are pretty outrageous. Salvador Dali as the Emperor? Orson Welles as a fat snob Baron? Mick Jagger as a speedo wearing bad guy? Is this a comedy, or a Sci-Fiction? This movie is soundly more and more like 1974's Zardoz with its bad concept. The one thing, Jodorowsky got right is hiring Dan O'Bannon, H.R Giger, Chris Foss, and Jean Giraud Moebius. Most of them, would later go on, making the awesome movie, 1979's Alien. Jodorowsky had already spent nearly a third of the budget without shooting a thing, the producer decided to replace him. The project ultimately stalled for financial reasons. The film rights lapsed until 1982, when they were purchased by Italian filmmaker Dino De Laurentiis, who eventually released the 1984 film Dune, directed by David Lynch. Watching the documentary, it made it seem like Jodorowsky won it out in the end, but watching this documentary, and watching Lynch's Dune, I can't see Jodorowky doing better. I would even say if Jodorowsky's Dune had been released. It would flopped, and Star Wars might never have been given the green light, which would be a shame. So, I'm glad, it never got made. Now to the documentary, the film had this mostly one-sided cult like praise, as everybody saying this movie would be awesome, and its Hollywood fault, for not understanding art. Excuse me, there are reasons, why certain art films are great, and other sucks. It's the fact, the people put a lot of work and heart into it. The documentary biggest mistake, is using Hollywood as a main reason excuse why the movie was never made. Just because the studio decline to fund it, doesn't mean the movie couldn't be made. The documentary felt so whinny, without little work to show. Instead of doing countless interviews about why Jodorowky's dream will never get made. Why don't the documentary, instead focus on pitching Jodorowsky's ideas to people that can fund it. That's the biggest fault of the documentary. It felt so temper tantrum, showing Jodorowsky is bitching, while doing nothing after the fail attempt. 'The goal of life is to create a soul", he says in the film. What does he knows? He's such a hypocrite. Why bother making a documentary about a person who give up? How is this uplifting? Another fault of the documentary is the audio track. Half of the time, you can't understand, half of the people being talk to. It really needed so sub-titles. Then the movie even has the nerves, to keep an interview that get interrupt by a cat in the film. WTF!? Overall: The documentary was pretty entertaining, even if I don't agree with most of the ideas, Jodorowsky had for the film version of Dune. The production art-work feature in the film are beautiful to look at, and probably is the highlight of the film. It's a must watch for any film student, or Sci-Fiction nut. A good 'What If' documentary for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . or the biggest theft of intellectual property in world history? I'm sure the producers of JODOROWSKY'S DUNE and the 17 "talking heads" interviewed here had a legion of lawyers telling them what NOT to say about the crime committed against ripped-off movie writer\director\star Alejandro Jodorowsky, who SHOULD be as rich and famous as George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg put together. In 1975 he entrusted meticulously complete storyboards, costume, and art direction full-color mock-ups to all the major Tinsel Town studios. It's not hard to read between the lines of DUNE and know that each studio made lots of photo copies BEFORE returning this enormous Pre-production book to Alejandro with polite rejection memos. While Jodorowsky's proposed film adaptation of novelist Frank Herbert's first DUNE book starring Mick Jagger, Salvador Dali, Orson Welles, and David Carradine was scuttled by Hollywood, shot-for-shot scenes, costumes, spaceships, and robots were stolen wholesale and incorporated into STAR WARS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, ALIEN, TERMINATOR, PREDATOR, THE MATRIX, BLADE RUNNER, CONTACT, FLASH GORDON, MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, PROMETHEUS, and scores of other flicks by these same hypocritical conglomerates suing the pants off poor people for "illegally" copying, downloading, or otherwise "pirating" the government-bribing pirates themselves. Ironically, in addition to appropriating the life work of a naive foreign visionary, film historians have voted the David Lynch-directed misbegotten on-the-cheap version of DUNE released in 1984 as "the film most likely to make the Angels weep in Heaven."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jodorowskys Dune: The greatest film never made (thank goodness for that!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must confess that before watching this documentary, I never heard of Alejandro Jodorowski or his movies, or that he wanted to do a movie based on Frank Herberts sci-fi novel ?Dune". Being a great fan of Sci-Fi I went to see this documentary and I must confess it is a fascinating movie. It shows Jodorowskys passion about this project, his visions (probably LSD-induced) and the obstacles he faced during the preparation of the movie. He said himself that he wanted to create a mind-changing movie for the entire generation of youth, a movie which induces hallucinations for the viewer without having to take LSD, and in my opinion, that is the core of the entire problem, the cause of his failure. Jodorowsky is a true representative of the avantgarde in the 60's and 70's. It was a generation of people who tried to find some bigger truth and to provoke the establishment, all that with the help of mind-altering drugs, mysticism, lots of sex and horrible fashion, and ultimately they failed. Many movies from this period are violent, disgusting (here I mean sci-fi movies) and bizarre things, which are better left unseen. In this context, Jodorowsky thinks that his movies are deep, challenging and philosophical, but he is wrong. Confusing or strange or sick images are not deep. Bizarre brutality is not challenging of philosophical. It is what it is. The only thing which cannot be disputed is Jodorowsky energy which he uses to convince people that nothing is something. His enthusiasm for his project is great but I cannot perceive his rationale behind his actions, his only criteria for everything is his intuition, which led him to make a bizarre cast for the movie. Enough to begin with Salvador Dali (whose demands were ridiculous) as the Emperor of the Galaxy, then Orson Wells (whose demands were also ridiculous) as baron Harkonnen. These two egos on the stage would have probably never be able to cooperate. He continues with Mick Jagger as Feyd Harkonnen and Dalis muse Amanda Lear as princess Irulan. For the soundtrack he chose Pink Floyd and a group named Magma. From his scenario we can see how he imagined the costumes and it reminds greatly of ?Flash Gordon" from 1980. Everything looks bizarre, campy and ridiculous. As for the story, he made some big changes in his script, which were unnecessary in my opinion and did not contribute to the movie at all. He was not ready to make any compromises with anyone so he did not want to cooperate with Douglas Trumbull, the special effects expert from that time, only because he didn't like him. The length of the movie was estimated at 12 hours or more, which scared and banished all the movie companies in Hollywood. And of course, anybody in Hollywood who has seen Jodorowskys other movies would be frightened by a prospect of letting him do a movie without any creative control. All in all, a must-see documentary for all science fiction and ?Dune"-fans, which must be grateful Jodorowsky failed to put his vision on the big screen. It would have probably be overlong, campy, bizarre, brutal, frustrating ordeal with lousy special effects, but however it would have become a cult movie (probably impossible to watch sober), if nothing else then for it's strangeness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie having read most of the Frank Herbert books and not being aware of this movie that was never made. Okay so it has connections to modern sci-fi movies having had people that were working on it then go and work on other films but man - this movie is all dialogue: people talking at the camera about what could have been, what should have been and really there's only so much of that I can take before falling asleep. The movie they're talking about is probably one of the greatest movies NEVER made - but this is one of the slowest, boring movies ever made. I apologise to everyone who really loved this - I see where you're coming from but balancing that out this is one slow moving, yawn-fest if you don't know what you're in for. The guy's a genius.

		<shortDescription>It definitely required a touch of madness from all involved to attempt such an undertaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"'Dune' will be the coming of a god," exclaims writer/director Alejandro Jodorowsky, who had set out to make a tremendously ambitious, mind-blowing epic that would change the public's perceptions of movie-going forever ? starting in 1974. But it was not to be. For the most part, the monumental amount of work that went into the conceptualization, over a 2 ? year period, is documented in a book (of which there are only two left in the world) designed to sell the project, kept at Jodorowsky's home. The film could have been "Star Wars" before that singular space opera masterpiece influenced generations of viewers, or bigger and more resonant than "2001: A Space Odyssey." Its failure to reach fruition is a tale of what is likely the greatest sci-fi movie never made.Jodorowsky had been driving people crazy ever since the riot-inducing "Fando and Lis," started in 1967; his revolutionary "El Topo," and the following million-dollar-budgeted "The Holy Mountain" of 1973 were similarly met with awe. Perhaps his most winning quality was complete artistic control over his pictures. In 1974, with producer Michel Seydoux, a castle in France was rented as the base of operations for writing the filmic adaptation of "Dune." Author Frank Herbert's work was a worldwide publishing success and the holy bible of science-fiction devotees, though the rights were obtained for practically nothing, as if Hollywood was certain it could not be shaped into a marketable movie.Jodorowsky wanted to make a film that would give audiences a fabrication of the effects of LSD; a visual experience as close to the hallucinatory effects of the crystalline compound without actually taking the drug. To tackle this lofty aspiration, he sought out creative warriors, ranging from visual effects technician Douglas Trumbull (who was dropped due to clashing spiritual wavelengths), to famous artist Jean "Moebius" Giraud (tasked with sketching over 3000 storyboard panels), to Dan O'Bannon, the production designer and editor of John Carpenter's "Dark Star." He went on to approach actor David Carradine, the band Pink Floyd, his own son Brontis for the lead character of Paul, spaceship artist Chris Foss, the eccentric Salvador Dali and his muse Amanda Lear, iconic Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger (before he would work on Ridley Scott's "Alien"), Andy Warhol's great actor Udo Kier, the inimitable Mick Jagger, and the sizable Orson Welles, among many other talented people.It definitely required a touch of madness from all involved to attempt such an undertaking. It was to initiate with a lengthy "Touch of Evil" opening scene (but better!), intended to be a tracking shot traversing the entire galaxy before zeroing in on spice pirates, and included sand worm confrontations, Baron Harkonnen's head-shaped fortress outfitted with huge knifelike barriers, Paul's messiah-like demise, and a riveting finale, altered drastically from the source material. The visionary ideas are breathtaking, but combining the likelihood of exceeding the $15 million budget and studios' notable fears of Jodorowsky's spectacularly unconventional filmmaking, the entire product was just too ahead of its time to take a chance on.The documentary itself chronicles a bit of Jodorowsky's career leading up to "Dune" (with clips of his strikingly bizarre films), interviews with intrigued filmmakers and critics, numerous artists involved with the doomed production, and Alejandro himself, imparting plenty of details about his endeavors. Significant points of the storyline are explained, accompanied by paintings and animations, but the vastly different avenues explored for this take on Herbert's creation regularly begs for greater enlightenment. Colorful illustrations repeatedly pose the general reality that the optical translation couldn't possibly have been accomplished in 1975. There's also amusing commentary on the reception of David Lynch's long-awaited 1984 version. And yet, despite many staggering images, from a technical standpoint, the documentary is standard at best. A surprising amount of time is spent hearing Jodorowsky slowly narrate the processes of recruitment, seconds are wasted on a cat being picked up and held, and the lack of more prominent, current industry talent for interviews is disappointing.- The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The tale of a madman and his quest for transcendence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tale of one of the greatest films never made, Jodorowsky's Dune? The documentary goes little into what the film would have been and more the process that Jodorowsky himself went on to get it made (or not made at that). But as Jodorowsky preaches about his "prophet film" that would change the world and be the greatest of all time, it simply isn't convincing, at all. It comes across more like a madman who is enlisting a plethora of great talented men with false promises of self-described great art, religion and spirituality. I will not conceit like many people blindly will that Dune would have been the greatest film ever, changing the very fabric of cinema and of culture - in the end, it is not for anyone to say, not even Jodorowsky, that Dune would have been anything - not great, not bad, not a prophet or a messiah - the only thing it was was not made. I also completely disagree with Jodorowsky's and the film's conclusion that the film wasn't made because people were afraid, it was only Jodorowsky and his blind control of the film that destroyed any feasible chances of the film being made. He could have quite as easily said that he would make the film 2 and a half hours long, and then maybe push his luck with the running time into 3 hours. Many also believe that "the Dune book" was an incalculable influence on sci-fi and fantasy cinema, drawing many similarities, from Star Wars' lightsabre duels to but all but one of them are contrived; the only one that isn't is the Alien creature from Ridley Scott's film, which Giger went on to design, directly taking concepts from his own work in Dune.But with all this, isn't the documentary meant to insight discussion?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jodorowsky's Dune</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only discovered this documentary after it was mentioned in a movie thread by a fellow flick lover. I'll be honest with the fact that I'm not overly aware of director Jodorowsky and his work so I went into this totally blind only knowing about the classic sci-fi epic that is Dune.It all starts off with a relatively in depth look at Jodorowsky's previous work leading up to his Dune attempt. We learn about films such as 'El Topo' and 'The Holy Mountain' which appear to be his most famous works, films I have never seen or heard of admittedly but 'El Topo' does look the more interesting to me being a violent western. Its here that we learn how Jodo thinks, how he sees things, his imagination, creations and ideas, and basically one word sums it all up...surreal.This doc explains how Jodo travelled all across Europe to lure various big names to his project trying to get his unique vision off the ground. The doc shows us lots of small sketches drawings and a small animated example of the way ideas were going, in all honesty there isn't a lot to be shown really. I was hoping for lots of big Ralph McQuarrie type paintings giving a clearer picture but alas no. Many of the images are unfinished or purely examples, not even the final idea, and half of which looked pretty terrible to me but that's a personal opinion. Everything has now been put into a ginormous book which I believe has the complete plot in hand drawn black and white pencil storyboard form (panels) with colour extras. Thing is we don't really get to see that much in this doc, maybe there isn't that much to see and what we do see is all there is.Most of the doc is mainly dialog from various people involved with Jodo on the project at different stages. They discuss every aspect of the production including bits which I found more interesting such as approaching H.R. Giger and Chris Foss the sci-fi artist about design work, both of which resulting in some typically unusual yet familiar concept work. Intriguing to see Dan O' Bannon was also involved with this project for special effects...which most probably led the way for another certain alien film and probably influenced his imagination. What I found the most arousing was the possible casting choices by Jodo, whether or not these stars would have been used in the final film is anyone's guess but its a strange bunch. Orson Welles as 'Baron Harkonnen' really felt like a bad choice to me and simply made because he was very fat at the time, Salvador Dali probably because Jodo was part of the surrealist movement which is hardly any kind of surprise and Mick Jagger as 'Feyd-Rautha' who did look the part but again was mainly thought of because of his fame at the time. Many of the outfits designed for these characters also varied drastically, from more grounded Star Wars type styles to very bright bold and colourful costumes that were garish and oddly revealing, especially Jagger's which was pretty much a male dominatrix getup. The only guy that seemed to fit the film to me was David Carradine, but again he was only chosen due to his current popularity and not because he may or may not have fit the role.Overall I think this film was too much of a personal pet project for Jodorowsky, he clearly wanted to make the film desperately and gets frustrated during the doc. But from what I can gather he was casting people mainly because he simply liked them or they were popular, he cast his son as 'Paul Atreides' which kinda comes across as nepotism to me, he alters much of the book to suit himself and despite some groundbreaking concepts for effects and visuals, again his own taste seems to be heavily influencing the story of Dune. Any director must be happy with his vision sure, they will want to add their own style to it but Jodo seems to lose the concept of Dune in places to me and its only his creative team that kept him in check.Bottom line I can't help but feel this film may have ended up like the cheesy 1980 'Flash Gordon' flick. A mixture of electro synth rock with a traditional score in places (Peter Gabriel, Pink Floyd and progressive rock?), possibly tawdry or gaudy visuals and loud hammy over the top performances. Seeing as Jodo was taking drugs during this time (he got O'Bannon high to sell his idea to him!) I worry that this film would have felt more like a hallucinogenic hippie ride than a sci-fi space opera. I'm sure the effects would have been good in places but they were really breaking new ground at the time (1975-76) so who knows how that could of gone. Jodo went against '2001' effects wizard Trumbull so the possibility of a realistic Dune universe may have been lost with him.An absorbing documentary which definitely digs deep into the buried layers of a film that some call a lost epic. Jodorowsky is a true visionary no doubt but I'm not sure if his vision, at least some of it, was right for Dune. The only disappointment for me here was I was kinda expecting much more visual concept work to be show, seemed a bit thin on the ground to me. Never the less highly engrossing stuff that any sci-fi buff should enjoy. I would be very interested to see Jodorowsky's vision filmed now.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Documentary But The Jodorowskys Dune Would Have Been Rubbish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this last night. As documentaries go about a doomed project, it was okay. Interesting in places with interesting characters and a decent story. As for failed projects, I am sure there are many. but why did this failure merit a documentary, the reason of course it was connected to Dune. In literature there are few SciFi books that invoke depth of feelings and reverence that Dune does, when Scifi fans first read this book, it becomes an event and a book you never forget. It's epochal in scale, it not only creates a universe but a world which even now seems possible and could actually exist. Although that book and its follow ups have great set pieces of a desert planet, giant worms, guild highliners, great characters, battles, spirituality, and other ideas that make your head zing. Ultimately the book is about human beings and their loyalties, their loves, hates, but ultimately the books are about power and power is the crux of it. If an adaptation focuses to much on the world Herbert created and forget that,the project wont work.I first read the books when I was 15. again when I was 30 and recently I listened to the audiobooks. Each time I noticed something new in the tales and it was like visiting the saga for the first time. I didn't mind the David Lynch effort. But it was to compressed, camp and lacked story in favour of spectacle. The TV series was better but ham in places, too cheap and it omitted too much detail, it lacked a gravitas and balance. If they are going to successfully put the saga to screen a HBO series like Game of thrones is the only way to go.As to what I think Jodorowsky's Dune would have been like. I believe us Dune fans were saved from Jodorowky's "rape" of the story. From his creation of Duke Leto being castrated and Paul conceived by a drop of the dukes blood in some act of magic, to the end of "his" story, where the universe achieves cosmic consciousness from Paul's death. Then using his own son to star as Paul, which to me is more evidence of self indulgence. To spite the reverence some of the contributors say about what could have been, I shout "The emperor has no clothes" this film would have been complete and utter incomprehensible, unwatchable shyte. LSD or self indulgence do NOT make good films, so thank you Hollywood in your wisdom for not supporting this abortion of the original novel as it would have been absolute dribble. I give it a 7/10 for the way it provoked me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot say if I liked the documentary or not. It shows the lifelong obsession of a guy to make a specific adaptation from Frank Herbert's Dune, how he did 99% of the work only to be turned down by the money people in Hollywood. Brilliant, uncompromising, ahead of his time, Jodorowsky is being interviewed now, when he is an 80 year old man, bitter from the failure of the film. I think this is what bothered me most. People described him as this brilliant charismatic man, but I only saw the self-important old man that ruined his son's life to turn him into the perfect lead actor for his film.Other than that, the information contained in it alone makes the film worth watching. It gives you direct connection to the creational process: how to write the story, how to find the people that can draw it on paper, how to woo the actors, how not to present a movie to accountants and so on.As a Herbert fan, especially Dune, I didn't like very much how Jodorowsky wanted to change the story, but imagine a project having the likes of Dali, Giger, Orson Welles, Mick Jagger and others. He didn't like Lynch's version of Dune either, which I think was great - compared to most other Lynch movies that I dislike. It was painful to realize that, if I would have been the Hollywood producer, I would have turned down the movie as well, probably. Yet at the end I could not not admire the man and his passion for movie making.A movie definitely worth watching, but I still don't know if I liked it or not.</fullReview>

JODOROWSKY'S DUNE is a true treat for film buffs but the doc suffers from the same platitudes you'd expect from a VH1 documentary. Everything is brilliant, the best, superb, and ground- breaking. Jodorowsky is referred to as a genius repeatedly. Really? His DUNE sounds both fascinating and trite at the same time. It would have been wonderful to have this film produced but what would have been the outcome? Planning does not a masterwork make.
