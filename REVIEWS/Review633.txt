		<shortDescription>It's Still Alive!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You know this story. The crackling lightning. The mad genius. An unholy creation."And so opens up the lastest interpretation of Mary Shelley's legendary novel-turned-pop culture myth. So, what does this version add to the time-tested tale? Surprisingly, a fair amount.An amalgamation of various film versions (taking most of its cues from Universal and Hammer), this film tells the origins of Victor Frankenstein through the eyes of a nameless hunchback who, after a quick and very nasty surgery, is dubbed Igor. It tells the story of how the world around Victor reacts to his experiments, from the conniving entrepeuneur to the over-zealous man of faith trying to stop him. And how does it all hold up? Again, surprisingly really well. The chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy sparks the film up quite a few notches while Andrew Scott, Jessica Brown Findlay and Freddie Fox all make good work of their admittedly under-developed supporting roles.The direction by Paul McGuigan is energetic and lively, even if the pace is a tad too frenetic at times. The use of practical effects for the monstrosities that our heroes bring to life are impressive to behold and everything is boasted by a powerfully theatrical score by Craig Armstrong and some beautiful production design by Eve Stewart. As I said, pacing is a tad too fast and certain bits of writing could've used some tweaking, but the cast and enthusiastic direction definitely make this a more than worthy entry into the Frankenstein mythos that I will gladly welcome into my collection as soon as it makes its to Blu-Ray/DVD.I'm pleased to say that it is very much alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's (barely) Alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. If a filmmaker is going to mess with the classics, there are two paths of creativity from which to choose: stay true to the original, or put a new spin on it. In this case, the classics in question are the nearly 200 year old novel from Mary Shelley (1818) and the nearly 85 year old movie from James Whale (1931). The filmmakers doing the messing are director Paul McGuigan (Lucky Number Slevin) and screenwriter Max Landis (son of director John). The spin they chose was (in theory) to tell the story from the perspective of Igor, the loyal assistant to Dr. Frankenstein.It's an interesting approach, but one that immediately presents a problem ? since the title they chose was not "Igor", but rather Victor Frankenstein. The film does begin with Igor's backstory in the circus as a hunchbacked clown/amateur doctor, and the character does provide some early and late narration. The conundrum stems from the fact that pretty much everything else in the movie is centered on the mad scientist, rather than the skilled apprentice/partner.Daniel Radcliffe plays Igor and James McAvoy plays Victor Frankenstein (not Fron-kin-steen, in a nod to Mel Brooks), and both actors seem to be doing everything possible to bring energy and enthusiasm to a movie that can't seem to decide if it's a reboot or a reimagining or simply an origin story. Radcliffe effectively uses his physicality as the circus clown who is so mistreated and misunderstood, and McAvoy is such a hyper-active mad scientist that I'm sure his fellow actors many times were inclined to advise "say it, don't spray it". McAvoy does seem to be having a grand old time playing the brilliant yet unhinged young doctor-to-be, and to his credit takes a much different approach than Colin Clive when he gets to the infamous line "It's ALIVE!" The best parts of the movie are the intricate and amazing sets, the monster himself (albeit too brief), and the expert use of classical music and film score. The circus sets are colorful and active, while Frankenstein's soap factory home/laboratory is fascinating and creative, and the final Scotland castle on a cliff is breath-taking. Pulleys, chains and cranks are everywhere ? as is an incredible amount of body parts, organs and fluids.After a very well done circus opening, we are jarred with a seemingly out of place action sequence involving a slo-motion chase and fight scene that seems to be attempting to mimic some of the recent Sherlock Holmes movie stunts. Here they are unwelcome and ruin the flow. Another aspect that seems forced and unnecessary is a romantic interlude between Igor and a trapeze artist (played by Jessica Brown Findlay). It feels like an add-on to remind us that it's supposed to be Igor's story. Additionally, Andrew Scott plays an intriguing Scotland Yard Inspector who is every bit as obsessed with his faith-based beliefs as Victor is with his science-has-no-bounds stance. A story told from the Inspector's perspective might have worked, but instead it comes across as another add-on. Another add-on is the filthy rich and very devious fellow med student (played by Freddie Fox) who agrees to fund the experiments, but mostly the character is an after-thought necessary to move the plot along. Wasted is the always menacing Charles Dance, who has but one scene as Victor's strongly disapproving daddy.A combination of the romance, minimal role of Igor in the grand finale, the medical school bumbling, the clunky Inspector involvement, and the all too brief monster appearance makes the film all but impossible for viewers to connect. They tell us twice "You know the story ? a crack of lightning, a mad genius, and an unholy creation", but the reality is, the fact that we know the story, makes this one all the more disappointing. It's fun to look at, but is lacking the depth and soul that has allowed Shelley's book to stand up over two centuries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than it has any right to be, this revisionist spin on the classic Mary Shelley creation finds its heart in the men behind the monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You know this story. A crack of lightning. A mad genius. An unholy creation," intones Daniel Radcliffe's Igor Strausman, who warns us at the start not to expect a literal re-telling of Mary Shelley's beloved horror classic. Instead, as imagined by writer Max Landis, this latest spin focuses on the relationship between the titular mad genius ? played by James McAvoy ? and his trusty associate Igor who becomes instrumental to his dream of re-animating the dead. Yes, though Victor first meets Igor as a nameless hunchback at the circus, the latter is in fact a gifted physician whose knowledge of the human anatomy makes him invaluable to Victor's plan of assembling various organs into an outer shell and introducing life into it.But even before that, Victor recognises something special in the filthy clown with the rat's nest of a hair who rushes to the aid of a trapeze artist Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay) following a near- fatal fall during a show and manipulates her bones in order to save her life. So Victor decides to give the destitute sad-sack a new lease of life by first busting him out of the circus, where at his cavernous home cum laboratory, he proceeds to drain the fluid from the young man's massive abscess, fit him with a back brace, and give him the name of his absent flatmate Igor whom Victor says is a morphine addict who has not been seen for months. Igor is indebted to Victor, and so without much question, assists his 'saviour' in his experiment to bring life to a homunculus stitched from animal- part discards from the local zoo.If you're waiting for the iconic hulking man-monster to appear, let us warn you that you'll have to wait until the very finale, which takes place on a very stormy evening in a remote Scottish castle right next to the sea. Indeed, this is less a movie about Victor actually creating his monster and what happens afterward than about the process leading up to that pivotal moment, which its director Paul McGuigan centres on a debate between theology and technology as well as an emotional complement in the bond between Victor and Igor. To introduce the former into the narrative, McGuigan interrupts the scientific proceedings with the entry of a moralistic Scotland Yard detective (Andrew Scott), whose past has not only made him a man of unwavering faith but also obsessed with stopping Victor's experiments he perceives as Satanic.It is also this said inspector who causes Igor to question Victor's research, especially in the wake of Victor's Royal College of Medicine presentation of his first hodgepodge Prometheus which unsurprisingly does not end well. Not unsurprising too is how Victor is constructed as both the emotional and moral centre of the film ? though he starts off subservient to Victor, Igor struggles with the ethical implications of using science to achieve immortality, which ultimately leaves him conflicted with the dilemma of sticking by the person who had rescued him from eternal ignominy or following his own conscience. Igor also finds his heart with Lorelei, who makes a somewhat amazing recovery to help Igor find his centre of being.Though the romance is contrived, McAvoy and Radcliffe are actors with charm and gravitas, and they make good use of both qualities to keep us engaged in their bromance. McAvoy overdoes the mad-genius bit on more than one occasion, but is on the whole appropriately brash and obsessed to play the brilliant, extroverted yet socially bizarre Victor. At least Radcliffe complements his partner with a nicely understated performance, which expresses his character's anguished, good-hearted and conflicted nature at various points. Next to Victor, Igor is a much more straightforward persona, but Radcliffe does what he can to make us empathise with the latter's plight.On his part, McGuigan keeps a tight balance between horror, drama, romance and even a few spots of comedy, while ensuring that the pace doesn't sag. No stranger to Victorian-era London from directing several episodes of 'Sherlock', he forgoes more handsome evocations for a more grimy and downbeat vision of 19th-century London that is more befitting of the grotesqueness of Victor's creations. Oh yes, despite the rating, you'd do well to note that some images are absolutely not for the squeamish, in particular because the film does not shy away from displaying the various organs of the body which Victor uses to assemble his unhuman work of science.As an origin story, you could do much, much worse than 'Victor Frankenstein', which is loud and messy all right, but has a quieter, more grounded centre on its arguments of faith versus science as well as a compelling relationship between its two lead characters. That's provided of course that you're willing to accept a revisionist take in the first place, with Frankenstein played as a soulless hulk that is prone to violence but nothing more and relegated almost to an afterthought right at the end. Like we said, this isn't about the monster as we typically know it, but the journey leading up to its creation, one that is undeniably intriguing in itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stitched together from archaic fable tricks, Viktor Frankenstein is an empty vessel at heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the Frankenstein name is indeed cursed, there hasn't been a great Frankenstein based movie in years, even decades. From last year's I, Frankenstein to Van Helsing who only has it as subplot, all have met mediocre fate. Now armed with robust acting power and visual that oozes Victorian era, also a bit or horror and action attached somewhere, another rendition shares the same exact fate; cinematic tediousness.A slight modification to the narrative is made, just like Sherlock the movie is narrated from the sidekick's perspective, in this case Igor's (Daniel Radcliffe). Aside from that, there's barely anything new that hasn't been done in similar or better fashion. To its credit, it's not utterly terrible in term of presentation, in fact the visual is rather nice. It's quaintly dark and electric version of last decade metropolis, Tesla would approve.James McAvoy as the titular Viktor really tries hard on establishing the character. Given the stale material, he still manages to squeeze some emotional scenes as well as a good chemistry with Radcliffe in a bromantic kind of way. Andrew Scott from Moriarty fame, now plays the role of Inspector Turpin. He's the polar opposite of Viktor, conservative yet equally clever and ambitious.Unfortunately, the far too familiar plot fails to produce any thrill, the strong acting prowess ends up rehearsing the same routine of mad scientist's banter. There's screaming, philosophical argument, faux science and slight mental abuse by the two leads. It's a lot of noise of little dramatic effect. Not that the script is bad in any way, it has occasional witty lines although any hint of humor or charm is muffled by the overly melancholy tone.At some points, the movie tries to dabble in horror, action and even romance subplot. The atmosphere is already primed for thriller, but the shocking abomination is ironically timid and unmemorable. Action consists of a few scenes of slow motions repetition. Despite the production offering distractions, the main story line is very straightforward and streamlined, and sadly also predictable.For all the star and flair, though they might be mildly amusing, the end product is a medium so lacking of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's alive?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening shot, blurry, a figure moving in slow motion, brought to my mind a scene in the book of the monster seen going across the snow- covered landscape from a distance, ... but that is about as close to the book as the film gets, which is both good and bad. It's good because it tells an original take on the story, but it's also bad because it tells a mostly satirical story, told from Igor's perspective, largely poking fun at the clichés in the various film versions of Frankenstein, rather than a faithful adaptation of the novel.James McAvoy hams it up as Victor Frankenstein, with a brilliant intro ("Might I know your name?" Igor asks him, Vic turns to look at Igor, freeze frame, title appears) while the rest of the cast downplays it nicely, Jessica Findlay is quite attractive, even in the unrevealing Victorian-era clothing. The film is sightly more serious than its comedic-looking trailer made it appear. Good sets and costumes, and some quick witted, sharp dialogue, but the story never really comes alive (pun totally intended)Curiously released at Thanksgiving 2015, it might have fared better than its $600.000 opening if it had been released at Halloween. Considering this was filmed in late 2013, it surely must have been ready for Halloween 2015, or 2014 for that matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been so much better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard not to be cynical about Hollywood sometimes, particularly when it produces films as lazy as Victor Frankenstein, an uninspired origin story of Victor Frankenstein and his assistant, Igor Straussman. Before a chance meeting with Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy), a then nameless Igor (Daniel Radcliffe) worked as both a clown and a physician. A medical incident one night at the circus leads to their first meeting and Igor becoming Victor's assistant.Sharing a passion for medical science, the pair embark on a project to bring about life from death. After a few mishaps, Igor feels they should stop but Victor's drive to make a name for himself leads to the most volatile creation that even he thinks is too far.Right from the very beginning, Victor Frankenstein feels all over the place. Paul McGuigan directs the film as if he hadn't made his mind up on what sort of film this should be. Unfortunately, in the end he went with an edgy modern retelling of a classic tale that brutally highlights McGuigan's lack of imagination as a filmmaker.Considering the acting talent in Victor Frankenstein makes it even more of a disappointment. James McAvoy majorly hams it up as Victor, coming across as a mix between Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes and David Tennant's Doctor. Daniel Radcliffe, who I've never thought to be a very good actor, takes a step backwards with his portrayal of Igor, with awkward line delivery and no chemistry being his main problems here.They also manage to waste Andrew Scott, most famous for playing Moriarty in BBC's Sherlock, as a police detective on the tail of Victor. His character is so underwritten that Scott has little room to manoeuvre and ends up delivering one hell of a monotonous performance.Max Landis' story lacks any real punch and his script is daft yet not totally void of quality which, considering the history of this story that he had to work with, is a real shame. There are some good visual effects that lead to some entertaining moments and Craig Armstrong's score is a rare highlight in this ultimately disappointing film.I pray to God that the last scene isn't one that means we are going to get a sequel mind, because that is really what we could do without.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different enough to be worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are wondering what different things can they do for this very familiar story to make it worth watching - they do succeed in giving a fresh perspective - Igor's The cast is likable and watchable. Daniel Radcliffe is a good actor and his roles since Harry Potter are actually show his range. The transformation from hunchback to Igor is quite an extreme makeover. James McAvoy is a also a very convincing actor and acts obsessed enough. Despite both actors being small sized they can pull off a big action movie. Jessica Brown Findlay of Downton Abbey is a pretty love interest (for Igor no less) and her role isn't irritating.The first resurrected creature and organs are quite morbidly frightening for what they are.The ending is grand but kind of wonder what did Victor expect once they brought him to life? Anyway it's not necessary to look to deep into a story like this.Worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unfairly Maligned Film With Lots of Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what the trailers will try and tell you, "Victor Frankenstein" is in fact a fairly straightforward, character-driven drama about the relationship between mad scientist Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) and his hunchbacked assistant Igor Strausman (Daniel Radcliffe) that just happens to have a few monsters.Rather than remake the classic story (or should I say monster), "Victor Frankenstein" is a prequel revealing the origins of Dr. Frankenstein's most famous experiment. Effectively filling the gaps provided by Shelley's novel, this film provides a ghastly look at his first hideous, soulless attempts at creating life, which predate the sympathetic, flat-topped creature as portrayed by Boris Karloff that we all know and love. That being said, this film owes much more to the film adaptations of Frankenstein than the book itself. A tip-off is the prominent inclusion of Igor, an invention not of Shelley's but of Universal Studios, who cast the incomparable Dwight Frye as Fritz in James Whale's "Frankenstein" (1931), which morphed in Ygor and finally Igor in subsequent sequels and adaptations. Bearing a somewhat misleading title, the film is really Igor's story. Working as a nameless freak in a circus due to his physical deformity (which Radcliffe portrays brilliantly; he could be the next Lon Chaney Sr.), he is a stranger to kindness until he meets Victor, who recognizes his brilliant mind and vast medical knowledge. Igor is given a new appearance, a new name, and a new life by his generous benefactor, on the condition that he work as Victor's partner and assistant, bringing his expertise to animating individual body parts for use in the highly-strung medical student's unholy enterprise. Victor, in his megalomania, as the "creator" of Igor, demands his complete loyalty, something that is easy for the grateful younger man to give until he strikes up a romance with Lorelei, the aerialist he worshiped from afar during his time at the circus. Slowly, he begins to see beyond his unwavering devotion to the disturbed madness of Victor's mania for creating life out of death.To add to the conflict, Victor and Igor find themselves being pursued by the Javert-like Inspector Turpin (Andrew Scott), who, as a man as consumed by his religion as Victor is by his rejection of it, refuses to rest until he and his ungodly experiments are brought to an end. This gives the film a chance to explore the cautionary message present in Shelley's novel about trying to control to forces of nature in further depth than simply showing the misbegotten monsters alone.Visually, "Victor Frankenstein" is a treat. Turn-of-the-century London is portrayed in equal parts glittery and grimy, with period-appropriate costumes and hair adding to the effect. You can't have a "Frankenstein" movie without a few dead bodies, and this film is not shy about showing the various viscera, though it is all for a purpose and is far from excessive, with much less blood, gore, and grotesqueness than I was expecting. Much more is implied than actually shown in detail. As someone who avoids modern horror films for their indulgence, I applaud the filmmakers' restraint. The action scenes, which number precisely four and take up less than a quarter of the film's one-hour and forty-nine minute running time, are brief but intense, though rather tame when compared with your average action movie. They give Radcliffe a chance to utilize his gift for physicality, which he plays to the fullest. Yet for all its trappings as a horror film, the heart of "Victor Frankenstein" is the relationship between Victor and Igor. Both social misfits, they find themselves appreciated for who they are for the first time in their lives. It soon becomes very clear that Igor is the only real friend Victor has in the world, and that the latter, for all his grandiloquence, needs his lowlier creation more than Igor needs him. The chemistry between Radcliffe and McAvoy is there and is what makes the entire film tick. They both give equally strong performances individually, with McAvoy perfectly capturing the monomaniacal, socially awkward mad genius, a sharp complement to Radcliffe's soulful, loyal, levelheaded partner, but together they are a powerhouse, bringing delightful touches of humor and pathos to an otherwise rather serious film. More than once I felt myself growing teary-eyed. How many horror films can do that? As to the many negative reviews, I don't believe the critics and I watched the same movie. The pacing and focus was tight, the acting good, the film itself a rather straightforward drama with dashes of horror and action thrown in rather than a mixed bag, and the various subplots, rather than distracting from the main plot, came at the appropriate times, and helped to move it along. The only faults I found were the slight overuse of slow-motion in the action scenes, the rather quirky choice of superimposing anatomical drawings over various characters, and the script's occasionally on-the-nose dialogue (though Radcliffe and McAvoy's sincere performances made them less noticeable), but these are small qualms. Overall, there is much more to like than to dislike.My only explanation for all the hatred is that "Frankenstein" is a revered novel with a strong literary following; critics came in expecting a remake of the classic monster story, and after they were disappointed at what they saw as a desecration of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel, they took their vengeance out on this film, which never pretended to be an adaptation of that story in the first place. It goes without saying that if you're expecting a faithful facsimile of Shelley's novel or a 360-degree reinvention, you're in for a disappointment, because "Victor Frankenstein" is neither. But if you want to experience a well-acted, entertaining prequel to the classic story, you're in for a real treat.</fullReview>

The editing and script was so bad. Each scenes are very disconnected and scattered. It also feels very jumpy and certain places were not explained well. I especially hate how they use the title opening "Victor Frankenstein" as if it is a verbal line in the movie.. It was SO ODD!The lines were also very cheesy and clumsy, which you just wouldn't speak to each other like this in real life.

		<fullReview>Everyone else has made in depth reviews, but no one had explained why this movie totally fails to live up to its inception. The premise is established early on, Igor's perspective and his love for a woman, as well as the promise - we know what happens in the end. The movie, 50% in, departs into the all to common trash heap of needless violence and leaves Igor standing in the wings doing nothing. What could have been an amazing study in humanity degrades to mindless slashing, screaming, and absurd carnage.It was very disappointing to leave the most interesting characters and plot points in the wings: the love interest of Igor, a brothers immortal bond, the parable of death and life as seen through Igor. The brother could have been a TRUE REVELATION but was cast aside for mindless violence. An original ending would have left Igor staring at the castle just before the "event" but not entering. We could have felt the pathos, experienced mystery and dread, actually felt a personal bond with the characters... but no. Mindless spectacle destroyed everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understandably not a totally strong "horror flick"; Victor Frankenstein, however, is a creative, likable, and fantastic movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We follow the story, mainly with Igor. Igor is taken in by Victor Frankenstein; His life flips upside down, they become a team, and we, the audience continue to follow the adventures, as well as embodiment of these two characters, as they both create a scientific breakthrough. Or in this case, reanimation. Honestly, I found this movie to be a little misspoken for. I can see where many were expecting non - stop occurrences with the reanimated creature we've all come to know and love. Before anything else of this review, there is little of that. But here's the thing, does that make this entire thing bad? No. This film was actually creative, and quite good. First off, I honestly love the charm, and creativity of this story. The entire execution of the film's telling of this entire tale, I found to be flawless. The entire telling fell within the amazing character chemistry between Igor, and Victor. Which, by the way, both Daniel Radcliffe, and James McAvoy had amazing chemistry together. You could watch, and feel the connection their characters, if that, actors shared together. The characters in this film, while on the topic, were all around great. I can't emphasize this enough, horror, if that, thriller's now, usually have unlikeable characters - But not here. This film has characters that you could actually bare with, characters that'll you'll grow to, and actually bond with, sharing feelings for their actions. Of course, however, you have a small collection of characters you grow to dislike, but of course by intend of the film itself. I personally found the entire, overall plot, and storyline to be charming. I found the rescue, and bonding of savior friendship between Igor, and Victor to be all around charming, and just flat out awesome. It thrills us, audience, while at the same time develop feelings for the characters. Moving to visual elements, first of all, I honestly loved the entire visual effects of this film. I felt as if it was beautiful, and succeeded in giving us a flat out, solid display of the Victorian era, or in other words steam-punk. It felt intriguing to look at, visual eye-candy as far as the eye can see, giving an attention - grabbing effect. The camera work compliments as well, giving us some pretty well placed shots of which show the action sequences, as well as the meaningful ones. Lastly. I honestly liked the creations. The re-animated figures looked distorted, something they're supposed to succeed at. It didn't look cheap, and honestly was great for the time they came around, with their grotesque features, not too gory, or disgusting, but at the same time not too light, or cheap. In conclusion, this film succeeds in a pleasant surprise. Once again, I can see where people get disappointed, as we see barely any real "Frankenstein" or in this case, the reanimated monster, at least not as much as many may of expected. However, the film succeeded in dismissing that, as we're giving many succeeding elements, including stunning visual effects, great, likable characters. I fun, at the same time thrilling story, and an overall unique charm that doesn't disappoint. Although, as said before this wasn't a strong "horror" but for what it was, aside the dismiss of the appearances of monsters, this was a fun film, enjoyable, and over all fantastic. I'd highly recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another adaptation of Mary Shelley's classic monster tale 'Frankenstein'; this one is told from Igor's point of view. It stars Daniel Radcliffe as Igor, and James McAvoy as Frankenstein. It also costars Jessica Brown Findlay, Andrew Scott and Freddie Fox. The film was directed by Paul McGuigan (who's also helmed movies like 'LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN' and 'WICKER PARK') and it was written by Max Landis (who also wrote 'CHRONICLE' and 'AMERICAN ULTRA'). The movie received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it horrifically bombed at the Box-Office (as well); it's not that bad though!The film actually tells the origin story of Igor (Radcliffe), Victor Frankenstein's (McAvoy) assistant. Igor was a hunchbacked circus clown, when the aspiring medical student, Victor Frankenstein, found him. Victor frees Igor, from his captors, and cures him of his giant cyst (and bad posture, because of it). He then enlists the surprisingly intelligent young man's help; in his extremely ambitious medical experiments. At first Igor is very excited, to be apart of such groundbreaking scientific work, but then he realizes Victor is insane; and his experiments are extremely dangerous.The movie is pretty cheesy, but somewhat entertaining. Radcliffe and McAvoy both give it their all, in their performances, and the directing is adequate. Landis's script is rather disappointing though, considering what a talented writer he's already proved to be; there's been many more original, and entertaining, adaptations of Shelley's classic work. Still, it's not nearly as bad as it's been made out to be.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/41q3ZuWGdEE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just wanted to give my two cents on a great movie that is not getting a lot of recognition. I went to the movie because I wanted to see James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe in a movie together. Not really because I like the story Frankenstein. I was pleasantly surprised by an interesting, intense, and very believable film. The cinematography was dark, sort of like the Moulin Rouge movie. It was just really good from start to finish. Clean acting and engrossing story. The scenes where they are bringing dead things back to life can be very graphic and disturbing at times. I thought this would have been a better release around Halloween with an R rating. But overall awesome movie. I liked it better than Bond, Mocking jay (both good), and the Good Dinosaur (not that good). I reflected on the movie long after I left the theater, which to me, means I saw a movie that got me thinking! Only reason I gave it a 9 is, well, a 10 is a tough score to get!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The world of course remembers the monster not the man, but sometimes when you look closely there's more to a tale. Sometimes the monster is the man." Victor Frankenstein (McAvoy) is an eccentric scientist who has a dream of creating life from death. After rescuing his assistant Igor (Radcliffe) from the circus he has finally found someone he can work with. After bringing to life a small animal he is approached and asked if he can make a human. Victor and Igor set out to change the world, but somethings should be left alone. A story this old that has been told and seen over and over again faces an up hill battle. How can you turn something like that into something fresh and new? This one really pulled that off. The story you know is here, with a few needed twists and additions. This movie deals more with the madness within Victor rather than the actual monster itself. The best way to describe this is a Frankenstein done in the style of the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes movies. A movie that is just fun to watch and really adds to the story that everyone knows in a way that does make it seem new and exciting. Overall, surprisingly good and a movie that I recommend if you want to be entertained for a few hours. I give this a B+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick production, decent acting, but a poor script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another retelling of Mary Shelley's horror tale Frankenstein, this one focuses more on action and downplays the horror. I went in with low expectations after the reviewers mostly panned it. Daniel Radcliffe stars as the hunchback Igor, Dr. Frankenstein's assistant. He works as a clown in the circus, backstory that was extrapolated on since Igor isn't even in the original novel. The hunchback is quickly dispelled in some ridiculous fashion about a puss filled growth on his back and his spine is straightened by a contraption so that Radcliffe can walk around normally and be a handsome lead. His performance wasn't terrible and I hope the Harry Potter actor continues to get interesting roles in movies.James McAvoy was entertaining as always as the mad scientist himself. He seemed trapped within the confines of the script and the tired retelling but usually he lights up the screen in any performance. There was a hint at a sequel at the end but I think that was just wishful thinking.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are no spoilers here, just a real person's true review. I almost did not watch this due to the overall reviews, and that would have been a shame, because I liked it. To all the naysayers looking for a solid track to the original story, this is a bit different. This a a completely different take. Parts of the movie were not so great, but overall, I LOVED IT.Depends on what you're looking for. If you are looking for a story perfectly true to original - not so much. This movie is a wonderful alternative view. I appreciate and really enjoyed the risk-taking and the different view. May not be for everyone, but thoroughly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different and good interpretation of Mary Shelley's novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despise the bad reviews from some viewers on IMDb I did enjoy Victor Frankenstein. There's been a lot of movies based on Mary Shelley's novel, some bad ones and some good ones, and I thought this version belongs to the good ones. It's a different approach but entertaining to watch. Daniel Radcliffe proves that he can act something else then Harry Potter. His collaboration with Victor Frankenstein played by James McAvoy works perfectly well in this dark picture. There are plenty enough moments of disgusting creatures and scenes to make the more sensation seekers happy. Why some people rate it so low remains a mystery to me. There are thousands of worse movies then this. I truly enjoyed it and I'm sure a lot of people will do also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you love the classic, you probably won't love this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My book club read Frankenstein last year, and while it was interesting, it was also drawn out, and boring in some parts. Since this is a movie version of it, the pace is much faster, and they took a lot of liberties with the book. In fact there is very little of the book remaining. But I didn't find that to be a bad thing, since this was an interesting re-telling of the story.The biggest difference is that in the book, Dr. Frankenstein does not have an assistant, especially not a humpback named Igor. Daniel Radcliffe's character does compliment the story, and allows us to see into Dr. F's mind, by him being the caring one, while Dr. F. can be the crazy one. In the book Dr. F. was both caring and crazy, but whereas you can read this description in the book, it would have been a lot harder to portray it in the movie.Igor doesn't stay a hunchback very long though, and what Dr. F. does to help him, was the most disgusting part of the movie. Just thinking about it makes me want to gag a little. After Igor no longer has his hump, he starts to interact with society, and finds that he enjoys it. This pushes Dr. F. into more of a rage since he feels as if he made Igor the man he now is, and Igor is not helping him as much as he wants.The only part of the movie that was similar to the book (at least that I can remember) is towards the end when Igor is climbing the giant mountain (although in the book, it was the Doctor). This was a pinnacle of tension in the book when the Dr. went to find the monster. In the movie, it was another pinnacle.Although there is very little of the book in this movie, I still really enjoyed it. The action scenes were intense, and the gore was a good amount, and made sense with the plot. Not gore, just for the sake of gore. As long as the classic isn't one of your favorites, I would say give this movie a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A circus clown who studies anatomy in his spare time. One day the circus' female trapeze acrobat Lorelei fell from the ropes. The clown, and a doctor Victor Frankenstein, rushed to her side. Igor managed to help the girl breathe again. The circus owner denies the clown's talents and locks him away. Victor frees him and they escape. Victor takes him as a his new flatmate and cures his hunchback, assuming the identity of his former flatmate Igor. The next day sees Igor's face on wanted posters, but Victor convinces him he's now a new man since he's no hunchback anymore like the posters describe. He helps on Victor's experiments. Victor takes Igor to a party where he sees the now well Lorelei. She thanks him for saving her. They then chat with Victor. At home Victor reveals his major project which has been possible from Igor's help; a creature sewn from different species cadavers. They manage to give life to it. The next day Victor brings the thing to a presentation. But it escapes, almost killing Igor until Victor reluctantly kills it. But with Finnegan supporting financially, Victor gets bolder, building an intelligent man instead of a beast. Detective Turpin who's on the circus case comes to Victor's place, seeing a link to the case. But Victor dismisses them due to they having no warrant. Victor's father comes and warns him harshly due to Victor's school informs that he's neglecting studies. But Igor encourages the down spirited Victor, inspiring him to build the man with 'augmentations'. Near the project's completion, Victor delays it to give Igor a night off with Lorelei. The next morning the police try to barge into Victor's place so Igor sneaks past them inside. Not wanting the police confiscate his experiment, Victor push the schedule forward to bring the man alive. Turpin gets in, holding Victor at gunpoint. They struggle, ending in Victor and Igor escaping with Finnegan's help while Turpin loses a hand. Finnegan tries to kill Igor by drowning him. He survives and Lorelei helps him. Igor and Lorelei soon goes to Victor. Turpin follows them. Igor finds Victor but the doctor doesn't heed and instead continue on with the experiment. The man shows signs of life after being zapped by lightning. But another lightning strikes the tower, chaining incidents that kills Finnegan. The man, the Frankenstein monster, lives. Victor talks to him as if he's his brother Henry. But Turpin shoots it, angering it. Victor finally heeds Igor and with him battles the monster. Igor manages to stab it's heart but with two hearts, the monster rises again. Victor manages to finally kill it.Well, having actors like Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy, and a story base that has been so popular over the many decades, prove to be a challenge to big for the movie creators to handle. The story feels so bland that all the story developments didn't give any sense of surprise or interest.Even as the story serve the tale from the new fresh perspective of Igor, it fails to give anything that wows the audience. It made sense for me. The movie made Igor tell the story. But the story itself is about Victor, which made the focus kind of wanders off from time to time between the two. This creates the weird mood on the movie, particularly on the latter parts when the focus shifts interchangeably between Victor and Igor very often.The movie also fails to center itself on the many values it had spotlights on. There are things about potential heresy, scientific advancement, past trauma, reluctant friendship, and also the thing with the detective Turpin. All those many plots and subplots didn't have any that gets the movie's main and center focus. They all get adequate introduction to make the audience care about them, but they didn't seem to have the adequate conclusion.The acting overall is surprisingly quite low in my view. James McAvoy didn't really get it right as a Russian in London at that time frame. Daniel Radcliffe nailed his part better, although I must say that the movie itself didn't really give enough depth to the clown and Igor. Jessica Brown Findlay's role felt like she's there only to get that bed scene in the movie.For me Victor Frankenstein (2015) deserves only a 5 out of 10 score. I really don't recommend you wasting money for this on the cinemas as there are many better alternatives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As lifeless as a long forgotten cadaver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to say exactly who thought Victor Frankenstein was a good idea, but my suggestion would be that they're highly unlikely to have offers rolling across their table in the near future as Paul McGuigan's reimagining of Mary Shelley's classic tale is on par if ever so slightly more tolerable than its recent near namesake I, Frankenstein, which is to say, Victor Frankenstein is most certainly dead on arrival.There was never a hope that even the most electrified jolt of movie lightning was ever going to breathe life into this far too serious and downright muddled wannabe blockbuster event with American Ultra writer Max Landis delivering a ham fisted script that re-jigs Victor Frankenstein's scientific exploits with hunchbacked Igor into a tale of circus freaks, animal parts and terrible romantic subplots and with McGuigan's direction lacking any of the energy he bought to his previous films Push and Lucky Number Slevin, Victor Frankenstein's 110 minute runtime feels like a lifetime of mood lighting and damp grungy sets.There's effort to shock the movie into becoming entertaining in brief moments of action, like a circus escape and a college lecture gone wrong but with those scenes failing to ignite the film along with a misguided and lacking finale, Victor Frankenstein' hopes lay as dormant as a long forgotten cadaver.Another huge problem with this overly glum and lifeless creation is the pairing of James McAvoy as the charmless Victor and Daniel Radcliffe (horribly miscast) as the charisma free circus gimp turned Igor as the two actors struggle to forge any type of on screen chemistry together and had the film somehow managed to get these two characters to gel in a reasonable fashion, there's a small chance this trashy piece of Hollywood filmmaking gone wrong could've become a cult favourite or at the very least a so bad its good oddity.For the many varied fans of Shelley's original story, Victor Frankenstein should be avoided at all costs and while there are brief flashes of an entertaining reimaging on show here, McGuigan's film is as a whole a thoroughly unenjoyable creation that has neither the life within nor the heart to work on any level. A deserved box office dud, Victor Frankenstein is unquestionably not alive.1 set of lungs out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A watchable movie but it could have been better! 4/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: This is yet another remake, which turned out to be a big let down! James McAvoy plays Victor Frankenstein well but I found Daniel Radcliffe (Igor), quite annoying, and he seemed to be in the way most of the time. I was impressed with his acting, when he was playing the Hunchback with no name but as soon as he teamed up with Victor, McAvoys acting and screen charisma over-powered Radcliffe. With that aside, the main problem with the film is that it takes way too long for Frankstein to come to life, and when he finally does, it looked awful. It looked like a big slab of clay, more than a huge monster, and the weird looking monkey also looked a right mess. On the plus side, the chemistry between Radcliffe and McAvoy was half decent and the the action scenes weren't bad but the storyline took way too long to get going and I wasn't too impressed with the ending. I'm not surprised that the movie made a lose at the box office because there isn't any memorable moments and it didn't do this classic concept any justice. At the end of the day, it's better than the Robert DeNiro version but it's still not that great. Disappointing!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Paul McGuigan, 52, who also brought you Gangster No. 1 in 2000, The Reckoning, Wicker Park, Lucky Number Slevin and Push, so he has some experience when it comes to big scale movies. Personally, I think that he could have done more with Radcliffe's character and there wasn't much depth to the other actors, which I found quite disappointing. The love story was also weak and the whole look of the film was quite dull. Its still a watchable movie, from an entertainment point of view but I did expect more, mainly because of today's technology and the fact that these young actors have a lot of experience in the period genre.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $34millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/sci-fi/horrors, starring Daniel Radcliffe, James McAvoy, Jessica Brown Findlay, Bronson Webb, Daniel Mays and Spencer Wilding. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems to me that the more versions we have of Mary's Shelly's book the more defined her characters become. In this versions it is Igor who relates the saga. From his (Daniel Radcliffe) perspective the audience shares the story view from the Hunchback's point of view. In doing so the tale is broaden and the movie itself is enlarged to see it from his life. In this way, it is he who tells the story and he is transformed from a minor character to a intelligent being who shares the credit the creation of The Monster (Spencer Wilding) along with Victor Frankenstein) The movie is great and the special direction it is given spins off in a new and orbit. It is well acted and the audience is well deserved of the new appreciation from this version. Well done and with it a new Classic is born. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The good, the bad, and the ugly...and that's just the production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problems here are deep, though there are a few rewards, as well.First, since the story strays so far from the story we know, and fairly far from the novel, perhaps it would have been better if they had written the film as NOT Frankenstein. A different story. Of course, then it would have been dismissed as a rip-off of the Frankenstein story.Second, while I admit that I'm no fan of Daniel Radcliffe (at least since he grew up), I just don't think he gave the part of Igor what it needed. Particularly early on in the film, Igor needed the audience to be deeply sympathetic toward him, and Radcliffe is not a good enough actor to really pull that off. He's better later in the film, but that is long after there is no longer a need to have great sympathy for the character.What's good about the film? Well, James McAvoy turns in a bravura performance. He lets out all the stops, so to speak.The special effects are quite stunning, although I'm not quite sure why there are so many explosions in the film's climax.The detail in sets (many computer driven, of course) are nonetheless quite entrancing.In addition to McAvoy (as Dr. Frankenstein) and Radcliffe (as Igor), there's Jessica Brown Findlay as -- oddly enough -- Igor's love interest; she seems like a very talented and lovely actress. Andrew Scott is superb as the detective, although we are drawn to the "bad guy" (Dr. Frankenstein) more than we are the good detective who fully realizes the abomination Frankenstein is about to create. Freddie Fox is good as a late associate of the bad doctor.All in all, despite its problems, I enjoyed it. But as I walked away I sorta thought about what could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innovative and lively take on a Gothic Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I have not seen the original films from the 30s I have seen a variety of films based off the Mary Shelley novel and this was my favorite modern take. In the past I was underwhelmed by the lack of character motivation, poorly constructed story line, and general misinterpretations. Previous films actually bored me with the whole concept but this film brought life back to it. It had action,romance,dialogue,character development, and a solid artistic interpretation which i had found lacking in the past films. It allows you to understand the characters and though there are played by familiar faces, Daniel Radcliffe, James McAvoy, Jessica Findlay(Downtown Abbey) and Andrew Scott(James Bond),it is well casted and provides multiple interesting perspectives of the madness that ensues in effort to create life. I highly suggest you give the film a chance I was reluctant at first but was happily surprised by the result. Of any reason to at least give it a try, it is very different from other adaptations, it is well acted by the entire cast,and has some beautifully eerie scenery that well sets the mood of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With apologies to Mary Shelley</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Max Landis is responsible for the screen story and screenplay takeoff on Mary Shelley's epic 19th century novel FRANKENSTEIN and Paul McGuigan (Lucky Number Slevin, Push, Wicker and sundry television series). The 'revised version ' of Frankenstein proves colorful, atmospheric, well photographed?and ultimately a very long song that grows a bit foolish were it not for a solid cast.As the movie producers summarize the film, 'James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe star in a dynamic and thrilling twist on a legendary tale. Radical scientist Victor Frankenstein (McAvoy) and his equally brilliant protégé Igor Strausman (Radcliffe) share a noble vision of aiding humanity through their groundbreaking research into immortality. But Victor's experiments go too far, and his obsession has horrifying consequences. Only Igor can bring his friend back from the brink of madness and save him from his monstrous creation.'What is not added is that Igor has grown up in a circus as a hunchback clown (the hump being an abscess that Victor drains once he rescues Igor from the circus) who has a brilliant mind, a penchant for medical studies, and a crush on aerialist Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay) who falls just at the time Igor is being absconded from the circus to join him in his 'creating life' bizarre laboratory. For some reason Lorelei becomes an elegant lady and Igor cleans up well and the work to create Prometheus beings ? and goes on forever until the law and reality set in and the Hulk lookalike (having been brought to life by lightning) is destroyed.The film drags on at a very slow and repetitive pace, but it works because of the interaction of McAvoy and Radclifffe ? reason enough to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe next time...Victor/Victoria Frankenstein?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It must be tough to figure out where to tread on ground that has been so well trod. The idea behind this version is to focus on the relationship between the friendly neighborhood mad scientist and his assistant Igor, who in this telling Victor rescues from mistreatment in a circus. There is a half-hearted thematic attempt to equate Igor, played well enough by Daniel Radcliffe, with Frankenstein's more famous creation, here called Prometheus, but it falls flat, as does the rest of the movie.The main problem is the title character, who is so misconceived, so annoying and insufferable, as to make you wonder why anyone would give him the time of day, let alone want to make or even watch a movie about him. James McAvoy goes full-throttle playing up Victor's essential obnoxiousness and gives what must be the worst performance of his career. I'm not really sure what else he could do with the role, but robbing Victor of anything resembling humanity doesn't do the character or the story justice. If there was anything else interesting going on here, McAvoy might not be such a sore thumb. Unfortunately, the other characters are pure cardboard and do whatever the plot requires instead of doing what actual human beings would do. The creature itself, when it finally emerges, won't make anyone forget Boris Karloff. He is as dull as the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hope that Daniel Radcliffe has saved all the money he made from the "Harry Potter" movies, because I don't see him having much of a film career for long from picking misguided movie projects like "Victor Frankenstein". To be sure, I do admire the filmmakers for at least making some effort to be different from other Frankenstein movies, such as presenting the story from the viewpoint of Dr. Frankenstein's assistant. (Though this isn't entirely original - the 1996 movie "Mary Reilly" did something similar.) But the movie is ultimately defeated by too much clutter - there are too many unnecessary characters, too many plot threads, and the movie takes forever to get to Frankenstein making and bringing his monster to life. Actually, the monster sequence, when we finally get to it, actually is a little intriguing. But after a few minutes it's all over and the movie abruptly ends, leaving the audience to say, "Just what was the point of this movie?" Apparently not much, if any.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie on DVD from my local public library. My wife chose to NOT see it.It is a fantasy of course, based on the 1818 novel, which originally used the 18th century as its setting. This movie departs quite a lot from the source novel but for me it is very well done and nicely entertaining.It starts in a circus, Daniel Radcliffe (post Harry Potter) "belongs" to the circus, he is a hunchback clown subject to ridicule and mistreatment. He has no name and he knows no other life but on his own has been studying medicine and anatomy.Pretty Jessica Brown Findlay is Lorelei, a trapeze artist, one performance the rigging breaks and she falls to the floor, badly injured. A medical student in the house rushes to her aid but says he cannot do anything. However the hunchback snaps the girl's broken clavicle into place and saves her.The medical student is James McAvoy as Victor Frankenstein, quickly recognizing this hunchback's skills, breaks him out of the circus and on to his lab in London. There he names him Igor, drains the fluid from the huge cyst on his back, and fits Igor with a brace to get him to stand up straight. Victor has been experimenting with assembling parts of dead creatures to use some sort of electrical stimulation to bring them alive. He believes Iror can help him achieve his goals. So that starts the rest of the movie. Another interesting character is Andrew Scott as Scotland Yard Inspector Turpin. He believes something is amiss and is relentless in tracking down Victor and his creations.For me it was a fun movie to watch, nothing serious in it, and I was really impressed with the visuals and the very deep bass at appropriate places. SPOILERS: Why was Victor so intent on experimenting to bring something dead back to life? It turned out when he was a boy of 10 he and his older brother went out at night, it snowed, they became lost and his brother died. Victor blamed himself and felt that he needed to create a living, breathing, thinking man to atone for that. The very last scenes has him making the large monster with two hearts and two sets of lungs, suspending the body in a network of wires above a castle and using balloons to attract lightning that would provide enough electricity to bring his creation to life. It worked but upon realizing it was a monster intent on destroying things he and Igor had to kill it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You know this story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe the low critic ratings for this film are unjustified. Certainly the complaints that it deviates too much from or warps Mary Shelley's novel are unwarranted. It obviously draws more from monster features of the 1950s than it does from the novel (the character of Igor was, I believe created for film and was not one of Shelley's characters anyway). It is difficult to come up with something passing for original from a story that has been rehashed endlessly for decades, but this, at least, comes quite close.McAvoy and Radcliffe have great chemistry and are obviously having a lot of fun. Daniel Radcliffe is no Laurence Olivier, let's face it, but I will say, with brotherly fondness, that his skill as an actor is improving. At least he can bring on much more convincing teary-eyed emotion now than he did back in The Order of the Phoenix (cringe). He is also developing a knack for comic timing. McAvoy manages to portray Frankenstein with an excellent balance of intellectual arrogance and manic obsessiveness, yet still makes him oddly charming and likable.I'm pleased to see a Gothic-style film that I don't have to squint at in order to watch - it is shot with plenty of light while still conveying the grittiness and dirt of that dark Victorian-era London film-goers are used to. The colour palette is muted but appropriate in sepia tones, and again conveys Gothic style nicely without being drab in its bleakness.Overall - highly recommended. Not challenging and, as is stated twice in the film itself, "you know this story". But certainly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Victor Frankenstein" will not win the Academy Award for best motion picture screenplay adapted from another source. Mary Shelley's brilliant nineteenth-century novel fails to "come alive" in this turgid retelling of the story.Shelley's narrative not tweaked, but gutted and refashioned without the substance in this version. The original novel "Frankenstein" depicted a scientist who was at heart a decent person, but was irresponsible in his uses of technology. By contrast, this film depicts an experimenter who is mad from the outset and never changes over the course of the film.The result is a one-dimensional and uninteresting performance from James McAvoy as Victor Frankenstein. Daniel Radcliffe's character plays the assistant named Igor, who appears to have a conscience. Jessica Brown Findlay plays the role of Lorelei, a former circus trapeze artist, who is the love interest of Igor. These dim-witted characters never grasp the reality of Frankenstein's insanity until it is too late.While there were some excellent costumes and professional computer graphic images used to create the world of nineteenth-century England, none of the artistic choices came close to approximately the breath-taking descriptions of Mary Shelley in her original novel.How many film-goers will want to read the novel after viewing this film? Sadly, I fear, very few will be inspired by this unsatisfying attempt to breathe life into a true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goofy, campy and a bit too "sherlock", but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were moments when I thought this movie might be really really good. Those moments passed, and the complaints that I have about it are a bit contradictory. For me, first and foremost, its a bit too campy. There's a lot of Sherlock-esque slapstick camaraderie. Along with the goofiness, the medical inconsistencies were a bit too silly. Yes, i understand that the underlying premise of the movie is medically improbable, but you think they would make a more coherent story than an 18 year abscess. There were times when I thought the writers just didn't make an effort! A few too many poorly written diversions were also thrown in in order to add create action and add time. If they had been a bit less sloppy, they might have raised some existential issues worth consideration.In the other hand, a few of the more modern aspects were interesting. I liked some of the departure from the book in terms of how the assistant ended up with the doctor. I liked the visualizing of the internal organs and bones when the doctor looked at living matter. The costumes were also great.In short, i wish this had been about 50% less silly, and the plot more coherent. The actors were both entertaining (although Igor was not always believable, he was at least hot).I keep waffling on whether or not to give it a 5 or 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half of the movie was spectacular, beyond any expectation I had before watching the movie.Breathtaking,amazing and geeky.In the full film I admired the excellent performance of Daniel,Jason and Andrew.(Jason really deserved an Oscar) Although,when those 3 finally meet during the middle of the movie,and I was about to explode from joy to see 3 masterminds competing, the movie suddenly changed to an average semi-romance,thriller drama of a low talented scriptwriter. I was really disappointed when the slowly progressing,detailed play suddenly turned to this "Lets just speed up things and make them simple" Although I still give a straight 10 to the movie,even if it is only for the first half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun film if you don't take it too seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not happy whit the endless remake fever of Hollywood but the trailer for this one didn't look to bad so I gave it a shot. The angle here is that we experience the story from the viewpoint of Igor, who is a hunchback circus-clown slash doctor who is set free by Frankenstein to aid in the making of 'the monster' (you know the story). They try to make it a bit more hip and smooth (think the Sherlock Holmes versions of Guy Ritchie). It's best not to take the movie to seriously coz let's be honest it's all a bit silly so you have to go along with it. Radcliffe's acting is decent and McAvoy choose to play it big (sometimes borderline overacting) but it fits the movie so no worries. The VFX are pretty good and the production design and sets are nicely crafted so the movie is pretty easy on the eyes. It made little money at the box office so a hint to studio execs: bring something we haven't seen before. That doesn't mean you can't have a good time with this film on the condition that you take it for what it is and expect nothing more.</fullReview>

Poor script,Director couldn't bring out the best of the talented actors and it seemed everyone was in a kind of hurry.It was like let's finish this project somehow and go to the Disneyland.Seriously when you have Daniel Radcliffe,James McAvoy,Andrew Scott in same screen ,you can make something historic ,well if you got the talent of course.Last thing I hope the team will never,ever consider of making sequel.But what can we say ??

		<shortDescription>Good, but could have been so much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people slated the film before it even came out. And it is easy to see why. The old save the cat principle of making us care for the good guy seems to have been forgotten. We have two protagonists who do their best not to give us any reason to like them. Everyone does a lot of talking, to the point that you forget at least half of what they are saying.Macavoy is good, but you can see him acting in pretty much every scene. Radcliffe tries his best, but this is not a buddy movie, and he is the supporting actor, so we are left wondering what is going on when the film begins to focus mainly on him.So the fault lies in the script and the director. I can imagine that the original script was a good story about Igor and his relationship with the doctor and the monster (and how he is an assimilation of both). And how his love is spurned. But clearly this was not good enough for a film, and so we have Frankenstein, creating life, with all its thunderbolts and lightning.So there are times it feels like a television show. A period drama that could of been a series, but someone decided to mix three scripts into one.The best thing about watching this movie was that I started writing my own script about James Whale creating The Bride of Frankenstein in 1935, full of anti homosexual and anti communist subtext. I hear they remaking the actual Bride of Frankenstein, but I fear that like this film, it will be too lame for a younger audience, and too bland for an older audience.A nice try at thinking outside the box, but if you are going to do that, then try and create something new rather than trying to bring to life something that has been dead for years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tamed Monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic Frankenstein story is mostly culturally known for the monster more than the creator, thus many accused that Frankenstein is the iconic monster. Victor Frankenstein wants to center on to the human aspect of the story and nothing more. The creature is there, but isn't quite what the movie is showcasing. The movie wants to be more about the relationship between Victor and his lab assistant, Igor, and how things fall apart once they think through about this experiment. It's actually a lot interesting when they deal with the titular character's madness, but when the twist and climax comes, it's a total safety zone, in a shameful Hollywood way. It has a strong theme it was willing to handle, but it seem too feeble to handle it any longer, thus result to dumb and clichéd decisions.This is in Igor's perspective about how Victor Frankenstein found him and build a friendship until they create the monster that will be their trouble afterwards. It's all a fine idea, but there isn't much in Igor other than being an outcast in a new environment and having a love interest who instantly falls in love with him after an incident and nothing else. There's also a conflict about an inspector finding suspicion to Frankenstein, which has hardly anything more than obsession with the scientist. But whenever they contradict with Frankenstein's idea of creating life, it comes close to really good moments, sticking close to what this story is really about. We see an ambition being pushed too far, kind of living up to its aim of portraying Frankenstein as the real monster than the creature he is making. But it stops being interesting when he reveals his true motivation. It also enormously lost it once it finally goes to the climax, which is a point where it reveals that the movie ultimately lacks the gumption of handling this theme in the first place.To be fair, it does help having this nice cast keeping the movie at least entertaining, maybe only when Frankenstein himself is around. It's kind of fun watching James McAvoy going insane while others around him are either stick-in-the-mud or genuinely worried. Daniel Radcliffe, having Igor as the protagonist now, carries it well, despite of being an ordinary hero kind of Igor. Andrew Scott displays a quieter madness compared to McAvoy's Frankenstein's, yet equally effective, anyway. I'm not exactly sure what the movie is trying to do with the action and some mix of humor. The action seems a little too stock, with these indistinct looking slow-mos and stuff, and there isn't enough sense of horror to it, either. At least the monsters look weird enough, but not impressive enough as action scenes. There isn't much humor in it, unlike the sense of sarcasm it was pulling off in the trailers, but it never matters anyway. The production looks nice, but that's it.Victor Frankenstein is not awful enough, as many critics may claim. It has stronger moments when it still had potential, when it's just a character study of madness, until it finally admitted that the movie is not bold enough to tackle such ordeal for its characters. Again, this is a Hollywood blockbuster, and like many out there, it isn't fond of pushing the limits or getting away from its comfort zone, unlike its main character. Thus, it's just another blockbuster. And for its blockbuster elements, the action is kind of awkward and there is nothing remarkable about the effects. If there is one thing that keeps the movie watchable and it's nothing more than the cast, because their committed performances just makes its thematic moments sort of compelling in a short while. Everything else is just disappointing compromise.</fullReview>

The cinema crowd was great. No one was being noisy, no one was on their phone (this usually irritates me). It was the perfect crowd and the movie still did not entertain me.Perhaps my expectations were sky high which lead to disappointment. I wish the main character's development was better because I felt that it lacked foundation. Not to mention the one too many extras that made the movie a mess.

		<shortDescription>One of the Better Frankenstein Reboots!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anybody who has read Mary Shelley's landmark horror novel "Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus," published in 1818, knows Hollywood has taken liberties with it. Basically, Shelley's saga has spawned more than 70 movies. Most of them would make the Gothic author spin in her grave. Among the movies, "Hamlet" director Kenneth Branagh's "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (1994), with Robert De Niro, qualifies as the best, displaying greater fidelity to the novel than any other adaptation. The latest rendering of Shelley's work, "Push" director Paul McGuigan's "Victor Frankenstein" follows dutifully in the footsteps of the Universal Pictures' classic with Boris Karloff as the monster. Nevertheless, "American Ultra" scenarist Max Landis provides some provocative changes. McGuigan and Landis pay tribute not only to the influential 1931 James Whale film with Karloff, but also Mel Brooks' farcical "Young Frankenstein" (1974), co-starring Gene Wilder and Peter Boyle. A triumph of production design in its recreation of Victorian Era London, "Victor Frankenstein" emerges as a energetic effort to launch a new franchise. Mind you, this isn't one of those horror movies where everything ends in fire and ashes. Instead, the mad scientist learns from his blunders, while everybody else--aside from the vile monster-- gets away. No, the PG-13 rated "Victor Frankenstein" won't afflict you with nightmares. Certainly it contains its share of gripping, white-knuckled moments, but it concerns itself more with thrilling rather than frightening audiences. Mind you, none of this will matter because "Victor Frankenstein" won't generate adequate box office to justify a sequel. British secret agents, old-school boxing champs, dames with arrows, animated dinosaurs, and heroes from a distant galaxy will divert virtually everybody from watching this rambunctious melodrama that deserves a far better fate. The first thing McGuigan and Landis change in the "Frankenstein" formula is the character of Igor. This revisionist tale unfolds from the viewpoint of the hero's faithful laboratory assistant. "Harry Potter" superstar Daniel Radcliffe plays an anonymous, subjugated, hunchbacked, circus clown. Everybody in Lord Barnaby's Circus mistreats this harmless innocent. Despite the circumstances of his miserable existence, the clown serves as the circus medic. Improbably enough, he indulges himself in the study of anatomy, and his anatomical illustrations are incredibly detailed. Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay, Lady Sybil on "Downton Abbey"), a picturesque trapeze performer far above Igor's social status, is the only person who doesn't treat him like excrement. During a performance, she plunges to the ground, and the deformed clown saves her life. When this accident occurs, a medical student, Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy of "X-Men First Class"), rushes to Lorelei's side, too. Victor is impressed with the clown's resourcefulness and capacity to improvise on the spot. Indeed, Frankenstein is so impressed that he helps the clown escape from the circus after his cruel employer, Barnaby (Daniel Mays of "Byzantium"), has confined him in an animal cage. McGuigan stages this audacious getaway, as Victor and the clown narrowly elude Barnaby's fire-breathing and knife-slinging henchmen, like a daring Indiana Jones' cliffhanger. The surprise is the clown isn't a hunchback! Frankenstein perforates the clown's hump, actually a cyst, drains it, and them straps him into a back brace that straightens out his posture. Frankenstein then names him after his former roommate?Igor Strausman?who has vanished under mysterious circumstances. Clearly, Radcliffe's Igor shares little in common with previous Igors. Frankenstein makes Igor his partner, and they experiment with reanimating a pilfered pile of chimpanzee body parts. "If life is temporary," observes Frankenstein, "why can't death?" During a demonstration at the Royal College of Medicine, Frankenstein and Igor bring a ghastly looking chimp to life. Sadly, this maniacal monkey business goes haywire, and Frankenstein has to kill the chimp after it goes on a rampage. Later, Frankenstein's intimidating father (Charles Dance of "Underworld 5") reprimands his ungrateful son for wasting time on such unspeakable experiments. Meantime, one of Victor's fellow medical students, Finnegan (Freddie Fox of "Pride") displays a deviant interest in Victor's use of electricity to reanimate dead tissue."Victor Frankenstein" reminded me of those invigorating "Sherlock Holmes" epics pairing Robert Downey, Jr., with Jude Law. Director Paul McGuigan, who helmed four Benedict Cumberbatch &amp; Martin Freeman "Sherlock" episodes for BBC-TV, keeps our protagonist dodging adversaries, including an obnoxious Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Turpin (Andrew Scott of "Spectre"), who has been investigating the murder of a circus employee that died when Frankenstein rescued Igor. During their escape, one circus henchmen accidentally killed a cohort, and Turpin has been snooping into Frankenstein's sinister shenanigans. Meantime, Igor takes time out to romance Lorelei who left the circus after she fell. Naturally, she frets about Igor's antics with Frankenstein. At the same time, Frankenstein immerses himself in his experiments. Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy are splendidly cast as fast friends, with Radcliffe as more sympathetic and McAvoy as more insane. The questionable activities that they engage in to obtain body parts aren't depicted. Never do we see them either plundering graveyards for human remains or raiding zoos for animal body parts. Nevertheless, McAvoy's Victor Frankenstein is every bit as fanatical as Peter Cushing's Victor Frankenstein in the 1960s' Hammer Studios Frankenstein movies. The complaint that some Frankenstein fanatics may raise is the belated introduction of the monster. Not until the big finale are we shown the monster. Indeed, this monster is humongous, boasting two sets of lungs and two hearts. Comparatively, he resembles the albino giants in Ridley Scott's "Prometheus" (2012). Alas, the monster spends less than fifteen minutes on screen, and he lacks the ability to speak like Robert De Niro's literate monster in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein." Moreover, he is not the intellectual giant that Aaron Eckhart was in "I, Frankenstein" (2014). Like the escapade where our protagonists took flight from the circus, McGuigan orchestrates several other sequences with similar gusto. The final scene in an eerie Scottish castle where the monster draws its first breath beneath stormy skies stitched by jagged lightning bolts is sensational stuff. "Victor Frankenstein" ranks as an electrifying "Frankenstein" adaptation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well acted update on the Frankenstein tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein was more intended as a cautionary than an horror tale about man trying to become God; however in many aspects it respected the fight of man against the darkness of the morals and religion imposed limits of that age.This new version basically retells the classic story giving more importance to Frankenstein assistance Igor; than the original movies gave; but is still Victor (and his madness) story.The movie ends (perhaps a little to abrupt) few minutes after the monster is created; which is a pity because the second part is as much interesting as the second and full of grave concerns about human nature.In any case; Paul McGuigan (the director) keeps the movie always interesting with elaborated action scenes, a few comic situations, lots of suspense but mostly because of the excellent chemistry between the two main characters.Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy gives two outstanding performances as Igor and Victor Frankenstein. While the first is required a very physical acting as the deformed Igor the second has to make believable a borderline, sometimes hideous but still charismatic scientific. Both give a lot of themselves and make the movie works.In brief; if you liked the Boris Karloff movies; this one will not disappoint you. Is well structured and somewhat updated retell with lots of respect on the original. If you are not familiar; this will like you; but let's hope the second is someday made in order to appreciate the whole novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Proud member of the Jack Reacher school of 'what the hell do we call this wannabe franchise grab let's just name it after the protagonist' (I'm still dreading the day "James Bond" hits multiplexes), Victor Frankenstein is just as cutely campy, if not quite as enjoyable, as you'd hope. Director Paul McGuigan and screenwriter Max Landis opt for the action comedy buddy cop feel of the Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes (another lazy title culprit!). Sadly, proceedings here are too undercooked to cough up the same irreverent spark.That said, the film does has its moments of jubilance. The first set piece, with McAvoy's Frankenstein breaking Radcliffe's medically savvy, hunchback out of his circus confinement, is the nutty highlight. Full of deliriously over-the-top slow-mo jump-punches against a canvas of exploding circus paraphernalia, it's deliciously stupid, and by far the most fun we have here. Shortly after a cheerily gruesome emergency surgery de-humpifying Radcliffe and branding him with the name we're all waiting for, McGuigan plays the body horror card, and it doesn't work quite as well. First, we wait for it, stalling with hours of surgical montages and listless pontificating on the morality of conquering death, as well as an ill-advised romantic subplot - the less said thereof the better.Their first bout with reanimation, recalling the grotesqueries of Dr. Moreau, is fun, but filled with overly familiar gore squirting/jump out scare tactics. It's mostly memorable due to Landis' surreal decision to name the creature "Gordon," speaking to a goofiness the film could sorely use more of. Afterwards, we're left treading water in more stale morality/spirituality debates as we await the defining creature feature, now clearly earmarked as climax. Sadly, despite McGuigan's best fire, lightning, brimstone, etc. posturing, it's a slipshod affair - rushed, over-reliant on tacky CGI, and annihilating any inherent complexity in the Frankenstein mythos. Kenneth Branagh's 1994 Frankenstein is far from a perfect film, but handled this balance between campy Hammer gore and classical existential angst far more smoothly, as well as giving us some time with De Niro's gnarly creature. Here, we get a brainless, grunting stab-fest employing Frankenstein's Creature as a boss battle prop, made all the more awkward by the fact that Radcliffe's Igor, who the film took extensive pains to deliver to the remote castle in time, is a conspicuously absent bystander for the majority of it. McGuigan tries to spice things up throughout, punctuating the endless montages with comic book freeze-frames and scribbled anatomy textbook tracings over the moving image, a-la Sherlock. Still, it's a strained effort to revitalize a film that largely feels like an over-budgeted accidental after-thought.As with most such lacklustre buddy cop slogs, it's left to our cast to make things worth our while. James McAvoy is well-attuned to the kind of spirited campiness the film is asking for, and his yelping, nearly frothing at the mouth Frankenstein is good, trashy fun throughout. He's even charming enough to commit valiantly to an asinine, halfhearted tragic backstory, bless him. Next to McAvoy's scene-chomping, Daniel Radcliffe shoulders the film's whiny straight man/boring moral compass by comparison, but he's irresistibly affable enough to pull it off. He's clearly far more interested in Igor's carnivalesque eccentricities, and is far more interesting when applying his remarkably pliable physicality to Igor's slumping, shambling, toad-like circus days, keeping a defiant glint amidst his grovelling, and it's only his inherent charm that makes his dull courting of Jessica Brown Findlay's wary circus acrobat tolerable by comparison. Sherlock's Andrew Scott (who, between this and Spectre, is being severely wasted on the big screen through no fault of his) adds an appealing weird, slushy dourness to his obsessive religious detective. Still, he's unmistakably a plot device the film labours clumsily to incorporate in for sufficient dramatic effect throughout, and his own tragic backstory (Landis doles them out bargain-bin style) is yet another unnecessary distraction at best.Igor's opening "You know this story" voice-over (ugh) is meant to play as smugly reflexive, but instead points out Victor Frankenstein's fundamental redundancy, and how immaterial its tweaks to the Frankenstein myth are. There are too many easy Frankenstein analogies to apply here condemning the film's final product: indulgent, selfish, foolish, monstrous, verging on an ill-advised disaster. Ultimately, it's harmless, braindead, throwaway camp, made oodles more enjoyable by its charismatic leads. Still, we're closer to the level of Van Helsing's Frankenstein lore than Boris Karloff here.-5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Victor Frankenstein' is the newest adaptation of the novel of the almost same name by Mary Shelley. "You know this story" is the preliminary sentence of the movie. Most people will know it, despite the attempted reinterpretation of Frankenstein's monster. This time it's told from the perspective of the assistant Igor, who is saved from his miserable life in the circus by Frankenstein. Out of gratitude, Igor stays with the insane medical student and supports him in his vision to bring life from death.&nbsp;The relationship of the radical visionary and the clumsy but also handy intern, that 'Victor Frankenstein' brings to the screen is definitely enjoyable. The chemistry between Frankenstein (James McAvoy) and Igor (Daniel Radcliffe) can clearly be felt and is all in all pretty to watch. They obviously had a great time filming. McAvoy's portrayal of Frankenstein is mesmerizing and adds along with an interesting back story new depth and complexity to the character. Sadly, the characters are the only thing that succeed in Max Landis and Paul McGuigan reinterpretation. The original story itself has always been quite abstract and won't be that no less than before, despite the new, more realistic touch. Especially the ending is in my opinion a little to excessive and adds action that the movie didn't have up to this point and also didn't need. Due to one or another unnecessary storyline the movie drags on a little, after the first half and is with it's almost two hours definitely too long. One more thing I didn't like were those weird medical overlays, that the movie didn't need. In the end, you can have fun with this movie if you allow it to, despite all it's points of criticism.'Victor Frankenstein' isn't as bad as some other reinterpretations of classical monsters (Dracula Untold for one), but also isn't the overwhelming event that you would want from a movie or story like 'Frankenstein'. The story is neither well-rounded nor successful but everyone that expects simple, slightly exaggerated entertainment will get just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different type of Frankenstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all of the Frankenstein movies, this was by far the weirdest one. It was far-fetched at some points, but the story was not bad.The story was engaging, but it got weird towards the middle. Victor Frankenstein, played by James Mc Avoy, is the mad scientist who wants to create life from death. His assistant Igor, played by Daniel Radcliffe, is a rescued circus freak who happened to be a genius physician. Together the two of them worked endlessly to create new life. So they pieced together parts from various animals together to create the new being. But to give it life, it was possible by electricity giving it a kick start. The first creature was mainly made out of a chimpanzee's body, and man was it deformed and evil. It really looked like Koba from the Planet of the Apes movies, but after he was hit by a freight train twice.Towards the end of the movie, the Frankenstein monster was finally brought to life. But he really did not have that much of a life. It lasted all of four minutes before he was killed by his creators. All that for nothing. This movie is more focused on the journeys of the characters than it is the actual monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better than Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's a fairly obvious statement to say that our opinions of movies are tempered quite a bit by our expectations of that movie. How many times have we seen some indie darling hailed as the next great horror film, only to be let down and disappointed. In the end, the movie is probably better than we're letting on, but it didn't meet the weight of its' reputation. In some ways, my opinion of this movie is the opposite of that reaction. The reviews were bad. The movie bombed. I had just about zero expectations and, perhaps, that is why I found it to be much better than expected and, as a result, find myself giving it a much higher rating that I ever expected.We all know the story of Frankenstein and his monster, but this film really takes that well tread blueprint and crafts an entirely new monster from it (sorry for the bad pun). I found myself reminded a lot of Hammer's series of Frankenstein films. Before you lose your mind with me making that comparison, I do not think it to be near the quality of THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, but am speaking of the subject matter. Hammer's series was always much more about the doctor than any creation he brought to life. The mad scientist was the main focus and that is clearly the case in this version, albeit with the adding extra of Igor.We begin our film in a circus where Igor is a clown/ freak who is tormented by his compatriots. An accident occurs that injures the woman he has pined for from afar and brings all the forces of this movie together. It is here that we meet Doc Frank and the result of the events that transpire, also, introduce us to the police detectives who are integral to the movie's plot. The film almost lost me in this opening as it was just much too sleek and modern, trying far to hard to pander to the superhero movie fan. The slo-mo capture shots and frantic action felt much too out of place and not in keeping with the tone of the rest of the movie.This extends to the next scenes, as well, where our doctor rushes about his laboratory breathlessly, while instantly healing Igor of his affliction in sudden, brutal ways that have no expectation. Why did he need to do it this way? Could he not have explained some things and taken his time? It came off far too much as action for the sake of action with no thought to what it added to the script. Fortunately, the movie settles into a groove, though, that I did find to be interesting. Doc Frank is a student with a father that disapproves of everything about him and a dark secret in his past that drives him towards his unholy experiments. Igor (played by Harry Potter) is the heart of the movie and the real hero. He is thrust into a world of science and gentleman's culture where he comes upon his true love. These two actors are the stars of this movie and the reason that it is successful in the end. We grow to like their characters, understand their motivations and almost root for them to finish their ghastly experiment.In pursuit of them are two police detectives, one of whom is hell bent on ending their work, holding it to be blasphemous. He becomes the actual villain of the movie as he blindly pursues the doctor and his assistant at the cost of all else. We do not actually meet our monster until the closing minutes of the movie, finally getting to the parts that we all expect from the beginning. I will say that the monster (called Promotheus here, in a nod to Shelley), is pretty impressive. I know a lot of classic monster purists who will hate the design, but they would hate anything that isn't Jack Pierce's classic green giant. This monster is impressive in scale and hews a fine line between paying homage to the classic designs and creating something new.If you are hellbent on being a hater and know you'll despise this for not being Universal or Hammer, then just stay away in the first place. I was really skeptical as I tend to hate this sort of modern retelling, but in the end I found that it really drew me in and left me much more impressed than I ever thought I would be with a modern monster movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't heard a lot about this film but the two leads, James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe had me curious to give this a watch.Well I regret that decision now!Thinking back on this movie, I don't think there was one thing I actually liked about it. Both McAvoy and Radcliffe have done a lot better work than this film!The story was boring, I guess you can say it's well acted; would hate to imagine how it would have gone if they had cast worse actors.There is a scene involving animal cruelty, computer generated animal cruelty, but nonetheless, it's a pretty brutal scene.I've watched this once and I have no intention to ever watch this again.CHAPPY THINKS he's shocked (get it &#x263a;) that he actually made it through this shocker!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The performances and chemistry with the creative setting made this one worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a well executed post-modernized version of the classic horror tale. It has a decent built up and some really good performance although it can be a bit over exaggerated sometimes. The director tried to go for a more fast-paced take on the Mary Shelley's classic novel. Although there isn't much depth to it, the action combined with the well written dramatic elements made this movie work. At least for the most part anyways. This movie focuses more on the character Igor (Daniel Radcliffe) and what made Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) tick and what drove him to his work. I give this movie a bit of respect for it being creative and well put together for the most part. The main drive of this movie isn't the steps it took to create the monster but the bromance relationship between Igor and Frankenstein. The performances and chemistry with the creative setting made this one worth watching.7.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Liked It Better Than I Expected To, It Benefits A Lot From James McAvoy Giving It His All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to see this in theatres but with the low box office gross, it was gone before I could get there. It seemed like a cool twist on the story, having more of a buddy cop take on it. I have to admit ahead of time I haven't read Mary Shelley's novel so I can't speak to how the movie changed the story from the source material. I wanted to give it a chance though, it has a good cast and from the trailers it looked like it had a steam punk vibe similar to Van Helsing with Hugh Jackman. Having low expectations often helps and while I can see flaws in Victor Frankenstein it was still a fun, escapist blockbuster.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The opening of the movie is our introduction to the man who will be Igor (Daniel Radcliffe). He is a hunchback, he has no name and he works as a clown in a circus. He is treated badly by the other performers but he bides his time and studies human anatomy. He secretly has a keen intellect and serves as the show's doctor. The one light in his life is Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay) who is an acrobat in the same show. He admires her from afar however. One night during a performance in London she falls and faces a life threatening injury. From out of the audience runs in Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) who is a medical student at a nearby college. Between the two of them they figure out how to fix her collapsed lung and save her life. Victor is astounded by the hunchback and asks him to leave the circus to work with him but before he can say yes, the owner laughs and throws him in a cage, claiming that he is circus property. Victor finds him and frees him but they are pursued by the rest of the circus performers. There is a chase sequence and they get away but one of the other performers is accidentally killed in the chaos.They get to Frankenstein's lab which is in an apartment above a soap factory. The hunchback thanks Victor for his help and Victor claims that he wants to fix him. Victor deduces that his deformity isn't a birth defect it's actually an abscess and he syphons the fluid from it and gives him a back brace to help him walk normally. The performer is grateful for the help but Frankenstein then departs to work on his own. He inadvertently tells him that he's probably being hunted so they should actually give him a name. They decide on Igor after Frankenstein's former roommate who has been missing.I think when you watch this movie, it's easy to see what the crew were trying to achieve. The most obvious comparison is to the Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes movies. They're going after that sort of team dynamic with the two leads playing off each other with funny dialogue and a strong sense of friendship. I think this is an interesting choice and I think it works here. Frankenstein and Igor are a likable pair and you get to see different things happening because they see events in different ways. It's not true to the source material, I get that but in terms of putting a new twist on a classic novel (the movie even reminds you of that through stating it out loud that you know the story already) I think they took it in cool direction. I also liked the costumes, the set design and the visual style of the movie, it was obvious that they didn't have a big budget but they seemed to put it to good use creating the fun steam punk feel that the feature has.The other big reason that gives this movie life is that James McAvoy is really giving 110% as Victor Frankenstein. He's carrying this movie through the slower scenes just because of the energy in his performance. It's really the biggest reason that this movie is entertaining. I also liked Daniel Radcliffe as Igor. His acting only seems off through comparison to James because he's not chewing the scenery like McAvoy is. Daniel is more low key and that's fine, he works well with James in their scenes together. Jessica Brown Findlay is also good but she's given very little to do. I was disappointed in Andrew Scott's performance as Inspector Turpin. He lacked the enthusiasm that was needed for his character as the adversary of Victor Frankenstein. But he also could have been weighed down by the character not being very strong in the first place.As much as I enjoyed the movie, it did have problems. The action scenes aren't all that interesting or well filmed (Victor pulls out some fancy fighting moves at times, how did he learn that being a medical student?). I think the movie also runs out of steam by the ending. The climax is goofy and doesn't gel with the rest of the story. I also thought the character motivations are believable but they flip completely on a dime or they grow into strange variations of what they started out as (Turpin especially, he goes from a smart and seasoned detective to a religious fanatic at the end, they tell you why but I don't think that justifies what he does).With how badly this movie was panned, I wasn't expecting much from Victor Frankenstein. I was enjoying it halfway through as a fun and imaginative take on an old story but by the time the ending came around, it was hard to stomach. Thank goodness it had McAvoy in there, he made you want to see what would come next. I feel like I'm being a little soft on this movie but I want to be positive because I think it's unfairly being slammed for trying to find something new instead of sticking to being faithful adaptation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As most of you have already guessed, this version has about as much to do with the novel Frankenstein as Groovie Goolies has to do with NASCAR. It has an overzealous character named Victor Frankenstein who is determined to create life by reanimating stitched together body parts from corpses. All similarities end there.Just because the movie doesn't follow the book doesn't make it necessarily bad. The original Universal film strayed from the source material and Hammer's fine version also moved far afield from the novel. The difference is that those two films had terrific scripts and tight storytelling which generated suspense (if not scares), and made us care about the characters. Paul McGuigan's directorial effort is just a slapdash, hodgepodge of situations, big pyrotechnics and foolish scripting, though he keeps things moving at a brisk pace.The movie gives a wink and a nod to the Universal films by tossing in an inspector investigating Frankenstein who loses his hand, although in the original it was an arm, and to the monster and not in a fight with Frankenstein. Hammer's Frankenstein is also referenced in a scene involving a pair of headless eyes in a tank which follow a match. The script tries hard to be clever by transforming Igor (another character created by Universal) into a leading man when his hump turns out to be a large cyst! The scene is gross but not really fun, just overheated and ridiculous. Most of the film tries to keep up this overheated, manic behavior and situations. In the end it's just tiring and uninvolving. The only person we get to care about is Igor, and even that is due less to the script and more to Daniel Radcliffe who, God bless him, does his best with a paper thin character who comes off like an idiot toward the final reel for his unwavering devotion to Frankenstein, which doesn't seem warranted after his treatment. McAvoy chews the lovely scenery as the title character and appears to be having a good time. I suppose he welcomed this after playing a sensible, stalwart hero type in the X-Men movies.In the end the movie is defeated by its size and sturm und drang. If it had chosen to narrow its scope, focus and ambitions, it could have been more fun. The cinematography is very nice, all the performances are fine, if occasionally over the top, though all the supporting characters are given almost nothing to do and are one-note personalities. The sets and setting are lovely. Sadly it went for the big box office Christmas holiday type entertainment with a story that really doesn't call for it, and failed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Victor Frankenstein is a great retelling of the classic Frankenstein story. And boy was it good. Instead of focusing all it's attention on Dr. Frankenstein and how he created the Frankenstein monster, the film rather focuses on his assistant Igor and how his life changed when the good doctor saved him from the circus he was at. The movie spends a lot of time on Dr. Frankensteins earlier creation, which it seems couldn't have been made if Igor hadn't helped. As for the famous Frankenstein monster (or Prometheus as he is called in this film) his creation isn't really shown. At all. Sure they show us how they came up with the idea and how they were going to do it. But no footage of the actual assembly. This is because the main character is Igor but some footage had been nice. Another problem I have with this film is the whole subplot with this Finnegan family wanting to control London with the technology Frankenstein used to create Prometheus. I don't know what they thought when they included that. It was only there to give Frankenstein a place to create his monster and thats it. It just ends there. They don't backstab him as stated, it just stops. Other than that this was an amazing movie and I can't wait to watch it again. I give Victor Frankenstein a well deserved 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't say this s really a horror flick as you should think when you see the title. It all takes place before Victor made his creation with a dead body made of human parts.We do see how Igor (Radcliffe) came into the life of Frankenstein (James McAvoy) and how both start experimenting on body parts from animals turning it all into an animal creation coming to life but things go wrong. With the police on their tale they still want to create a new creature. Once alive it's were this flick stops and it's from their you know the history of Frankenstein.There's a lot of talking going on and here and there we do have some action like with the animal going berserk and towards the end when they are giving life to the dead body. Naturally there's a bit of love story going on between Igor and Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay) a girl he saved in a circus were he worked as a hunchback. Not really my thing, so far Frankenstein (1931) is the only one I adore but the acting was excellent so I guess a lot of people will love this story.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3,5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's alive!" is perhaps one of the most famous proclamations in popular culture, but after countless attempts to revive Mary Shelly's 19th-century monster for modern audiences, not to mention last years' dreadful I, Frankenstein, the most appropriate follow-up to that very quote comes from the mouth of James McAvoy in this year's Victor Frankenstein, which the title character bluntly states, "Isn't it obvious?"... In the film's opening minutes this fresh prospective comes to life, as Victor (McAvoy) and Igor (Daniel Radcliffe), escape from the circus after Frankenstein witnesses the anatomy-savvy hunchback save Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay), a beautiful trapeze artist and ignored love interest, after a deathly fall. Super imposed x-rays of bone structure in a blueprint-like effect, slow motion fireworks, freaks with fire-blowing and knife-throwing abilities all make for an inspired opening sequence, which unfortunately fails to prevail into the ensuing 110-minutes runtime.FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2015/12/10/victor-frankenstein-2015-review- indieadam/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Frankenstein Movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best Frankenstein movie I have ever seen.I've seen plenty of movies and TV shows pertaining to Victor Frankenstein and his monster. And I enjoy watching Victor Frankenstein (2015) more than anything I've seen. :DWhile I think most Frankenstein movies have focused mainly on the Frankenstein Monsters, this new movie focuses mainly on Igor &amp; Victor Frankenstein the people. We see both Igor's and Victor's characters develop throughout the movie, which is I think is really refreshing. Igor's character developed the most, but we also see Victor's character development. And there is also that very important romance element between Ignore and the beautiful girl. IMO, no movie can be fully enjoyable with some romance. IMO, the hero should always get that beautiful girl and they should live happily ever after. :DOf course, no Frankenstein movie would be complete without the monster, and this movie actually has not just one monster, but 2 monsters, which is also different than most Frankenstein movies. In addition, the ultimate monster creation is quite unique in terms of physiology. It's insanely awesome in terms of anatomy IMO. I absolutely love it. :DSo although "Victor Frankenstein" may not be Oscar worthy in the eyes of most people, I unequivocally enjoy the heck out of it and would say it is among my favorite movies. I would also say that it is unequivocally the best Frankeinstein movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

Oh yes, poor monster he didn't ask for all that. Yes, Victor a bit insane for creating him in the first place.But I honestly didn't prepare of how it was going to be from Igor's point of view. As far as I remember from previous movies or mentions, Igor is a quiet character. Or silent. He simply doesn't speak, as far as I know. He's there to help, to do what he's told.Daniel Radcliffe's Igor gives a new perspective to me. He is a person with quite background story. I like this Igor. I like that we finally have reason why Igor is Victor's assistant or helping him. I also like how Igor see Victor and in turn, we finally know the real Victor and his obsession.Daniel and James McAvoy surely didn't disappoint ? I think they both are never. This is probably one of the best Frankenstein adaptation so far. Frankenstein is a classic, one of the best scary story this world has. Good job 'playing' with Igor, we didn't see much of him so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always unfortunate to watch a film when you know it could have been better and it's ultimately just another film in the end. Victor Frankenstein is just that. Led by James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe, Victor Frankenstein covers a new side of the myth of Frankenstein. This time focusing on Igor, a hunchback that is helped by Victor and recruited into helping him bring a human to life.I really liked McAvoy and Radcliffe's performance. They were both clearly having some fun and did the best they could with the script, it's just that the film never popped. Max Landis' script definitely had potential and there were a fair share of fun moments including a solid but pretty messy and convoluted climax, but Paul McGuigan's direction was iffy at best. The film is a very slow 2 hours long and I even had a difficult time staying awake at some moments. It was nice seeing Charles Dance show up for a glorified cameo, but that story line never paid off. I think the constant switch of backstories between Igor and Victor became misleading. I don't really know what the film wanted to be. I'm not even sure the movie knew what it wanted to be. In all, Victor Frankenstein was another bland action film that tried to be something it wasn't. A few good performances couldn't save this one.+Performances+Entertaining if not messy climax-Really slow-Never picks up the pace5.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gruesome, Dark, and Somewhat Boring. Acting is the lightning to this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Happy Thanksgiving everyone! This glorious holiday is a day filled with turkey, football, family, and monsters. Wait did I just say monsters? Yes I did my friends. Although it is a holiday, movies do to take a break from premiering on the silver screen. My holiday movie assignment is a little unorthodox this year, and comes in the form of Frankenstein. The patchwork nightmare from Mary Shelly's imagination has had many iterations, but Paul McGuigan has delivered us a movie that promises to be darker in tone. Today we cover Victor Frankenstein, headed by the dynamic duo of Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy. The theme of this movie focuses on the Mary Shelley's classic tale told through the eye of the assistant Igor. Radcliffe takes the lead in this origin story, as Igor is dragged into the world of 19th century scientific medicine and its unethical practices. The main plot of this film corresponds to the classic book, but Victor Frankenstein is laced with multiple subplots that provide some variety and character development. Almost all of these side stories are laced with darkness, many involving the obsessive pursuit of answers by immoral means. While the variety is a nice welcome some of these elements I felt were hastily pieced together and lacked the emotional fervor they were looking for. In addition the plot was also kind of boring, lacking the suspense and excitement I was hoping for. This was especially true in the horror element. For a horror movie, Victor Frankenstein was not the scariest thing to grace theaters. Instead I felt it went more down the disturbing avenue. This is especially true of the visual effects and make- up, which were fantastic in this film. I was impressed when I saw organs and muscles pulsate and contract, in a high-definition shine that amplified the effect. The computer animation also was well done, blending into the live action with fluid transition and texture. This realism certainly establishes nightmare-inspiring moments, where festering creatures and a beefed up Lunk from Goonies roam about unbound by any rationality or restraint that mirror their creators' desires. Even our human characters are not spared from inhumane torture and gore strewn injury that is truly skin crawling. I felt that some of these moments were a little over the top, and took too much focus from the story. Nevertheless, those with weak constitutions or religious zealots should avoid this tale. For this reviewer, the acting was the best quality of this film. James McAvoy as the mad scientist was a fantastic pick by the casting director. The man continues to impress me with how he can juggle his characters emotions without crossing over into annoyance. McAvoy's portrayal of insanity in voice work, facial expressions, and body language itself is first class. Daniel Radcliffe also doesn't disappoint as Igor, committing to his character from the start by portraying the shuffling gait of the hunchback (not an easy task). Radcliffe's charm was nice to see, which made for a likable character that I could to root for in this miserable setting. As usual it's the chemistry between the two that is the most impressive component. They played well off each other's emotions, with a synergy that was dynamic, energetic, and somehow dark at the same time. I hope to see these two reunite for further films. Jessica Brown Findlay deserves some mention, for she provided the touch of elegance in this chaotic slew of science. Not only is she beautiful, but Findlay radiates the classiness of her character that commanded respect and provided a love story. Andrew Scott once more steps into the mad, obsessive role, though ironically plays an inspector this time around. Scott not only captures the mannerisms of the insane, but somehow adds that hint of uneasiness to really sell the part. If only he had been utilized a little more. Victor Frankenstein is a movie that truly calls for those who love the dark and grotesque. The acting and special effects will immerse you into the world and deliver the realistic horrors you have been looking for. While I did enjoy the focus on Igor this time around, I have to say the movie wasn't as suspenseful as I had hoped. This left me bored at times and waiting for the move to end. I cannot recommend this movie for a theater visit, but would encourage you to give a shot when it comes to RedBox. My scores for this film are: Drama/Horror: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Little Franklock: Science and Friendship are Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this, but then I'm (a) weird and (b) a massive fan of Steven Moffat's "Sherlock" and series of "Doctor Who," especially the current Capaldi era. There's enough crossover here with "Sherlock," with the director Paul McGuigan having directed most of the best episodes of "Sherlock" as well as inventing the technique of expressing its genius protagonist's thoughts on screen in the form of graphics (also used here to illustrate the ingenious ideas of Victor and Igor) as well as "Sherlock" cast members Andrew Scott, Mark Gatiss, and Louise Brearly, for it to count as part of the "Sherlock" canon. The fact that the Creature that Victor and Igor design has two hearts sort of ties it into the Whoniverse as well.I have a theory that McGuigan would have liked Andrew for the role of Igor but was told that if he wanted McAvoy for Victor he'd have to get a marquee name for Igor. Which is fine: Daniel Radcliffe is adorable in the role and Andrew gets a break from being adorable in his stern grown-up role.I do think there was a deliberate choice here to transfer the paradigm of Sherlock and John's complex working friendship into that of Victor and Igor--like John, Igor is a lost soul rescued by the friendship of a socially backward but brilliant and sort of even heroic man, though the comparison sort of stops there. James McAvoy's Victor bears no resemblance to Cumberbatch, either as Sherlock or Frankenstein, and he's an original as far as screen Frankensteins go, a fiery, passionate man full of infectious joy in the act of creation. He's really fun to watch.Since the film's bombed at the box office there won't be any sequels, but there's rich material here for fanfics so the cultists who will inevitably be drawn to this film and get it despite its sub-zero ratings on Rotten Tomatoes will take care of that. Thanks in advance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was quite alright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually liked this movie. There is a lot of negative comments and reviews about it, it seems people often forget that movies are made to entertain us; not every single one is Oscar worthy, but that doesn't necessarily means it's a bad one. I like this story, and I like this Frankenstein origins type of movie. James McAvoy is an amazing actor, somehow I believe everything he does - weather it's a mad genius Victor Frankenstein, brilliant professor in X-men or just an ordinary man in love with his wife in The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby. The scenes in the circus at the beginning of the movie are brilliantly done; slow motion of running and circus performers, along with the fire and light effects are my favorite one. Overall, entertaining and quite enjoyable. Of course it won't be everybody's cup of tea, but what in this world is? Give it a chance and it might be right up your alley...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me tell you that I didn't make it all the way through this movie. I tried, I really did. It was not that the actors were bad because they were not, although I have seen them do better work. I know that when you watch a movie you are to suspend belief and roll along with the protagonist BUT I COULD NOT. Especially after Victor tells 'the hunchback with no name' that he has no hunchback, instead he has an abscess, AND that he has had it for 18 years. Seriously? I am supposed to suspend everything I know about the human body and just accept that this person has had an abscess that had them bent over for 18 years? As if that wasn't bad enough, Victor straightens up the 'hunchback with no name,' and straps on a brace so that he can stand up. For real?? The human body does not work that way. I rather enjoyed the costumes, the set design, and the atmosphere. The acting was not terrible, and at the same time not great. The editing and camera work were pretty lame, and because the actors were not on the ball, I'd say the directing was shabby. I give it one star for costume, set design, and atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost excellent......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Frankenstein is yet another reinterpretation of Mary Shelley's classic tale. This time it crosses over into cinematic history by including the character Igor who was first introduced in film in 1931 but was never present in the original novel. Its an approach that works well in the context of this film. Lets start by saying this film adaptation is well written. It taps directly into the question at the heart of Shelley's book of whether human beings have the right to use technology to play God. There's good tension and juxtaposition, between Frankensteins determination that scientific rationality trumps superstition. That death is a temporary, reversible state. This is in direct collision with Andrew Scott's, inspector Turpin. A man whose religious conviction affirms that man should not usurp the role of God, as giver and taker of life. Balancing the serious question at the heart of this tale, is the relationship set up between Frankenstein and medical genius circus performer, turned assistant,Igor. The warmth and at times humour in the relationship between Frankenstein and Igor, off sets and lightens the serious, sombre tones that typically inhabit this Gothic horror story. Daniel Radcliffe is perfectly cast as Igor. His simple, almost goofy yet clever characterization, compliments James McAvoy's frenetically funny, almost, obsessive compulsive, Frankenstein. There is real human chemistry between these two actors that leaps off the screen, making this film inherently watchable. This is as much a tale of two odd-ball, science mad friends, as much as it is a morality tale and this film is all the better for it. The action sequences are well timed too and cleverly executed. Perhaps the only shortcoming in this film, is its latter half. The lack of genuine interaction and narrative between Frankenstein and his creation, in particular, is rather dissatisfying. Instead, what you get, is exposition, that leaves the film feeling incomplete. Its a shame too, as this is, in most regards, an excellent film. If a little more care had been taken this, could have been a truly memorable flick. Nonetheless, Victor Frankenstein is still a well acted, enjoyable Gothic horror romp with enough humour to lighten the load. Eight out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In short this is a low brow, brilliant popcorn movie. If Alton towers made a Frankenstein movie - this would be it. Great theatrics, costume, atmosphere, energy and spookyness. If your looking for deep Art-house movie making, this is not it, but why should it be. Its a great, freaky tale of mankind going crazy and this is my favourite version of it - I believe that I've seen them all. In my opinion, the harsh reviews are from pretentious, wanabee critics and are snooty and irrelevant. If you want a great fun tale filled with spectacular razzle dazzle to watch with your kids - this is perfect - which I think is what it sets out to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't deserve the bad reviews at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was shocked to see how bad the reviews were on Rotten Tomatoes. 'Worst movie of the year?' WHAT??? This is the first decent movie I've seen in months (apart from 'Spotlight' but that one is in a different league). There are so many really bad movies out there recently that I almost lost all hope that I will ever see a good movie again. I was very positively surprised with this one. Sure, I've seen a few movies about Frankenstein's monster, I know what happens AFTER the monster becomes alive, but this movie is about what happens BEFORE and I liked how the mad scientist and his obsession were shown here. James McAvoy is a fantastic actor, I'm not a fan of Radcliffe but I actually liked him here as well. I'd say this is a solid drama, with interesting characters and great scenography. I like that there were so many details in the interiors (the machinery and everything else), you can really get a feel for what it must have been like to be a scientist back then. I'm glad this movie wasn't all CG and it actually had a story that made me pay attention throughout till the very end. Of course, there are weaker moments here and there but I can't agree that the story is ludicrous and doesn't add anything new. There's a lot of new here for me, I don't know, maybe other people have seen ALL the movie AND theatre adaptations and they're bored with this whole idea of a monster being raised from the dead (why are they still watching then?) Oh, but what about the 'Black Swan' that's been done to death? Why are they raising this one from the dead all the time and nobody complains?I give 'Victor Frankenstein' 8 stars out of 10 because it's a gripping, very well executed movie. It made me think a few times about the implications and consequences of what Frankenstein was trying to achieve. It isn't just a failed horror movie (Really? Where did you get that idea?), it is an entertaining drama that utilizes props - something not many films do these days - and allows the actors to create a character that we care about. I certainly did care.This movie is far from the 'straight to DVD' category and if you like this type of movies, I'd definitely recommend it. Sure, I've watched some movies because the reviewers were saying 'This movie isn't as bad as others make you believe' and they were actually VERY BAD (think the latest 'Die Hard' aka 'Die already!', as one reviewer noted in the title of his review) but I honestly can't see why anybody would hate 'Victor Frankenstein'. This is a strong, solid movie that's very entertaining and certainly not as forgettable as some will tell you. To be on the safe side, watch the first half an hour. If you decide you hate it, you can skip the rest; if you like it, you might just have a pretty nice evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Victor Frankenstein" is an original but odd take on the time-honored tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been written for hundreds of years that the only two things that are certain in life are death and taxes. But for thousands of years before that, people had been trying to figure out how to beat one or the other (or both). A young British woman named Mary Shelley tapped into interest in that whole trying to beat death thing when she published her novel "Frankenstein" way back in 1818. Many (but not all) feel that Shelley's story is literature's first example of science fiction. Either way, there can be no disagreement about the enduring interest in her story over the past two centuries. Many publications, interpretations and differing versions later, 2015 gives us the horror film "Victor Frankenstein" (PG-13, 1:49). This version uses Shelley's basic idea of a scientist trying to create life out of death and takes as its title the full name of the author's most famous character, but uses little else from her original story.Named after the creator of "the monster", the story is told through the eyes of the scientist's loyal assistant, Igor (Daniel Radcliff). As the film opens, he is an abused nameless hunchback clown in a traveling circus. One night when a trapeze artist named Lorelai (Jessica Brown Findlay) falls during a performance, the hunchback rushes to her aid, as does local university science student Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy). You wouldn't know it to look at the hunchback, but he's well-read and kind of brilliant. Impressed with his knowledge of anatomy, Victor frees the hunchback from his captivity. Victor takes the hunchback home, fixes his hump by draining it, forces his body into an upright position, fits him with a back brace and gives him the name of Victor's often-absent assistant, Igor.Without telling him why, Victor sets Igor to work repairing damaged internal organs of animals, while Victor himself is in an underground laboratory working on? something. The scientist is so excited about the progress they're making that he treats Igor to a night on the town ? a high class party where Igor and Lorelai meet again ? both considerably better off than the last time they saw each other. She has recovered from her fall and is now keeping company with a society gentleman, while Igor has cleaned up quite nicely. Victor isn't shy about talking to people about his experiments and Lorelai becomes the voice of reason and moderation as she learns more about what the two men are up to, while Igor is too blinded by his loyalty to Victor to clearly see what's happening and what he should do about it.Regardless, the progress on Victor's experiments continues. He presents his first major success at his college and gains a rich, but unscrupulous benefactor (Freddie Fox)? and a crucible full of problems. He arouses the fear of the townspeople, the ire of his father (Charles Dance) and the attention of a crusading police detective named Inspector Turpin (Andrew Scott). The rest of the movie involves Victor hurrying to bring his work to its logical conclusion while engaged in increasing levels of disagreement with Igor and a battle of wits with Turpin who sees Victor's work as an abomination in the eyes of God."Victor Frankenstein" treads its own path through the dark forest that is the Frankenstein story, but some may take issue with just how different it is. The scenes of Victor's work progressing seem unnecessarily gruesome. That might not have been a problem if the tone of the rest of the movie were consistent with the horror, but McAvoy's performance is distractingly whimsical. It's not humorous in the usual sense and is meant to show his character's madness, but the characterization just comes off as strange. The rivalry between Frankenstein and Turpin pits an atheist scientist against a strongly Christian detective, making both extremes seem like one-way tickets to crazy town. The set decoration is excellent and the performances of Radcliff and Scott are outstanding, but all these positives can't quite make up for the weirdness in the story and the ridiculousness of some of the scenes. In short, this film deserves kudos for its originality, but falls short in its execution. "B-"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a shame this movie got almost no marketing whatsoever. I don't even remember seeing a trailer for it on TV or even youtube. We didn't make it to the cinema on time to catch The Good Dinosaur so we ended up seeing this instead. This film explores the relationship with Igor and Victor Frankenstein. I know that sound boring but James Mcavoy's portrayal of the mad genius alone if worth the price of admission! He is hilarious, energetic and off the wall. This is very much a character driven film but the story is solid and the action and special effects are more than enough to satisfy everyone. It is refreshing to know Hollywood can still turn out films that do not need to molest your eyes with CGI and explosions to keep you entertained. It is a shame how most people will discover this film only after seeing it on a smaller screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Victor Frankenstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, at least, they gave the right title to the film. Like the weak initial narration describes, Victor Frankenstein doesn't tell the story of the monster, but the one of the man who created it, told from the point of view of his assistant Igor. I would say this is another "literary re- imagination" slightly inspired by a famous novel, but the considerable creative licenses taken by screenwriter Max Landis seem more based on the 1931 movie Frankenstein, so at least, Mary Shelley's legacy wasn't too insulted (even though it wasn't too honoured either). For the rest, Victor Frankenstein is another one of those strident modernizations with swollen drama, baroque production design and performances so exaggerated that they frequently fall on the ridiculous. James McAvoy is the main guilty of that, ignoring any subtleness in order to "chew scenery" with his laughably over the top performance. On a lesser degree, the same can be said about Andrew Scott and Jessica Brown Findlay, while Daniel Radcliffe feels bland and listless as Igor. The screenplay from Victor Frankenstein has many problems, but I think that the main con of the film is Paul McGuigan's direction with its atonal roar and absolute uncertainty about what kind of movie he wanted to make. Is this a tale of horror, science fiction or a period thriller? I guess the answer is "all and nothing". McGuigan previously made some films I liked (Lucky Number Slevin, Push), but I don't think he had any affinity for the Gothic fantasy which identifies the tale of Frankenstein. He simply thought that "horror" is the same as "excess", and he proceeded to saturate us with bombastic music and overcharged images, hoping that the "drama" to inspire something on us for the characters would be generated. Needless to say, that never came. On the positive side, Victor Frankenstein includes some solid special effects, specially a re-animated primate, even though the sequence in which it is included is too brief in order to keep the PG-13 rating. In conclusion, Victor Frankenstein is a tedious and absolutely uninteresting film, and I felt it like a waste of time. At least, it wasn't as bad as I, Frankenstein... even though not much effort is needed in order to be superior to that atrocity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Victor Frankenstein is so bad it makes me wonder if filmmakers (actors or otherwise) regret participating in movies from time to time; it's not fun bad, just bad bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daniel Radcliffe provides the voice over introduction to Victor Frankenstein. "You know this story... The world, of course, remembers the monster, not the man. But sometimes, when you look closely, there's more to a tale. Sometimes the monster is the man."Did that just blow your mind?!But, wait, isn't that kinda the whole point of the book?Now, I'm not knocking the movie for attempting to do something different but what Victor Frankenstein is doing feels really lazy. It's not like they are reinterpreting the story or some of the major themes, it's mostly just a recasting of superficial elements..Now, the crux of the movie is, well, about Victor Frankenstein (McAvoy) and Igor (Radcliffe) as they struggle with the technical and ethical quandaries of reanimating life. In this iteration of the story, Igor is an abused clown in a&nbsp;steampunk circus. In his free time, he studies medicine. One thing leads to another and the young medical student, Frankenstein, recruits the clown to be a laboratory assistant.The graphics and special effects are perfectly ordinary. Style-wise, we have a&nbsp;steampunk&nbsp;feel. If you aren't familiar with steampunk, it's Victorian England with, potentially, futuristic technology; it has a lot of bronze work and pipes and steam.I mean, Victor Frankenstein is big budget flick aimed at us&nbsp;millennials. Let me tell you, we love steam-punk. It just feels like the decision of the marketing department to stylize the movie this way. There are other decisions that make me feel like this was marketed towards&nbsp;millennials&nbsp;but I'll get more into that later.The dialog is dismal and it doesn't help that everyone phones in their performance. Well, everyone except for James McAvoy, he's just overacting the heck out of his role. He was so pleasant in X-Men: First Class why is he doing this?The story itself, at least the direction in this film, was disappointing. I'll go into detail in a bit but, without spoiling anything here, it will suffice to say that it was a let down.Overall, I would recommend that you actively avoid Victor Frankenstein. It's bad acting in a bad adaptation with tired art direction. Go and see Van Helsing if you want a supernatural but light and fun movie.Now, let's discuss this movie in a little more detail -- so mind yourself of spoilers.I mentioned that this movie was geared towards&nbsp;millennials. Let me describe the plot a little more. So we have Igor, the character to whom we are supposed to relate. He's just a guy who is really interested in medicine. Unfortunately, he's trapped in an abusive world (the circus). He's saved by Frankenstein and given the opportunity to do great things.We have Frankenstein whose all for science; he's the "God is dead because science is awesome!" type of guy. I get the feeling that he's supposed to be "cool" because he's an atheist but he gets a little too carried away with his experiments for us to gravitate towards him. Meanwhile, a dogmatic, fundamentalist Christian inspector (Scott) pursues the protagonists. The inspector is definitely bad because he's like our parents.This leaves us in the middle with Harry Potter (Igor, that is). He wants to study medicine and science because it's interesting. He's neither an angry atheist nor a Christian; he's more of an agnostic. This quality of the plot reminds me of what I understand of the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche.In his one book, he describes a shift in power dynamics in society. In the medieval period, we had knights and dukes and lords - the "nobility." The nobility had the power because they took it and fought to keep it; they were like hawks. They were to whom we were to aspire. Hence, being "noble" is a positive trait.But, if they were so great and powerful, why did the system topple? It failed because of what Nietzsche calls "slave morality." The slaves who opposed this feudal system didn't actively rebel they just passively shuffled their feet until the system crumbled. In the metaphor where the nobles are the hawks, the slaves are the sheep. It's a sort of passivity or apathy that characterizes the sheep. Before I get into how this ties into the movie, I feel like should note that one of the things about Nietzsche is that there are problematic ways to interpret his ideas, case and point, the Nazis. For our purposes, I'm pointing out some of the characteristics that he describes with respect to the movie.Igor, for example, wants to do science because it's cool. He's OK with reanimating animals but he mildly objects to reanimating a human. He says that he doesn't want to participate anymore but he doesn't really give a reason why. His reasons certainly aren't the same as the fundamentalist inspector. He doesn't actively support or oppose the experiments either. He just says, 'I'm going away with my girlfriend.' After all, it's a whole lot easier to abstain than to give a definite answer.We have these driven characters but are left with the one standing still. Consider the final lines of the movie. Frankenstein writes Igor saying, "I'm continuing with my experiments? Be ready because I'll call on you someday?" Frankenstein's experiments are where it's at, that's where I want to be. I don't want to be with Igor as he just shuffles about.Gah! There's the rub. Maybe the reason I'm writing and thinking about this so much is because it hits close to home. The reason it's frustrating though is because the film doesn't provide anything satisfying. There's no insight or direction or call to arms. It's just a character that resonates with a target audience and that's that.So, in summary, don't see Victor Frankenstein. It's a stupid movie and writing about it has made me mad.Stupid Victor Frankenstein? &gt;:|</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are in the era where big companies retake old classics to adapt again and Twentieth Century Fox Film did a decent job with respect to Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's Frankenstein. It is completely innocuous and unimportant to mention that Paul McGuigan makes the movie aiming to do for "Victor Frankenstein" what Guy Ritchie did for "Sherlock Holmes", Victorian London but with a different theme: "Two men with the ability to generate life". It is interesting to the reinvention of the classic focuses on Igor more than the same main character disappearing completely cliché that Victor is the center of attention, obviously, without downplay Victor in the movie. More than a story of monsters , religion and beliefs "Victor Frankenstein" is a story of true friendship that surpasses any buddy film. Landis' script addresses the issues of life and death in an impressive manner focusing not just on the name " Frankenstein " also in his friend " Igor" . This script takes the essentials of classical achieving a memorable tribute to the most fearsome monster of Hollywood. The script and the effects are a key part to connect the film with the audience but clearly are the actors who work for the reborn: Radcliffe took the right tone to become the shadow of 'Victor' ( perhaps for his dream of medicine expert or in gratitude for his flamboyant remove hump) although at times McAvoy stole the limelight to 'Igor'. The performances of these two ambitious men are truly spectacular, them feelings and differences make the trip that much more fun and entertaining , these two guys deserve a ton of applause. The break point of the movie are ten long minutes, where they are presented many villains, and often the case the bromance ((Jessica Brown Findlay's trapeze artist, Lorelei) appears to exist largely to deflect suspicions that Victor and Igor only have eyes for each other (not counting the eyes in formaldehyde, of course). "Gordon" and "Prometheus" (the first experiments of them ) are shown in a majestic manner , with a dark touch but with a careful hand of details that make each look truly amazing . However , the end is not the best, but leaves the door open for a possible franchise, that according to public reaction (Box Office) and apparently , it is very unlikely to see a sequel due to the few gains so far over budget. "Victor Frankenstein", really surprised , managing to show a new face of classic , fresh it , and exceeding what we had in mind. Innovative, refreshing , exciting and totally unbelievable becomes the new invention of "Victor and Igor".</fullReview>

Igor is an eccentric fellow, highly passionate about his work. Same goes for Radcliffe's nameless man. Their enthusiasm is infectious. We're more than welcome to this party.

		<shortDescription>A good, dark, emotional, thrilling, electrifying take on an utter classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Frankenstein is an engaging, dark, brilliant take on Mary Shelley's horror classic. While it is not a horror (as the trailer leads you to believe) it is a thrilling sci fi period tale. The story is interesting, very character driven. The acting is top notch. Daniel Radcliffe certainly delivers in this, especially as a hunchback. Bullied and enslaved by a malicious circus, he is cast as a freak attraction but harbors a passionate interest and outstanding talent for medical science. In his role as a young outcast caught between his morals and his ambition to create notable scientific progress, he is intriguing and very sympathetic. James mcavoy is the famous mad scientist and does an excellent job of showing the unstable side as he slides into madness, spurred on by his ambition to create life from death. His performance is outstanding and really captures the audience. Andrew Scott portrays Turpin, a police inspector who becomes obsessed with catching Igor and victor, and is a religious zealot. Quite like Javert from Les miserables. The costumes are exquisite, as well as the hair and make up (Daniels long hair is amazing.) the cinematography is great, everything is brilliant. Only problem I have with it is the script. Some of the writing falls flat in some places but all in all, a brilliantly done film. Very electrifying, if you'll pardon the pun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for purists but otherwise fascinating and unique perspective of the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a totally unique take on the "idea" of Frankenstein. If you're a purist you won't like it because it doesn't follow the book, the monster is different (which I actually thought was more accurate) and the story is about the relationship between Dr. Frankenstein and Igor. Told from Igor's point of view and being as much about who Igor was as it was about Dr. Frankenstein, it was really fascinating. Excellent acting! Radcliffe was a great Igor until about the last quarter where became a little more Harry Potter (poor guy just can't shake that role...). James McEvoy was incredible as Frankenstein. He really played his character well; I saw a slowly going-mad genius instead of seeing any other character he's played (Professor Xavier he was not!), and if it had been the first role I had seen him I would have wondered if he really was a little off his rocker. The inspector was great as well - unfortunately I saw him as Moriarty from Sherlock Holmes and it was hard not to think of him as Moriarty throughout the movie, especially since he kind of morphed into the same sort of control-freak loony as the show progressed so I kept calling him Moriarty in my mind. He was still really good in his role though. Really interesting movie with several hilarious spots to break up the tension - even funnier because of the unexpectedness (though don't let this make you think it's a comedy because it's not, it just has touches of comedy if you have a slightly dark sense of humor). As usual I was about the only one in the theater laughing at these odd little spots and comments that really were outrageously funny. At one point Dr. Frankenstein finally shows Igor one of the creepy little things he's working on and it's the point where any normal person would run screaming or be gagging and you wait for the big reaction and instead get a comment on how it could have been done better. Just the build up, the way you subconsciously know a person should and would react, and then the casual comment are as a combination really funny. It's those sort of weird and twisted little bits in the show that make occasion for random bursts of laughter.I loved LOVED the end - this perspective of the creature was my favorite though I can't really say why without it being a spoiler other than the fact that it fit in with my theological beliefs much more than the book or other versions do. Oh yeah, it was more than a bit gross in parts! A simple medical procedure in the first 15 minutes had me nearly dry heaving! Yeah, I'm that person, show a little bit of mucus or pus or whatever and I'm gagging. If you're a Walking Dead or Game of Thrones fan - you'll be just fine. If you're like me you'll be closing your eyes here and there. Again, don't expect the story in the book. You have the name, you have the "bringing the dead to life with lightening" and that's about it for similarity. But because of that there is great opportunity to develop some really interesting characters and they picked the right actors to play the roles. I don't see many movies in the theater; I seldom think they're worth paying that price and would rather wait until they're at redbox, but I have no regrets at having paid full price to see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . to describe this new, revisionist take on VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN, set in a 19th Century Steampunk Great Britain. No, they did not go to the trouble of digging up and using lightning bolts to reanimate Boris Karloff. Since extras cost more than they used to in Mr. Karloff's 1930s heyday, you won't see hordes of villagers running around with torches and pitchforks in VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN, either. Instead, we get a Gay love triangle between three young lads, one of whom already has reanimated the eyes of a late ex-. When this trio is not tied up in making eyes at each other, they're Hell-bent upon building Boy Toys to expand their circle of fun (it's important to remember that there's no "Bride of Frankenstein" under consideration here!). Only sometimes-hunchback Igor (a.k.a., Harry Potter) has a moment in this tale for the ladies (probably because of some latent spell cast upon him by either Hermione Granger or Ginny Weasley). At least everyone here lives happily ever after (if you assume that the dozens of slaughtered people will be successfully reanimated, that is).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story of Frankenstein is there on top of a few layers of attempting to be hip and contemporary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Frankenstein's unholy obsession with making life from death turns him into a mad scientist and his creation into a monster.Though James McAvoy plays the title character, most of the plot focuses on Igor, played by Daniel Radcliffe. The film tries to make the hunchback more of an interesting character, giving him a back story of a genius judge by his looks until Frankenstein saw what was inside and mentored Igor into using his brilliant mind to help him built the monster. The movie takes more of a medical spin on how to put body parts together and make life. There is a lot of scenes about designing the monster, experimenting, failed experiments, and begging for money to people who think the two men are Godless creeps (which Victor himself is happy to play up).Visually, Victor Frankenstein does go classic horror on you with the Art direction and costume design. In this category, it does not try to prove it's more sophisticated than what we know about Frankenstein, but complements it's heritage. It's also gruesome and grotesque like an old school horror movie, pulling no stops of what an abomination reanimating dead corpses can be.Overall, it reminds me of Guy Richie's version of Sherlock Holmes, as the sidekick takes more of a center stage as we show you how disturbed the main charter can be. Not nearly as stylish as Richie's Holmes, which is good, cause they make up for it with a Universal style retro monster scary we rarely see these days. Way better than expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Frankenstein ever!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was not just the best Frankeinstein that I have ever seen (and I'm a huge fan) but McAvoy made it so real! He should get an Oscar for it! I have never seen any actor be a mad scientist as realistic as he was! Also I loved how they showed the science behind and they created an animal before not just straight a human like in all other films.. Radcliff was good too, I think he really needed this ugly face character to finally made me forget him as Potter :) I hardly buy original DVDs because there are not a lot films nowadays that I would watch several times but this is one of them. I enjoyed every minute and every actor/actress did their best. I wish there would be more films out there like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better Than I Thought it Would Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't really sure what to expect when I saw the trailers to this movie but I'm actually surprised how much I enjoyed the final product. It's far from perfect but it's such a fun film that I was able to ignore a lot of the flaws. I am a little disappointed that they didn't go ahead and call the movie Igor because that's really who the film is about but I can let it slide. This one is directed by Paul McGuigan, I'm not that familiar with him but he did direct Lucky Number Slevin, which raises him a notch in my book. Let's talk about the story.A young hunchback in a circus later referred to as Igor (Daniel Radcliffe) runs into the mad scientist Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) when a young trapeze artist has an accident and they work together to save her life. Frankenstein is impressed with the young man's skill and decides to help him get away from the circus. However, Frankenstein isn't doing this out of the goodness of his heart. He wants Igor to help him in his experiments to create life using electricity and old dead body parts. Despite some reservations, Igor feels indebted to Frankenstein and decides to help him bring a corpse to life. This turns out to be a very bad idea.Just to be clear, I'm a ridiculously huge James McAvoy fan. Filth and Professor X have truly endeared this man to my heart and I'll watch him in anything. I love the intensity he brings to his role as Victor Frankenstein. I could easily believe that this man is insane and it's great that he doesn't seem to notice the spittle coming out of his mouth on certain scenes. I also enjoyed Radcliffe's Igor more than I thought I would. It's been difficult for this guy to get out of the shadow of Harry Potter but I genuinely like the roles he's taken so far. Igor is a sweet and trusting guy despite his abuse in the circus and Radcliffe gives us that and more. I like that his Igor is much more intelligent than the ones we've had in the past. The only other character that I want to mention is Andrew Scott's Turpin, an incredibly astute and religious detective. This guy also brings an intensity to his role that makes him a bit terrifying. I didn't know whether to root for him or against him but he does have some good points. I'm a little unsure of his methods though. Overall, I actually liked the acting more than I thought I would.London looks fantastic in this movie. The trailers made the film look cheap but the final product is much better in my opinion. Sure, it's grimy, but London is supposed to be filthy looking. I was also surprised to see that they went with some period appropriate music rather than try to bring in something that obviously doesn't fit with the time period ( I'm looking at you Great Gatsby). Even the final reveal of the Monster surprised me because I genuinely liked the look of him. Man, this movie needed some different trailers.Alright, like I said before, the film is not perfect. There are a few sub-plots that didn't really need to be included in the story. I enjoyed the sub-plot with Inspector Turpin but the character of Finnegan came off as completely unnecessary to me. Freddie Fox does a fine job portraying the character but he really doesn't have any purpose other than to be an immoral prick. He does provide funding for Frankenstein's research but I wasn't exactly asking myself how Victor procures money anyway. There are a few other little nitpicks like this one but I don't want to spoil too much of the film. Let's just say that they tried to put way too many sub-plots in what is supposed to be a story about Frankenstein and Igor.Honestly, I thought this movie was awesome despite a few obvious flaws. The acting is great and everything just looks interesting. It's far from perfect but it's a unique retelling of the Frankenstein story and I'm surprised how good it is. I doubt many of you will want to watch it especially when movies like Creed are out right now but if you feel like watching something fun and frivolous then try giving Victor Frankenstein a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie if I may say so myself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off let me say that I'm rarely one to write reviews and so on and so forth.Now down to business. I have become used to critics giving bad reviews on movies and music that deserve much much better recognition. This, unfortunately is the case with Victor Frankenstein.First of all regarding the acting. It was nothing short of Class-A acting. Make no mistake, James McAvoy is a near Platinum actor in Victor Frankenstein and nothing short of it. He managed to possess the role in an utmostly believable, hypnotizing and charismatic manner. Daniel Radcliffe was not kidding when he said James gave a "phenomenal" performance in the movie, which brings us to Daniel, who plays Igor. I've known who Daniel Radcliffe is since I was a kid, and honestly he wasn't a terribly great actor in the Harry Potter movies. He was okay, but not that good. Well ladies and gentlemen prepare to be taken away by Daniel Radcliffe in Victor Frankenstein. He truly has redeemed himself. Not once did I remember Harry Potter while watching Victor Frankenstein, only Igor did I see, and that's a good thing, a very good thing indeed. The rest of the cast did a great job as well. All in all the acting is very good, and "phenomenal" on James's part.Secondly, the story. This is the story about Victor Frankenstein, the man who created the monster. The monster who is mistakenly known as "Frankenstein" by many of the newer generations. This isn't a horror flick. This isn't a crappy movie with stupid scares scattered all over to raise your heart rate for no actual purpose. This is a more mature story, with a lot of philosophical weight, if you have the eyes to see it that is. This isn't Macbeth, this is much more real. Believe me, this movie sheds a lot of light on the stupidity and ignorance of today's society, especially on certain sensitive matters, even though it's centered around Victorian England. I will not share any information on the actual story, but know this, if you go to watch this movie (and you really should), keep an open mind and try to view the story from Victor Frankenstein's point of view as the story progresses. If you do this, then you will see how truly great this movie really is.Thirdly, the soundtrack/score. Fantastic and very, very well thought out for the movie. It does nothing but make the experience all the more powerful and touching. I already own it on iTunes and I will buy the CD when I get the chance.The trailer is a joke. Do not count on it to give you the feel of how the movie actually is. I have watched this movie 3 times in the theater already, yes three times, and I plan on watching it again. Don't let the negative critic reviews lead you away from one of the best movies of 2015, if not the twenty-first century. Go with an open mind, watch it yourself, and then judge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Victor Frankenstein - monster maker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No movie captures the theme of the mad scientist better than this movie. James McAvoy's depiction of Victor Frankenstein is a show stopper. He absolutely carries the movie. His performance is fantastic. The movie also contains a finale that can be best described as hysterical. It must be seen to be believed and enjoyed. It is one of the great endings in recent movie history, maybe in all of movie history. That scene alone is worth the price of admission. In a way, this movie is a throw back to the movies of the 1930s, replete with all the electrical gadgetry, castles and large cavernous interiors with open roofs to let in the lightening. Electricity plays a key role in the story. The pacing of the story is fast and relentless. This Victor Frankenstein is truly obsessed, indeed frantic. Nothing will stop him from creating life out of nothing. But although obsessed, he is also engaging and charming, albeit erratic to the point of distraction. But that's to be expected from a scientist who's into what he's into. Daniel Radcliffe is also excellent as Igor, but this is James McAvoy's movie. Essentially, this movie is a prequel to the actual, well-known Frankenstein story. The movie also contains a moral: when you create a monster you must be able to kill it too. Otherwise you're asking for trouble. What was Frankenstein doing before he created the monster played by Boris Karloff? To find out, watch the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good riff on a traditional story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Frankenstein has been told and retold repeatedly since Shelley's novel, and previous movie treatments have aimed variously for Gothic horror, action adventure, character study and psychological drama.In this case, the plot of the movie is a riff on the 1931 Boris Karloff version and direct derivatives (assembling a human body from parts and animating them with lightning, police nemesis, hunchbacked assistant, remote castle), with a change of focus from the tragedy of the monster (also a primary theme of the novel), or even from the monster entirely, to an attempt at answering a central question about Dr. Frankenstein himself: "What was he thinking?" We are given the perspective of the assistant, designated as "Igor", with enough backstory to make him sympathetic and his choices comprehensible, and through him we are introduced to medical student Frankenstein, well-rendered as an otherwise decent person who is believably and dangerously manic and obsessive (rather than theatrically insane or cold-blooded and sociopathic). We follow Igor as he is drawn first by gratitude and loyalty, then friendship and compassion, to assist in a project that at first sounds dubious and gradually turns disastrous and horrible.The movie will not be satisfying to an audience hoping for extended combat scenes featuring the monster, brooding character studies in dark motivations, or wide, cinematic views of lonely Gothic settings (most of it takes place in a repurposed urban warehouse), although it as brief and well-chosen examples of all of those things. Frankenstein himself lacks the usual wife/fiancé, and the only romantic angle is an association of Igor's that serves to frame the plot.The story the movie actually chooses to tell is engaging and well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just came back from watching Victor Frankenstein. It was ? enjoyable. Someone who studies medicine would probably be annoyed (some of the main characters' knowledge about anatomy may not be correct), but there were some funny/dramatic scenes. Also, if you try to find parallels between the movie and the Harry Potter movies, it becomes even more fun (they even have a pseudo Draco Malfoy!).Anyway, it's nice to see Harry Potter and young Charles Xavier try to make a zombie while BBC's Moriarty tries to stop them and Tywin Lannister appears just to express his disappointment. McAvoy and Radcliffe have great chemistry, which I did not expect, so that a pleasant surprise!I found the fight with the monster too fast-paced though. I could hardly realize what was happening when it was over. Also, I did not like how at the end, Victor Frankenstein does not appear to have learned his lesson and plans to make another creature "one day".Perhaps they are hinting at a sequel that way?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN (2015) ** James McAvoy, Daniel Radcliffe, Jessica Brown Findlay, Daniel Mays. Reimagination of the Mary Shelley horror classic with Igor (Radcliffe), the titular character's hunchbacked assistant, and his POV of how the duo came to be involving the reanimation of the dead and the experiments that produced the monster that is best remembered than its creator. Same could be said of this odd production written by Max Landis and directed with some style by Paul McGuigan yet one wishes it had used some style like the Hammer films (in spite of some grande eloquent Victorian sets) and some humor (like the Karloff versions) while instead eliciting at best a shrug of going back to the drawing board for a better version envisioned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tolerable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On spotting that an unnamed circus hunchback is a brilliant amateur doctor, Victor Frankenstein rescues him from slavery as a resident freak, cures his abnormality, names him Igor, and recruits him to assist in his experiments to bring life to new creatures cobbled together from bits of old creatures.This prequel plays fair with pre-existing Frankensteinian film mythology, and gives us a relatively straightforward (and also relatively inexplicit ? it is a certificate 12A in the UK) origin of the Frankenstein/Igor partnership. It is handsomely staged with some decent set pieces and, intriguingly, is a film played completely straight but featuring a central performance from James McAvoy as Frankenstein operating at full ham, and loving every minute of it. Daniel Radcliffe as Igor does well with the physicality (although I got a bit fed up with the raised shoulder), falls somewhat short with the acting here and there and, as always with a period piece, is fatally hamstrung by his unmistakably 21st century estuary English accent.Taken as undemanding fun, this is successful enough in its own way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strays Too Much From Source Material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Victor Frankenstein", starring Daniel Radcliffe-The Harry Potter movies, The Tailor of Panama; James McAvoy-The X-Men movies, The Last King of Scotland; Jessica Brown Findlay-Winter's Tale, Downton Abbey_tv and Andrew Scott-Spectre, Saving Private Ryan.This is a re-telling of the Frankenstein story, but completely different from previous versions. It is told from Igor's point of view, in this case, Daniel's. James plays Victor Frankenstein, the mad scientist that likes to experiment on dead animal parts and later, dead human parts, of bodies in trying to create life. James finds Daniel, a hunchback, working as a clown at the circus-while James was looking for spare body parts from dead animals-and enlists him as an assistant in his work. It seems that Daniel is a lot smarter than he looks, plus his hunchback deformity is actually a big abscess which James just pops like a pimple and cures Daniel, almost immediately-See, I told you it was different. Jessica plays a trapeze artist that catches Daniel's eye and becomes his love interest. After some of James' experiments with animal rejuvenation catches the attention of the police, specifically Andrew, James has to change locations and go into hiding to finish his work. Oh yeah, he has graduated to human parts, now. The actors are good and the sets look good and they do stick with the lightening angle of rejuvenation but there are just too many other changes for me to like it more than I did. It's rated "PG-13" for scary images, violence and sequences of destruction and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 49 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. If you are looking for a new take on the legend, you might like it more than I did but otherwise, it would be alright as a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homage to the Same Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein is often represented as a warning against man playing god. It is perhaps instead a warning against man creating without woman. Without the maternal element, the novel's Victor abandons his horrific creation, thus setting in motion the chain of events which make a monster monstrous. But forget all that. This movie has apparently solved it. Rather than explore the underpinnings of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelleys novel (the daughter of one of the greatest feminists of all time) this film plays more on the cinematic allure of the story, and replaces the lacking maternal sense with an overtly homosexual relationship between Igor and Victor. And has a pretty fun time with it. So Spoilers... We see Igor released from his circus torment and elevated to Victor's assistant. First thing he does is suit up, attack Igor physically FROM BEHIND, and assail him. He penetrates him with the syringe and withdraws a white fluid from him via a tube using his mouth, which he then casually spits out before further asserting his dominance over Igor with more leather posture gear and a demand to cleanse himself. Wow. The subsequent time is spent in an exploration of this relationship. Time Igor spends with his circus acrobat crush is derided by Victor as a waste. Victors father strikes his son and insults his "Experimenting at college." They drunkenly design their ideal man (RHPS style) and discuss the need for "Large Organs." Igor is exposed to the finances and accounts are shared. Very domestic. Finally Victor pronounces them "Partners" and the relationship sours shortly thereafter. Another suitor appears, who similarly whispers in Victors ear from behind in a way not dissimilar to Victor behind Igor nearer the beginning, this time with promises of funding and acclaim. Throughout this, a fanatical inspector (ironically played perfectly by a homosexual actor) sees their lifestyle as sinful and informed by Satan, and sees a conspiracy in every last connection. He assails them at every opportunity, breaking their door down, deforming himself in the process of his personal crusade. His cries of conspiracy and immoral lasciviousness fall on deaf ears and he is forcibly retired. Igor is apparently disposed of, resulting in his "rebirth" from near drowning. Temporarily "cured" of his attraction to Victor, he returns to his acrobatic love but quickly realizes where his loyalties lie, and she assists him in reuniting with Victor. It's barely even hidden. I was rather disappointed when the electrical bolts around Prometheus didn't form a triangle, the imagery was THAT overt. As a Frankenstein film, it does a couple of things uniquely, but the really enjoyable parts were simply the abusive yet loving relationship between these two. Also, the word "suck" was used repeatedly. Just saying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Its alive!!"- Igor "Cause that's rather obvious"- Victor Frankenstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>n London, ambitious medical student Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) attends a circus performance, where he saves an injured aerialist, Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay), aided by a nameless hunchback (Daniel Radcliffe) enslaved by the circus' ringleader, and who harbors feelings for the girl. Impressed by the hunchback's vast knowledge of human anatomy, acquired from stolen books, Victor rescues him, drains the cyst on his back that causes his physical abnormality and develops a harness to improve his posture, and then names him "Igor" after a recently deceased roommate. The two then become partners in Victor's ongoing experiments to create life through artificial means, incurring the wrath of religious police inspector Roderick Turpin (Andrew Scott), who views their experiments as sinful.After Igor suggests they use electricity to animate their creations, Victor procures parts from dead animals and creates a monstrous chimpanzee-esque creature nicknamed "Gordon". Meanwhile, Igor reunites with Lorelei, now masquerading as the mistress of a closeted homosexual baron, and the two develop an affair, upsetting Victor, who views Lorelei as a distraction. Igor invites Lorelei to a demonstration on their experiment, which goes awry when Gordon escapes and wreaks havoc through the university before being killed by Victor and Igor. Lorelei is horrified by Victor's experiments and urges Igor to dissuade him from pursuing the matter further, but Igor is reluctant to do so upon learning that Victor is driven by the need to atone for his indirect role in the death of his older brother, Henry, for which Victor's domineering father, Mr. Frankenstein (Charles Dance), blames Victor.Victor is expelled from college for his unorthodox methods, and later approached by his wealthy, arrogant classmate Finnegan (Freddie Fox), who wants him to create a humanoid artificial creature. Victor and Igor outline a behemoth being known as "Prometheus", but Igor's deepening relationship with Lorelei soon causes a rift between them. Shortly afterwards, Turpin and his men raid Victor's laboratory, hellbent on destroying his inventions, and during an altercation with Victor, Turpin loses both a hand and one of his eyes, while Victor and Igor are extracted by Finnegan's men and taken to his family's estate in Scotland, where Finnegan provides them with the necessary funds to build Prometheus. Igor is mistrustful of Finnegan and leaves after having a falling out with Victor. Finnegan later kidnapps and binds him, revealing his plans to kill Victor once Prometheus is complete and weaponize his creation. Igor is then thrown into the River Thames to drown, but manages to escape and reunites with Lorelei, who nurses him back to health.Once recovered, Igor returns to Finnegan's estate with Lorelei in tow in order to rescue Victor, and finds Victor on the verge of using lightning to animate Prometheus. He ignores Igor's pleas not to and activates the machine, just as Turpin unexpectedly arrives, the failed, illegal raid on Victor's laboratory having cost his career, and opens fire on the machinery. Despite his intervention, Prometheus springs to life and rampages through the complex, killing Finnegan and Turpin. Victor realizes his efforts were misguided and joins forces with Igor to kill Prometheus by stabbing its two hearts. Igor sustains severe injures in the fight and collapses in Victor's arms.Igor soon recovers, having once again been nursed back to health by Lorelei. He then finds a letter written to him by Victor, in which Victor apologizes for all the suffering he caused and recognizes Igor was his "greatest creation". Igor then reunites with Lorelei, while Victor retreats to the Scottish countryside in search of new discoveries.If you like science movies and frankenstein, you will like this movie.For me its a 10/10 !! :)))</fullReview>

This could have been just as or even more disgusting than an abscess (check them out, they can contain hair and teeth). Dermoid cysts can reside in the body for years w/o causing harm. Abscesses kill you.Please, Igor should have been taller, darker, and better looking. Who knew Mr. Radcliffe would have grown up into a wimpy puny creep, like Macaulay Culkin.At the end, the monster should have been only seen in shadow. And Victor should have died (if he didn't).
