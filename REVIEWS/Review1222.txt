		<shortDescription>It's a scream that they made something this original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1996, when I saw this in the theater, I was expecting to see a predictable movie. That we would just get bored with. But I was wrong. This has to be one of the most clever movies of the 90's. Believe me, this was an awesome thriller. Wes Craven should stick to movies like this, It had a wonderful cast. Funny lines. Scary moments. Classic horror scenes that will keep you at the edge of your seat. A movie that you'll rewind and want to watch again and again. And after the 50th time you watch it, you'll say, just one more time. So, if you have good taste, or are looking for something original, watch this film. And get the trilogy DVD set. It's a screamer! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hate To Admit It, But It's Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's more than a few reasons to hate `Scream'; the main reason would be that the film single-handedly resurrected the teen-slasher genre, a movie category that had long been beaten to death. Because of the success of `Scream', witless horror crap like `I Know What You Did Last Summer' and `Urban Legend' got greenlighted, half the teenage casts of various WB television shows got summer acting jobs, and some awful scripts that should've been left dead and buried `Teaching Mrs. Tingle' got to see the light of day. `Scream' is responsible for a lot of garbage. But the truth of the matter is, `Scream' is also a phenomenal movie.The plot of `Scream' is very simple: a masked knife-wielding maniac is busy stalking the students of High, killing them off one by one. The killer's inordinately obsessed with one girl, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who of course gets involved in the quest to unmask the killer. The catch (in case you don't already know it), though, is brilliant. Everyone in the film is familiar with all the slasher film conventions. They know that you shouldn't walk in the woods alone at night. They know that having wild sex is an unwritten invitation to be hacked to pieces. They know not to say things to each other like `I'm going outside for a cigarette; I'll be right back.' -- such statements are virtual death warrants. One of the best examples (and best characters) of this is Randy (Jamie Kennedy), the film-obsessed nut of the film, who actually goes so far as to muse what `real' actors and actresses should play the other characters in the film, going so far as to joke about who gets to be Tori Spelling. All the dumb conventions of slasher films are pulled out of the shadows, exposed for what they really are . . . and then, some of them get used anyway, because the characters willingly choose to ignore those conventions. Some cliches are thrown away, while others are embraced. `Scream' really turned the horror/slasher film genre on its ear, becoming the first truly suspenseful and exciting slasher film in many, many years simply because it suddenly had a million new avenues to explore. The film's self-awareness allowed to move in brand-new directions . . . and suddenly, scenes that used to be predictable in other slasher films suddenly become incredibly intense in `Scream'.Director Wes Craven was perfect for this film -- as director of slasher classics like `Nightmare On Elm Street', he easily sets the visual feels and style of film to perfect evoke all the slasher films of yore . . . and then, much like `Scream's' script, chooses to either faithfully follow the tried and true, or to go off in competely unexpected directions. Either way, Craven manages to create a lot of absolutely nail-biting, thrilling scenes. He also doesn't hold back with the gore, which is always a plus in great slasher films. The acting ranges from barely mediocre to good -- Neve Campbell's okay as Sidney; Courtney Cox is pretty good as tart-tongued reporter Gail Weathers; Jamie Kennedy rules as Randy the film geek; and David Arquette is utterly bland and forgettable as Deputy Dewey Riley, the sad-sack policeman. But casts in slasher films don't particularly matter anyway; the good ones are all about suspense, terror, and gore. And in `Scream', Wes Craven provides massive amounts of all three of those criteria.The irony is, `Scream' spawned dozens of imitators, and by spawning imitators, all the new avenues opened up by `Scream' quickly got old and boring once more. Still, purely on its own merit, it's an excellent film. The best slasher film of all time is still John Carpenter's `Halloween', without question, but `Scream' actually runs a close second. It's well worth watching. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling, refreshing horror tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this film for the first time in the basement of a four story house, with no-one else in was the perfect setting for this film. From the very first scene I was gripped and I could not wait for the climax to discover the murderer and his motives. The script was extremely original, as they had purposely set out to parodie the typical slasher style movie.It was written in a way that deceived and tricked and had you jumping out of your seats but also laughing at the paradoxical black humour. For anyone looking for a good horror film with a twist, you won't find a better one than Scream.Overall I give it 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scream" does not seem like the kind of movie that could make you appreciate American cinema. If you haven't seen it, then you're probably viewing it as just another silly slasher flick that creates more laughs than scares. On the contrary. This movie IS filled with plenty of scares and satirizes the horror genre in a way that literally has turned this film into a masterpiece. I guarantee you that while you may not love it (it nearly was rated NC-17 for its intense violence), you'll be highly amused by this one. A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, funny and clever ? the best Scream movie by miles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost a year after someone raped and killed Sidney Prescott's mother in the small town of Woodsboro, someone is killing teenagers. When Sidney herself becomes a target, the link is apparent and her missing father is a suspect. However, as with all good scary movies, everyone is a suspect.The film that sparked the revival of horror movies (Halloween H2O, I know what you did last summer, Urban Legend etc all followed?..thanks a lot!). This stands out from all those (and it's lackluster sequels) by being really good and clever. The story is nothing more than the standard slasher plot ? but it avoids the cliches quite well. In fact it uses the cliches as references and makes plenty of jokey references to other movies and the supposed rules of horror movies ? we even have a quick flash of a caretaker dressed in Freddy's jumper and hat!That doesn't mean it's not scary ? it is! From the tragically horrible opening 10 minutes through each gory killing the tension is high and the shocks are real. The plot twists nicely and the ending is much better than most slasher movies (including the absurd endings of 2 and 3). This manages to be fresh, clever and scary ? getting by any sticking moments with it's tongue in it's cheek.The cats are good ? Campbell is a believable virgin, scarred by what happened to her mother ? before she starts turning into Buffy the vampire slayer in parts 2 and 3. Cox is excellent playing against type and David Arquette is funny as the Deputy Sheriff. Kennedy as Randy is also funny as the movie geek ? in fact he remains the highlight of the next 2 films. The cast being filled of up and coming faces (including Ulrich) makes it even more thrilling when the `wrong' people get killed, technically all the cast are `unknowns' who usually make up the body count, so really anyone can potentially get offed.Overall funny black comedy, scary thrills and gory excitement. A rare treat ? a really good teen horror movie</fullReview>

Not that lame, typical horror film. This film was unpredictably scary. My friends were covering their eyes, but I wasn't, even though this movie scared the crap out of me! Neve Cambell was surprisingly impressive and I loved her character, Sydney, so strong willed.If you want a good Friday evening scare with friends, Scream is an excellent rental. I would make some popcorn but put it aside whenever the phone rings in the film because you might end up spilling popcorn all over the place.Scream Report Card:Acting A+ Script A+ Scares A+ Characters A+Final Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest slasher movies ever made--one of the years best films. ***1/2 out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SCREAM (1996) ***1/2Starring: Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Liev Schreiber, Drew Barrymore, and Henry Winkler Director: Wes Craven Running time: 111 minutes Rated R (for strong grizzly violence and gore, language, and some sexuality)By Blake French: "Scream" is the mother of all teen slasher films. From the opening sequence to the somewhat silly closing cliffhanger, it is one of the scariest productions of the past several years. Now, about the opening sequence, it features a penetrating Drew Barrymore receiving prank phone calls from a man with a deep, mysterious voice, who becomes more and more conversationally aggressive as they talk. "What's your name--because I want to know who I'm looking at." After building up some very effective momentum, the scene has a heart-stopping climatic payoff that isn't only pointless gore, but terrifying suspense. It is moments like these that make "Scream" one of the best movies of 1996.  "Scream" centers on a high school girl named Sidney Prescott, a modestly productive young woman who spends much of her time alone and with her boyfriend, Billy. She is approaching the anniversary of her mother's murder, whose killer has been convicted and sentenced to death. Sydney's school is in the process of mourning the brutal murder of two fellow classmates, and the pupils aren't exactly sympathetic.One night Sidney is home alone, and receives a phone call similar to the one in the opening scene. Sidney is tormented in that call, and after an exchange of a few unfriendly words, attacked by a dark individual wearing a white ghost mask. She fights him off, however, and lives another day, much in regard to the mysterious appearance of her boyfriend and a young, squeamish cop named Dewy.  The presentation of Sidney's life is not one-dimensional. The overlook on her schooling experiences, classmates, relatives, friends, and teachers are all believable. Strongly supporting the character are the details and sub-characters.  It is nearly impossible to watch "Scream" without making a list of assumed suspects to the numerous killings that take place. Here is my prediction list of murderer suspects, not telling who, if anyone, is the correct guess:· Dewy, the young police officer who suspiciously shows up at nearly every crime scene, and has somewhat of a psycho personality.· Sidney's boyfriend, Billy, who is actually sent to prison for a short period of time after being accused as a prime suspect. He also appears at a crime site unexpectedly.· Sidney's father, whom has motive for murder and is nowhere to be found locally.· A crazy video store clerk who is obsessed with scary movies and who I forget the details of.  Another element that makes "Scream" so great is the content of the murders. The victims aren't just helpless plot puppets waiting to die like a mannequin, but real people who want to live. Each puts up a good fight in defending themselves, and several nearly escape the killer. The characters who die are often unexpected, members of the main cast--making this production unpredictable.  The performances are electrifying in Wes Craven's highly acclaimed horror film. The actors act with dramatic intensity and the characters are perfectly cast. Each character is explored with suspicion, and due to Craven's direction, the villain's identity remains a mystery until the lazy finale. I am an experienced filmgoer, and I thought that I had the killer picked out at mid point in the film. But I was so wrong--the film had me fooled all along, and that is not an easy thing to do. I had no clue of who the killer actually was. "Scream" contains so many twists are turns that by the end of the movie, I couldn't have correctly predicated the killer's identity if my life depended on it.

		<shortDescription>Iconic, unique, fresh, a definitive new horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream With the countless number of teen slasher movies doing the rounds, it is too easy to watch scream and see simply another school serial killer movie that has just rolled off the factory production line. However, it was Wes Craven's 'Scream' that started the whole revival of the horror genre and re-invented the teen horror. Through no fault of its own, but rather a succession of bland rip-offs, not to mention a very successful spoof (Scary Movie), Scream's original impact has been severely dulled. Were Scream released today it would no doubt be moderately successful but would be instantly forgettable. But back in 1996 the teen horror market was wide open. The teenagers of the 90s were bored of traditional horror movies featuring haunted houses, vampires or deformed monsters. They had seen them all. So Wes Craven, having reinvigorated the horror genre once before with 'Nightmare on Elm Street', set out to do it again. This time, along with Kevin Williamson, who would go on to be creator of Dawson's Creek, created a new kind of horror ? one that you could laugh at as well as scream at.What made Scream so successful is that it was never patronising, and displayed a strong sense of ironic self-awareness. It took every horror cliché in the book and turned them upside down. For the kids that had seen too many movies, there was now a movie for them. The characters did not follow the clichés, but in fact talked about them, and talked about what would happen if they were in a movie. This sense of irony may seem tired now, but when Scream came out it was new and exciting. There was rarely a need to scream 'don't go upstairs' or suchlike in Scream, because the characters themselves were saying that! The idea of the killer being amongst the students adds a fresh dimension to the film, as fear gives way to paranoia at not being able to trust anyone. The subversions of the accepted horror clichés, in particular in the opening ten minutes (I'm not going to give anything away for those who have not seen it) also contribute to making Scream a truly shocking movie. It was this sense of innovation that made Scream such a breath of fresh air for the horror genre, and it is only a shame that Craven's genius has been ripped off so many times that his work has dated far too quickly. Craven and Williamson have also created a new horror star ? but it was not a particular character but just a costume with an iconic mask. The Scream mask has become just as symbolic, perhaps even more so, than that of Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees.For any serious horror movie fans, Scream is essential viewing, if only to witness the film that started it all. The 'movie within a movie' idea was terrific, and would be taken even further in the sequel. The frequent references to classic horror movies, and reversals of accepted horror clichés, especially in the opening ten minutes) are also fun to watch out for. There is even a wonderful moment where one boy climbs in the bedroom window of his girlfriend ? a scene that would be taken and used as one of the foundation for Williamson's successful teen series Dawson's Creek.The iconic mask, the one-liners, and the unique self-awareness when it comes to horror clichés make Scream a true original ? accept no imitations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever, scary and funny - a must-see for horror fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making a brilliant, original horror film is pretty hard these days, since practically everything has already been told, and more than once. Using that premise, director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson came up with Scream, whose cleverness derives from the fact that it knows every single stereotype of the genre and satirizes them.Take the opening sequence, for example: a young girl (Drew Barrymore) is making popcorn and waiting for her boyfriend when she suddenly receives a phone call. Normally, this would be a huge clich?, only this time the killer decides to play a little game (horror film quiz, naturally) with his victim. In fact, the only reason why he kills her is that she gave the wrong answer to one of his questions (those who haven't seen Friday 13th might want to skip that bit, as it spoils said movie's ending). That scene is both very scary (the murder is quite graphic and disturbing) and at the same time funny (it tests the characters', and the audience's, knowledge of the horror genre), and the rest of the film continues in the same vein: after the first killing, the masked psychopath starts disposing of other teenagers in the town of Woodsboro using the same technique. One of the targets is Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), whose mother was raped and killed the year before. This implies the killer might be the same, but who could it be? Sidney's distant father? Her mother's lover (Liev Schreiber)? Or some random guy, with no motive at all?Fortunately, it is not the last category: this murderer has a motive and a plausible identity as well. But it isn't the payoff that makes Scream interesting; it's how Craven and Williamson get to it, by outlining the genre's conventions (some of which were actually invented by the director himself) and using them in a clever, if self-referential, way. The point of the movie is, the more you know of this kind of films (pay attention to the rules, stated by geeky film buff Randy), the more chances you have to survive (although you must take into account that the killer has seen the same movies). The in-jokes that would ruin other films are the very cause of Scream's success, with memorable scenes such as the villain mimicking the movie his victims are watching or Craven's unmissable cameo as a janitor wearing Freddy Krueger's outfit (not to mention priceless lines like "Movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative!").In other words, Scream is a smart, effective horror film, which manages to amuse and scare in equal measures. Definitely worth watching, even if the two sequels (especially Scream 3) don't really match the original's intelligence and, forgive the expression, originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect movie to SCREAM about!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is truly an American horror classic, and I can guarantee that it will continue to be such for decades to come. The movie is a landmark in film making, considering the fact that it redefined and entire film genre! Scream is smart, funny, and suspenseful all at the same time, which gives the movie the perfect taste for anyone who wants to see a scary and satisfying horror sensation. I remember being so terrified by the Scream mask when I was little. I think I first saw the mask on TV when I was 2 and I was terrified of it, and I nearly peed my pants when I first watched the movie at the age of 6. Scream is the scariest movie that I have ever seen, and along with that, it is the best movie that I have ever seen. It has characters that are easy to connect with and love, especially Sidney Prescott. It is a very enjoyable movie, along with the other 3 in the series so far. I recommend this movie to everyone. It is a true horror phenomenon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Craven proves he's a master of horror and innovation with Scream, over 10 years since his last smash A Nightmare on Elm Street. Craven had been a legend for 3 decades, but with this he made possibly his best known film, reinventing a dead genre for better and worse, making horror films profitable again. More importantly it gave horror fans something to cheer about, a smart, funny, sexy, but above all scary film.Scream's intro has already gone down in movie history as the benchmark of a shocking and effective way to start a film. Take an established actress, and eventually butcher her to set the tone. The phone, knife, shocks, inevitability of death, blood, helplessness, and a love of scary movies. Craven turns what we expect on its head, and we know we are in for something special. We are introduced to Sydney Prescott, a teenager whose mother was murdered a year ago, trying to get on with her life, coping with school, boyfriend, the court case involving Cotton who has been charged with her mother's murder, and intrusion from journalists. She has become strong through this ordeal, but is still vulnerable. Her boyfriend Billy wants sex, but won't push her as she is still a virgin. The news of the new murder comes as a shock to the whole town. Journalists flock in, including Gail Weathers who had accused Sydney of lies. In school the news spreads, and the cops question the students. Sydney's tight group of friends try to work out who it was, believing everyone's a suspect. Her friends are Tatum, feisty, strong whose boyfriend is like her, and Randy, movie nerd who secretly loves Sydney. When Sydney is attacked, it seems the killer is after her. Her father is supposedly out of town and cannot be found, a curfew is ordered and all the kids have a party. Soon the killer attacks, but who is it? This is clearly one of the best horror movies of the decade, not just an excuse for gore, but clever on many levels, and self-referential. It is more than that, being one of the best looks at teenage life in the last few years. The characters are extremely well drawn, taking stereotypes, but changing them against our expectations, enhanced by some brilliant performances. Every cast member performs well, with special mention to Randy, Arquette and Lillard. Cox is good, but Campbell is excellent, going through a myriad of emotions, proving that her character does not have to be stupid like most would typically be.Craven is in control, feeding us clues as to the identity of the killer, but ensuring that by the end we are surprised. Gore is used wonderfully, the scares and jokes are many, but it is the story of Sydney which makes it a classic. She is strong willed, smart, and we go through every emotion with her, aided by Neve's performance. We feel for her, but know we cannot help. The film is shot beautifully, the scenery stunning, an idyllic place to live, but with dark secrets. We get many close-ups of each character's face, Leone style, and we are hurt when one is killed, but become suspicious of each one. The script is sharp with many references to horror movies which the fan will try to recognise.Thematically we return to Elm Street territory. We must fight for ourselves in the world, and while our friends are the most important people in our lives, they may not be around forever and we must be able to cope with their loss. Parents are either not around, don't care, don't understand, or are to blame. Sydney's mum seems to be the catalyst for the deaths, the only authority figure to gain respect is Dewey, who isn't much older than the teens. The opening scene as Casey crawls towards her nearby parents, with the killer behind her highlights this, that the older generation will not always be able to keep us safe. The Headmaster, played by Henry Winkler hates kids, but he cannot organise or gain respect from them either.We are never certain of Gail's intentions, another point to do with the media's involvement in society today. Death has become trivialised, the victims just a ploy for ratings or power for those who tell the stories. Our thoughts on violence, on violent movies are challenged, Craven a veteran of criticism over use of violence. In the end it's up to us as individuals. The film shows that places we believed to be safe-our homes, and schools, have become dangerous places today too, that we are not safe anywhere. In a group, or by yourself, we are still vulnerable. The scene in the school toilets emphasises this point, and is another beautiful scene. However, the film teaches us that rather than being overcome by fear, by the fact that we are not always safe, we should fight.The death scenes and scary parts are memorable. My favourites- Sydney on her porch, staring over the hills, and the scene with Sydney, Billy and Gus's Don't Fear the Reaper playing in the background. It gives a perfect glimpse of what it is like to be in love at that age, and together with Campbell's beauty makes an odd atmosphere, especially when viewed again, having watched the other 2 films. We become intimate with Sydney, wishing we could save her from her pain.With the combination of genres subverted, a brilliant script and score, some excellent acting, good scares and jokes, Scream paved the way for a new breed of horror films, none of which, like Halloween and Elm Street, have matched it. We should be thankful for Craven, as he has provided the world with another film which should be watched and talked about as much as those felt to be the best movies of all time. This is certainly one of the best of our time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror legend, Wes Craven, wanted to mix a traditional slasher film, with a who done it mystery, while at the same time parading both. The result is Scream, which turned into a much bigger film and franchise than he expected. He wanted to do this sort of under the radar, with a cast of virtual unknowns, but due to its uniqueness, the movie quickly gained popularity and today is considered one of the best horror movies of all time. The cast are all household names now and the ending of this film is legendary. Twists, turns, paranoia, accusations, one liners, and good looking people is what Scream is all about. The story is a great one, the cast is solid, and when it comes to writer/directors, you can't get much better than Wes Craven. The original Scream is one that should be on your must see list!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is your favourite scary movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the 1990s the Slasher genre was becoming stale, filled with clichés, countless sequels and very predictable and uninventive. Likely two men was able to play on this, Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven was able to play on this and made a really excellent take on Slashers.In the small town of Woodsboro two teenagers (Drew Barrymore and Kevin Patrick Walls) are shockingly murdered, a year after a woman was raped and murdered in the town centre. Very quickly the town is thrown into turmoil, with the media reporting on it, but the teens do not seem to be worried. The killer, known as Ghost-face soon targets another Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), the daughter of a victim, who luckily escapes. But Ghost-face is going to rest and goes on a mission to take down Sidney and anyone who stands in his way.Scream works because it is set in a world where horror movies do exist and teenagers know clichés. It is a self-aware horror film and has a lot of references to classic horror films like Halloween. Scream is forced to be inventive and Craven who is a master of the horror genre, so knew what he was doing with this film.Even if Scream was not made with a post-modern, self-aware horror with a comic edge, it still would have been an excellent horror film and one of the best slashers around. Craven and Williamson made sure their characters were fully developed, likable or at least normal. Sidney is a character with a lot of a baggage because of her mother's death and afraid to get close to people. She is a likable because is a friendly, smart, decent girl who is also tough. Sidney's friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) was tough no-nonsense girl who could have easily been the clichéd slut role, but that was avoided because she was a good friend and competent. Courteney Cox plays a unpleasant journalist who cares more ratings and book sales more then safety of people and emotional harm. She is not a journalist who is looking to report the truth or for the public interest. But she does come good at the end. The characters of Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and Stuart (Matthew Lillard) offer a lot of comic relief particular because of their knowledge of horror films. And David Arquettte is solid as a competent police officer who has a typical brother-sister relationship with Tatum.Cavern made sure Scream was exciting with a lot of action, violence and creative deaths. I particular like his technique of using the camera to follow the victims and move it around the house, adding excitement and intrigue. He knows how to build suspects and he does keep you guessing. I don't get scared watching horror films but you do care for Sidney and the idea of being home alone at night can make you more tense.I do have a criticism. They does not seem to be much of a reaction at the school hearing about two of their peers being brutally murdered. Most people seem to be very causal about it and saw it as something fun, not worried about a serial killer being on the loose or just saw it as an excuse for a party. Come on, if they was a murder in a small town there would be more sadden, grief and worry. Personally I would have focused on this collective reaction, but I am a more serious person and possibly would have a thriller/a social piece.Overall, Scream is certainly a worthy horror film, no manner what generation of horror fan you are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I screamed alright.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I screamed because of how bad this movie is.We'll start with Wes Craven. The guy made one good movie in his whole career...A Nightmare On Elm Street. And even that could have been twice as good as it is. This is just more generic crap from the Craven factory.Second, the writer. Kevin Williamson. I think that's his name. I'm not going to look it up either because he doesn't deserve it. Not only did he write this horrible piece of crap, but he also wrote I Know What You Did Last Summer (AKA Prom Night the remake). The only good thing about that was the possibility for a spoof called I Forget What You Did Last Summer. But enough of that crap (literally), let's get back to Scream.The movie starts with a carbon-copy of the opening of When A Stranger Calls (which was fifty times scarier than everything Williamson and Craven did put together twice). Then we get into the actual movie, which is just constant references to other horror films.My main gripe with this movie is not the writing or directing...but the characters. All of them. We literally have NO reason to care about ANY of them. Rose McGowan is nice to look at, but that's as far as it goes. But the worst is the actual killer himself. I know they were trying to break the invincible horror movie killer cliché intentionally, but they went WAY too far. This guy falls over at the drop of a hat! Instead of being totally indestructible, he's just plain clumsy. And why on Earth was he dressed up in his disguise while at the grocery store in broad daylight? And when the identity of the killer is finally revealed, it's really no shock considering he did absolutely nothing for the whole film, not to mention that he has no motive except for some little soap-opera bullcrap that we're just supposed to believe. It doesn't come as any type of shock at all.Is this movie horror, or comedy? It tries to be both but never goes far enough in either direction and just ends up being neither funny nor frightening. Williamson and Craven think that referencing great horror movies means that theirs will be great, too. All that did was remind me of how awesome a movie like Halloween is and how pathetic this tripe is.But the worst to come out of this movie is actually it's influence on other horror films to come. The fresh teen cast, all featured on the cover art in the same exact fashion as this movie. If you're ever at the video store and see a box cover that mimics that of Scream's cover...just walk away. Because honestly...what Scream-influenced movie was even halfway decent? None.Scream is anti-horror. It's everything that a horror movie should NOT be. Fresh teen cast, bright cinematography, clumsy/harmless killer, fast-cut editing, banal directing, forgettable action movie score, references to other horror movies, too much comedy, unbelievable sequences, characters that we have no reason to care for, and to top it all off...it spawned countless imitators that were even worse! Do yourself a favor...don't watch this. Watch something great instead. Something like Rosemary's Baby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Scream" - 15 years later, it's still the mother of all modern-day, MTV-generation slasher movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, here it is, finally, the mother of all modern-day, MTV-generation slashers: "Scream" is the popular 1996 slasher epic that single-handedly signaled the return of the slasher movie, and also single-handedly revitalized the sagging horror genre. But there was a twist: a large part of "Scream's" massive success had to deal with its open acknowledgment of its source material, lending the movie a level of self-awareness that had never been done before in horror (or at the very least, done very successfully).The closest horror movies I can probably think of before then might have been "The Lost Boys" (1987), or maybe even "An American Werewolf in London" (1981). (And yes, I do realize there is a possibility that I could be wrong, but those are the only two I can immediately think of.)The movie also represented a marriage of old and new: horror maestro Wes Craven ("A Nightmare on Elm Street," "The Hills Have Eyes," "The Last House on the Left," "Shocker," - to name a few), the man behind the camera of this wildly inventive slasher, was a seasoned professional in the horror genre at the time, yet his career at the point up until "Scream" seemed seriously lagging - despite the mild success of the reality-bending "New Nightmare" in 1994. Enter into the picture newbie screenwriter Kevin Williamson, whose inspired script for "Scream" took the lessons of past slasher flicks and injected a hip, knowing, mid-1990s cynicism and self-consciousness into the material that didn't ride the fine line into camp territory: the kids in this movie spoke and acted like they *knew* they were in a horror film. Together, these two gave us horror movie heaven - "Scream."Despite the over-riding sense of self-knowing and movie referencing humor, "Scream" is still edge-of-your-seat entertainment of the first order. It's a ludicrous premise that in theory should not work, but it does: the movie is still pretty damn scary (in addition to being gruesomely bloody and gory), even though all the characters are keenly aware of the "facts" of horror movies yet still knowingly break the rules established by the three godfathers of the slasher genre - the aforementioned "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (my personal favorite slasher movie), "Halloween" (1978), and "Friday the 13th" (1980).The film's plot is deceptively simple: Somebody is taking their love of scary movies too far, and they're making a killing (pun intended). The classic opening double-murder sequence (featuring Drew Barrymore) sets the tone for the rest of the movie, and that is a non-stop roller coaster ride of thrills, chills, and laughs. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell, whose performance here officially ushered her into being the MTV generation's scream queen) leads an all-star cast of a slasher movie that also doubles as a brilliantly thrilling whodunit.So whodunit? It obviously wasn't the ultra-feisty reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), nor was it Sidney's best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) or Tatum's bumbling older brother, Deputy Dewey (David Arquette). Or was it one of them? Either way, other suspects include Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich, whose character's name is an obvious reference to the late Donald Pleasance's Dr. Sam Loomis from ye old "Halloween"), Tatum's mentally deficient boy-toy Stu (Matthew Lillard), or was it the movie-loving nerd Randy (Jamie Kennedy)?I've seen "Scream" countless times over the years, several of those times were in a high school graphic design class my sophomore year. I got into it around '99 or 2000, three or four years after the fact, but I loved it from the opening moments. Upon a refresher viewing today to mark the 15th anniversary of the film's release, I realize "Scream" has not lost of any its impact. But because "Scream" was the movie that revitalized the horror and slasher genres in a single dose, it didn't take long for imitators to follow its self-knowing, movie-referencing satirical formula, and some of those imitators include its three sequels (released in 1997, 2000, and 2011). (And how about those slasher movie parodies in the "Scary Movie" series? Isn't it ironic that "Scream" was initially titled "Scary Movie"?) It was a formula that worked once and only once.Most famously, perhaps, "Scream" firmly established once and for all, the "rules" for surviving horror movies. Drum roll Randy:1) Sex = death,2) No drinking or doing drugs, and3) Never say, "I'll be right back" because you won't be.15 years later, "Scream" is just as thrilling, entertaining, and funny as it was when I first saw it as an impressionable teenager in 1999 or 2000. Wes Craven has always had a way for directing scary movies with lively and three-dimensional characters, but "Scream" carried the revered horror master and his chief screenwriter into mainstream blockbuster territory, three more times, even.(Yes, I loved - that's right, I said I loved "Scream 4"; it's the best and funniest since the original.)10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course Scary Movie was the working title of this Wes Craven vehicle, which got hijacked by the Wayans to make their spoof of this (and other Horror movies of that time). Craven also had made the latest (til then that is) Nightmare movie, called "New Nightmare". It was the first one that got into the whole "we are aware this is a movie, while we're doing it", but wasn't as successful as the Scream movies became. Even though it was a success in America it did take almost a year to come out in Germany for example.And while the movie "plays" with rules and has fun with it, it is also pretty scary. Of course friends of mine didn't like the fact, that it tried to be funny and scary. Some people like their horror movies to be straight and not fourth-wall breaking. But this one is really a great example how to do it. It also helped Kevin Williamson to become famous (at least for awhile, he worked with Robert Rodriguez - Faculty) and Wes Craven to be "hot" once again.As you can see, I have not really written anything about the movie yet. I won't really tell you what it is about, but I will dare you to watch it, if you dig horror comedies. Hopefully before you watch the spoof that is called "Scary Movie" ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for a slasher. I even like the bad ones like "Halloween: Resurrection" and "Urban Legends: Final Cut" but to me they're really fun and often have a really cool twist ending. So when an actual good slasher comes along, I'm all over it. As soon as "Scream" starts with its tremendous opening, you know you're in for a really fun and interesting film with originality. "Scream" ticks all the boxes and is probably the best slasher film ever! Wes Craven's known for his "Nightmare on Elm St.", "The Hills Have Eyes" and such. All have been OK, but I think Wes has really found his place in the teen slasher genre. He makes it fun and original with the help of the excellent writers who are actually really clever at creating irony plus funny lines and characters.The thing that holds a slasher together is its characters and "Scream" has really memorable characters. Courtney Cox is a delight as the originally annoying TV presenter that eventually turns into someone who we actually really like. David Arquette is also really funny as Deputy Dewey the policeman. In fact the whole cast is brilliantly fun, including Matthew Lillard who is suitably hammy as the friend of the group.Aside from the memorable characters and sharp wit, "Scream" is also really exciting and suspenseful. There's even a chase scene that lasts a good 15 minutes. A rarity where nowadays its a quick 2 second chase in the woods. The cinematography and camera movements are also really interesting. The camera sometimes has this dream-like quality to it that suits the film really well. "Scream" never gets dull, it's tense and exciting right up to the shocking end twist that really fulfills your expectations."Scream" grasps you by the throat from the minute it starts and doesn't let go. It's memorable and really exciting fun. If you're a fan of slashers like me then "Scream" should be at the top of your list. The sequels are quite good as well, especially the incredible latest instalment "Scream 4" that is probably on par with this incredible original. Horror fans should also really appreciate the references to classic horror films throughout the film.

		<shortDescription>Enjoyed it a lot more than expected...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been recently reading a lot of reviews of the latest film in this series, Scream 4. Now, for one reason or another I have never seen any of the 'Scream' films before? well not all the way through anyway. Time to change that I thought and so here we are with the first one, Scream. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would, it doesn't take itself all that seriously and there's an awful lot more humour than I expected.We open with a mysterious voice calling up a girl called Casey, who is home alone about to watch a scary movie. She tries to blow him off but he is persistent and eventually begins to creep her out. Things don't end too well for Casey, or her boyfriend, Steve, after a masked assailant has finished with them. We then switch to another girl, Sidney, her mother had been murdered almost a year ago and her father is about to leave on a business trip. All the talk the next day at school is about the murder and on returning home Sidney receives a call from a man with a mysterious voice. She isn't so easily scared, but still she is attacked by the same masked assailant. Having fought him off, her boyfriend, Billy turns up just before Deputy Dewey. Having found a cell phone on him, Dewey arrests Billy and Sidney goes to stay the night with Dewey's sister, Tatum. As time goes by the bodies begin to mount up and this attracts the media, particularly ambitious reporter, Gale Weathers. It's only a matter of time before Sidney is to be the next on the list, and anyway, there's a score to settle and an awful lot of suspects.This made a refreshing change for me, a horror film that doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time has all the scares and shocks of a more serious one. I liked it! Decent performances all round; Neve Campbell did a good job as Sidney, as did Skeet Ulrich as Billy. Also of note were Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers, David Arquette as Deputy Dewey and Matthew Lillard as Stuart. Also nice cameos from Drew Barrymore as Casey, Wes Craven very briefly appeared as Fred the Janitor and Henry Winkler as Principal Arthur Himbry.There is a great soundtrack too, including an interesting acoustic rendition of 'Don't Fear the Reaper' when Sidney and Billy are first seen on screen together (very nicely done). I suspect, unfortunately, that the other films in the series may not live up to this rather good beginning, but we shall see? If you haven't seen it, it's definitely worth a viewing, even if you're not really a fan of teen horrors (like me)? Final verdict: Recommended.My Score: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't yet watched this film but you know the plot is a killer dressed up chasing some teens and think it sounds all too unoriginal, think again!The first 15 minutes of this film will go down in not just horror cinema history, but cinema's history in general. Also, even if you have watched just one horror film in the past, the rules stated in this movie will make perfect sense.Scream is one huge guessing game, and you can almost guarantee your first and second guesses wont be correct. Another great thing about Scream is that it catches you off guard with the comedy it has in between death/chase scenes, and in some cases, comedy during these tense and on-the-edge-of-your-seat scenes.Overall, its a complete must see for a slasher/horror fan of any level, as it is a surprisingly brilliant masterpiece of a horror flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream (1996)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>80/100. The movie that begun the silver age of slasher films in the mid to late 1990's. Although Wes Craven's horror filmography is glowing with other culturally significant trips to the macabre ( A Nightmare on Elm Street, Last House on the Left, The Hills Have Eyes) I consider 'Scream' to be his greatest achievement. Not only was the timing for the film perfect, but Kevin Williamson's simple yet brilliant script and an almost perfect cast help hail this movie as one of the best horror movies of the 1990's. Neve Campbell as the film's sexually repressed or 'final girl' character, if you will, rivals that of the original scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis. David Arquette as Dewey Riley steals the spotlight every scene he's in, Courtney Cox proves her acting talent by playing a stuck up, malevolent news reporter whose passion and slight hint of selflessness makes her character hard to not love, while Jamie Kennedy helps channel the audience's thoughts and concerns to everyone on screen. Even minor characters such as Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, and even Henry Winkler all have memorable roles. Drew Barrymore's opening scene although perhaps a little over-the-top, is both memorable and nostalgic to horror movie lore. This strongly meta influenced film is one of the few to get the concept right and the laugh to scare ratio is perfect. The final act is a wild ride that should make everyone shudder at how plausible it would be for someone to put on a Halloween costume and start butchering inebriated teenagers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The little parody that could.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this again for the first time since it hit theaters. Scream has been parodied and copied so many times the film itself is now a cliché but that doesn't change the brilliance of the original. In some ways Scream is an end cap to the modern slasher sub-genre beginning with Halloween on one end and culminating in Scream. Sure, there have been a number of slashers since but the genre hasn't dominated horror as they did in the two decades following Halloween. Scream isn't terribly original but by capitalizing on that it serves to masterfully sum up the genre and two decades of films before it. Wes Craven, where are you now? Deliver us from Eli Roth and Uwe Boll!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Jamie Kennedy and Drew Barrymore star in Wes Craven's 1996 horror film. A girl and her friends are targeted by a killer obsessed with scary movies. Sidney Prescott (Campbell) is a teenage girl who lives in Woodsboro, California with her father and is trying to get over the death of her mother murdered a year before. She also has a boyfriend, Billy Loomis (Ulrich) and friends, Randy Meeks (Kennedy), Tatum Riley (McGowan) and Stu Macher (Lillard) who's also Tatum's boyfriend. When 2 classmates, Casey Becker (Barrymore) and her boyfriend, Steve Orth are brutally murdered by a psychotic killer obsessed with scary movies, Sidney and her friends become targeted. Arquette plays Tatum's older brother, Dewey who's a deputy helping Sidney and Cox plays Gale Weathers, a reporter determined to get a story and free falsely accused man, Cotton Weary (Liev Shreiber) who Sidney thought killed her mother. Sidney realizes she could be wrong about Cotton and everyone is a suspect. This is one of Craven's best that redefined the horror genre featuring a good cast &amp; score. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You May Not Scream, But You Will Grin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 90's, the slasher genre was worn out. Series like "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th" had gravitated away from their horror routes and were now like comedies. The longevity of these series were now a running joke to the audience, and the genre needed some new life. So "A Nightmare on Elm Street" director Wes Craven decided to make "Scream"."Scream" is a horror movie that is self aware. While most films in the genre are usually mocked for being so cliché, "Scream" celebrates it and cleverly follows the classic formula.The beginning of "Scream" opens up with Drew Barrymore. Many people thought that, due to the marketing campaign, she was going to be the lead role, since she was such a big name at the time. But, no, she's actually killed within 15 minutes. It's kind of a tribute to "Psycho", where Janet Leigh was portrayed to be the main hero, but was abruptly killed early.So then, the film transitions over to Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell. Sidney's mother was raped and killed a year prior to the film, and as such, Sidney is in a depression. I find Capmbell's performance to be very solid for a horror film, and this is my favourite role she's been in. This is the film that launched her career. She may have a respectable resume these days, but in my heart, shes a scream queen.Sidney has a boyfriend named Billy, played by Skeet Ulrich. Neve Campbell had co-starred with him earlier that year in "The Craft". In his very first scene, Billy sneaks into Sidney's room just to make-out with her. But the way he proposes it is funny as hell. Funny enough, this is probably the way I would propose it if I had a girlfriend.Then there's Sidney's best friend, Tatum, played by a young Rose McGowan. Funny to think that in 11 years, this chick would be blowing the hell out of zombies with a gun-leg in "Planet Terror".Tatum's older brother, Dewey, is played by David Arquette, who is the real life older brother of Patricia Arquette. Patricia had starred in "A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3: Dream Warriors". Dewey is an easily lovable character. He comes off as kinda wimpy and weak, but you just love him.Then there's Gale Weathers, played by Courtney Cox. Gale's a news reporter, but she also becomes Dewey's love interest. While the sequels expanded upon this, in the original, it seems like Gale is just using Dewey to get to Sidney for her next big story. Sidney gets so mad at Gale that she punches her square in the face. I laugh my head off every time I see this part.But the man who steals the whole film is Randy, played by Jamie Kennedy. Randy is a film buff, always overflowing with film references and great humour. Randy is probably my favourite film character of all time. Mostly cause I can relate to him. Being a film buff myself, I know the mindset, and thats my favourite part about Randy. He's always in movie-mode.The finale is a 40 minute long build up, sprinkled with a kill here and there, and it keeps you guessing at who the killer really is. Speaking of which, I haven't even talked about the killer yet.The killer's costume was an actual real life Halloween costume that was already popular before the movie. It's kinda like the original "Halloween", where the filmmakers went out, just bought a random mask from the store, and used it for the movie. Reusing this technique was very smart in my opinion, cause it truly gives the feeling that the killer could be anyone.Overall, I love this movie. While it's in no way a masterpiece of horror cinema, the modern age owes a lot to "Scream". It revitalized the slasher genre and brought a new audience's attention back to the classics. It's not a landmark, but it's a pretty solid horror film. Check it out.</fullReview>

I was apprehensive because of the 18 rating but I don't really know why, I personally think it was more 15 worthy as there was nowhere near as much blood and gore as I thought there would be. The death scenes weren't that elaborate, I mean yes the garage door was a little odd but mainly stabbings with knives. I already knew who the killers were and that kinda spoilt it for me but I think it was fairly obvious who it was. I also watched scary movie before this and was shocked at how they are virtually the same. It had a good story- line and great actors.

		<fullReview>'Scream' is a scary movie however the light-heart attitude of this movie makes it quite funny also.The story begins with a phone call and ends with a blood bath in true horror style. A young teenager Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) gets a mysterious phone call and the caller asks a series of questions most famously "What's your favorite scary movie?" he terrorizes her for a good ten minutes and probably the most terrifying scene in this movie he finally kills her while wearing the famous ghost-face costume.The story jumps between horror and comedy, for most of the movie the viewer's heart is racing and for the rest they are roaring laughing. Much of the comedy is provided by the stupidity of Dewey Riley (David Arquette) the always lovable character.Much of this movie revolves around one character Sidney Prescott (Neve Cambell) and the grief she suffered since her mother was murdered and she a witness. An inpatient boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) seems a suspect of the Woodsboro murders as does many others even Sidney's father (Laurence Hecht) and her friends as well.I think it is safe to say Wes Craven has done it again in creating 'Scream' it is well recommended on seeing especially at night. So all I've left to say is "What's your favorite scary movie?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to build it up to the skies only to disappoint you, but this is the best horror movie I've ever seen. I've spent a while trying to find one that can remotely compete. You can't do it. This movie has everything. Instense psychological horror, reasonable and tasteful gore, romance, drama, comedy, mystery, the most witty and human and lovable characters you'll ever find within the genre and just about EVERYTHING else you could ever hope for in a horror film. If you're one of those people who can't stand movies with the little "why did he go in there"s and "why didn't they follow her"s, this one's for you. By openly acknowledging the existence of horror movies and the rules of the slasher film, this is an effective satire of said "scary movies".The next time you have a chance, I beg you, grab your closest friend, find yourself in an empty, creepy room, turn off the lights and WATCH THIS FILM. Believe me. You will never regret it.From the gentle fragility and great inner strength of Sidney to the laughably cruel and fun Gale Weathers to the goofy and naive Deputy Dewey, by the wicked wit of Phonevoice to the might of Ghostface, in hopes you one day join us Scream geeks in the finest horror kingdom of them all, I officially recommend to you this most excellent film.May you abide by Randy's Rules for ever,l-am-masterjedi</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening ten minuets of this film sum up a new age of slasher film in a brutal and chilling way. Scream isn't Halloween or Friday the 13th but something new and refreshing to the horror/slasher genre. The opening scene consists of the standard horror movie set up but before you feel comfortable enough to condemn the film from the start the brilliance of this movie comes into play. The Voice - Roger Jackson.The voice is so significant, so unique that it attracts you in a way in which you feel that your being spoken to directly. Another underlining aspect of this film isn't the killer but what the killer is wearing. The Ghostface costume/mask is so significant that when seen it is instantly recognisable. The eeriness of the costume adds to the effect of the film because it allows the audience to try and play a guessing game of who it can be. A guessing game which goes on till the final few scenes.A chilling film which ensures that horror movies will never be the same again.It's a scream, baby.</fullReview>

Scream was the smash hit that transformed the horror genre. Scream is a rarity of horror, spoof, laughs, thrills, chills, and overall Wes Craven crafted another amazing horror classic.I'm going to try and keep this review short. Mainly because a majority of people already know this is a good movie. I honestly believe, it takes someone with the talent of Wes Craven, to somewhat poke fun at the horror genre, and in the same film deliver a good horror movie. The movie is original, and even though it has '90s written all over it, it still feels organic and fun.Everyone does an amazing job acting in the film. Neve Campbell is tough as nails, David Arquette and Courteney Cox work well on screen, Matthew Lillard is funny and scary, along with the rest of the cast. My only complaint, is from the poster of the film, you would expect Drew Barrymore (Charlie's Angels, 50 First Dates) to be the star. I believe they did this as an extra way to make money, and cash in on her popularity.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Scream. If you haven't seen this movie, what the Hell are you waiting for? Seriously, it's more than a movie for horror nerds and geeks. It's a movie that should be seen by any movie lover. Oh, and the Fonz is in it! I believe Scream earns a...9/10!This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you all for reading/viewing, and I know you'll all have an amazing day as always. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genre-defining classic, 1996's "Scream" still holds up even now, 20 years later! Fiendishly entertaining, often hilarious and genuinely eerie when it needs to be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that 1996's "Scream", a genre-defining horror and satire, is 20 years old. Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson's masterpiece of self-aware thrills and chills was a landmark upon release, and redefined the world of cinema in a big- bad way? inspiring not only its own legacy of three sequels and a recent popular spin-off television series, but also ushering in a new wave of horror films taking influence from its style and tonality as well as re-igniting interest in the genre as a whole after a decidedly dead period in the early 90's.But does the film, an undeniable phenomenon of its decade, still hold up all these years later? The answer is a resounding "yes"!Following tragic lead Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), the film follows a plot involving a psychopathic murderer tormenting a small American town. Seemingly obsessed with horror films, the killer first calls and torments his victims, often referencing popular horror and slasher films, before striking. High School Student Sidney, who is still reeling from her mother's murder one year prior, is having her own personal troubles, which are only made all the worse when it comes to be clear that she is seemingly one of the prime targets of the killer. And so, during a massive high-school party, the stage is set for a bloody, brutal (and hilarious) final battle against the mysterious figures that have been rampaging through town!The real reason the film is such a hit is the expert writing, Craven's direction and the absolute charm of the cast. In particular, I have to give high praise to Williamson's script, which is expertly refined and finds a pitch-perfect balance between self- aware comedy and fiendish horror thrills. The characters in the film have all seen the slasher flicks the killers are trying to emulate, leading to a lot of wonderful moments. Including a laugh- out-loud scene where Sidney explains the common rules of horror film bimbo's doing things like "running up the stairs" when they should be running out of the door? only to see her ironically forced into the same situation. Or the iconic scene where supporting character Randy (Jamie Kennedy in what is perhaps his most well-known role) literally explains the rules of surviving a horror movie to his drunken party-going classmates while they hoot and holler and intentionally break the rules.Craven's direction perfectly compliments the wonderful screen writing. Craven, an icon who will be sorely missed after his recent unfortunate passing, was an authority in horror? three decades in a row, he helped to define the direction the horror genre was heading, between "Last House on the Left", "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and this film. His sense of visual storytelling had a sense of class and his guidance in his cast and crew helped translate Williamson's fantastic writing to the screen almost flawlessly.And then there's the cast. Good lord is this a great assembly of performers. Neve Campbell is endlessly likable and identifiable as out troubled heroin. Supporting roles played by the likes of Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich and Mathew Lillard are all great additions and give great justice to their roles. (Yes, even Kennedy and Lillard- who can be disliked in some circles, are excellent here.) And the film even introduced relative newcomers Courtney Cox and David Arquette to a wider audience with their scene-stealing roles as reporter Gale Weathers and Deputy Dewey Riley. Wonderful, wonderful, WONDERFUL cast!Heck, even the sort-of pink-elephant element of the film being "so 90's" (one of the reasons why some younger people I know are hesitant to give it a shot) lends to its charm, because it's such a refreshing time-capsule of nostalgia. This is one of those films where, despite the carnage, it'll give audiences who were alive in that decade a fuzzy sense of years-long-past. And it gives the film a further layer for re-watching and re-visiting, especially when analyzing and comparing it to other horror films over the years.It's without doubt a classic. Nearly without flaw. Still relevant to this day thanks to its wonderful observations on genre. And still fiendishly haunting and uproariously hilarious."Scream" is easily a 10 out of 10. And still very much well-worth watching for not only fans of horror, but fans of film as a whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a surprise!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is a good movie, more of that is a great meta-movie /parody of the slasher genre of horror ,which by 1996 ,when scream came out was in decline. West Craven here in a way made fun the main movies of his directorial history (like A Nightmare on Elm Street) and show us that even the most hardcore Filmer can be caught of guard. That is in a sense the story of Scream and fortunately Mr Craven and the actors made a great job pocking fun in the clichés of the horror movies we all know and either love or hate. To the point this flick was a sleeper hit and twenty years later has become the guideline of "How to survive a horror movie". Before I saw for the first time Scream ,I thought that it was overrated, after seen it it more than deserves the praise it gets. If I have to nit pick some thinks, is the fact that it is a bit dated for todays standards and the chill which once made people chill ,has been spoiled due to the low point in which horror movies are in modern-days. Note that it also had unnecessary sequels like the films it made fun of, what a irony!I am pretty sure that, horror movies will come back ,like the superheroes movies before them and Scream will be seen as a historic film ,like Phsyco(1960), Dracula(1930) ,Alien(1979), The Thing(1982) and the rest of the historic horror movies which even today we praise them as landmarks. It will come its time for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you are looking for cleverly crafted thriller Scream is most definitely for you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is often disregarded as just another cheesy slasher film to those who have not seen it, or are not a fan of the horror genre. Though yes Scream is considered a slasher film it marks something different for the horror slasher genre. I admit I entered watching this film with an expectation of slasher trademarks, bad acting, easy kills, bad decisions made by the main characters, a masked killer. Let me say I was more than pleasantly surprised by the artistry in this film in comparison to its predecessors such as Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street. Wes Craven has been credited with the classic film direction for Nightmare on Elm, but Scream takes you to another level of creativity. With a sense of mystery as well as the gore of a slasher it makes for an enjoyable experience.The movie acts as an interesting double narrative, allowing the watcher to become invested in a murder mystery, while also getting a commentary on prior slasher film conventions. Characters are found making direct references to previous slashers sometimes even making fun of them. There are also several visual tricks used in reference to past films. One of the easiest ones to pick up on is one of the characters in Scream Billy's striking resemblance to Johnny Depps character in, you guessed it, Nightmare on Elm Street. There are also several other little nuances lovers of classic horror can pick up on , from cameos to name similarities.If you are looking for cleverly crafted thriller Scream is most definitely for you. It is a movie that continuously keeps you guessing with just the right amount of jump scares and red herrings. The twist ending will leave you wondering what clues you may have missed even prompting you to watch again. I know I would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>******SPOILER FREE***** Scream must be applauded for what it did. It made a credible horror movie that got people interested in a film genre that by 1996 had all but died a death. It made the slasher movie relevant once again, and remains the best of its genre, despite a myriad of copies and similar styled movies.I can imagine the annoyance felt by Drew Barrymore, who I don't think they that it would spurn 3 sequels.Each sequel that's followed has dipped in quality to its predecessor, the forth installment was poor, the second good, and the third watchable.This first film is funny, scary and energetic, no wonder it was a huge success. Neve Campbell is great, Sydney is also the most interesting character in the movie.Is there any horror fan that's not seen it? can't be..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For me an inventive mixed bag, but there's more good than not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've gone back and forth in my feelings about "Scream" both times I've seen it, almost 20 years ago when it opened, and just now There are times when its meta-parody- but?still-scary approach to teen slasher films works quite well, especially the ending which manages to be funny, scary, over the top, and socially witty all at the same time. Other times it's too self conscious to actually be scary, but not surprising enough in its humor to really be as much fun as it could be. It's also a hard film to criticize, because the answer to almost every complaint (e.g. the actors playing high school kids all look like they're well into in their 20s) can always be 'but that's the whole point, it's always that way in these movies'. But one thing that does annoy me that isn't so easily shrugged off is that the cast seem to be in a number of different movies. Skeet Ulrich, for example, brings a surprising amount of realism and depth to his character, while Courtney Cox as an 'I'll do anything for a story' reporter plays a cartoon of a cartoon. This isn't of issue of 'good' versus 'bad' acting, but it does make figuring out just what the tone of the film is, more muddy than it needs to be. Probably the best thing about 'Scream' is it knows when to BE best. The opening and closing 15 minutes are the two strongest sections of the film, so if the middle is a little all over the place and sometimes repetitive, and a little more obvious in it's humor, that's not what you walk away remembering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Craven's cult classic horror film follows in the aftermath of two students grizzly murders. As the town mourns over their deaths, a group of high school seniors mourn in their own way, by relating them to the grandfather horror films of the past. Soon they become targets of the killer, and they must somehow survive the town if they wish to see a high school diploma, with no blood on it.This is the calling card to all film-buffs, all Easter eggs scattered through out the film are homages to it's origins, while at the same time maintaining it's own special place, for all film fan's hearts.Out of 10 movie tickets, it's a 9.5. The motive was so simple, and so well understood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time "Scream" was released in 1996, writer/director Wes Craven already had a couple of landmark horror films under his belt in the form of "The Last House on the Left" &amp; "A Nightmare on Elm Street". With "Scream", he teamed with screenwriter Kevin Williamson for a reflexive take on the slasher genre. The result was both a critical and commercial success.In a nutshell, the story revolves around a costumed serial killer who is murdering teens while eluding the police and creating a media frenzy. Not a particularly novel concept but that's the point. The screenplay plays up the conventions of slasher movies, offering a clever commentary on the sub-genre that's appealing even to those who sneer at the formulaic nature of such movies.The acting talent on board isn't half bad for a horror flick. The memorable opening features Drew Barrymore and there are recognizable faces everywhere you look, including Neve Campbell (naturally), Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Rose McGowan &amp; Henry Winkler, among others. One note regarding the casting: Skeet Ulrich is such a dead ringer (sorry) for a young Johnny Depp that I have to assume that his casting was an unspoken nod to Depp's presence in the original "Nightmare on Elm Street".As for the direction, Craven knows his way around a horror movie, so its no surprise that he supplies the movie with the requisite suspense. The movie also looks attractive and has a decent soundtrack to boot.Ultimately, "Scream" succeeds both as a slasher movie and as a satire of slasher movies. It's also pretty accessible, being not especially gory, at least in comparison to contemporary fare. Of the sequels, I've only seen the first two, neither of which rose to the level of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still scares me every time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 12 when I first saw this with two girlfriends when it came out on video, my parents were asleep and we watched it on the sly as we were told it was too scary for us. Well, the opening sequence alone was enough to scare the crap out of us, and we spent the rest of the movie peeking out from under the quilt.And even now, 15 years later, after seeing it numerous times, it's still scary as hell. The first ten minutes would have to go down as the best first ten minutes of any horror movie, ever. I had no idea Drew Barrymore's character was going to die, I thought she was the star (and I've read recently that that was the whole point, Drew was offered the role of Sidney but wanted to play Kasey instead to throw the audience off and have them realise anyone could die). And die she did, in circumstances I can only describe as my worst nightmare. When her parents came home and she was around the side of the house trying to call out to them, I was screaming "throw the phone at them, throw the PHONE!!!!". After that we meet Sidney, played very well by Neve Campbell, very believable as the tortured victim who just can't seem to escape the drama. Although I rolled my eyes when she was home alone, getting prank calls, and went out on the front porch after the man on the phone told her he was on...her front porch. And I am still a little bit confused as to why she went to that party at the end, I mean she was attacked in her home, the killer called her friends house, she was attacked again in the school toilets, so she goes to party in the middle of nowhere with one dopey cop as the only protection? Then has sex with the prime suspect. I must admit I didn't guess the killers straight away. I thought it was Billy for awhile, but then when they arrested him halfway in I assumed they wanted you to think it was Billy but it wouldn't be, then he got "stabbed" by the killer and I instantly thought it must be Randy, then when Stu said he was going to get a beer and he never returned, I realised it must be him, otherwise he would have seen his girlfriend hanging in the doggy door and raised the alarm. My mother guesses every single killer in every movie. She said Billy and Stu shared "a look" at the fountain, a "look" in the video store, and a "look" when Billy turned up at Stu's party. And when I watched it again, I realised she was right, it was pretty obvious. Overall, a great horror movie, I loved all the sequels including the fourth movie that I saw recently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By the 1990s horror had grown stagnant due to the numerous sequels that were preceding films like 'Friday the 13th', 'Halloween' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street.' But when Kevin Williamson wrote the script for 'Scream' it was destined to be a winner. 'Scream' is one of the scariest 1990s films I have seen in my teen years since I was only three when it came to the big screen. The genius of the film is that the device known as a telephone/cell phone can used against us in sinister ways which makes us fearful of our safety in our community. I was impressed with the performance of the cast and of course Wes Craven's creativity in the manner of the film's deaths and look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror triumph that is also the last best ever in the genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1996, at a time when it seemed like horror and slasher movies were beginning to fade, this superb little gem of a film was released to an unexpected public who had lost interest in the genre. It had seemed that the slasher genre was dead because of a tired release of sequels from Friday The 13th, which did nothing but make the same film over again. I've always liked the Halloween sequels but even they were not making money. Along comes this hip screenwriter named Kevin Williamson. The same cliché in up and coming screenwriters was apparent here, he was struggling, didn't have money and living off of nothing but he always loved horror movies and was able to come up with his own concept for a script that would become his ultimate masterwork.Then comes in Wes Craven, who was already a horror legend that at the time, it seemed like he could have gone in any direction he wanted to as a director, he even rejected the script at first, claiming that he shouldn't go down that road again. After noticing what a huge impact he had made with fans over the years and coming to see that he could do no wrong at coming back with another horror powerhouse, he decided, why not? Diminsion Films loved the script from the beginning and always had Wes in mind and now they had him on board, a great script and a director who is a genius at what he does, now all they needed was a cast that could make the story's movie within a movie concept believable. This time though and was unknown in the genre, the producers chose well known actors and hot up and coming talent to portray the characters in this quirky horror opus. Neve Campbell had already received recognition for the hit television drama Party Of Five and was the right choice to play the lead heroin Sydney Prescott. Then you had Courtney Cox from another popular show at the time Friends, had the right amount of personality to play Gale Weathers. The rest of the cast included the always lovely Drew Barrymore. To play a character that is killed off in the first scene, instead of casting some unknown, which is what you usually do especially to a character who is the victim, you had one of the biggest young actresses in the world, Wes even stated that he wasn't sure if the audience would ever forgive them but because Barrymore is so memorable in what is already a well crafted set up to the film, the audience loved it.The shooting of the film seemed like a fun one when you watch the behind the scenes footage, Wes seems relaxed and confident and the cast is charming and excited to be a part of the production. Post production had a few problems, to get an R rating, a few gore effects had to be cut down to where you see less which I would say is the only flaw to the film but only the MPAA is to blame for that.Released in December of 1996, the film had a decent run but after only a few weeks, it was the most talked about film. It was clear that this was a horror triumph and one that surely had an effect on younger audiences that they began to show interest in the genre again. Because of its smart concept and witty satire, the film was something special I think that it could not have been pulled off effectively again, so in that context, I think this may be the last great horror film. Of course, this is open for debate and I have seen a few decent horror films since the release of Scream but none as believable or intelligent. Urban Legend (1998) tried to be Scream and I thought that movie was good by the way but wasn't as successful. Over the years we have had a tired release of remakes and few films have paved the way for horror, although I thought that the 2002 film The Ring was the most interesting American horror movie I had seen since Scream but still not the best. The most well done horror films are coming from foreign countries right now that it seems that American horror is dead again but we can only hope that someone will come along and bring something new and fresh to the genre but because Scream did such a unique way at breaking rules and coming up with new ones, I will say it's the last great American horror film. Still, I really enjoyed the sequels, even the 2011 release of Scream 4. I also thought Halloween: H20 was one of the best sequels I had seen in slasher movies, even if it was in a way a response to Scream's success.Good luck to up and coming directors and screenwriters, let's hope that the one with the interesting take on horror gets the attention of studio heads and producers and also becomes the next horror classic, we desperately need it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing. Great cast. Great writing. Great director. Great characters. I recommend this to everyone. This was my very first horror movie and it really got me interested into the genre. There are plenty of scares and jumps throughout the film and it has its fair share of violent acts done by the killers. The first time I saw this movie I caught the last 40 minutes or so, so I didn't have any clue what was going on and I didn't even really know what the movie was about. So I was glad to see it again all the way through, really appreciating the movie. Now its one of my favorites! The character development is great, so you really care about who dies/ doesn't die and the one-liners are funny, bad-ass or just plain wrong. Kudos to K. Williamson for his original, groundbreaking script. And kudos to the cast, particularly to Matthew Lillard (HILARIOUS), Neve Campbell (my favorite Scream Queen), and Courteney Cox (favorite actress ever-played ruthlessly ambitious Gale to the T), for their wonderful acting.

		<fullReview>Wes Craven has been contributing to the horror genre for years, with films such as the Hills have eyes, Swamp thing and Nightmare on Elm street. All of these films which have over the years become classics and help inspire the horror films of today. So where does Scream fit in? Is it another Wes Craven classic? Well to perfectly honest, yes! I was never a great fan of horror films, I always found that their plots were too predictable, but scream changed all that. It takes the horror genre we all know, and turns it upside down. This is done by an exciting and unpredictable plot which was excellently portrayed by such people as Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard, who each added a certain something to the already brilliant storyline. With one of the most memorable and sinister faces from the big screen, it has struck fear into the hearts of many since day one. Wes Craven has done it again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Most Slashers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am giving Scream nine stars out of ten, because I think, for what it is, it is a near perfect movie. The storyline is simple: a girl in her late teens named Sidney Prescott is still dealing with the murder of her mother a year ago. And then, just two or three days before the one year anniversary of her mother's death, a killer dressing himself up in a spooky Halloween costume called 'Father Death' (later called Ghostface) starts murdering people in the small peaceful town of Woodsboro. And he makes Sidney his main target. From there on, it is a "Whodunit" murder mystery, where any of the other characters in the movie could literally be the person behind the mask doing the killing, and only at the end of the film will you find out who it is. Here are some reasons why Scream is awesome, and way above the (vast) majority of slashers: -The acting is very good. There isn't a single bad actor in the entire movie. Most slashers (and horror films in general) have acting that is just OK at best.-None of the characters in this film are interchangeable. There isn't one character that feels like they exist only for the sole purpose of dying.-The opening scene is one of the best opening scenes in any horror movie, ever. Just perfect.-This was a breath of fresh air in the horror genre when it was first released back in 1996. The horror genre was all but dead, and then Scream came along and gave it a much needed boost. Scream has since spawned (thus far) three sequels, and has become one of the most popular horror series.There are other reasons why this movie is awesome, but instead of continuing to type them out, I recommend that you just watch it (if you haven't already) and see for yourself. If you're a fan of slashers, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's only fitting to write a review for my favorite movie, the movie that reinvigorated the slasher genre. Satirizing the horror genre and the many clichés that were prevalent in the 80's horror movies while successfully throwing the audience through a loop in the first ten minutes. I think one of the reasons the movie has been so successful has been the cast, using already established actors like Neve Campbell and Drew Barrymore. My first viewing of this movie brought a mix of excitement and fear as Ghostface flashed his haunting mask and tilted his head. The story has a meta feel to it, the characters can recognize the presence of other horror films and know the dangers of being a teenager in the situation. You spend the whole movie trying to decipher who the killer is and even when presented with a red-herring and as the characters start dropping, you still are perplexed with the result. The film offers comic relief and characters that you can become invested in; whether it's Dewey the lovable deputy, or Randy, the geeky horror movie guru.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the basic story guide spoils some of the movie, but I needed an good intro, and this was as good as I could make it.Basic Story Guide: Spoiler Alert (some of the introducing paragraph spoils certain aspect of the beginning scene, if you wish to remain in the dark, read from "Enter Sidney Prescott,") Woodsboro, a town settled far away from the more violent and notorious states of California, such as L.A., or Oakland. But one night, while a teenager is settling down to watch a horror movie, she receives a phone call from an unknown person. At first, its all innocent flirting from both person on the phone and your girl. Until, he begins stalking her, with repeated phone calls. (spoiler, if you wish to remain in the dark, do not read) After an extended amount of time, young Casey, and her boyfriend are both murdered. Enter Sidney Prescott, an average teenager of who is still recovering from the tragic murder of her mother a year prior. The murderer, Cotton Weary has been placed in prison, is awaiting the death sentence. As she begins to put her life back together from this traumatic event, she then receives phone call from an unknown person. Sidney finally realizes she is in the cross hairs of a killer who is relentless, and that she may have placed the wrong person in prison for her mothers murder.Verdict: This movie is my all time favorite. The acting in it is convincing, the plot is throughly engaging, and the characters are absolutely enjoyable. Although I will say this (spoiler alert for a certain event in the movie): by the time the party scene starts up, it's almost like it has out of steam, and then it picks back up, so be prepped for that. But this movie is my all time favorite horror movie for three reasons: 1.) The main character had a back story to her, and the movie had a plot. It wasn't some nihilistic movie like Hostel or something along those lines where someone is standing on a street corner and is abducted by a deranged psychopath, and plunged into violent circumstances.2.) The movie has a balance of both comedy and horror. One moment you are laughing, the next you are jumping in your seat. And the characters themselves are lovable, even the killer. They literally grow on you.3.) This movie breathed life back into the slasher genre, most of the movies were sub-par, but none-the-less, effective and creative. Urban Legends, I Know What You Did Last Summer and Cherry Falls being a few that stick out in my mind.Overall, an awesome movie, and I am grateful for seeing this movie. Thank you Wes Craven for making this historical movie.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sidney Prescott becomes the next target of a maniacal killer who has already killed two kids from her school. As tabloid babe Gale Weathers gets involved, and starts to dig deeper, it becomes apparent that the killer may be connected to the man who raped and killed Sidney's mother. Could it be that the wrong man is in in prison for the crime? If so? Just who is responsible for this new rein of terror?Scream opens with what has now become 10/12 minutes of classic horror folklore, where director Wes Carpenter sets out the marker for the reinvigoration of the genre synonymous with his name. What follows is a full blooded exciting picture that is laced with genre references and bona fide pinging humour. Teaming up with hipster screenwriter Kevin Williamson, Craven has assembled a roll call of stock teen-slasher characters, filled the roles out with a cast list reading like the young, pretty and the restless, and embraced the genre he loves while also subverting it. Clever clever stuff indeed.Retaining its "mystery who done it" core throughout, red herrings and misdirections come and go, Scream is also a truly scary {and violent} picture. As it makes the knowing genre faithful laugh, it also makes them jump, squirm and shout at the screen. Particularly during the last, excellently constructed quarter when the terror ups on poor Sidney and the reveal induces cries of "what the hell". Subsequent revisits to Scream has you spotting all the little pointers in the story that you missed on the first viewing, but even knowing the reveal fails to dim Scream's lasting appeal. Also of note is that the cast get a chance to act, something that is a rarity in the sub-genre that Scream is the flag bearer for. Neve Campbell, Jamie Kennedy and Courtney Cox benefiting the most from the sly and adroitly written script. Craven's film spawned two sequels, the first is equally dazzling and watchable, the second not so. While it was also responsible for a cascade of imitators and comedy spoofs that would follow. None however have captured the essence, the nous or the style of Scream. It remains the daddy and the bench mark in an often maligned and rarely realised teen-slasher genre. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witty and subversive horror movie (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scream" opens with a suspenseful ten-minute prologue where a plucky young teen (Drew Barrymore) is menaced by a mysterious phone-caller (a sinister Roger L.Jackson provides the voice) who quizzes her about scary movies. The threats quickly escalate into bloody carnage as the girl and her unlucky boyfriend are quickly gutted. This scene is a perfect summary of what is to follow: suspense, gore and horror movie references - within a horror movie.The setting is the white middle-class country town of Woodsboro, and the characters who quickly realize they are caught up in their own 'scary movie' are high-school geeks Stu (Matthew Lillard) and Randy (Jamie Kennedy), local stud Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), perky blonde Tatum (Rose McGowan), and her best friend Sidney (Neve Campbell), whose mother was murdered only a year before. Getting involved in the chase for the killer are bumbling local cop Dewey (David Arquette) and ruthless tabloid TV journalist Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox). Anyone of these characters could be a suspect, and if they're not a suspect, they're a target...Neve Campbell radiates strength and intelligence as the heroine of the piece. Courteney Cox, the compulsively neurotic Monica in TV's "Friends", turns in some good work as the ambitious Gale Weathers. David Arquette is appealingly goofy as Dewey, and he and Cox have a great chemistry together. Ulrich, McGowan and Lillard are all excellent in supporting roles. "Happy Days" Henry Winkler has an unbilled cameo as the high school principal.The characters' self-awareness makes them unique for horror movie victims, and the script plays off this with funny consequences. The keynote speech here is in the final party scene where Randy (brilliantly played by series' favourite Jamie Kennedy) lays down the rules of surviving horror movies: never have sex, don't drink or do drugs and never say "I'll be right back". Needless to say, these rules are bent and broken with abandon.Beneath that, though, there is a subtext about the supposedly safe middle class environment the characters inhabit. The film's setting, the fictional borough of Woodsboro, has a very utopian look, with wooden houses, white picket fences, and clean, well-built schools and offices. Director Wes Craven delights in showing us the ugliness hidden within the beauty of these surroundings, well-accentuated by Marco Beltrami's haunting score.But such perfection can never really be true, so long as the surroundings (however beautiful) are inhabited by human beings with human issues. It is just such a setting like Woodsboro that creates bored, spoiled, desensitized people, a minority of whom may very well take to extreme violence as a means of enjoying or escaping their lives (the Columbine massacre is a good real-life example). The constant horror-movie references are amusing but in the end irrelevant. No matter how safe or perfect an environment seems to be, human impulses, always hidden beneath the surface, will threaten and undo the safety of that environment. That is the real message of "Scream" and one which it's closing song, SoHo's 'Whisper to a Scream', captures very well."Scream" was followed by two sequels, and then was shamelessly ripped off by a parody imitator, "Scary Movie". But above all of that, this first film remains the original and best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream (7/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven officially supplemented himself on the Mount Rushmore of horror once his nontraditional slasher film Scream hit theaters. Utilizing a style of writing and dialogue that is closer to that of a midday soap show than a feature film, Wes Craven successfully pulled off a fun "who done it" slasher. The film does a great job at poking fun of horror clichés and has an aspect of unpredictability. Even though Neve Campbell is the star, the show stealers are Courtney Cox and David Arquette with great character development and chemistry. Scream isn't perfect by any stretch but does a good job at being different, thrilling, intelligent and entertaining, everything to look into for a horror flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite Movies.This Movie made me watch other Horror Movies like Halloween, Friday 13th and A Nightmare on Elmstreet, because of the famous quotes they use.I often saw this with my friends or my girlfriend, it never get old.I specially like the mask and the costume, the killer is wearing. It gives me the creeps, if I see him chasing after his victims. The characters develop after time and also throwing like I said different movie-quotes at the audience, which is very amusing.One great classic for any kind of Movie-Collection. I deeply recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best slasher film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Scream it's a fantastic meta film with interesting characters and an interesting story. What I loved about the film was not just how meta it was but the movie has you guessing who the killer is from start to finish and honestly it's a thrill to watch. One thing I do complain about with modern horror films is pointless openings with our main killer killing some innocent to show how scary he is well yeah he is gonna be scary he is a mass serial killer. Now with Scream they have the pointless opening and in all honesty I think it popularised these opening scenes but it matters because it connects with the whole story and impacts every character in the film. My I add as well that this was made at a time when horror films have completely fallen out of faith with audiences this movie made it popular once again for a few years that is.The plot centres around Sidney whose mother died one year ago at the start of the film. She learns one of her classmates died and then later on is stalked by the killer who becomes her primary target.Scream is brilliant and easily my favourite horror film it's clever and extremely creative with an unexpected plot twist. So yeah watch Scream even if you don't like horror films because your opinions on them will change.</fullReview>

Her dramatic squinty face on screen just one too many times. Rose McGowen plays Neve's best friend and she is incredibly hot.As a typical slasher/mystery it had its moments, I wasn't terribly scared at all during the movie. I wouldn't even rate it as a horror film. I would call it a mystery/slasher.Worth watching one time through, after that it loses its charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is a classic horror movie with a twist. Throughout the movie, it makes references to other horror movies of the time and mocks them, making it stand out simply by that. A big difference of Scream is that it does something no other movies does. When the movie was promoted, Drew Barrymore was the face of the movie, she was supposed to be the leading role. To everyone's shock, she dies within the first few minutes of the movie! This is something few movies do, making Scream stand out even more. The storyline is self adds to twist of the movie. Sidney's mother was raped and murdered a year ago. And it just so happens that as the year anniversary approaches, a serial killer targets Sidney. The biggest twist is when one finds out who the killer is. Throughout the entire movie, one is led to believe there is only one killer, and the biggest suspects are Sidney's father because he is missing, and Billy, Sidney's boyfriend. Billy was initially taken to jail because he showed up at Sidney's house right as the killer failed to kill her, but then is found innocent. The twist is that there are two killers! Billy and Stu, Stu being one of Sidney's close friends. Then one finds out that Billy and Stu killed Sidney's mother because Billy's father was cheating with her. On top of that, Billy &amp; Stu had kidnapped Sidney's father. All these elements make Scream one of the best classic horror movies. While still including the elements that all horror movies have; the teen romance and parties, with the killer targeting them all, with the intricate story lines and twist that make you jump and scream like all horror movies should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A first of it's kind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the 90's horror movies were dead. Scream revitalized that genre for it's meta and self-aware take. Since Scream most movie have tried that meta, self-aware angle, some have been successful, but a lot haven't. We can all thank Scream for that. Give a lot of credit to Wes Craven's sense of direction, building scares and tension per each scene, and Kevin Williamson's original sharp script. He obviously had a brain child. It's also almost hard to even imagine Wes Craven almost passed on this movie. Killing off Drew Barrymore right from the beginning was a huge deal back then. Killing a big star like her meant no one was safe and that unpredictability was at massive play, keeping you guessing. The cast is wonderful. Neve Campbell was my childhood crush. I watched this film when I was about twelve years old and since then I fell in love with her. Neve portrays her character Sidney Prescott very well, she's strong and she plays the victim role effortlessly. Couteney Cox is great at playing the bitchy reporter Gale Weathers, David Arquette gives the film some levity as a clumsy deputy Dewey Riley. Rose McGowan plays Sidney's spunk best friend Tatum with attitude. Skeet Ulrich plays it straight as Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis, almost all the time you can't help but wonder if he's a suspect or not. Matthew Lillard also provides some humor as Stu, as well as Jamie Kennedy who is the breakout character Randy Meeks, the film's go-to for anything comedic. The Ghostface killer is so iconic now that it just doesn't seem scary at all, but the very first time we see that costume, and he's chasing Drew Barrymore, it is quite effective. Craven does such a good job with building up suspense. He makes Billy Loomis look guilty, but then innocent. You almost kind expect him to be the killer, but in the finale what don't you expect is Matthew Lillard end up being the second killer. It's a double whammy and you'd never expect someone like his character to end up being a killer. Williamson's writing allows you to take a breather from all the suspense and laugh once in while with solid dialog and jokes. The only gripe in this near perfect film is when Ghostface is stalking both Sidney and Tatum in broad daylight. That is one moment where it just looses some credibility. Also some of the special effects are just a tad bit outdated. Not so much so that it takes you out of the film, but you can tell, especially Tatum's death by the garage door. I grew up in the 90's, I'm only in my early twenties and Scream was definitely a part of my childhood. Thank you Wes Craven for not only giving me nightmares and making me afraid to go to sleep(another obvious iconic Wes Craven horror villain) and answering phone calls. You will be missed by many. 8.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taking My Love of Movie Reviews One Step Too Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this as a teenager and was blown away by the first ten minutes, and after the impressive opening of this film, was kept hooked and entertained the whole way through. The first frame through to the last showcases, despite a few flaws, what an almost flawlessly perfect horror movie looks like. Scream is well known by now for revitalising a dead genre, and in doing so, created its own, and burrowed its way deep into my subconscious that I screamed out in agony when they not only screwed up Scream 4, but flat out denied us the promised Scream 5 and 6.Keeping this review Spoiler-free is hard considering it's the type of movie where twists and turns and red herrings is what keeps it entertaining. It's the type of film where you have this one conversation with yourself the whole way through: "he's the killer. No. He's the killer. No. He's the killer. No. He's the killer." I never guessed the killer.Kevin Williamson has always been one of my favourite writers and ideas man (when he's writing films and not crappy television shows), and Scream shows him at his best. Wes Craven has an uncanny knack of creating memorable icons. It must have been his destiny to scar people's brains with terror-ific, unforgettable images. As a child he probably sat in bed thinking: "How do I make other people not be able to sleep at night?" Neve Campbell is the perfect scream queen, marred only by the fact she won't do nudity.Marco Beltrami's Scream score is still one of his best musical works to this day. Nothing he has done since Scream and two of its sequels has ever come close in brilliance to the unique sound he created for this and those films.This movie truly is a Scream and I gave it, at a time when the internet wasn't really around that much, the greatest word of mouth ever. I still enjoy sitting down with people who haven't had the pleasure of watching it and seeing their reactions for the first time.It's most certainly a Screamer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Much Fun It's Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream has a running theme of being really quite impressive and it works wonders on its audience of mostly fresh-faced and young cinephiles looking to be cynical and think outside the box. The nineties was good for horror, with the Ring, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Candyman and of course who could forget everyone's favourite Leprechaun, so what better time than to release Scream, which at the time was thinking so far out of the box that it really shocked a lot of people into realising just how vapid the genre was. It's cool to not be cool now, and Scream works. I love Scream because whilst its pitch-black humour, often intense gore, horror film references and almost self-parodical tone work on one level, it's still actually quite a scary film. If you haven't seen Scream, you're missing out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic deconstruction of the slasher film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream was the shot of adrenaline the horror genre needed back in the 90's after a plague of bad sequels and a general pushing away of all things horror. It helped revitalize the genre especially the slasher subgenre and gave way to the meta style comedy that we would see in coming years. Even after all the films we have seen in the 2000s, Scream takes the cake as a horror movie that knows how to balance multiple ingredients well.Good: It has a lot going for it and yet it all works. It is a horror film, a comedy, a soap opera, a mystery, a meta deconstruction, and dare I say it even some action in there. It moves at a fast pace and it has plenty of energy flowing through it. The cast all around is great as they embrace their roles and play them with gusto. The stalking sequences are great and I still enjoy how everyone has a fighting chance with the killer lending to the unpredictable nature of it. Bad: There are some cheesy sound effects throughout the movie that can be overbearing especially when someone is using a knife. Just a lot of SHING! SHING! SHING!Overall, I still consider Scream a classic horror film because it was such a big influence on the genre and it is still a massively entertaining film today despite it not being scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart horror film for fans of the genre and newbies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scream" is a good horror/thriller that works not only as a deconstruction of the slasher/dead teenager genre but also as a scary who-done-it? film. It follows high-school student Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who is being stalked by a mysterious killer who wears a long black cloak and a mask based on The Scream painting by Edward Munch.What I like about this movie is that it's a lot smarter than your average horror show. An easy example that makes my point is that in this story, people have actually seen horror movies before. How many films have you seen where you can't help yourself, you end up screaming at the people inside the movie because they walk into a dark room without turning on the light or grabbing a flashlight, they don't grab a weapon to defend themselves or they put themselves in situations that give away what their fate is? This, combined with a solid cast, a well written script and a lot of funny moments will suck you into the story, while the mystery of the face behind the killer's mask will compel you to stick around. If you're a fan of horror films you'll be happy to see that not only the film makers, but the characters in "Scream" film share the same love and it's a lot of fun to go through the film and check off the titles that are referenced to, in order to see if you have seen them yourself. If you aren't a fan of horror films this is a smart one that doesn't linger on the gore as much as It presents a mystery with some frightening scenes here and there. I really feel like this picture has a lot of re-watch value despite the fact that it's a mystery because it gets better the more horror films you have seen. If you want to get Into the genre of horror films and you're wondering where to start, then of course you have your classics like "Nosferatu" and "Frankenstein", then you've got your 70s flicks like "Black Christmas" and Night of the Living Dead" and from there, "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Friday the 13th", "Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Halloween" but you better make sure you don't miss "Scream" on your way you're the 2000s. It might even make you appreciate some of the franchises that eventually devolved into bad R-Rated comedies? or you might feel even stronger about pictures like "Leprecahun 4: In Space" being utter trash. It's scary, at times very funny, the characters are compelling and it'll keep you guessing all the way through. (On Blu-ray, November 9, 2012)</fullReview>

The best character in this movie has to be Randy though. He is literally the only smart one. Through the movie I was guessing the whole time. A great mystery horror movie. One of my favorite horror movies of all time. Also one of the greatest slasher films as well. The great thing about this movie is that it had enough jump scares but not to many and also didn't have to much blood either.

		<fullReview>Yes, I know, I wrote in the summary that this is one of my favourite scary films. Well, "Scary" films anyway. It's not an actual scary film, but back when I first seen it, in 2006, it was chillingly scary, because I was much younger and it gave me some frights. Plus, it has some bloody-scenes and jumpy scenes that make you startle a little. Or they're gonna make you Scream a little. (Pun intended?....yep) But this is a damn good Slasher film. I really love this one, and it's my favourite out of all the Scream films (well, sometimes I think Scream 3 is equally as good).Ghostface - the masked killer is somewhat different from other masked- killers, as he's just a guy....or a woman...in a black cloak-like costume wearing a ghost-face mask (thus, he's known as "Ghostface"). Whereas most villains/masked-slashers in other films are different cause they're back from the dead and they're hideously-deformed looking. E.g - Jason Voorhees. This 90's slasher is incredible and I would recommend it to you if you've not seen it already. 8.5/10. (Wes Craven, a horror/chiller master!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent,Scary And Funny Horror/Slasher Classic. Wes Craven At His Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is an excellent,scary and funny Horror classic and one of the greatest Horror films of all-time that is filled with amazing direction,a wonderful cast,a terrific script and a creepy and memorable score. All of the elements make Scream an unforgettable Horror film and is Wes Craven at his best.Scream tells the story of Sidney Prescott(Neve Campbell),a teen who on the one year anniversary of her mother's death discovers that a killer with a ghost face mask is stalking and killing people in her home town. When Sidney finds out she's next on the list Sidney has to try and stop the killer and stay alive.During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen as dead by most critics and audiences I wouldn't say the genre was dead but was more in a coma and waiting to wake up and the film that woke up the Horror genre was Wes Craven's Scream,a brilliant Horror movie that was not only a critical and Box Office hit but also made the Horror genre hot again and paved the way for other slasher films such as I Know What You Did Last Summer(1997)and Urban Legend(1998). Right from the movie scary and now famous 10-15 minute sequence,Scream is an amazing and terrifying Horror movie that takes the Slasher genre and toys around with the Slasher movie giving us a film that is not only scary but also funny,smart and clever giving viewers a film that rethinks the Slasher genre while paying homage to Slasher films of the past. Scream is one of the few films I can think of that mixes Horror and Humor flawlessly with intelligence. The scary and suspenseful scenes in Scream are done with powerful and explosive intensity that punches you right in the face and during the scary scenes none of the characters are never safe or secure with violence in the air. The violence and gore that happens during the scary scenes are horrific and disturbing and reminds me of the in your face brutality of his earlier classics such as A Nightmare On Elm Street(1984),The Last House On The Left(1972)and The Hills Have Eyes(1977)because like those films Craven shows us the disgusting view and doesn't hold back one bit. The Comedy and Humor is funny and at times hilarious because it seems like the teenage characters know that they're in a Horror film are self aware and know all of the Clichés and things that happen in a slasher film(or all of the rules in order to survive a Horror film)which is in line with the post-modern film making of the 1990s. Scream also features terrific and fun references to landmark Horror classics such as Psycho(1960),A Nightmare On Elm Street,Halloween(1978)and Friday The 13th(1980)and some of the references are obvious while others are subtle. The balance of Horror and Humor makes the movie more intense and unforgettable. Sidney Prescott is one of the great Horror movie scream queens/heroines and that's mainly because like the other scream queens of the past Sidney is tough and can handle herself and you root for her to survive despite the viciousness all around her and when you see her going through terror you will relate to her. The Ghost face killer is a classic villain in the Horror genre because what sets this killer apart from other killers in the genre is that the killer calls on the phone and uses Horror movie knowledge to test the victim and if get the answers wrong Ghost face will kill you with no remorse. The Ghost Face killer will have you on edge when you see Scream the first time and will stick with you and you can say was one of the reasons caller ID was invented. Much of the film's success of Scream is thanks to the screenplay by Kevin Williamson which is amazing,terrific and in my opinion one of the best screenplays in Horror film history. Williamson script is filled with great dialog that is clever,ironic and done with a style that has been imitated but never duplicated. Williamson fills his script with Horror,Mystery,Comedy and Drama all within 112 minutes and giving viewers a unique story that never slows sown. Williamson has never topped his Scream script and I don't think he ever will. The ending of Scream is a classic conclusion that is filled with twists,turns and thrills that will catch you off guard and add to the movie's greatness. An outstanding ending.The cast is incredible. Neve Campbell is excellent as Sidney,one of the great Horror movie heroines,with Campbell bringing toughness,sympathy and depth to the role. Courtney Cox is wonderful as Gale Weathers,a heartless News reporter. Skeet Ulrich is terrific as Billy,Sidney's boyfriend. David Arquette is great and funny as Deputy Dewey. Rose McGowan is fantastic and sexy as Tatum,Sidney's best friend. Jamie Kennedy is outstanding and hilarious as Randy,a movie geek. Matthew Lillard is delightful as Stuart,Tatum's boyfriend. W.Earl Brown(Kenny)and Joseph Whipp(Sheriff Burke)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for credited and uncredited cameos by Liev Schreiber(Cotton Weary),Linda Blair(Obnoxious News reporter),Wes Craven(Fred The Janitor)and Henry Winkler(Principal Arthur Himbry).The direction by Wes Craven is amazing,with Craven always moving the camera and bringing a thrilling and intense style to the film. Wonderful direction,Craven.The score by Marco Beltrami is sensational,suspenseful and intense and adds to the atmosphere to the film. Great score,Beltrami.In final word,if you love Wes Craven,Horror films or Slasher films,I highly suggest you see Scream,an excellent,scary and funny Horror classic that you will never forget and will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that defines a slasher film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie that defines a slasher film, where a serial killers dressed in black with a ghost-face mask stalks teenager Sidney (Neve Campbell) one year after the death of her mother. Soon, Sidney's classmates begin to fall victim to the slasher, and Sidney must find out with the killer is and if these incidents have anything connected with her mother's death.Filmed in a high school setting, the actors did provide a believable and serious performance nonetheless, providing enough drama and suspense to make the horror film watchable. The scenes with the killer's voice over the phone, the killer chasing the victims and the victims hiding and trying to escape from the unseen killer will send chills down your spine and cover your ears to prevent you from being creeped out at those jumping-out-at-you moments.Campbell's character was overly dramatic at times and appeared too angry at the role; Drew Barrymorre would have made a better lead actor, but her smaller role in the movie was memorable to say the least. Overall, not a bad horror film.Grade B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being fairly inexperienced with horror movies, i put on this movie and had no idea what to expect... and i had one of the best viewing experiences I have ever had.The opening scene turns up the heat the boils through the whole film, with two fairly gory deaths. Then you are transported into the life of the main character (who's mother died a year early by the way) and follows her reaction to the killings then suddenly her attack from the ghostface killer. Following her tribes and tribulations of the attack and so on, we are pushed further into the world of scream. The end turns the heat way up, with characters being killed off one by one, including one female being crushed by a carport door.I loved this movie! Have fun with it, sit back and scream!9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The killer Ghostface is terrorizing a small town, killing off the people who dare break the 'rules' of horror movies. His victims are mostly teenagers, but he has his eyes set on Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell.) Everyone is watching.Scream was released in December of 1996, before many people had seen it they were calling it DOA. It was during a time were slasher films where starting to die, and only seeing the light of a VHS release. Scream came out and single handily saved horror. Become the 16th highest grossing film of 1996 making over a 100 million at the box office, to mainly positive reviews. It made Neve Campbell a household name and showed the world that Wes Craven still is and always well be the master of horror. Scream blew the doors back open to slasher films and paved the way for the likes of I know what you did last summer, Urban Legends and many many more.Scream has one the best and most shocking openings ever. For 15 minutes we sit on the edge of our seats as we watch a young Casey being harassed as Ghostface keeps calling her on the phone. All he wants to do is play a game, sounds simple enough. Only he is outside her window watching her, and his game is horror movie trivia, a game that always proves to be deadly. None of the viewers seen this opening happening, some of us couldn't believe it was happening. It sets the tone for the whole movie and makes us wonder if they open like this, then wheres the ride going from here? Well my friend put your belt on nice and tight because this ride does not let up.We meet our main girl Sidney Prescott. We find out that her mother was killed just a year before. The man who did it in jail. When Ghostface puts his sights on her she is quick to learn that running out the front door doesn't always work. On top of this Sidney has to put up news reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox.) Who wrote the book about the murder of Sidney's mother. Gail seems to put Sidney though more hell than Ghostface, but she well get whats coming to her. Sidney's boyfriend Billy don't really seem to understand her drama filled life to make matters worse. Of course we also have the hot blonde played by Rose Mcgowan, your film geek played by Jamie Kennedy, and you stupid cop played by David Arquette. Only they are all very real in depth people. Scream puts every horror rule ever made in your face and then breaks them. It's a tongue and cheek horror film with some laughs but a hell of lot more scary's and blood. The most clearly written teen horror, its packed with lots of turns and drama. Wes Craven is a great story teller with how he tells the camera move, It is so slow well pasted that its very creepy. You just sit back and watch it unfold. There is lots of conversations that just make your blood flow cold, Wes makes this very intense by his use of close ups on the speakers face I found myself holding my breath at times. The last 20 minutes of this movie is filled with great surprise. You wont see any of this coming I promise you that.Scream is a very important film to horror, and the history of horror, and it is one of my favourite films. It paved the way for so many. If you have not seen this film you really should. It well not let you down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now a cult movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing 'Scream' as a teenager when it first came out and being utterly scared. Yet, I'm not sure nowadays audience would really be scared. What we find scary changes over time--'Alien' was considered very scary when first released in the late 70s, yet today I doubt it would really scare any adult viewers ('The Thing' is another example). It does not prevent 'Alien' from being widely praised as an excellent, classic film. The same applies to 'Scream'. The opening scene remains one of the most memorable in film history. Cleverly written, witty, well acted and shot, 'Scream' is a masterpiece that reintroduced talent to the then decaying horror movie industry (compare it with series like 'Friday the 13th' for instance). Sadly, it is also its own victim as all the goofy parodies have resulted into depreciation of the original film. But remember that, before it was turned into its own cliché, 'Scream' was utterly innovative at the time, playing cleverly with slasher clichés.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Slasher Movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Re-invention of the Classic Slasher? Yes indeedy. Back in the 90's, just when you thought the horror genre had limped away with the odd entrails popping up here there and everywhere, up jumps this little gem and BOOOOOOOM, hundreds more jump on the bandwagon for a bloodthirsty, gut spilling ride. Drew Barrymore's role was cleverly placed as top billing (if I remember correctly she was all over the Cinema posters and adverts etc etc) and ended up "Sliced and Diced" within the first 10 min of the film.......Awesome casting. Neve (that's Nev not Neeeeeeeeev) Campbell plays a virginal high school girl Sydney Prescott, mentally scarred by her mothers tragic murder who doesn't give it up for her Depp looky-likey Boyf Skeet Ulrich. She's the main target through out the film and plenty of "It's him"...."no no, He's the killer" ensues. Scream doesn't take itself too seriously and that's what I love about this film. Jamie Kennedy's Randy is utter genius, esp the Rules of survival.....so so true to the classic low budget slasher! There's not one character in this film that doesn't belong and even Rose McGowen's Tatum (who, I'm sorry, could probably have someones eye out with those things!) is a good compliment to the meek and mild Sydney. There's plenty of tense moments with one of my favourites (The killers at large, Sydney's at her house waiting for Tatum. She opens a door, music builds up for a climax, she closes it and there's nothing there). I was told that Scream was one of the first movies to adopt that red herring...not sure if that's true, but it's very good and have seen it in lots of other movies since. A healthier looking Courtney Cox is a refreshing change to the emaciated botoxed bore she's now become and it's interesting to see the sparks fly between her and David Arquette. As for Matthew Lillard.....he's my dirty little love secret so there will be no bad reviews from me (yes yes that goes for Scooby Doo too!!!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply put: One of the greatest horror movies of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Original, enticing, thrilling, and most of all completely realistic. What makes this movie truly capture the audience is the fact that it could actually happen in real life. Although "Scream" is not based on a true story, it sure seems like it could be.There are many aspects of film that are executed perfectly in "Scream", but its strongest is the plot. The story draws you in keeps you guessing and makes you ask the same two questions: Who is the killer? and What's going to happen next? Also, the cast exudes tremendous chemistry that really brings the story to life.Neve Campbell is pretty good as the main protagonist, Sidney Prescott, who is being stalked and threatened by the killer the entire movie. I wouldn't say her performance is great, but she definitely does a commendable job. Courtney Cox is excellent as the bitchy, determined reporter, Gale Weathers, who still believes the wrong person was accused of committing the murder of Sidney's mother. David Arquette does well as goofy, incompetent Deputy Dewey. Rose Mcgowan also does well in her as Tatum, Sidney's slutty best friend. Jamie Kennedy really shines as Randy , a horror movie buff whose outrageous theories and rules on horror stories play a major role in the element of mystery that the film builds on from the notorious opening scene, featuring Drew Barrymore, to the ending credits. Kennedy also adds crucial comic relief. The entire ensemble gives above average performances. However, the two actors that really stand out and make "Scream" what it is are commonly overlooked: Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard.*Below contains spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading!Ulrich plays Billy, Sidney's boyfriend who is one of the main suspects of being the killer. His mysterious, yet comforting performance throughout most of the movie keeps you going back and forth on whether he actually is the killer or not. The moment he is revealed as the killer, his character immediately changes and takes you into the mindset of a killer. His sinister performance in the last 20 minutes of the movie is underrated and definitely deserves more credit. Alongside him as the other killer (which for me came out of nowhere) is Matthew Lillard's character, Stu, whose comical and eccentric demeanor surprisingly complements Billy's ruthlessness. Although Stu doesn't really have a motive for committing all of the murders, he solidifies himself and Billy as two of the most original villains in horror movie history.Also, the voice of the killer(complements of Roger Jackson) gives "Scream" its signature style.If you haven't seen "Scream" I highly recommend you check it out. And if you have seen it, watch it again as the second viewing is just as riveting!Plot: 8.5/10Acting: 8/10Cinematography: 6.5/10Script: 7.5/10Style/Originality: 9/10Overall: 7.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self Parody Can Still be Screamingly Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is what happens when you combine the world-weary, cloyingly experienced direction of Wes Craven, and the creative talents of a (then) young and hungry screenwriter, Kevin Williamson. Scream received a lot of ink upon its debut for boldly parodying the genre, turning dialog and plot developments (usually unbearably trite) into something witty and unpredictable.However, Scream achieves greatness whereas many other B-movie horror spoofs fail in their attempted hipness, solely because it manages to remain a disturbing, hurtful movie taking place within the bounds of reality. Despite its comic relief, every scare in Scream still feels real. The film doesn't so much mock itself as it merely suggests that even serial killers can have a sense of humor. The film's black hooded crank caller graduates to movie-icon status, thanks to some wonderful cinematography and editing techniques by Craven, who still knows how to force a jump out of his audience. David Arquette, on the other hand, achieves icon status for his inept character of Dewey Riley and will become the butt of many jokes because of some effective stunt casting. (i.e. "Scary Movie")Even if you are sneering by the final plot twist, it's hard to deny that Scream does the unthinkable by making a really funny movie this dark and disturbed.Horror and GoreFairly graphic, at least by Wes Craven standards. Wes Craven seems to particularly enjoy destroying beauty, so don't expect anyone to survive on looks alone. There is a nice balance of bloody goo meets cat-and- mouse thrills, and the killer's ominous voice is perhaps the most violent blow of all. The fact that various characters are self-aware throughout the film, and still scared stiff by their horrific demise, emphasizes the point: just because you're smart, doesn't mean you're smart enough to survive what's coming.How to Watch ItWatch this murderous playground with friends and make sure the lights are on and the phone line is free. For kicks, figure out which of you would probably die first because of Randy's rules.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream was made at a time when slashers were on their way out. Michael, Jason, and Freddy had lost their touch. They were battling psychics, going to New York, and all sorts of weird stories that went completely against what the franchises built themselves on. Wes Craven had some luck with with New Nightmare, a meta return to the franchise he built. But it was this movie that really rebuilt the genre and brought it back to glory.The movie is about a group of horror movie buffs who find themselves in a horror movie. Much like the original Friday the 13th, there is a mystery as to who the killer(s) is. It focuses on Sidney, the incredibly sexy Neve Campbell, whose mother was killed a year before and learns how she is tied to the killings. They are all aware of the movies this film references.New Nightmare may have been the first, but Scream was the first to popularize the idea of self-aware characters. Any movie buff will recognize the references (Halloween, Friday the 13th, Prom Night, etc) beyond those the movie directly references. The movie is a love letter to the genre and will make film buffs out of anyone. I know this movie is probably the reason I'm such a film buff, particularly of horror movies, myself.I love that the movie is a mystery. There's so few horror movies that include mystery aspects. The original Friday the 13th tried it, but Ms. Voorhees came out of nowhere. Prom Night did it, but the killer was pretty obvious. This is very much like an Agatha Christie story. The suspects are all there, and they're all guilty until they're gutted or the mask is taken off. The reveal is quite satisfying. Their motivation is fitting. Screams 3 and 4 would be disappointing, but this one was really good. And the movie just gets better with multiple viewings so you can see new layers to the real killer throughout the movie.The cast is good. Campbell looks great and is a great heroine along the lines of Alien's Ripley. McGowan isn't just a dumb, horny blonde. Cox proves she isn't just her Friends character. Arquette is hilarious. Though it's Lillard and Kennedy who steal the movie. The two are terrific and hilarious in every scene they're in, especially the "Rules of Horror" scene. My only complaint is that Ulrich looks a little too "evil," though he otherwise does a great job. They all are convincing as high school students.Of course, what really makes this movie great is the frights. This is an incredibly effective scary movie. Like all the best slasher films, this one relies on suspense over gore. There's plenty of blood, but it's the build up to the kills that really scare people. The opening scene is probably one of the best in the genre. Anyone can make a person jump and enough gore will gross even those with the best stomachs, but suspense is the best way to really scare someone. The movie really spends the time to make you care about the characters, so when their time comes you're actually rooting for them rather than the killer, the main problem with later Friday the 13th films. This is one that will have you hiding behind blankets and pillows on your first watch.The movie's use of cell phones may date the film somewhat, but Scream is a terrific film otherwise. The movie knows the genre and is one of the best of it. This is a can't miss for any horror fan, and will likely make some new fans.</fullReview>

In comes Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) and a hilarious reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox, the best character in the film) to investigate the murders and stay alive.The movie is funny and scary, with homages to famous older horror classics the entire way through, and the climax is excellently tense.

		<fullReview>'Scream' brought a lot of attention back to teen-based horror films. However, despite a lot in this genre being 'movie-trash', this film certainly is not. It's a black-comedy almost with a lot of now famous names included in the cast. The most famous at the time this was made (1996) was Drew Barrymore who doesn't last very long. This opening sequence to the film automatically made 'Scream' special. Throughout the film there are a lot of nods to teen-horror cliché's which are usually ridiculed. Mocking the typical teenage horror character stereotype is what made this film so unique and very funny. The script itself is often genius, the funny scenes can be really funny and the horror/frightening scenes do what they're supposed to do.Most of the acting is pretty good. Matthew Lillard is probably the best in the film, providing most of the comedy. Other performances like those of Courtney Cox and David Arquette are very good which is something you don't see too much of in horror films. The film overall is really worth a watch, apparently after this film was released sales of house-phones with caller ID doubled, you know that a film had that great an effect on people must be worthy of watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream- the mother of all slasher films. And it is the master of the slasher genre, Wes Craven, who once again hasn't failed to deliver with originality and style. The films twisted plot line incorporates everything that typically wouldn't be expected of a horror classic- humour, sex and gore. The consequences of each character is predictable, but nothing can prepare the audience for the unforgettably shocking beginning to the film. Take Drew Barrymore, the most famous actress in the film. A typical teenager, pretty, flirtatious and a love of scary movies. Butcher her boyfriend?telephone and mess with her head...then hang her from a tree, gutted inside out in the front garden? all within the first fifteen minutes. Why not?! Scream turns what is expected upside down, making it more addictively special. Undercover killer on the loose, we are left racking our brains to uncover the truth. We are fed clues to the identity of the masked killer, and just as we think we've cracked who's responsible, there's another twist and we are thrown into the unknown again. As characters are killed off, the more suspicious we become of those who remain, ensuring guaranteed surprise at the end.Highlighting the dark secrets within an idyllic neighbourhood, Scream shows no one is safe, dropping the audience straight in, with the horrific beginning and leaving with a cliff hanger at the end. But above all, Scream leaves the audience with constant fear of the infamous phone call??who will be phoned next?...</fullReview>

Its scary, its cool and it doesn't take itself seriously which is what makes it stand above the rest. Neve Campbell is great here along with future star Rose Mcgowan and the "Friends" protagonist Courtney Cox. Skeet Ulrich was awesome too.

		<fullReview>Scream (1996, Dir. Wes Craven) One year after the death of Sidney Prescott's mother, two students turn up gutted. When a serial killer appears, Sidney begins to suspect whether her mother's death and the two new deaths are related. No one is safe, as the killer begins to pick everyone off one by one. Everyone's a suspect in this case.In the mid-90's 'Scream' was released, and after disappointing horror flicks, was able to produces a new type of horror movie. A type which hadn't been seen for a long time. The great thing about 'Scream' is the concept of it. It's not just a horror film, but also a spoof of previous horror movies. Countless references to the behaviour of characters in previous horror movies add to the enjoyment of this movie. Everything you would think of when watching a horror film (and still do now) was addressed, such as what type of character died. Wes Craven changed these and created a film with characters who could actually be unpredictable. Another great thing about this film, is the fun behind figuring out who the killer. Most horror films have some indication of who the killer, but in 'Scream', everyone is a suspect. If you haven't seen 'Scream' yet, where have you been?

		<shortDescription>The best horror movie of the decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream (1996)Scream is an interesting film. While at its core it is a gory slasher film, it is also a comical, entertaining and often very tense experience. Wes Craven's film is a success. Scream while it has all the expected clichés (the killer's behind you) it dares to be original. It is about characters who go to the movies and know and discuss famous horror movies (Halloween, Psycho). They analyse their motives; there's one scene at the end of the film, where a character is watching Mike Myers stalk Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween while the killer is behind him. The bloody horror violence works effectively. It adds an effect. A sort of running joke. Characters who love iconic horror stars are getting killed by a local psycho. It works. Kevin Williamson's script is fiendishly inventive, in making this horror film, funny and mysterious and makes you keep guessing and guessing till the end. Fantastic stuff from a man who has a significant contribution to the horror genre.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably wicked! - the best horror-thriller thing in years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is amazing. Cool, funny and with some jumpy moments (at least in the dark), Scream has everything that a good horror/horror spoof needs. All the cast are great, and Drew Barrymore - even with her small role - is particularly memorable. Courtney Cox is great too, and Neve Campbell is awesome as the lead character. I suppose it really shouldn't have been any good; the mask at first seems a bit naff and the whole psycho killer thing is (or at least was) getting old. But somehow Wes managed to make a great film.This is definitely the best horror movie ever! (Although saying this it's one of the only ones I've seen but oh well) If you don't see it you are missing out - and if you choose not to you are a complete loser! And see if you can spot any in-jokes, though hard to spot they will make you smile. Now go see Scream!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little too smug, but enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Huge Spoilers* I'm probably the last horror fan on Earth to see this movie, and I'll admit was wasn't expecting much. Amazingly enough, it was worth the wait! As I expected, the smug attitude was really annoying, but not as bad as I expected. Another thing I didn't like was the supermarket scene. How stupid can it get? Dressed up like that in a supermarket, the day after a double murder. Nobody's going to notice that (heavy sarcasm). I though the ending was really cool though. I had the twist partially figured out, but I really didn't think it was Billy. I did figure there was more than one killer, but I fell for the obvious red-herring of Randy...I guess I just underestimated Craven, didn't think he'd twist it too much. The deaths were great, I especially liked Tatum's death, though the scene leading up to it was pretty stupid. Overall, this was surprisingly good, though Craven's smugness does get pretty bothersome.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people think it's just a typical 90s slasher. It isn't, it's a satire which (i understand) can be a little confusing sometimes. This movie is meant to be funny: making fun of slashers but at the same time it is a slasher, so it uses irony as a form of comedy. Anyway it's very funny in outlining horror clichés and using them at the same time. I think all 3 Screams are great but the best is the third which has one of the funniest things I've ever seen in it and I think to enjoy the Scream movies you need to have seen some horror movies and perhaps be a little sadistic (ok maybe not) but anyone who tells you this movie is bad really doesn't get it. Also, Scary Movie is very stupid... They spoofed a spoof and they said "we're just saying, 'this is how stupid you looked in those horror movies'" so they obviously didn't get it.

When he is biting the knife. Ohhhhhh!!!!!!! And when Matthew Lillard goes up behind billy and they are both covered in blood and that was like way hot. No matter how good this movie was though i would not even think of ever watching the second or third movie ever again. They both sucked.

		<fullReview>It is, I guess, the best horror film in the nineties, not only for his capacity to put into discussion the basics of horror, but also for his attempt to go deeper into the reasons of some social problems, such as the education of the young generation, without falling into a retorical speech. At times it seems to be even too severe for the young generations, but, as it must be, it never gives advises of possible changes. It is a wonderful portrait of society, perhaps not only the American one, made with the irony that only a great director (thanks of course to Kevin Williamson) can show.

		<fullReview>This movie is one of my favorite by Wes Craven if only because of his ability to know every cliché' he uses in his own movies. It is amazing that this movie can be so scary, a suspenseful who-done-it, and a hilarious spoof all in one. The body of this movie is about an 8 and the great beginning and ending pull it up to a nine in my book. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good slasher, however, I feel like people should see some other classic horror movies (eg. Nightmare on Elm street, Halloween, Friday the Thirteenth, etc.) to enjoy this to the fullest because the little things in this movie create hilarity sometimes. See this movie when you have a genuine knowledge of horror movies but it is also still great if you don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A highly entreating and intelligent teenage slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLOT: A psychopathic serial killer is stalking a group of teenagers in a quite and peaceful American town, just like in the movies, first threatening them with scary phone calls.John Carpenter's 1978 classic 'Halloween' is responsible for Scream, and before you watch Scream you're probably going to wonder whether this is another one of those unoriginal Halloween knock-offs with over the top gore. Well, I must let you know that it is far from that. Scream is a 1990s style teenage slasher movie with just enough tongue-in-cheek understanding of its own silliness to make it gruesomely fun without being insulting or boring and full of nonsense. It's a hip, stylish and expertly filmed, original slasher.Directed by Wes Craven, king of teenage horror (e.g. A Nightmare on Elm Street) has delivered a winner. He has managed to make a movie that is both genuine scary movie and arch parody of scary movies. It's the film's very self-awareness that makes it different from all the rest. Instead of following the time-honored horror rules that it so carefully details, it leads them - the virgin is immune from death, we are told, but what if she gives it up? Well, you can guess the rest. Craven also owes a great deal to Kevin Williamson's first-rate script, a witty and smart piece of horror comedy that makes him worthy of the career he gained after this.The performances are some of the best I've witnessed in a horror film, Neve Campbell (how come we don't see more of this girl?) manages to pull off a tormented, innocent teenager with a lot on her plate. The rest of the cast brings up some memorable performances, especially Rose McGowan who plays Tatum, my favourite character. Among the rest of the cast is Friends actress Courtney Cox, Matthew Lillard, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich and how could I forget Drew Barrymore, electrifying cute Scream queen (sadly she dies about 10 minuets into the film).Overall, Scream is a great entertaining movie. However, you must keep in mind that it isn't meant to be taken seriously, as there is nothing too universal or groundbreaking in the film. Despite that, on its own merit it's a classic slasher film. And you can see the films legacy in its dozen of boring imitators (Urban Legend, Valentine and I Know What You Did Last Summer).9.5/10 See It If You Liked: I Know What You Did Last Summer, Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street and Urban Legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Single-handedly eliminated the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone used to talk about how SCREAM 'saved' horror; the irony was, as we've now come to see, it actually killed it off, and almost for good. While SCREAM is a pretty decent film, the firm tongue-in-cheekness of the script, combined with pretty teenage kids, and subsequent turnover at the box office, made studios go teen-horror movie mad. The end result was five years of complete drivel from the so-called horror genre, with few notable exceptions, all from outside the teen horror area (SIXTH SENSE, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and lately RING). Tripe like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, URBAN LEGEND, SHRIEK, and the spoofy but equally terrible SCARY MOVIEs helped turn horror completely into a farce. A joke, even. The follow-ups to SCREAM further contributed to this demise, both forgetting the joke and playing themselves further into near-total parody. Another irony is that Craven did this in-joke horror much better two years earlier with NEW NIGHTMARE; a far superior horror movie, and a very underated flick. Only lately, with the realisation that horror was actually a lot better in the 1970s, have we seen some signs that a turnaround might be on the horizon. Please, please, please... don't screw it all up by making another SCREAM, Wes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Craven finally did what he set out to do several years ago by reviving a dying art in the motion picture phenomenon Scream.Sidney Prescott (Nev Campbell) lives the town of woodsborro where a horrific murder has taken place that resembles the one that took her mother away one year ago. Now she must figure out who the slasher is before she becomes another statistic.What this film was able to do that none before it could muster is balancing the horror and humor element that bedazzled movie goers across the globe.The humor relies on the referential by poking fun at the mistakes that victim of horror films make and how to avoid them. If you hear a strange noise lock the door or staying in huge crowds instead of going off alone.What made it scary was the tension as the killer sneaks up on you and where he or she will appear next. The brutality and display was almost a game of cat and mouse. It was all about opportunity and when you were at your weakest.Wes never forgetting where he came from through in a few Easter eggs that fans of his will appreciate and recognize like the janitor that looks quite a bit like Fred Krueger or the way the way in shocker where the killer sets up his victims to be found.Special recognition is saved for Rose McGowan who plays Tatum, the sister of Dewey and best friend to Sid, who blazes like a wild fire. Her best work was always reserved for a challenging script and here she was ready to play.Many films would follow in the new wave of slasher films trying to capture the magic and audience that ran to its procedure in droves yet none never quite matched the brilliance of scream.Not everyone will like the new style or appreciate its significance in history.But time has proved that scream earned it spot in 250 best films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is the greatest Slasher of the 90's? Its right here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the record, this is less of a review of the movie itself, and more of a review on the entire idea behind it and what to expect.What do you get when you pair up the master of suspense Wes Craven with a upstarting writer with a fresh idea? Some would say Hollywood gold, and it did do that just fine, but more important is taking the genre and flipping it on its head.This film is a masterpiece of its time. Some would regard the movie as a bit goofy, but it really comes down to its reality based, unpredictable nature. This film will put you in a situation where you are involved with something that impacts your emotions in ways you are not used to. From the brutal violence, clever dialogue, and a story that will mess with your mind over the course of its 4 film saga.Its not your typical film, which is one reason why it did so well at the box office and has stuck around as such an iconic horror film. This was the beginning of the end of Wes Craven's career, with Scream 4 being his last ever film. He really did pull out all the stops and hat tricks he learned over the years and put all his eggs in this basket.As each film builds, you see how the story evolves with the times and with the characters. Its so rare to see a saga span such a long period of time with the same cast and the same crew and be executed with perfection.Without getting involved with what happens in this film as I want to keep this spoiler free, go into this with an open mind, (remember this was 1996 so cell phones were still not the norm like they are now) and watch the story grow from one film to the next as everything unfolds in a way that was not intended originally, but ended up being one of the most perfect horror film franchises ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Started the 90s horror boom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sparking the late 90s campy slasher film boom, Scream terrified audiences in 1996 as Wes Craven puts his hand to serial killers. The meta-movie explores the horror tropes with a certain self-awareness that adds to the horror and inserts comedy, defying the clichés and stating the rules. The story embraces the genre and doesn't shy away from the overly campy nature of a murderer stalking teenage girls in a small town.The story begins with the iconic phone call as young teen Casey (Drew Barrymore) is home alone. The conversation delivers the iconic line "What's your favorite scary movie?" before diving into dumb victim choices and gore. This murder brings back the media to the town of Woodsboro that experienced a previous flood of reporters a year early with a mysterious murder. Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is still struggling with her mother's death as a new killer stalks her. The film contributed further to the horror genre with the ghostly masked killer who was not an unstoppable force, but stumbling human that could be knocked down and outrun. Surrounding Sydney are potential suspects including her best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan), her lustful boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich), Tatum's boyfriend Stuart (Matthew Lillard), and film buff Randy (Jamie Kennedy). The killer slices through victims including the Principal (Henry Winkler). There are some gruesome deaths including a garaged door, a television, and, of course, a knife.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

Neve Campbell stars as Sidney whose mother was murdered the year before. She is placed under police protection after an attack in which her boyfriend is arrested. Very clever with everyone looking guilty yet the film relies too much on graphic violence. Wes Craven directs with skill and insight using the creative impulses that worked well on A Nightmare On Elm Street. Neve Campbell delivers a strong performance as a teenager targeted for murder and not sure who is friend or foe although her discoveries in the third act deliver a great plot twist. Courtney Cox as reporter Gale Weathers arrives on the scene only to be punched in the face by Sidney. She further investigates until the over the top violence in the third act surface. Skeet Ulrich is the accused boyfriend struggling to reconnect with Sidney. Matthew Lillard plays a horror fanatic in what is a pivotal role. Drew Barrymore makes an effective cameo in the film's opening. Intriguing look at unhealthy media influence and the disruption of an unstable mind. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My experience with Scream (1996)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last week, I revisited the first Scream film. Although the idea of there being two killers isn't an original concept, it certainly was fresh at the time of its release. I loved it when it came out in late 1996. I felt like I was one of the very few who experienced it before most people. It has a very simple plot that I was intrigued by in a horror film mainly because the genre had been absent from the silver screen for quite some time beforehand. I was a senior in high school. The Friday when this opened, it was a half day before the Christmas break and I decided to see it basically out of curiosity. The horror genre is really a hit-and-miss for me, but I remember how effective horror movies were when I was growing up in the early eighties so therefore I wanted to give this a try. At an old AMC theater which does not exist anymore that was pre stadium seating I showed up about forty minutes before the next show. I prefer to arrive early. It was quiet there that afternoon and for a horror movie I couldn't believe how long it was. I remember peeking in during the ending and seeing a young guy destroying stuffing out of a pillow in a living room. I thought this might be intense. I probably shouldn't watch anymore so I waited in the lobby. The next show it was practically an empty theater so I thought the timing was right and that it would soon be gone from cinemas. Since there was virtually no advertising before it opened, I didn't know what to expect, which was definitely beneficial. The first ten minutes was the scariest I thought. Long before those stupid spoof movies, I was initially startled when I saw that creepy ghost mask. I am more critical of it now than before. Honestly I think there should have been a higher body count towards the end. It makes sense to me because Billy and Stu were clearly deranged but I felt they were slipping. They were becoming distracted. Sydney's best friend could have been spared until later. That silly garage scene could have been totally omitted. Randy could have been killed off easily. He became completely inebriated during that party, which was going against his rules for surviving a horror movie. Deputy Dewey was stabbed in the back and could have been finished off. Billy had his chance to kill Gale. I don't know why he let her live. I think it would have been a much crazier ending if Sydney was the only survivor. I think she was probably the smartest one throughout the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>scream is one of the best slasher films o date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into the viewing of this movie, after watching 2-3 horror movies previously, I had a certain picture in my head of what a horror movie would consist of. After viewing the movie Scream, I was surprised to say the least. Not only is this movie completely different from the basic horror slasher films, but it is different in a way that pleases the audience. While this movie does have the same characteristics, such as the tropes and the last girl who survives, it also has numerous unforeseen plot twists and a humorous aspect. While in previous horror films, whether I had seen them previous to watching them in my college class or not, there is a well known killer in each (ie, Michael Myers in Halloween, Freddy Kruger in Nightmare on Elm Street), we don't have this in Scream. Scream starts off with a teenage girl being alone in her home making popcorn and receiving a phone call that soon turns intensifying. This call thus leads into the death of the girl's boyfriend and her own death while her parents are merely a couple feet away. The film transitions to the girl's high school, where things are chaotic over the death of these two people. Fear sets in and people are on edge at all times, even with the constant police presence. While seeing all this chaos at the school we meet the main character, Sydney, who we meet in a scene where her boyfriend sneaks in her window, is the virginal character. The movie continues to strike fear in the audience when we hear the phone ring and we see the killer attack Sydney. Throughout the movie there are many plot twists but the ultimate plot twist is when we figure out who the killer(s) are and what their motives were for killing all those people. Also, this movie was a good start to many, now famous, actors and actresses careers. While this made things a little less scary for me, as I am familiar with Matthew Lillard playing Shaggy in the Scooby Doo movies and Courtney Cox from Friends, it made me more interested to watch the movie as I knew the people in it. Overall, this movie will definitely be one of, if not my number one, favorite horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Return To Greatness For Slasher Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson, the film that brought slasher films back from the brink.Nearly one year after her mother's murder, Sidney Prescott ( Neve Campbell ) is stalked by a man in a ghost mask who is obsessed with horror films.The movie starts off with a high school girl (Drew Barrymore) preparing to watch a scary movie when she receives a phone call from a person who appears to have the wrong number. The call starts off innocent enough, until the man on the phone has kidnapped her boyfriend and tells her that she has to answer horror movie trivia if she wants to live. This man is revealed to be none other than.... another random guy in a mask, who (surprise, surprise) kills her.This may sound like almost all slasher films, but I assure you that there is something different about this film. The Scream series is most well-known for its self-awareness. Since all the classic horror films exist in Scream, the characters makes a lot of references to horror films. A character name Randy (Jaime Kennedy) who works at a video store, only exists to point out all the clichés in horror films for some laughs.Neve Campbell gives the best performance as Sidney. Sidney has been a depressed teen ever since her mother died a year ago and so she is not the most cheerful character around. When her mother was murdered, Sidney got Cotton Weary arrested.Now that a killer is going after her, she is beginning to think she might have made a mistake. The anger and is Campbell's performance gives Sidney an intensity that is good for a final girl archetype. The Scream Series is about Sidney and not the killer, which makes the Scream series unique in that way. Sidney is also smart when it comes to running from Ghostface and uses her brain in the chase scene. Most of the time...Ghostface himself has two different sides to him. Phone Ghostface (Roger Jackson) sounds like a genuinely threating character. However once you see him in action, he is really clumsy. I guess you can't have that great of vision with a mask like that, so not being perfect adds a sense of realism to the film. It is just disappointing when you hear this menacing voice and then there is this guy in a cheap Halloween costume that is just not good at killing. Ghostface wears a black cloak with a hood and a white ghost mask. He also does this really cool knife cleaning trick.The other characters are pretty good. Randy is the best supporting character, being the movie geek of the group and all his movie references really make the movie. Matthew Lillard plays Stu, the goofy class clown and Skeet Ulrich plays Billy Loomis (Sidney Prescott's boyfriend) who seems like he just wants to do it with Sidney. There is also Sidney's close friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) who really is just there so Sidney has someone to talk to.Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) and Reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) have a romance going on in this film, but it is not explored much until the sequels. Dewey is not very good at his job and does not really protect anyone from the killer. Gale Weathers is a pushy news reporter, who is always trying to get a news story out of Sidney and just comes off as annoying.Craven does a good job imitating Carpenters style, making the ordinary seem sinister and mysterious. This tactic however makes some shots look lazy, like when Sidney is in a car and Ghostface tries to strangle her from the backseat. This shot is exactly the same as the car strangling scene in Halloween, and although some people would call this homage, I think that it is just a rip-off.The music score by Marco Beltrami does its job in making the viewer uneasy and has a mystical quality to it. The score is not nearly as iconic as other horror themes like Halloween or Friday the 13th, but it sound really good.The movie does not have that big of a body count like other slasher films. Only 6 characters die and there roles are very minor, this is because Scream was written to be a trilogy, so only certain characters are expendable. Unfortunately, because of so few kills in the movie, there is a lack of interesting kills. The only kill that is particularly memorable is the garage door kill. The movie ends with a party at Stu's house, and there the killer kills and injures some people. Sidney is chased around a bit, ending with the killer being revealed as Billy AND Stu. It turns out that Sidney's mother had a thing going on with Billy's dad and when Billy's mother found out, she moved away, leaving Billy behind. So Billy and Stu killed Sidney's mother and pinned it on Cotton Weary, and now they are planning on blaming these new murders on Sidney's father. The mess up this plan and get themselves killed, ending the movie.Billy has a pretty simple but good motive, but Stu has no real reason for going along with this plan. It is stated that he dated Drew Barrymore's character, but why would he have killed Sidney's mother in the first place? Or why would he stake out in a bathroom, hoping that Sidney would go in there, when there plan hinged on her death being on the next day? No matter the flaws that this movie has, it is still a great film. It makes the characters self-aware AND still stays true to the slasher genre ( unlike Scary Movie ). It also introduced a new generation to classic horror films, something it still does today. A Must See 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Love Letter to Horror Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me make one thing very clear; I'm not a horror junkie. Sure, I'll watch horror movies like "American Werewolf in London" and "Misery", and enjoy them, but I haven't seen the major horror landmarks like "Nightmare on Elm Street", or "Friday the 13th". For the past few years, I've always tried to watch a new horror movie every October. This year, it was "Scream", and...it's alright. Maybe I'd enjoy it more if I saw all these "slasher" horror films that this one is clearly paying homage to. But I did like it. However, it didn't scare me that much. Sure, it's gory and has plenty of jump scares, but it takes more than 50 gallons of fake blood and false alarm jump scares to get me. I mean, yeah, it's bloody, but in the gore department, I've seen much, MUCH worse. Okay, I've bashed this film enough, what did I like about it? Well, it was really good at keeping me guessing. I already knew there were two killers, I don't remember how I knew, but I kept guessing on who they were. When you watch it again, you realize they were directly telling you who they were the entire time. But for that first viewing, it's a wonderfully gory version of "Clue". So, did I enjoy myself? Yes. Will I watch it every Halloween? Probably not. My recommendation depends on how you feel about horror movies. Want a scary movie this Halloween? Give this one a try. Want something that's not too bloody? This isn't for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cravens last great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The recent sad passing of Wes Craven gave me a reason to look at some of his back catalogue, with The last house on the left and Nightmare on Elm Street being 'classic' Craven films, but I thought I would try Scream, which after its release in 1996 spawned 3 further sequels and has never really been spoken with the reverence of Cravens earlier output. Classed more as a 'slasher' as straight out horror, Scream played as a slice and dice of young, attractive American teens terrorised by a ghost faced masked killer stalking all those at Woodsboro High school, centring on the central character Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who is still coming to terms with her mother's murder a year before. What made Scream stand out and grab the attention was the beginning. Having at the time it's one A list star brutally killed off in the first scene was a real statement of intent that no one was safe and instead of characters that you didn't care too much about who you could predict would be picked off we had a group who all were potential victims but also could hold the potential killer. Craven weaves the story around Prescott throwing curveballs as the guessing game as to who is next grows with a great supporting cast including Cox and Arquette as the older protagonists, but the key to the whole movie is its self-reverence about the 'rules' of horror movies almost played tongue in cheek for laughs at times. Craven himself turns up in a cameo as a caretaker dressed as Freddie Kruger. I always thought Neve Campbell was set for greater things. As the central character and main focus of the killer, whenever confronted with danger reacted as a survivor and not as the victim or standard fodder for the killer. She was dubbed a new Jamie Lee Curtis and the 'scream queen' but apart from reprising the role for the sequels, never really went on to bigger and better which is a pity, but time is on her side. Scream spawned a number of imitators including franchises 'I know what you did last summer' and Urban Legend, cashing in on the success of Cravens latest genre movie, upping the gore and more intricate slayings, but none as clever or with the subtle wit and execution of Cravens last great movie. https://moviemayhemsite.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different perspective on the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah Scream, a movie that blew away the horror going cinema goers and haunted kids of the days nightmares. This is one movie considered one of the quintessential viewings of horror and is credited with revitalising the genre which had up to that point been in a way, dying out. As much as I respect Scream for doing that I can't write this and say I loved it or found it to be this amazing movie, I more felt it tries very hard to be smart but thinks it is smarter than it really is. The master behind the whole shebang is none other than Wes Craven who is considered one of the daddies of the horror movie genre and for good reason, the guy knows suspense when he see's it and crafts a movie that on his part is good and well done. I did however find little things about this that aren't all that great and the acting is not always that great even if this is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek.Our plot takes us to a town in the US and more specifically to a load of teenagers who are shocked to find out one of their classmates was brutally murdered by someone only we have seen wearing that now infamous mask. Our plot then takes us between murders as people are killed in the town, and not only teenagers are the target, this killer is one sadistic piece of work who also happens to be oddly funny too. Scream prides itself on making a mockery of horror and it's usually before this obvious plots, what it doesn't do though is truly branch out of that I mean if you watch closely it never truly changes the story, just plays out like any other. One thing I really did appreciate was the way Craven makes everyone a suspect and you really don't know who it is until the very end and even then you expect some kind of twist. I really wanted to love this I truly did but I do feel this has aged quite a bit, and I don't mean with its fashion etc. The reason I felt it is dated is because Scream itself created horror that could also contain humour as a light side gag, in turn Scream may have changed the game and had a few comments on the industry in horror but never truly stands out to me today and any movie which changes the game should be able to beat anyone who dares copy it. That all said Scream is still pretty damn scary I mean the killer jumping around is really quite chilling even if he keeps getting smacked by cupboard doors and kicked in the balls. As Horror goes it may not satisfy all those who prefer it serious but truly don't take this seriously and you'll have fun. I almost forgot to mention the actors involved; of course we have Neve Campbell as our main character of sorts Sidney Prescott who is in a spot of trouble throughout. Cast like Courteney Cox make it good but watching many episodes of "Friends" before hand makes me see her in a whole new light where she isn't Monica Geller. We then have David Arquette as a kind of comedy reliever in Deputy Dewey and some jokes also come from the future shaggy in "Scooby-Doo" (sorry I mean that is what I most remember him for) Matthew Lillard who alongside all the other cast members always has something funny albeit a little dark to say. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to see Scream and call it a masterpiece or brilliant or even good for that matter but maybe one day though. I will though be able to recommend it and say it is OK and that I feel is good enough because this is one movie I think everyone should see whether horror fan or not you can't deny this is a popular movie and one you might just love yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a number of things I like about this movie. One of the things about it that I like the most is the fact that it effectively manages to be both a parody of a horror movie and a horror movie itself without failing to be scary and without being cheesy. I think the casting in this movie is actually more well acted than people tend to give it credit for. I think Neve Campbell does a great job playing a believable tormented and traumatized victim and I like the fact that her character is a like and intelligible victim for a slasher movie. Skeet Ulrich is really creepy in this movie and he does a really good job making you wonder throughout the film if he really is the killer or not. This movie may not have been the first slasher, but it gave us a new original take on that genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A clever and original slasher-horror flick that reinvented the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1970s and 80s, Hollywood treated us with amazing slasher- horror flicks such as The Last House on The Left (1973), Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), and other lesser noticed slasher films. At the dawn of the 90s, the slasher genre was dying as Hollywood was failing to come up with anything new and was repeatedly recycling the same formula of the genre. This was until Wes Craven resurrected the genre with this unique, self-aware, teen- horror slasher film that parodies its genre with new elements, new twists, and new scares that many horror fans were not expecting. This film stars Neve Campbell as Sidney Scott, a 17-year old high school girl traumatized by the murder of her mother, who begins being stalked by a masked killer who begins taking the lives of her fellow school mates. Sound familiar? Just wait! The teenagers learn to survive against the killer's onslaught by using advice from horror movies by learning how characters in the movies become victims.Featuring a cast of Skeet Ulrich, Jamie Kennedy, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and Drew Barrymore, this movie drifts away from the typical slasher-horror clichés and comes up with new elements. Instead of having the characters make unwise decisions by failing to run out the door to safety while being chased it a killer, this film creates characters who are aware of their mistakes that characters from other horror films make and realize why the killer is after them. Like many horror fans, they also manage to point out every cliché that happens in a slasher movie like characters who are virgins end up surviving or how characters die because they fail to run out the front door instead of random places in the house. Basically, this movie is about teenagers who get killed from making a whole new set of unwise decisions. Neve Campbell does the great job as the main character. Then there is Skeet Ulrich who plays Billy Loomis, her clingy boyfriend, and Jamie Kennedy who plays Randy Meeks who is a huge move buff and is well educated on what goes on in horror movies. Many scenes where he makes references to other horror movies and establishes a set of rules in order to survive against a masked killer. These rules include: do not have sex, do not drink or do drugs, and do not "I'll be right back" before leaving somewhere. He is one of those characters who is really smart and has knowledge on how to survive a horror movie. Then there is the rest of the cast who demonstrate some great acting skills. Scream is one of the most original and clever horror movies. Like many slashers, it has the blood and gore that many gore fans come to appreciate. Overall, this movie succeeds at avoiding most (if not all) of the clichés that many horror films are known for. This is probably the best movie by Wes Craven in his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stylish Slasher for Generation X.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when Dawson's Creek creator Kevin Williamson and horror director Wes Craven team up? A modern take on the slasher film that delivers chills and gore. Scream is meant to be a parody of the slasher genre, but it is actually a stylish movie in the sub-genre. Neve Campbell stars as Sydney Prescott, a teenage girl dealing with the tragic murder of her mother. On the anniversary of her mom's death, her classmates begin getting brutally murdered. At the epicenter of the murders is news anchor Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) who is the author of the book about Sydney's mom's murder. This film is a great take on horror films and deals with obsessive horror movie fans that may know a little too much about horror films. This is an on-the-edge-of-your-seat film that will leave you "screaming" for more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not often do you get a horror film that satirizes and lampoons other horror films. From its opening moments, where Drew Barrymore's blonde is terrorized by an ominous prank caller who turns out to be deadly dangerous, we know we are in for a new take on the old slasher genre. As the film progresses, we get all kinds of film references and the characters themselves are aware of some of the clichés that famous movie horror characters in films like "Haloween" and "Nightmare on Elm Street" have been subject to.It helps that the film is also filled with strong performances from a notable cast, including Campbell and Arquette. Craven expertly directs a film which both pays homage to some of his earlier works but also redefines the genre in many ways. You'll be screaming at how good it is!</fullReview>

It's the movie that made slasher movies scary and original again. It has a great storyline, great acting, and the famous voice of the ghost-face killer will send a chill to the bone, every time you hear it. Neve Campbell as Sidney is pretty impressive, with this role she took the title of the scream queen. This movie is, and always will be a cult classic! 10/10</fullReview>

Of course it also has it's creepy side and for me it contains several of the most terrifying slasher scenes of all time. It has elements of all the slasher movies that went before it but it takes these ideas further or improves on them making it original in it's own right. With it's scooby do script and relentless pace this is a stonewall classic. Keeps me gripped more than the dated Halloween and is almost on par with the classic Nightmare on Elm Street. Has to be 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hip community of 'been there, done that' kids finds themselves terrorized by a killer known as Ghost Face in this smart, scary, well produced slasher film. It's a testament to the skill of director Craven who has made some pioneering entries in the horror genre including The Last House on the Left and A Nightmare on Elm Street. The cast is a mix of pop culture favorites and a bright new crop of capable talents who are given far more than the usual dead teenager material to draw upon. An instant classic within the genre and a deserved mainstream hit. Followed by numerous sequels; each cut from the same fine cloth. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Title: Scream Directed by: Wes CravenStoryline: The beginning starts off with a random man calling up a random girl and asking if she likes scary movies. This type of scene can go wrong very quickly or even just fall flat if not done correctly, but this movie makes it turn from a comical little chat into something more with the words "I want to know who I'm looking at" along with the sudden drop in the music. The man on the phone gets more violent with the fact of him knowing what she looks like, with all things adding up to make her more frightened while still adding suspense to the opening scene. You will also see that Scream made the "I want to play a game" line a lot more sinister for its time before it was used by the Saw franchise. The level of psychological torture that the man puts her through in the first scene is made all the more haunting by his monotone voice. Along with the woman actually sounding scared for her life and the life of her boyfriend and not like she is trying to sound scared for the camera. Which is more than what can be said for the parents. After the first scene we are introduced to two more teens, the main characters of this movie, who seem to have a relationship of sorts. We are then shown the high school that the girl from the first scene goes to as well the main girl. Afterward, we are introduced to the bunch of friends who we will be watching for this movie, one of which is called Stuart who is played by Matthew Lillard. This is a character I cannot take seriously, mainly because he also played and does the voice of Shaggy Rogers from the Scooby Doo movies. Our main character Sidney is left home alone because her father has gone away on a trip, so Sidney goes over to stay at a friends house. In a real world situation, this is actually a very smart thing to do under the logic of safety in numbers. Ghostface finds were she is and starts attacking her when she goes back inside, but runs off when her boyfriend comes, naturally she adds two and two together and suspects he's the killer, he gets arrested and she goes with her friend. But even at her friends house she still gets the man calling her with her boyfriend held in custody. Soon after getting attacked in school, Sidney goes to her friends to watch a movie feeling it would be safe there. There also is a subtle reference in the school with Frank the cleaner being dressed like Freddy Kruger. This is in the same scene where the camera is focusing on the headmaster walking around the school after hours. You can tell he is going to be attack and/or killed because he is not even a secondary character and is getting screen time. Because of all the murders people are jumping at all sorts of conclusions of who is the killer, this also instigates a town wide curfew. Ghostface appears at the party and his first kill is a creative one, he uses a garage to break someones neck. While Sidney is being romantic with her boyfriend upstairs, the rest of them are watching the horror movies downstairs, this is when we are introduced to the rules of how to survive a horror movie. They also get a call about the headmaster being found dead, this is a smart little plot device to get rid of the excess people in the house, shows how morbid those people are but it is believable. From there on it is just different ways to kill all of the different people. But it then turns out that Billy is the killer, who faked his death, but he's not the only killer, the twist is that there are two killers Billy and Stuart. But as expected they die in the end and Sidney lives on to do sequels. Acting: The acting of the main characters is solid, Neve Campbell plays the surviving Sidney, she adds a sense of reality to the main character who seems shy mostly. Skeet Ulrich plays Billy the brains of the murders, apart from mistaking him for Leonardo Dicaprio several times due to the way he looks he was a great actor and adds an unnerving sense of psycho into it. The secondary characters are good and actually feel like typical teenagers for the most part, apart from that there isn't really all too much to say about it, I admire that the movie didn't take itself all that seriously and that they were able to avoid being really cheesy at scenes that could have been cheesy. Noticeable Camera work: The panning and tilting shots were used effectively, wasn't to keen on the times where the camera jump zoomed, these were rare but still noticeable. We were treated to voyeuristic shots as well which worked well for the overall feel along with being a plot device. Costume: Not much to say about the costume, sort of inventive. Not much else. Length: 110 minutes Overall Feel: I enjoyed this movie overall, I was bored by the romantic scenes between Sidney and Billy after the first time we were introduced. The rest of the film created a dramatic and tense atmosphere, but when it cut to the romance I felt the suspense drop and was actually wishing them for to hurry up and get stabbed so we could go back to the main group watching movies downstairs. Apart from the pacing of the movie, everything else was OK. The story was pretty solid, no real plot holes that stood out. It was a good classic horror movie, simple as.</fullReview>

It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Lots of movies have copied scream since but back when it opened it was original and not what anybody has seen before. The opening scene with Drew Barrymore is still one of the most memorable movie scenes for me. The acting in this movie to go with the writing are on the of the reasons this movie will be a classic.

		<fullReview>Casey and Steve get killed in the opening sequence, which sets much of the tone of the rest of the film.The next day, the school where Casey and Steve had attended is abuzz with the news, and the local television channels are overflowing with it.Sidney sat next to Casey in school, and her mother was assaulted and killed the year before. The culprit was not apprehended. A lot of the attention of the film flows to Sidney, her boyfriend Billy, plus their friends Stuart and Tatum. Deputy Dewey knows Sidney from the year before.We see the same MO working against Sidney the next night. The perpetrator tells Sidney that her mother did not want to die. Billy gets arrested for it. Sidney gets to thinking about the two murder incidents, and the cops have a costume that looks like the one the perpetrator used.Gail Weathers and her hapless, overweight cameraman Kenny try to get the story first. Sidney cold cocks her, but apologizes the next morning. Gale, on the other hand, insists that Sidney's mother was a slut, and that Sidney identified the wrong man at the trial.Her classmates are more than a bit crude and insensitive. Two of the boys wear a Halloween costume that resembles the one used by the killer. Some of the girls speculate whether Sidney did the murders, and whether is was a pathetic cover up. The killer finds her in the girls' room at school, and Sidney gets away via some good scrambling.As the story progresses, the principal gets killed, Sidney's friend Tatum is killed, her boyfriend Billy gets knifed twice in the gut, Kenny gets his throat slit, and a couple more people get killed.When the guilty are revealed, it makes sense from the earlier parts of the film. Loose ends are tied up.-------Scores-------Cinematography: 10/10 Exceptional.Sound: 10/10 Well done.Acting: 10/10 Fine. Neve Campbell and Skeet Ulrich gave particularly good performances.Screenplay: 6/10 Too clever. Too referential to the genre. Too many references to other movies.

		<shortDescription>The rebirth of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know a lot of people are going to read the title of this review and scoff, but hear me out. Every generation has a movie that defines horror. My generation had Saw and the birth of torture porn, the 80s had Jason and Michael, and the 90s had Scream and the "smart" horror movie. To understand how important this movie is think about where horror was in 96. Jason has visited New York, then we sent him to hell. Freddy had a daughter, and Michael was the product of Druid cults. Sweet God WHAT HAPPENED? Horror was in the toilet and all the "heroes" were dead. The second stringer's weren't much better. Hellraiser was on his way to DVD and Leprechaun was... well that was something else. This came out with smart, self aware characters, strong writing and known actors who could convey terror. And these 3 things were copied for a decade. Those simple things made this movie a success and the money it made revitalized horror. The scares are good, the tension is good, the ending (I think) is good. Also, it STILL has one of the best opening scenes in a horror movie to date. Saw it when i was 12, and funny enough, before I saw the movies it mocks/loves. It got me hooked on horror and I've seen hundreds of horror movies since because of it. I'm giving it a 9 not because it's the most terrifying horror movie, because it's not. This is no Alien, The Exorcism, Halloween or The Thing. This is a smart, fun, scary movie that kickstarted a dead genre. Wes Craven at his best. Enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seventeen years passed since "Scream" was originally released, and watching it now made me notice how current it still is. This movie is very metalinguistic, criticizing the way horror movies have been made throughout the years, making fun specially of whodunit thrillers, like "Prom Night", among others. It's important to remember that even thought "Scream" criticizes those movies repeatedly, big part of the plot follows horror movies rules. Also, instead of trying to change the way horror movies are portrayed, it basically recreated the genre, delivering MANY other films with these characteristics, like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Urban Legend". One big thing to understand is the fact this movie created lots of others that are considered classics, no matter what the critics say. You know, how would feel life nowadays if we didn't have the great "Scary Movie" franchise? Sometimes Wes Craven ends up making fun of himself, which shows he's not all that prepotent as people state he is. All in all, albeit "Scream" feels corny and predictable at some points, we have to consider its HUGE importance to the world cinema, in general. Congratulations for the team involved in this picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Very minor spoilers, and the minor ones are given a warning*"Several more local teens are dead, bringing to an end the harrowing mystery of the masked killings that has terrified this peaceful community like the plot of some scary movie. It all began with the scream over 911, and ended in a bloodbath that has rocked the town of Woodsboro. All played out here in this peaceful farmhouse, far from the crimes and the sirens of the larger cities that its residents have fled."In a time where Michael was boring, Freddy had lost his edge, and Jason hadn't had a good film in years, the horror genre was close to dead. And yet in that time, we get SCREAM (1996), a funny, new, and, most importantly, scary movie. For once, a horror film in which the characters had seen all the same movies we had.The film opens at the house of character Casey, played by the famous Drew Barrymore, who is getting ready to sit down and watch HALLOWEEN (1978), when she receives a mysterious call. The rest of the film is littered with comedic moments and horror references that any slasher fan should have a fun time identifying (keep an eye out for the name of Sidney's boyfriend, the number on Tatum's shirt, etc). And of course there is the famous line "There are certain RULES that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie." The film mentions rules which we have all learned by watching earlier slashers. There's the glaringly obvious "don't have sex", don't yell out "who's there?", don't drink, and more. And what SCREAM does is try to break every rule (though it is still rather unpredictable).Now, of course, I hate what SCREAM did to the genre. It revived the horror genre, and specifically the slasher sub-genre, but almost all of the films inspired by SCREAM were just annoying and cheesy films that were trying too hard to be self-aware and hip. Looking at you, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (1997) (it's hard to believe that I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER was written by the same writer of SCREAM). And, while the second SCREAM movie is still pretty good, the other two films in the franchise are horrible imitations, just as formulaic as the films SCREAM tried to defy.When I first got in to horror, I watched almost every sub-genre of horror films, and had seen quite a lot of movies at young age (by the time I was 13 I had already seen THE SHINING (1980), THE EXORCIST (1973), THE OMEN (1976), THE FLY (1986) and many, many more), but one sub-genre that I wasn't very experienced in was the slasher. Sure, I had seen HALLOWEEN and the first four Friday THE 13TH films by the time of watching this, but that's as deep as my understanding of the sub-genre went. So I enjoy SCREAM because it helped past-me and many other horror novices discover the slasher genre (this film led me to the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise, PROM NIGHT, THE BURNING, and many others that I never had any interest in watching before). And that is what I truly love about SCREAM: its ability to please horror experts and to educate those who aren't as understanding of the genre.When some horror fans want to talk about awful modern movies, their go- to film to poke fun at is often SCREAM. I find this completely ridiculous, because SCREAM is actually a very good film. I'd understand completely if they made fun of SCREAM 3 (2000) or SCREAM 4 (2011), or hey, I could even understand SCREAM 2, but the original SCREAM is actually a very original, witty, tongue-in-cheek film that still somehow manages to scare on top of all of that.(Minor spoilers about the killer(s), no identity/identities are shared) While some argue that the killer(s)'s reason of recreating horror films (although another reason is that he/she/they are just crazy) is very unlikely, I honestly believe it was the only ending the film could have done. I mean, if it turned out to be some crazy act of revenge, or another standard slasher ending, I think we'd all feel a little cheated. And this is hardly the most ridiculous ending in the franchise (as much as I enjoy SCREAM 2, the ending is pretty ridiculous, and 3 and 4 are both some of the most ridiculous endings I've ever seen, though I'll save that for my future reviews of those films). All in all, SCREAM is a very fun, scary, and interesting horror film that actually brought something new to a genre that had been reduced to formulaic slashers for years (if only we could have another truly original film nowadays). There are some brilliant one-liners ("You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick"), great characters (I'm not Dewey's biggest fan, but besides him I enjoy all of the characters), and a mystery-slasher that actually keeps you constantly guessing until the very end (the first time I watched this film, I never would have guessed the killer(s) in a million years). Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply revolutionary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's go back in time : we're in the middle of the 90's, and Horror (as a genre) is wheezy and sickly, filled with cheesy and predictable slasher-films. Wes Craven's Scream kind of came of out of nowhere, created a "worldwide surprise" and had a massive box-office success. Then, what makes Scream that different from a goofy or classic slasher-movie ? First of all, the script. When you talk about Scream, you cannot NOT praise the amazing story written by Kevin Williamson. He has the cleverness to write a love letter to the genre, without forgetting to show its limits and flaws. There's always a great balance between parody and pure terror and it gives an incredibly fluid rhythm to the film. Plus, the characters are developed and it is something quite unusual in Horror flicks.Scream as also some cult suspenseful sequences such as the unforgettable opening or nice chase scenes between the main character and the Ghostface killer. But to make those scenes believable, we need good actors. And oh my gosh, the all-cast is over the top. From Neve Campbell's neurotic portrayal of Sidney Prescott to Drew Barrymore's epic bravery moments in the opening, everything feels great. Finally, filmmaking is stunning, Craven outdone himself and created lots of tense and mythic moments.To sum up, Scream is a revolutionary film, that has definitely changed the genre, or at least it woke it up. Easily one of the best horror films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We All Go A Little Mad Sometimes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am deciding to rewrite my reviews on the Scream franchise because I was not very satisfied with my original reviews. I really didn't express how much I loved these films. So I begin with the first film Scream.In the early to mid 90's, horror films were getting stale and people were not responding well to recent installments to Halloween, Friday The 13th and A Nightmare On Elm Street. In 1995 a young writer by the name of Kevin Williamson wrote a script for a film entitled Scary Movie. This script started a bidding war between different directors until Wes Craven decided to pick it up. The title was changed from Scary Movie to Scream.Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell is an aspiring girl who is just about ready to graduate High school with her friends. Her best friend is Tatum Riley played by Rose McGowan who is willing to take on anything that gets in her way. Then we have Randy Meeks played by Jamie Kennedy who is the big horror movie geek in the school. Stu Macher played by Matthew Lillard who is dating Tatum and is a big party goer. Finally there is Billy Loomis played by Skeet Ulrich Who is dating Sidney.One night Casey Becker played by Drew Barrymore gets murdered along with her boyfriend by a man wearing a Ghostface mask and the first on the scene is Gale Weathers played by Courtney Cox A reporter who will do anything to get the latest story and police officer Dewey Riley played by David Arquette who is shy and uncomfortable but has a big heart. After classes have been suspended for a few days Everybody heads to Stu's house for a party. One by one people get murdered including Tatum.Spoilers! After Sidney is attacked she finds out that Billy is the killer and Stu is his accomplice. Billy is driven By Maternal abandonment whereas Stu is driven to peer pressure. Stu dies from being electrocuted and Billy dies from being shot. The characters end there night by walking into the sunrise.This is a great horror film. The dialouge is well written because it is self aware. It knows it is making a mockery of horror flicks and has fun with it. The characters are nicely developed and the story is very original for a horror film.Rated R For Strong Graphic Horror Violence And Gore, And For Language.1hr 51min/111min.30 uses of the F-word.****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Drew Barrymore receives a phone call from a confused man who has dialed the wrong number. She politely ends the call, returning to her own business. But the man calls again, this time to apologize for his previous error. Minutes passes by and Drew talks to the man on the phone, thinking he's kind of fun. They even flirt a little with each other. But soon the man starts getting more and more creepy and aggressive. The first so innocent phone call turns into a total nightmare.The reason I love "Scream" is that it's such a great mixture of excitement, horror and comedy. It's impossible to guess what's gonna happen next and the actors are phenomenal. It's scary, funny and you are on your toes the whole movie through, guessing how it all will end. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>lets just start of by saying Scream was 1 of the best slasher films there is till this day 2012. the reason is for the scary opening Drew Barrymore done perfectly. i enjoyed the chase scene involving Sydney and exploring her past life. i would say the character that i didn't want to see gutted by ghost face was Sydney's best friend Tatum. 2 reasons for that 1 because i throat she would make a perfect killer. 2 because she was my favourite character. i also love the chemistry there was between gale and Dewey. glad they both survived.when the killers were revealed i wasn't so surprised that is was Billy, but i was really surprised that Stu tagged along in the killing spree. i was even more surprised that it turnout out to be more than one killer.scream kept me guessing the whole way. i could still watch it and be surprised who the killers are. if your a horror fan and waiting for the perfect movie that will keep you guessing, laughing and jumping out of your seat then this is the perfect movie for you. overall scream deserves a well earned 9star</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven Reinvents The Teen Slasher SubGenre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Scream' is perhaps the first slasher parody and it came out at a time when teen slasher flicks were almost extinct. It set a new trend by bringing back this genre and sadly, the result was a boom that provided wannabe trash like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', 'Urban Legends' etc etc. Of course the boom was only shortlived as people just got tired of watching teen slasher flicks.Back to 'Scream', director Wes Craven has found a way to reinvent the genre. It succeeds in both the humour aspect and the thriller aspect. Its self-awareness has given it a unique quality. In a way it celebrates the genre but also pokes fun at the clichés and silliness of the formula those movies followed. The teen characters directly make fun of the slasher flick and yet they follow the exact same formula because 'like it's really going to happen in real life'. The element of suspense is also well maintained. Obviously the viewer knows that so-and-so character is going to be killed and yet he/she is hooked to the screen.The cast includes a host of actors who were cast in popular TV-series. Neve Campbell is very good as the protagonist (and she gets better with each movie). Courteney Cox is terrific. David Arquette is alright. Jaime Kennedy contributes well to the fine comic relief. Rose McGowen is good as the blonde who thinks she's smart. Matthew Lillard goes over the top and sometimes it's annoying.'Scream' is sheer popcorn entertainment and its sequels successfully find newer ways to poke fun at the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ehh...nicely done, but it drags.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream. Now, I must admit I walked into this movie expecting a lot of humor and predictable scenes. For the most part, I got what I expected. From the very beginning, I knew Billy was going to be a key piece in this movie. Once he was so over-zealously stabbed, I knew that from there on out, it was nothing but corn syrup and make believe. As far as humor goes, the allusions to all the classic horror movies and nineties colloquialisms built into the lines made me chuckle out loud. I personally found it hilarious when Gail went to shoot at Billy, and the safety of the gun was on. It was just kind of like "?really? You couldn't check that BEFORE you busted in there? Clearly, you were waiting at the door, ready to seize the perfect opportunity, yet?you didn't think to check if the gun was ready." It's that type of stupidity that makes this movie worthwhile.The only piece of this movie that really stuck with me is that both Casey and Sydney were both intensely watched by the killers previous to their murders. That's the only thing that actually scares me. I'm not a big fan of "cheap horror", you know, jumping out and saying boo. I much prefer psychologically disturbing movies. Before seeing this film, I had only seen one other horror movie, and wouldn't you know that it too, was directed by Wes Craven. The best thing about his movies is his straight-forward decisions. Whether they directly impact the plot or not is irrelevant, it's the mere fact that he took the time to sit down and really concentrate on choices. One thing that really stuck out was the constant popping up of labeled bags and cans of food products. I get it; it's good for funding and whatnot. Howsoever, is it really necessary to having a can of Coke in every scene, or a bag of Ruffles always chilling in the corner? The eyes of the audience are drawn to the products, they aren't just subtly used. It literally looks like they were digitally enhanced to pop out at you. I watched this movie with my two best friends, and one of them is still arguing with me for my obnoxious commentary on this very subject. It bothered me that I'd be trying to focus on a murder, when "Oh, look! They had Dunkin' Donuts in the 90's!" No. Wes Craven, you are a genius, but that particular choice (no matter how pro-active you were trying to be) drove me crazy.One thing I didn't like about this movie is that it's sort of an open interpretation. While we know that Billy and Stu are directly involved with the murders, we don't know who specifically kills who. Sometimes, I'm really in the mood to do a little detective work and figure out all the little mysteries along the way. However, in the case of Scream, I really did not feel like going to great strides to decide which psychopath killed who. At the end of the mystery movie, I feel like there shouldn't be room for discussion. A mystery is all about two things; the evidence and the perpetrator. Therefore, I think it's only fair to present the audience with a dry, clear cut ending. At least then they can properly judge the storyline and the way the clues were presented all along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original classic horror/slasher flick from the 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty thrilling slasher movie, that was a big hit in the 90's. And for the most part I can understand why, the movie isn't like other slasher at that time. And adds a lot of quick exchange of dialogue and the direction was more entertaining than watching just one person die after another. Well it does happen, but it adds elements that make it more entertaining to watch. Which makes Ghostface, one of the new slasher icon of the 90's. Yeah the characters in this movie is pretty stupid for the most part and the character actions don't make much sense sometimes. So basically this movie has slasher movie elements, but the movie makes references to those slasher movies and adds other sharp elements sometimes. And even if the movies comes off as a bit silly at times, it still has some tension and other aspects that manages to make this film from being another generic slasher flick. It will even make some audiences make them shout or think "the killer is right behind you!" and such. Another aspect I liked is how most of the characters didn't just seem like cardboard just waiting to get killed, they actually stood out for the most part. Overall this movie was pretty original for it's time for a slasher flick and doesn't rely on huge amount of blood and gore for scares or to get the audience to be entertained. One of the main flaw that stood out was how it bashes on other past horror flicks and insulting characters from those movies, but the movie itself has similar flaws. Despite that it's still a pretty darn good popcorn flick with friends or even with a date.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream deserves a second look, fifteen years on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who remember the release of Scream will undoubtedly remember it as something of a genre revolution. For a period, teenagers sneaked into cinemas all over the world to scream and giggle; sleepovers full of teenage girls had never been so afraid and no one answered the phone when they were in the house alone. For those unfamiliar with the premise, Scream tells the story of Sidney Prescott, whose mother was brutally murdered a year earlier and now a ghost-masked serial killer is tormenting her with phone calls, movie trivia and a series of bloody murders. The fictional town of Woodsboro is in a panic. Who is the masked serial killer? Can hot-shot reporter Gale Weathers solve the crime and win her Emmy with the help of the sweet but dim Deputy Dewey? The plot is as basic as they come but what sets this film apart is Scream's borderline satirical awareness of the genre allowing it to play homage to all the great slasher films of the past while bursting the door wide open for a new wave of slice n' dice murderous mayhem in cinema.Scream follows the same basic conventions of a slasher film but with a knowing smile. These kids are well-versed in movie terminology and the sagely nerd Randy explains the conventions of the horror genre. Rule #1: You can't have sex, since only virgins can outsmart the killer in the end; Rule #2: You can't drink or do drugs, since like rule #1, they are sins. Rule #3: Don't ever say "I'll be right back." Needless to say, Randy's rules are fairly accurate and allow the audience a tantalising prediction of who's going to die.Scream stands out, not only because of its tongue-in-cheek genre-bending but also because it is damn scary! The scares come hard and fast, starting with the classic Drew Barrymore opening sequence. There is something untrustworthy about Scream's "the rules are there are no rules" cavalier attitude towards scares that keeps the audiences feeling uncomfortable for the entire film. You think you know where the jumps are coming, but since you also know that they are playing with expectations, you can never quite trust the rules you think you know. Another unique element of Scream is the self-aware nature of these teenagers. Kevin Williamson would go on to create an entire generation of over-thinking, verbose teenagers with his TV show Dawson's Creek and it's clear to see his pattern emerging here. The cast and characters are equally colourful and much of Scream's power is wielded in the energy and likability of the young cast. Unlike the teenagers in previous horror films, these kids were not so interested in sex and drugs that they are oblivious to the fact that they are being picked off one by one. These teens are well aware of horror movie clichés. They know what is expected of them and know how to avoid being killed. As the panic spreads, they look to the movies to figure out how to survive. Also, when the films killers are finally revealed it is their disturbing relationship to the horror genre that has inspired them. But they are quick to dismiss that horror movies actually make people commit murder, they just help them come up with interesting ways to do it; "movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative". Williamson was unafraid to create two sides to the "video nasties" argument, giving the audience something meaty to mull over after the movie ended, if they were so inclined.Scream was a gigantic success both critically and financially and so it sparked a new wave in teen horror, many of which were pretty terrible. There were even two sequels to Scream, the first of which was a winking discussion of the rules of the sequel. It was reasonably clever but not as good as the first (but then again, isn't that the rule about sequels?). Scream 3 however was an absolute disaster, hated by pretty much everyone and especially infuriating because its twist ending managed to ruin elements of the original film. Scream 4 is a dissection, fifteen years on, of the effect of the original film on horror films and how the genre has moved on, with particular attention paid to the Blair Witch inspired tendency of horror films to be based on supposed "found footage". Whether or not the fourth film manages to become a worthy addition to the franchise, it gives us the perfect opportunity to reflect on the original Scream film and to appreciate it for its sense of humour, its cinematic wisdom, it's uniquely postmodern concept (this is a concept that could only be used once, any followers were mere copycats), and it's ability to scare the crap out of audiences all over the world, even the most seasoned horror buff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witty, unique, hip, Craven's "Scream" is loud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** out of (****)Oh "Scream". What's there more to say? This was the granddaddy slasher of the 90's, and reasonably so. With witty dialogue, a slick atmosphere, and a nice line drawn between horror and self-parody, "Scream" resonates. The kills? This is the goriest of the trilogy. We get dismemberment, disembowelment, and tons of red fluids. Don't be fooled though. This film isn't competing for the most blood used in a film. Craven builds up suspense pretty nicely with a dark, sinister tone, unnerving music, and a few glimpses of the killer himself here and there. Strip away the profanity and gore, and "Scream" would still be a strong production.Not to mention the script is where it's at. The dialogue is cutting edge material, sprinkling in some welcome humor and sharp one liners. The performances are solid. Nobody here is trying to win the Academy Awards, yet everyone here is doing their job. And for once we don't have "Friday the 13th part 38". This is a unique film that stands on its own two feet. What I thought was pretty neat was how it references slashers that came out nearly a decade before. That's just an added bonus for horror fans.All in all, "Scream" isn't a film that I loved, but it resonates with me, and I found myself to still enjoy it. The dialogue, the characters, the story. It's all there. Witty, unique, hip, Craven's "Scream" is loud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still holds up on it's wit and scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to point out that the version of Scream I watched was the "Director's Cut" of the film. To my knowledge, it hasn't been released on DVD to this date. I bought it at Comic Con about a year ago for $5 since I bought a complete series of a show that was around $30. I got $10 off. Some would like to know what the differences are from the theatrical cut to the director's cut. Thanks to the DVD cover that says what the film has different from the original I can say.Here is what it says word for word; "The Director's Cut version includes additional GORE!! Close up of Steve's intestines as they fall from his stomach. Casey as she hangs from the tree at normal speed. Longer scene of Tatum's head being crushed by the garage door. Kenny looking up at the killer after his throat is cut. Billy going berserk as he stabs Stuart. Stuart's hand dripping blood into a puddle (after the double stab)." I wouldn't go nuts looking for the a bootleg copy on Ebay or iOffer. The director's cut maintains the same one hundred and eleven minute runtime and the shots are quick seconds shots that are hardly noticeable. Though I will say the close up of the intestines was one of the many great things on the disc.But what can you say about Scream? It's one of the defining horror films of the nineties. It pokes fun at the clichés in horror films and even goes as far as almost mocking them. Director Wes Craven knew what he was doing precisely when making Scream. He wanted the characters to be extremely self aware they were in a horror film and make them reference other eighties classics.In the eighties, slasher films got their break. So many horror movies made by so many defunct companies were released at hyper speed. Literally one every weekend. Some like Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street went on to be the poster children of the genre. While others like Don't Answer the Phone, Happy Birthday to Me, and Maniac chilled on the sidelines to get recognized years later by cult fans of the genre.I'm not going to take time explaining the plot because I feel it's unnecessary. Many have seen it and a synopsis isn't really vital. I have a lot to say about this and don't need to extend a review with a plot most people would know. Is that okay? Scream now or forever hold your pieces.Scream knows when to be scary and went to be witty. Frequent references to Friday the 13th, Halloween, and A Nightmare on Elm Street (another Craven film) are made sporadically. The references never feel forced and are easy to catch.Once more the film followed with sequels which makes some sort of sense. The film runs for only an hour and fifty one minutes. There is so much more that could be incorporated. Wes Craven went on direct all three (and the upcoming forth film) so decreasing in quality doesn't sound like something that will happen. I hope not at least.Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and Matthew Lillard are all great and it's no doubt why this film sort of formed all of their great careers. It's a thrill that Campbell, Arquette, and Cox will be returning in Scream 4 making me sort of an easy sale.I look forward to watching the sequels at the same time I'm not. I sort of know I'll like them, but they will most likely lack in quality when compared to the first film. It hit hard when it first came out. Lets hope the sequels continue to refresh and keep the formula alive.Starring: Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Roger L. Jackson, and Drew Barrymore. Directed by: Wes Craven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie Scream was pretty much a surprise when I first saw it. I was waiting for some stupid horror movie like those ones seen everywhere and I was wrong.The whole movie concentrates on parody and irony, its more than just a horror movie its comedy. If you have seen those older "same plot same stuff" movies maybe you can adapt to the Scream itself.Great plot, seems sometimes like trying to be a scary movie but no, there are lots of funny things for a horror fan if you are recalling them but also there's parts that are little nasty for younger viewers.I recommend this first one to all horror movie freaks if you wanna get some beer and get some kicks with the parts that you realize "lol it was from movie blah-blah" :)Plot really is great but it have been built on older ones and can't be taken too seriously, It made me laugh. Beginning was little more scarier than rest of the movie.Still not for little kids some guys take this movie too seriously.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The updated teen-slasher movie that laughed at the genre while at the same time helped usher in a new generation of sleek horror films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scream" is a horror film that is a modern day horror movie that is terrifying roller-coaster ride of murder and black-hearted laughter. The director, Wes Craven, presents almost a reboot on the teen-slasher movies that were made popular in the 70s and 80s (such as "Halloween", "Friday the 13th", or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"). There are classic elements present within the film that give the audience a fright while at the same time address many clichés found within the horror genre.As portrayed in a great many horror movies, specifically teen-slasher movies, there is a surface theme of lost innocence. The protagonist, typically a woman, is pitted against a monstrously twisted (metaphorically or literally) antagonist that wants her dead, and her friends, and her family, and any pets. The protagonist has to quickly go from meek teenager into a mature woman in full survival mode if she wants to stay alive to see the credits roll.Sidney Prescott, portrayed by Neve Campbell, is our leading heroine whose friends and family fall victim to a serial killer who shows an affinity to horror movies. Her troupe of friends include: boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich), best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan), along with friends Stuart (Matthew Lillard) and Randy (Jamie Kennedy). Along with a well rounded support cast the plot of the film revolves around Sidney as the killer begins to slaughter those around her, with Sidney being the final prize.The antagonist in "Scream" is a serial killer that uses a common grocery store Halloween costume to mask his identity. This concealed identity provides the major engine for the plot to move forward, keeping the audience guessing as to who the real killer might be. It also provides the core theme presented in this film, trust. Specifically, when everyone around you could be a killer, who do you trust? This simple costume gives the film its menacing face, with "ghost face" becoming the symbolic and iconic face of this film's franchise.Early scenes in the film showcase the themes of trust and lost innocence. One scene in particular early on in the film between Sidney and Billy highlights the aforementioned themes. Sidney is emotionally charged having just survived her first brush with the killer when Billy crawls in through her window, seemingly to her rescue. Clever use of dialogue, props (a cell phone), and coincidence presents the audience, and Sidney, with the question of whether or not Billy is her savior or downfall. The scene presents Sidney's loss of innocence by having just survived her would be murderer, having to deal with the repercussions of that alone, along with a boyfriend whose questionable arrival time in the scene leaves her wondering if he could be the killer.On the classic 1 to 10 scale, I would give this movie a 10. "Scream" is a sleek and modern take on the old teen-slasher movies, and horror in general. The clever dialogue addressing the genre within the movie, the well shot scenes, and iconic killer make this film the ultimate horror movie of the 90s.</fullReview>

From the terrifying opening sequence to the shocking twist ending, the movie was brilliant from start to finish. Unlike most horror movies, this had good acting from it's strong cast, especially from Drew Barrymore and Neve Campbell. Jaime Kennedy, David Arquette and Mathew Lillard were all hilarious in their roles. A lot of people give this movie flack because it brought in a lot of bad horror movies like Urban Legend and Valentine, but I thought this movie was really well made and at times pretty scary. Scream 2 was also pretty good, and in some ways even a bit better. Scream 3, however, wasn't very good. It had it's moments, but it just didn't work. If your looking for a fun and smart thriller, watch Scream. It's funny, well acted, scary and very original. The first twelve minutes are a Scream!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The King of 'Slasher' Movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the horror genre, and where Halloween reinvented the Slasher genre back in 1978, Scream reinvented it again in 1996. Scream is the best teen slasher film of the last two decades, and nothing will probably beat it. It is so entertaining, fun, gory, and just really great. It pays homage to other slashers, but it also makes fun of itself. There are so many scenes where the characters are talking about being in a horror film, and the 'rules' to survive in it and who the suspects are. There is a particular scene where Randy is saying that Billy is the killer, and I just love it because everything he says turns out to be true. The film plays with us, and the first time I saw it, I was completely shocked to know who the killer(s) was. Not because I thought it was original, but because the execution of it was. The killer was the first one suspected of doing the murders, but gets off the hook, and he turns out to be the one. The irony of it all makes it so great. In that form, Scream is very original. It also has some very good acting, for a slasher film of the 90's especially. Also, Rose McGowan's garage death is also one of the most memorable death scenes in a horror film ever. I am sure Scream will stay as popular as it is now, and even more iconic. I think it is Wes Craven's Masterpiece, and doubt anything will ever come close to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as textbook as the lengthy speech about horror clichés would have you believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the running joke throughout this film about how predictable and formulaic horror films are, this modest little thriller gave the genre a much-needed shot in the arm in the mid-90's. Though it would spawn scores of mediocre imitators, and eventually open the door for the dreadful "torture porn" phenomenon a decade later, we can hardly blame Scream for the untalented auteurs who attempted to follow in its footsteps. Taken on its own, and not considering the largely unnecessary sequels that followed, Scream is aging extremely well, and remains a solid, classy, and dense thriller that works on multiple levels.Scream delivers actual scares, humor that doesn't detract from the horror elements, and a twist ending that I defy anyone to honestly claim they saw coming when they first saw it. The script is sharp-witted and sharp-fanged, balancing the base horror components with a sophistication that one doesn't find in too many teen-targeting genre offerings. Additionally, the film functions as an homage to horror itself, deftly lampooning and referencing key moments from many genre classics while simultaneously out-performing most of the films it references.The cast is a superb ensemble, and even actors like Jamie Kennedy and David Arquette, who are responsible between them for some of the most idiotic and useless films of all time, shine with this material. It's a testament to the strength of the writing that even the most annoying actors to ever soil a screen are genuinely likable here.Surely, some of the best horror films of all time employ a full-throttle assault of terror, and this approach is largely the most effective way of presenting the genre. But Scream succeeds simply because it's such a fun movie to watch. By presenting this film as somewhat of a goofy teen romp (even though it's not all that goofy), the film-makers keep the viewer off-guard through much of the proceedings, and the air of satire the film never leaves behind gives the genuine scares that much more impact.Of course, most people who only know the film peripherally will undoubtedly remember Scream as "the one with the rules in it". Anyone who doesn't immediately tear holes through the logic presented in this famous monologue clearly hasn't seen many horror films, but it remains a great bit, especially since Scream, itself, so stridently defies many of the most harrowing clichés in the genre. My favorite touch: until Scream, never had a killer routinely endured so much abuse at the hands of their intended victims. The ghost-masked assassin here literally gets the crap kicked out of them in every scene they're in, and even though we know we're watching a film that obviously isn't trying to take itself too seriously, this note of realism adds a great dimension to the happenings. Our victims-to-be fighting back enhances the tension in each death scene, and the film presents polished and exciting sequences that are ultimately much more memorable than the rote stalk-and-kill we usually get in the less imaginative offerings of splatter's hallowed past.This film was highly original when it came out, and none of its imitators have even come close to matching the magical combination of non-formula elements that make Scream so special. We'll see how this film is regarded once it's further relegated to horror's history, but its hard not to notice that this film was pivotal in changing the genre's climate in the same way that Nirvana's Nevermind changed the landscape of popular rock music a few years before. I'm certainly not directly comparing these two works, but in terms of impact, it's safe to say that the analogy applies here. And, ultimately, if Scream is the Nevermind of scary movies, that's not all that bad a distinction to have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is one of the greatest movies of all time, even though it didn't have much of a plot. I just enjoy all the laughs and chills you could get watching this movie. This movie is highly entertaining and in my opinion will never get old. It's funny to notice that the MPAA rating consists of strong graphic horror violence and gore when the movie itself isn't really that violent. But, for that time I could see it being one of the most violent movies of its time. It's just cool to see how special effects have changed over time and movies now are so violent that they take away the point of the movie. Scream is a perfect movie when you're in the mood to be entertained. No one needs all the blood and guts that come from movies like "Hostel" and "Saw", even "Final Destination 3" was a little too violent. This movie will remain in fame for ever.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time you watch Scream, you'll be scared to the death from its suspense, phone calls, blood and twists. It surely is one hell of an experience watching it the first time, easily one of the most successful horror's of the 90s. After a second, third, fourth or even fifth viewing it doesn't have the same feeling that it did the first time. You know the twist, the ending, what's going to happen. Similar to Saw in it's own way, it still provides entertainment but not that scariness and thrills it did from the first viewing. No doubt it created a modern horror icon and was directed by a living horror legend "Wes Craven" (Nightmare on Elm Street). A very suspenseful horror loaded with plenty of violence, a twist and the typical but executed well elements. All in, a great horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third Time's The "Harm"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 1996, horror films were at a low-ebb again in terms of originality and the number released in theaters. But as this always happens every few decades or so, a young hotshot director and/or writer shows up with something that shakes things up again, if only temporarily.However, in this case the "young upstart" was actually an old hand at the game. Wes Craven had "rebooted" the genre twice before, with the uncompromising LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, and then again with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. And how would he launch a new trend in horror? By tapping the talents of a then sizzling-hot 'new' writer named Kevin Williamson, the creative force behind the hit teen dramedy DAWSON'S CREEK.What made the first installment of SCREAM so unique, is that it took all the conventional rules of horror that an entire generation had learned by seeing "FRIDAY THE 13th", HALLOWEEN and Craven's own ELM STREET series on home video, and gave them a playful, self-referential tweak. And the twist started with an opening sequence that horror fans are still talking about to this day.Hitchcock stunned the movie world back in the Sixties, by killing off his lead heroine halfway through the classic PSYCHO. Craven and Williamson took his established rule and ran with it, going the Master one better...by killing off the 'heroine' in the FIRST TEN MINUTES!If it had been some bit player from a soap or a sitcom, the scene wouldn't have made much of an impact. But it's DREW BARRYMORE, an immediately recognizable face playing the doomed Casey Becker, who learns the hard way not to play 'Horror Movie Trivial Pursuit' on the phone with a knife-wielding psychopath...especially if your answers are WRONG!The audience is then thrust into a slasherific whoddunit as a group of Casey's classmates, all relatively unknown actors at the time, try to figure out who's doing the killing...and who may be next, all the time aware that they are in their own "real-life" horror movie, where the killer knows the rules as well as they do.And as if to underscore the irony, there are several prominent cameos that are a nostalgia and/or trivia lover's dream, from Linda Blair and Henry Winkler, to Joseph Whipp (who sort of reprises his brief role in ELM STREET) to the director himself (look closely).It was a surprising and engaging way to "freshen up" time-tested horror conventions, and even now, ten years later, it still holds up pretty well. Only many of the actors have moved on to become bigger stars (Neve Campbell, Rose McGowan, Courteney Cox-Arquette, husband David Arquette, Liev Schreiber) or major players in Tinseltown as well, (Drew Barrymore, Jamie Kennedy).The brilliant scenario dreamed up by Williamson and Craven then is something of a cliché now, (with the satire parodied again in the SCARY MOVIE franchise), which somewhat explains the current lean of Hollyweird towards remaking classics and B-movies alike. Nothing this original would really surface again until a few bright sparks burst on the horizon, like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT or Lucky McKee's challenging MAY. Which brings us to where we are now.Pop in a copy of SCREAM today, and enjoy your ride "back to the future" of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smart, effective, horror film that mixes well with comedy and satire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When two teenagers (Drew Barrymore and Kevin Patrick Walls) were killed by a mysterious stranger. Which this killer murder them by not answering the horror trivia rightfully. Now other teenagers (Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Jamie Kennedy, Matthew Lillard and Rose McGowan) find themselves in danger as well. The only people that might stop the killer is a dopey police deputy (David Arquette) and a sleazy female reporter (Courtney Cox) before it's too late.Directed by Wes Craven (Music of the Heart, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Red Eye) made an intriguing, suspenseful, horror comedy satire. Which Craven certainly knows his way with horror movies without making it too jokey. Then first-time screenwriter Kevin Williamson (Scream 2, The Faculty, I Know What You Did Last Summer) wrote an first-rate script. His characters are well-written, he writes some creative plot turns and there's humour throughout his script. Although it received some controversial moments, when Craven and the studio were forced to cut out some graphic violence to get an R-Rating.The original DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an refreshing audio commentary by the director and the screenwriter (Who was an hot screenwriter back in the mid 1990's). DVD also has the original theatrical trailer. "Scream" was the first major blockbuster for director:Craven. Since most of his films were sleepers at the box office or they went on to have an cult following. Although "Scream" and the sequels has dated a bit and all the conclusions of the three movies were a bit too over-the-top. Still "Scream" went on to be a classic with horror fans and some major film critics as well. But my favorite of the three movies is "Scream 2", which i think it's superior but that's my opinion. If you haven't seen this 90's classic, don't miss it. Look quickly for Linda Blair in a cameo and an uncredited Henry Winkler in a small supporting role. Panavision. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror like no other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is a horror movie like no other. Of the long-standing crop of teen horror movies, this is a real standout as it is a film which, to quote a UK advertising slogan, does what it says on the tin. It makes you scream, as I found when me, my dad and my sister, who love these movies, watched this one. At one point, my sister ran across the room screaming. As for the film itself, Neve Campbell emerges as the star of the show. As Sidney Prescott, she captures the character's sense of fear perfectly. Courteney Cox is also great whereas David Arquette is well, David Arquette. Where Scream succeeds is the way it turns every horror cliché on its head. You know who the killer but you don't know they have an accomplice. The numerous pop culture references are also great including the references to different horror movies - wouldn't it have been ironic for there to be a reference to Miramax's first major feature, The Burning? Anyway, this is a great horror movie which makes you wish that Scream 3 was an afterthought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, "Scream" is in fact a good movie, but is that really why it was so successful? I mean I'm pretty sure not even half of the audience picked up that this was supposed to be a satire of a bunch of movies they never saw. Really all they fell for was the old slasher formula, slightly updated. Hell it's not a bad formula. As a scary movie this doesn't work, since the killer is not menacing at all so there never seems to be any danger. Because there are just some characters that are not supposed to die, the killer at times becomes unrealistically weak or dumb, and that's something I could have gone without. But it's just so brilliant to have these people waking up in their own slasher movie having to follow a bunch of movie rules to survive, I could appreciate that. This is probably the nerdiest movie to ever make 100 million dollars. And also it's just good entertainment, does that garage door scene ever get old? The big downside to this, obviously, was the whole new wave of slasher. There's only a number of times I can see a bunch of "Dawson's Creek"-rejects run for their lives while it's obvious who lives and who dies two minutes in. But this, I like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Craven's 1996 film "Scream" is deserving of its reputation. It manages to be tense, suspenseful, and still an occasionally hilarious parody of horror clichés. Kevin Williamson obviously not a great writer and he doesn't need to be when the movie depends on making fun of horror clichés, allowing Williamson an excuse to use dozens during the straightforward horror scenes. The cast is generally solid but only the gorgeous Rose McGowan and Neve Campbell stand out as having any real skill, with McGowan surprisingly effective at playing a stereotypical and obvious role. The kills are creative and Wes Craven directs the film quite well resulting in a clever and fun little horror/comedy flick.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is the best horror of the 90's, absolutely. It's a great, on purpose predictable movie with great actors. It's really a typical slasher movie, with a typical psychopatic killer and typical teen victims. The differences made between other slashers, like "I Know what you did Last Summer", "Nightmare on Elm Street", "Friday the 13th", "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" and all their sequels, is that the victims KNOW what they must do to survive a horror, they KNOW what they mustn't do/say/feel, but even THEN get slaughtered.I think this movie is both a great comedy and horror, it's not a horror which gives you nightmares, but it shocks you out of your chair sometimes. I give it 10 stars for the comedy and 10 for the horror!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best slasher film in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The slasher film sub-genre of the late 70s to late 80s had totally exhausted itself and so it was time for a break. Sure once in a while we'd get a new one like 1993's 'Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday' and 1995's 'Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers,' but for the most part new trends in horror took over for a while. That was until December of 1996 when collaborators Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson unleashed the simply titled 'Scream' on the unsuspecting public. But this was different than other slasher films. It has all the same conventions, but it also pokes fun at them at the same time. So thankfully this isn't just another by-the-numbers effort; it's oh so much more than that.Pros: One of the scariest and most exciting openings in a horror film ever. A really clever concept. Strong performances from a then mostly unknown cast. Moves at a breakneck pace. A great sense of humor. Plenty of great nods to classic horror films, including a couple cameos. A pretty good score and soundtrack. A truly threatening killer. Plenty blood and gobs of gore to make horror buffs happy.Cons: Runs out of a steam a bit towards the end.Final thoughts: Thanks to the excess of horror films in the 80s the genre died a little by the early 90s. Thanks to this unforeseen gem it was hot again. Though maybe not as terrifying as some of the films it pays tribute to, it's still an exciting and suspenseful modern slasher film.My rating: 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scream" remains one of the smartest and most entertaining teen slasher films ever. Why? Well, of course there's the actors. Neve Campbell definitely gives Jamie Lee Curtis a run for her money as the Reigning Teem Scream Queen. She makes the lead character, Sidney Prescott, all at once strong, smart, and vulnerable. Besides Sidney, there's ruthless and ambitious reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox); dopey but lovable cop Dewey (David Arquette); Sidney's feisty and funny best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan); Sidney's brooding boyfriend Billy and his wisecracking friend Stu (Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard); and movie-obsessed geek Randy (Jamie Kennedy). All the characters are distinctive and well-acted, and it really is an ensemble film.However, it is the writing by Kevin Williamson that makes "Scream" truly special. As Billy states to Sidney at one point, "It's all one big movie. You just can't pick your genre". The film stays true to this quote. Unlike other slasher films full of clueless teens, the characters in "Scream" know they're in a movie. And if they don't, they sure do know a lot about them. The script contains several humorous, pop culture references to movies (many of them being horror films). The film takes pleasure in poking fun and deconstructing many horror movie standards and clichés. "Scream" is still a horror movie itself and often implies a few of these so-called rules. But they are often done in an ironic and inventive way. The death scenes are creative, the characters are actually smart and know how to fight back, and the plot twists are effectively surprising. Actually, it would be safe to say that "Scream" is not so much of a horror movie, but a mystery movie with blood and violence. Unlike Freddy, Michael, and Jason, the killer is never given an identity until the climax of the film. "Everyone is a suspect!" Randy proclaims. At different points in the movie, every character does come under questioning. Is it Billy, Sid's dark and angst-ridden boyfriend? Did Randy see one too many movies and snap? Or is Gale doing all of this to get another story? Anything can happen, and the final reveal is very unexpected."Scream" is amazingly entertaining and suspenseful on the first viewing. And the great thing is it remains fresh and continues to keep you on your seat every time you watch it. Afterwards, many teen slasher copycats like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Urban Legends" were made, and two more films in the "Scream" series, but none of them are like the original "Scream".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a wonder what going into a movie with no expectations will do for you. This is the much lauded Scream, the so-called "smash hit that transformed horror into a phenomenon" (an obvious lie, but whatever), and I don't think it's half bad at all. This is of course, ridiculously deplorable and deporably ridiculous, but it knows it is, and it is very, very entertaining while being such.Scream takes its cues from Halloween, Friday the 13th and its three sequels, and it doesn't hide that fact, even playing Halloween on screen in the movie - allowing for a rather humorous twist towards the end, heh. This pretty much follows the blueprint of all the cheesy 80s splatter/serial killer movies there ever were, but it doesn't screw up.There's little here that you haven't seen already if you love these dumb 80s slashers, but if that is the case, then what's one more to add to the pile? Scream may be stupid, but it isn't a bad movie at all. Recommended.</fullReview>

The sequels aren't nearly as good as this movie is but it is a very good film especially for people who like moments of dark comedy and big fans of horror movies who know a lot about horror movies because they will appreciate the way this film is playing with the conventions of the horror/slasher genre.

		<fullReview>After a period of endless slasher flicks, body-count films or "date movies" in the 80's, following the success of John Carpenter's classic(which really isn't that much of one, there's hardly any blood), Halloween, of 1978(which I'm not claiming to be the first of its kind, I've heard of Black Christmas, which is said to also fit as such a film) the genre died out somewhat. With Scream, it was rejuvenated somewhat(at least for a few years), whether that was the intent or not. Love or hate that it had that effect... a respectful parody is such a rarity that it really ought to be commended, even if one doesn't care for the genre(which is not to say that I don't, I may have only seen a few of the older ones, but I do seek out these films). This is half-way a parody of aforementioned sub-genre of horror, and equal parts an entry into it. The clichés are all here, intentionally so, and the film manages to entertain with both halves, and these mesh remarkably and admirably well. The nods, both the obvious and the subtle ones, are all good. The casting is impeccable. The music, both the score and the songs used, all top-notch. The acting is spot-on. The direction is excellent... character introduction, building of suspense, plot exposition and development, high marks, all the way. The script is well-done. The gore isn't as bad as it could be, not sure I'd really call it excessive, but the amount of blood is massive(necessary for the spoofing). I've yet to see a recent movie of this kind which surpasses this one. Now, I'm surely not the first to point this out, but... why, exactly, were two full-on spoofs done after this, mainly using this for inspiration? Never mind that neither are that good, and that that they hold no respect of the films they make fun of, but why do a send-up of a parody? Wayans', come on, you can do... uh... well, still, don't do it again. "Shriek" team... well, you guys I don't know. But I digress. Frequently. I recommend this to any fan of parodies, horror films, and this particular kind of, well, both. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Scream' is a great movie. Yes, it did resurrect the 'teen slasher' genre, which isn't exactly perfect, even though I love the slasher movie genre, most people don't. Now, the plot seems simple enough, a masked killer is stalking, then sadistically killing teens in a town called Woodsborro. Now, it seems like an ordinary slasher movie, but the twist is, these 'victims' are fans of horror movies, they grew up watching them, and are basically self-aware. I won't spoil much, but the scariest parts are the beginning and the end, it's spectacular. The characters are actually Likable which is a must for good slasher movies. Now, for content, the movie is EXTREMELY bloody, in particular the beginning (w/ Drew Barrymore) and the end. Also, the language is pretty bad, with many bad language, such as f-bomb, sh**, and other unmentionables.I recommend everyone watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done, but it doesn't work like it's supposed to</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that this movie not only caused a resurgence in slasher movies, it completely changed the way they work. For a movie to do that, it has to be very good, and I applaud "Scream" for its ability to do so (though I'm getting kind of tired of the style it created for a few reasons which I will list here)."Scream" is your standard slasher movie, albeit with a few major differences. First and foremost, it is a curious mix of scares and comedy, which I will get to later. Second, unlike most slasher movies, it's pretty smart. The characters do dumb things, but they talk smart, and the fact that they still do dumb things makes it pretty funny sometimes. Finally, it's well done. It all seems very fresh and nothing is sloppy or hammed up. Very welcoming.The plot is standard, but given the purpose of the movie, that's what it should be. It's a slasher movie that pokes fun at itself and the earlier entries into the genre, so it's only natural that it takes this route. Basically, a costumed psychopath is stalking and brutally murdering local teenagers (after they drink or have sex, and/or do stupid things...again, part of the joke). But it centers around one local teen, Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who is of course, not without a dark past.That's pretty much it. Sound familiar? It should. Again, that's the point. But what rises it above the level (significantly) is that it knows what it's doing, and isn't trying to hide it (therefore not assuming its target audience is dumber than the characters that inhabit the worst entries into the genre). The characters are actually pretty intelligent (thanks to the smart script and the solid acting across the board), and even know the rules of the slasher movies, and of course the people who laugh at the warnings die gruesome deaths by making the mistakes that they were warned about (again, it's being funny and scary at the same time).Now about that purpose I was talking about, the fact that it's aiming for both laughs and scares, sometimes at the same time. It's certainly ambitious, which is rare for a big studio, and unheard of for a horror movie, especially a slasher movie. However, I have to admit, it doesn't work like it's supposed to. The laughs dilute the scares for the most part (though there are a good few creepy moments). The beginning scene with Drew Barrymore, is excellent, though not very scary. Still, it's commendable for how well it's done. I admit that I didn't see the final twist coming, which is kind of surprising (and probably should be rather embarrassing) since it was probably meant to lampoon the feeble attempts of the same obligatory task that was made by its predecessors. Then again, movies like "Scream" are typically not my kind of movie. But it's a modern classic of sorts (as close to it as a mainstream movie will come), so I had to check it out.While it doesn't work like it's supposed to, that doesn't mean it's a waste of time, not by a long shot. "Scream" may not be the best horror movie, but it's undeniably engaging, and never boring. I was always involved in the movie, and its interesting tone helps a lot. It's a fun movie, in a way, but it still manages to be pretty dark and grim. The recognition for that goes to Wes Craven, rightly known as one of the masters of the genre. He puts a lot of effort into the movie, and it shows. His goal is clearly not to have the most brutal deaths and the most sex, booze and gore he can cram into a single movie (though there are significant amounts of all of them and then some). He loves what he's doing, and wants to make it the best he can, and for his part, he does the best that can be done with the material. The new mixture of laughs and scares not working is not his fault, it's the concept that doesn't work. That statement is proved by all the future horror flicks that try to use the same method, which has long worn out it's welcome (even though it never really came).The acting isn't that important, as it's not that kind of movie (slasher movies aren't supposed to be). That said, all the acting is believable, and serves the film's purpose solidly.Writer Kevin Williamson is clearly very talented, especially since this was his first script. He is an idea man (something that is almost extinct in mainstream Hollywood), and he has about as much know-how and as strong of a love for the slasher movie as Craven himself.Speaking of, Wes Craven deserves most of the credit for pulling this movie together. Again, this movie doesn't quite work like the filmmakers had perhaps hoped, but it could have been a complete mess. Applause goes to Craven for preventing that. Actually, he makes it work well enough that almost none of the horror movies these days aim for just scares, which is kind of a shame now, because after 11 years, I kind of miss those movies.Do I recommend it? Sure, just know what you're going into. If you're going into it expecting a pure scarefest like "Halloween," you're probably going to be disappointed because that's not what "Scream" offers. It's a slasher movie that offers a commentary on itself. Now that's something you don't see every day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is the best horror movie ever made.Because this movie i like other horror movies.But this one is the best.Who's not agree with me is a stupid idiot.I love this and both sequels i have all three of them on tape and i never complain about this.One of the best movie,i like character Sidney Prescott and her friends,boyfriend Billy,friends Randy and Stuart,the deputy sheriff Dewey and reporter Gale Weathers were great.Great story and great soundtracks.I watch this movie thirty times and is still the best,better then Friday the 13 or Halloween they are both bullshit and they still filming this movies but scream are ending in the third.I can say they don't doing movies like this anymore.The Story begins after two high school students are murder by the serial killer Sidney Prascott become next victim of intelligent serial killer,Gale Weathers reporter and journalist is shore that serial killer is the some who murder Sidney mother one year ago and he's now terrorize her,deputy sheriff Dewey won't to investigate the murders hem'self but attractive Gale seduced and confused hem,so it's up to Sidney to find the killer before he kills again to find the truth,she will must to kill.Scream was the best movie when i saw hem years.Horror movie about the two high school student who kills like in the movie i love the ending where Sidney fought with Billy and Stuart and their plan and the game it was the best.I love both the sequels but they were no't good like the first.My opinion is the part one the best,part two good,part three the worst.The second sequel was the good little different but it looks like the same the first movie,first the name of the town was Windsor like in the first movie Woodsboro,then the victims were killed whit the beginning's names and surnames like in the first movie then was a copy killer on the end were like two killer but one won't get away other won't to be caught but was good movie i don't like third movie because was different than than first two but was great.Scream deserve legendary status too bad they don't do the forth installment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Non stop edge of seat thrill ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was initially quite sceptical about this movie. The image of a masked killer hunting down screaming teenagers as they run through their parents mansions trying escape just didn't appeal to me. However, from the moment Drew Barrymore picked up the phone in that incredible intro I was hooked. The pace and intensity so obvious in the opening is maintained throughout the entire film, which is due to Craven's excellent direction and of course Williamson's fantastic script. But the film also has another dimension for the more experienced horror film lover, it knowingly mocks past horror films in a very 90s this-is-so-lame-but-I-am-aware-of-that sort of way. Old clichés seen throughout the genre are repeated here, tongue firmly in cheek. In all, this film is entertaining from start to finish and I would recommend it to anyone, horror film enthusiast or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw the preview of Scream, the only reason why I wanted to see it was because of Drew Barrymore. I then found out it also starred Courtney Cox, I was a big fan of her from Friends but it still gave me no reason to watch it. I only wanted to see it because Drew Barrymore.By the end of watching the film, I was amazed. It was probably the best horror movie since Halloween. The plot is great, the acting is great. David Arquette is the lead part who in my opinion does a great job in doing so. Courtney Cox was not the main character but was in it for most of the film. If they ever made such a thing as the Horror Film Awards, Courtney Cox would probably win Best Supporting Actress.It's also a refreshing movie because it broke away from all other horror movies. Now adays, movies like "Nightmare on Elm Street" and "House on Haunted Hill" are always the same storyline. People enter a haunted house and they all get killed, yes they're good movies but the plot is always the same thing and what Scream did was made a different storyline which is fantastic and I thing that's what made it great.The cast is also young and hip. I'm sick and tired of seeing people in their 30s and 40s dominating the horror screen. I mean before Scream, they never made a horror movie with teens in! Overall an excellent movie and I strongly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self-Reflexivity in Scream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People are into this movie because they appreciate it has an endearing. This movie is, throughout, self-reflexive. This is how it can be self-deprecating in a really endearing way. It still has intrinsic scares; it is not explicitly a movie about movies?it carries the self-reflexive thing just as far as it needs to and uses it in just the right way. The most obvious example of this from the movie is when the guy lays out the rules of a horror movie and predicts what will happen next. When I think of Scream, these are the ideas immediately present in my mind: pure play in fright, the garage door scene, the archetypes, the self-reflexive attitude, epitomized by that one scene in which a character lists aloud the rules of the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Teen Slasher Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A teenage girl named Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) finds that a psycho killer is killing off her fellow classmates one bye one. Sidney is the victim to phone calls from the killer, and tries to avoid being "next" on the killer's list. While Sidney is just trying to keep her life together, a TV Reporter, Gale Weathers, (Courteney Cox) is trying to get as much out of Sidney as possible, but Sidney has harvested a bitter hatred for Gale, ever since she did reports on the brutal murder of Sidney's mother, Maureen Prescott, almost a year ago. Sidney's group of friends help her through everything, but she doesn't know anymore who to trust. Could the killer be one of her friends? Could it be Randy (Jamie Kennedy) - the movie freak? Stu (Matthew Lillard) - the oh so funny best friend of Sidney's boyfriend Billy? Billy (Skeet Ulrich) - the obvious boyfriend...too obvious? Gale - The woman Sidney despises? Tatum (Rose McGowan) - Sidney's very best friend? Dewey (David Arquette) - Tatum's brother, who's like her own? Or worst of all...Sidney's father? You'll have to watch Scream to find out. I think Scream is one of the best teen slasher movies ever made. 10/10 for me. It keeps you suspecting everyone and being as clueless as the main character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What's Your Favorite Scary Movie?" It's gonna be Wes Craven's Scream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven's film Scream is one of my favorite horror films of all time. This film came out at a time when slasher films were beginning to die out and with the success of this film, it was revived once again (sad to say with pathetic copycats). The film is about a serial killer, who loves horror movies, goes on a massive killing spree and is targeting a girl named Sidney Prescott, played by Neve Campbell, whose mother was murdered a year before. The one thing I love about this film is that it is a horror movie, but it has some comedy to it (thanks to Jamie Kennedy and Matthew Lilliard). This movie makes fun of the horror film audience and the rules you need to have to survive a scary movie. But I shouldn't say that because this film is also a good thriller with chills, thrills, and lots of horror movie gore to spare. The movie was well-done and I applaud Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson. Anyone who loves horror films can't miss this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is about a dressed up serial killer who stalks teenagers in a small town in California. I think this is Wes Craven's best film he's ever done. Nightmare on Elm Street is a great movie but intentionally, I think Scream is his best. This movie isn't really scary and is actually more funny than freaky, with a good amount of funny lines. There aren't much scary scenes besides the opening scene with Drew Barrymore and the hanging, which I thought was the freakiest part of the movie. There is a couple jumps in the film and the ending was the coolest part of the movie, revealing the killers and all. Overall, I think Scream is a classic thriller and is Wes Craven's best film to date.Hedeen's Outlook: 9/10 ***+ A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"For a film that knows so much about horror films couldn't they make this movie a bit better?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A serial killer stalks a group horror movie-obsessed teens. There is plenty of chilling telephone scenes that will excite you. The movie is fun and exciting, but far from perfect.The teenagers love horror movies. There are plenty of references to them. I remember the killer asking who the killer was in Halloween. They know that corn syrup was used for blood in Carrie. One scene talks about Jodie Foster's role in Silence of the Lambs. I even remember one of them saying "We all go a little mad sometimes," which is a famous line from Psycho.So, after all that, I thought "For a film that knows so much about horror films couldn't they make this movie a bit better?" The characters hear and see the killer, but every time they think it's a joke. None of them ever tries to kill the killer, even after they've kicked and hit him. Then, we get the same thing over and over again. Don't go alone. Don't open the car door. Don't try to escape through the doggy door. Come on! Wes Craven should have made the people more realistic, and thought "What would they do in real life?" Instead, he makes them so stupid things, which causes them to get killed.I think there were more reasons that I just can't remember. Oh well. One thing I CAN'T add is that the film is not scary, thrilling or entertaining. I enjoyed Scream. It would have been better if I didn't find myself yelling at the dumb characters, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven Has Made A Brilliant Horror/Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven (Nightmare On Elm Street and Last House On The Left) has done a great job with this horror. The horror genre became crap at around the time of the 80's. All we got were crappy rip-offs or sequel after sequel. Friday the 13th has 10 and Halloween has 8. It was about time for someone to come along and save the horror genre.The plot here isn't hard to follow at all. A killer in a ghost mask is killing of teens in Woodsboro High School. The story follows Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and her life that is practically ruined. A year ago her mother was raped and butchered and her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) is pressuring her for a better relationship. All she needs is a killer that appears to be targeting her and her friends which include Tatum (Rose McGowan), Randy (Jamie Kennedy), Stu (Matthew Lillard) and Dewey (David Arquette). Also included in the bunch is Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), a reporter who reported on Sidney's mother's death.This horror/comedy is really one of the only great horrors of the 90's. It has tried to be duplicated but never bettered. The acting is great in this, the music chilling and the directing fine. The other great thing is this doesn't take itself seriously. This is a parody of the horror movies in the 70's and 80's. It has typical clichéd situations and many horror fans will recognise references to Halloween, NOES, Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.The movie is filled with plenty of scares, especially the first 12 minutes, and is filled with plenty of gore. The climax is well played out and the killers identities are unexpected.4?/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings Fun To The Teen Slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while a movie breaks the mold and redefines a genre, Scream is one such movie.This isn't going to teach you anything new about life, broaden your horizons, or appeal to those of you looking for such. The movie is titled, "Scream," and if you think you're getting something other than a teen slasher, you're mistaken. This movie doesn't save the planet, it's only there to entertain, which it does better than any other horror film you'll see. No, it isn't the most frightening movie ever made, just the most fun. If you want terrifying slasher, go with the original "Halloween." Scream keeps all the tenets of the slasher genre: teens, serial killer on the loose, killer is unknown, killer has a unique look, and all the characters are stereotypes. On a deeper level, the genre is really about the dangers (really sin) of girls losing their virginity before marriage, where the slasher is a metaphor and symbolism abounds. But don't worry, Scream doesn't take itself seriously, it's postmodern fun. Scream stays true to the genre but is able to maintain a comedic element while all the time keeping you in suspense.The cast is a St. Elmo's Fire of the 1990s, and all turn in solid performances. Matthew Lillard's character is particularly memorable and propelled him to many lesser films, but also the excellent indie film from 1998, "SLC Punk." Please don't confuse this movie with Scream 2 or Scream 3, both with use the same casts, basically, and prove the first film really was catching lightning in a bottle. Scream 2 and 3 are bad films, sadly.Overall, an important movie in the middle 90s. Big box office hit that contributed to a whole slew of lesser films and parodies. A great time, fun to watch, and expertly put together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scream" is completely entertaining and totally terrifying. In a time when horror was losing its touch, Kevin Williamson wrote this clever script and Wes Craven brought it to life beautifully, reinventing the modern slasher and still remaining better than most of the films that followed it.Neve Campbell is Sydney Prescott, a shy girl who's life is turned upside down when somebody begins murdering her friends. In comes Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) and a hilarious reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox, the best character in the film) to investigate the murders and stay alive.The movie is funny and scary, with homages to famous older horror classics the entire way through, and the climax is excellently tense.

		<shortDescription>Still scares the sh*t out of me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Scream for maybe the 4th or 5th time, and i still got the chills while watching it. The way it's directed makes you jump all the time when people pop out of nowhere and attack. The suspense and lack of murders in the beginning is great, because it's not simply about blood and gore, it's about keeping the audience on the edge and making shivers go down their spine. I had to watch porno and comedy shows after watching this...that is always a great sign in a horror movie. The fact that i had to watch non-scary shows in order to flush out the frights from Scream shows how effective it really is.Even so, i still had to jog up the basement stairs when i turned off all the lights. And i know it will stay with me when i go to bed in about ten minutes(yes, i am still trying to avoid chills by delaying being alone in the dark)Also, as far as acting goes, there was some good acting in there. Jamie Kennedy was good(well, actually i liked his intelligent, paranoid character, but he played him, so i guess he gets credit for it). Matthew Lillard does a good show taking attention from himself and making it seem like he's not a killer whatsoever. Rose McGowan = Greatest Tits in the world.(Barrymore is good too) And lastly, Skeet Ulrich portrays the psychopathic killer tremendously, even if he couldn't fool me(until he got stabbed).All in all, an awesome movie that delivers exactly what it promises...Wes Craven's Finest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SCREAM (1996)starring: Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox Arquette, Skeet Ulrich, Drew Barrymore, Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy.plot: Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is not a very happy teenage girl. One year ago, her mother was raped and brutally murdered and a series of murders are taking place around her high school while her father is away on a business trip. After Sid is attacked by the masked killer, her boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich) and her father quickly become prime suspects. Meanwhile, a dumb Deputy (David Arquette) and a greedy reporter (Courtney Cox Arquette) desperately search for the identity of the killer.my thoughts: By 1996, we haven't seen a fairly decent slasher film since 1984 (A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET), some of its sequels were pretty good but not as original. Now, horror director Wes Craven and teen-angst and horror fan writer Kevin Williamson have teamed up to bring us SCREAM, a slasher which pays homage, references and spoofs previous horror films while also revolutionizing the genre. After this, we got two sequels and countless clones (just like PSYCHO, BLACK Christmas, THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, HALLOWEEN, Friday THE 13TH and A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET did) but none are better than the original.This film really knows how to scare you without having the killer walk slowly towards you. In my opinion, it sometimes works that the killer runs at you rather than when he walks towards you. The case scenes build up a lot of suspense. Don't get me wrong, it worked to have The Shape and The Fisherman walk, but here it wouldn't have.The mystery is also very well done. In a film where everyone is a suspect, and most are red herrings, it is very hard to guess the identity of the killer. Trust me, it's hard!Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson's teaming also did wonders. While Craven is great with building the suspense and painting dread all over the film, Williamson does great with the hip dialog. I really love what both of them did with the film and every horror fan should. I also enjoyed the score.But probably the best thing this slasher does is have the most developed characters in teen slasher history. Let's face it, although characters in teen slasher films before were fairly developed, they weren't fully developed. Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox Arquette, Skeet Ulrich, Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy all owned their parts and some carried on their characters to the two sequels and were still strong characters. Drew Barrymore and Henry Winkler also did great in their smaller parts.So if you want a slasher film that has a great director, a great writer, a great cast, very well developed characters, references and jokes of the great horror films before it and a shocking ending, definitely check out, it should be in every horror fan's collection!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS Horror is one of the most varied genre around. Handled well and you could be looking at multitudes of weak inferior sequels, handled badly and you could be looking at multitudes of dire sequels. Either way, the world is going to suffer when you create a fresh story. Written in 1996, no film is a better example of this than 'Scream'. Refreshing and original, it was a superb film primarily because of the fact that it rejuvenated a sickly direction. Whilst authors like Steven King were writing excellent books, the adaptations were often weak, at the same time old series like 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th' were stale and beyond saving. Horror needed a new direction, and by bringing teenage life into the equation writer Kevin Williamson did this. Creating a clever and witty story, Williamson and legendary director Wes Craven brought fresh life into a fading genre and managed to give us one of the finest teen based stories for decades. An entertaining film, with some outstanding butchery, 'Scream' is a pivotal film which you can't help but enjoy.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is your typical teenager when her mother is murdered. Beginning the film never fully recovered Prescott's past comes back to haunt her when a killer in a white mask begins to slaughter her friends.'Scream' is one of those movies where the intelligence which went into writing it is so easily ignored. Beautifully written, it is in effect a satire of the entire Horror genre. It manages to poke fun at the thing it is actually resurrecting. With a killer wearing a mask based on a famous painting (and a film title to match), certain aspects about it are just magnificent. Whether it's Drew Barrymore's brief cameo or Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy analysing the rules of horror, so many moments are memorable and entertaining. Few spoofs are ever that long lasting, but by inverting the idea and actually poking fun at itself, 'Scream' manages to guarantee itself a worthy place in the history books.True there are flaws, the acting is dire, one or two lines make you groan in disgust, but these flaws feel like they are intended. It's like Wes Craven knew that to do a true horror, certain 'flaws' had to be implemented, and it's hard not to admire his skill at matching Kevin Williamson's magnificent story with equally stunning direction. Craven is a Horror God, and with 'Scream' he proved once more how clever he really is.Until 'Scream', Horror was terminally ill. Old and tired, it had no new ground to really cover. Suddenly though Williamson and Craven built a new road. Making a joke out of the genre, 'Scream' managed to put a nail into the old style of horror design and simultaneously give life to a new direction. It is a landmark film and is a joy to watch. Bloody entertainment at a new level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's a Scream baby"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first saw Scream about 2 years ago, i wasn't expecting much because i knew what all these "Teen" Horror flicks were about (bad acting, bad direction etc) but when the opening scene began with Drew Barrymore playing helpless blonde Casey Becker, my mind was changed almost immediately, words cant describe how brilliant Drew Barrymore was in this opening scene, and i have never scene her act this good fantastic since. it starts of with Casey Becker answering the phone, while shes alone getting ready to watch some scary movies with her boyfriend Steven Orth, but suddenly out the blue, the stranger on the phone starts harassing Casey and this is when she knows something is wrong here, every time i watch this scene my heart still pounds and i still cant watch it when her parents find her hanging from a tree, because without this Drew Barrymore opener, this movie would have been awful. Then we get introduced to Neve Campbell playing Sydney Prescott, a 17 year girl, with a boyfriend who is always trying to get into her pants. Her boyfriend Billy Loomis played by Skeet Ulrich suddenly appears through her window giving her a big fright and the only reason why he wanted to see Sidney was because he wanted the night to be the night (if you know what i mean!) but she says no and he leaves. The next day after Casey and Steve were murdered and Sidney finds herself being swamped by tabloid twit Gail Weathers played by Courtney Cox (Tv's Friends), because a year earlier her mother Maureen Prescott was raped and murdered and Sid blamed it on her mothers ex lover Cotten weary (liev Schreiber) and Gail has been bashing Sidney since Cotten got sent down for her murder. We than get introduced to Tatum Reily played by Rose Mcgowan, Sidneys best friend, Randy Meeks played by Jamie Kennedy and Stu Macker played by Matthew Lillard (Tatums boyfriend). That very same night Sidney gets attacked at home whilst waiting for Tatum to pick her up, and suddenly Billy shows up and he gets arrested because Sidney thinks it was him. This is when Deputy Dewey Riley gets introduced played by David Arquette. its now the one year anniversary since Maureen Prescott was murdered and this when things start getting crazy and more bodies start piling up and its up to Gale, Dewey and Sidney to stop it.we found out who the killers are and their motive is blaming Horror movies and they want to blame the whole thing on Neil Prescott (Sidneys father) to make sure they don't get caught. in Conclusion i enjoy watching this masterpiece by Wes Craven and i want to give out mini awards to the brilliant cast: Drew Barrymore: No words cant describe the brilliance of her performance, she really was amazing Neve Campbell: Neve is always great as troubled Sidney and she was great in all 3 movies Courtney Cox: Courtney proved that she can get away from her "Friends" character Monica Gellar and this showed us she is a mature actor and can do any role Rose Mcgowan: she cracks me up in this movie with her sarcastic remarks "no please don't kill me Mr ghost face, i wanna be in the sequel"The rest of the cast are brilliant as well but i was disappointed with David Arquette because he was good in this but he isn't a great actor in my opinion i give it 100/10 because this is the modern say "Halloween" and this best Horror Movie of all time.</fullReview>

Earl Brown and Linda Blair.The original and true classic Scream film that redefined what makes a good slasher film. It starts off with a now classic opening starring Drew Barrymore as an unsuspecting victim that a killer is playing games with over the phone. We are then introduced to several friends who are killed off one by one, but in an unusually fresh way. Henry Winkler plays a principal. See this...it's good!my rating-A plus.

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be literally excellent. It's is not only scary but a great action movie as well, not to mention mystery. The story unfolds when we have to try and guess who the killer really is, and the ending scene ends with a great climactic finish. I love Mathew Lillard, David Arquett, Jamie Kennedy, Neve Campbell, and Skeet Ulrich's performances. Is it just me or did Skeet Ulrich remind you of Johnny Depp in this movie. Well I thought he had his character down pretty good. And t top it all off it had the horror master Wes Craven direct it. When you have Wes direct it and you have that star studded cast you already know how good the movie will be. I will never get tired of watching this movie since i am such a big horror fan. I also love all of the things they throw in about past horror movies such as nightmare on elm street, Friday the thirteenth and Halloweens. Awesome movie that I would recommend to anyone that likes horror movies, action movies, or mystery movies. This is a must see for any movie fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slasher film that's a cut above the rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror is not my preferred theme in cinema so it's no surprise that ten years have passed before I decided to have a look at this blood-bath of a film.It's about a masked serial killer who decimates a group of high school students knocking them off one at at a time while they party around a television set watching horror films. There's a lot of running and chasing and locking of doors and threatening with up-raised daggers. All this action is scary at first but eventually you get used to it and take it in your stride.The opening scene in which Drew Barrymore alone in her home at night answers the phone to an unknown caller is quite frightening as he whispers instructions in a threatening tone. This sets the mood of the terror that is to follow. We learn that it is inadvisable to venture outside on a dark night or neighbours could find your gutted body strung up in the nearest tree next morning! There is another scene which I found very scary. One of the girls finds herself locked in a garage with the masked killer and there appears to be no means of escape. Suddenly she sees the doggy door at the bottom of the roller door and she attempts to squeeze her slim body through the opening. When her hips gets stuck, the killer activates the roller door and her dangling body is drawn up with the door. Horrible to behold! There is a lot of realistic blood-letting in this movie and characters are drenched in gore. This is as it should be. Not like most movies where a thrust of a dagger leaves not much more than a relatively tiny stain on the clothing.I'm surprised that reviewers have not paid more attention to the character of Billy Looms. Admittedly Skeet Ulrich does little more than stare unrelentlessly into Sidney's face at very close quarters, but just watch his eyes and ask yourself could you trust this character. He convinced me that it is not necessary to shout and scream and threaten with a knife to create a tense scene. Just a smouldering eye contact well-done can send shivers down your spine. And Skeet is a master of this technique.As I said, horror films are not for me. They are usually laughable. I have to admit though that this is one of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I think I was about seven or so, and it scared me half to death. Now, with me almost being 15, it still scares me half to death. I've never been able to watch Drew Barrymore's death scene, and I probably never will. Much to gruesome for my liking.But, this movie is addictive. It was something that could actually happen. I mean, it was realistic. Sort of. And that's what scared me. The last time I watched it I was home alone, and I was looking over my shoulder every few minutes because I was so scared.It's well written, with an exceptional cast. The director broke away from the heavy set men who walk to their victims with the suspenseful music every time you see them. The killer actually ran, and he was a normal sized teenager. That, although it made me mad at first, makes me happy now.It truly is a frightening movie. I found myself burying my face in a pillow and plugging my ears a great deal of the time. Two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very well reinvented parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of serial killer who slaughter teenagers is maybe not new, but director Wes Craven has put the film to a whole new level. It' s much more than a normal horror movie, which provoked a huge amount of splatter-movies, which all tried to copy the idea of Scream. But Scream, as I see it, is also a parody of the older movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th which are both even mentioned by name in the movie.The characters and their attributes aren't surprising but advisedly and well chosen. Sidney Prescott (legendary played by Neve Campell), the main protagonist, is the typical young pretty high-school teen. Her obligate best friend (acted by a very cute blonde Rose McGowan) and her nerving older brother, who is additional the "good cop" (lovely staffed with David Arquette) can also be found in this movie. Of course the role of the unsuccessful sensation-seeking reporter (Courtney Cox, with a estranging hair-styling) has been established by Wes Craven.When you watch Scream at night and alone it will probably quit frighten you but if you have some friends around you, or you just love to watch horror movies, you will be amused by this "blood-red" humor, which is personalized in the character Randy (peak performance of Jamie Kennedy).Scream is definitive a "must-have seen" of the nineties. Watch it and scream !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, if somewhat predictable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I'm watching a horror movie, I generally watch for two reasons. Firstly, I want to be scared and enjoy the adrenaline rush of the jumps. Secondly, I want to lose myself within some kind of dark fantasy setup. Despite the fact that Scream fails to provide on either, it's a great movie in it's own right, but I think it's time Scream was referred to as what it is, a suspense thriller, and not a balls to the wall horror movie.With that comment out the way, I can say this: Scream is the best movie I've seen of it's kind. It has no pretensions to being an out and out horror movie, whereas it's copycats seemed to set out to be scary as hell and fell flat on their faces. The main reason it's such a joy to behold is this lack of pretension. Most modern horror blockbusters make themselves out to be the best thing since sliced bread within the first ten seconds of the trailer. They rarely are. Scream is happy to be Scream, and it doesn't really mind about how scary you find it so long as you're enjoying it.The cast are pretty annoying (par for the course with a Hollywood horror), but since this is a slasher parody that follows the 'cast iron genre rules' it's worth noting that a few of them are roadkill by the end of the movie. However, aggravatingly enough whereas in Fri 13th or Halloween, anyone who's a complete dummy or a lush or whatever will dead cert be on the end of an axe by the movies end, most of the victims in Scream have little or no relation to the greater plot, something that irked me a bit, as you'd know every death was coming because it'd go back to the random person who only just appeared last scene. It almost seemed that Craven and Williams didn't want any of their stars to die (aside from Drew Barrymore, who in the only shock in the movie is fairly unpleasantly slashed to death and hung in the opening sequence). Add to this the fact that most of the deaths had a 'I've had worse' type effect on me (even the aforementioned sequence is relatively non-violent in comparison to a Jason or Freddy film) as opposed to shocking me, and the horror aspect pretty much failed to have any impact on me.Aside from the fact that Scream is only scary if you're 14 (in which case you shouldn't have been watching it anyway lol), and the cast is full of people I've had my fill of (Please, someone cast Matthew Lillard in one of these movies and pickaxe his head in the first five minutes!), Scream has a pretty cool (for the time, it's now been copied to death) plot line, even if I did guess whodunit in the opening sequence. The plot twists around and around, and if you haven't seen a lot of these films, it'll probably throw you for a loop. It's well worth watching just to see the intrigue and mystery unfold.Add to this an original looking killer, some cool black humour, and there's a lot of reasons to watch Scream. It's an enjoyable, unassuming movie with slick production values and a good script and storyline. However, it has got its flaws and I disagree with its classic status. If you're into movies with the 90s/00s brat pack in them (Drew Barrymore, Matthew Lillard, Neve Campbell etc) you'll love this, and if you want a soft entry into horror, check this out as it's a fine place to start, but I would suggest you check out some real, non Hollywood horror as well, not merely confine yourself to the 'horror revival' genre Scream sits in, as frankly, movies like Maniac Cop, Ginger Snaps and Candyman (all of which come firmly recommended) make sitting through Scream seem like a walk in a happy happy field full of dandelions and bunnies. The best of the revival bunch. Recommended, but not perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is a perfect ten, my all time favorite scary movie. Wes Craven knows how to do horror films and he's brought us an all out horror mystery classic about a hooded figure that's killing teenage kids in a small town. The plot is like any other scary movie, kids are killed, killer gets caught leading to him being unmasked and big shock, yeah well there's a twist! The writer has put in a twist that the kids know that they are in a scary movie, needing to fallow the rules. The cast is perfect, my props go to Matthew Lillard as Stu, the best character in the whole movie. The opening is played perfect and Drew couldn't of been more on the mark. Jamie Kennedy is the perfect as his role as the geeky film nerd Randy who lives by horror films. David Arquet, Courtney Cox,Henry Winkler, and more support this film which gives it the extra steam to be a perfect film. The acting is done greatly, mostly by Drew in the beginning because you can feel for her as she is being spied on by our killer Mr. Ghostface. And I must say, though we don't see his face, we must thank the man who did the phone voice Mr. Roger Jackson. Well done Wes, great directing. Now not only do you have a great plot and well in depth characters, you get tons of blood. For gore fans, you'll really appreciate this film. Now do all yourselves a favor if your a scary movie nut like me, quickly go out and get a copy of Scream. Itself is a scream, enjoy!</fullReview>

This is easily my favourite movie(and horror movie) ever, and since it was so enjoyable, I was expecting a high standard from the sequels...And I wasn't disappointed.Wes Craven(director)and his team set up the rest of the trilogy expertly with this movie. They did a great job in all aspects: the acting couldn't have been better, the choice of actors couldn't have been better, the choice of scene location couldn't have been better and the character development couldn't have been better. Seeing this movie gave me a great interest with horror movies, and now I am obsessed with them.This movie(and trilogy) has a great amount of quotes: some funny, some sad, some fitting with the plot perfectly and some not making much sense at all. This would have to be one of the most quotable movies ever.Kevin Williamson(writer) came up with one of the greatest plots ever to be written. The plot has it's sad times, it's happy and funny times, it's suspenseful times and it's who done it times.In my opinion this is the greatest movie ever, this is one of those sorts of movies that you can watch over and over and over again, but thats just my opinion.A well deserved 10/10</fullReview>

I think it's a mix of the slick storyline, dark humour, clever cast and the great chemistry between the characters! Each character offers a vital and funny part to make this movie really work. The relationships between the characters is fantastic and each actor brings emotion yet dark comic humour to this movie. Neve Campbell is neat as main target Sidney, who brings just the right amount of emotion to the story. Rose McGowan brings dry humour and a fantastic supporting role. And Courteney Cox is brilliant as reporter Gale Weathers. The actors are cool and convincing and David Arquette rocks as quirky cop Dewey Riley. Whereas Skeet Ulrich carries off his character perfectly. Overall i just can't get enough of this Scream and suggest if you haven't seen it you all go out and buy it.

		<shortDescription>The best horror movie of the 90s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is so rare nowadays to see a horror film that can truly frighten you, while at the same time make you look at horror films differently through sheer invention and originality. Wes Craven managed to do such a thing in 1996, when he directed Scream, one of his best horror films in years. Certainly his best since A Nightmare on Elm Street.The reason why Scream is different is because it is about characters in a horror film that know they're in a horror film. Or rather the events they are being forced to endure mirror those of something right out of a stalker/slasher movie. And they're all too aware of the clichés, e.g. "the dumb, big-breasted blonde girl who can't act who runs up the stairs instead of out the front door." These are very self-aware characters, but that doesn't stop them from falling victim to the murder spree. That is never more evident than the opening scene. A scene that is as shocking in it's intensity as in it's audacity.A young woman, Casey, played by blonde Drew Barrymore, is at home all by herself. She is in her kitchen making popcorn, getting ready to watch a movie (probably a horror movie). The phone rings. On the line is an anonymous smooth talker, who wants to talk to her about "scary movies." Watch the way she fingers with a butchers knife while she's talking! Things turn nasty when Casey's caller starts threatening her, and traps her in a potentially nightmarish situation in her own home. She sees her boyfriend tied up on the patio, and now to save both their lives, Casey must play a game. Questions about horror movies. When she gets one too many wrong, her stalker finally shows. Wearing a black costume, and a ghoulish mask, well they all have to wear masks don't they? It all culminates in Casey's boyfriend being gutted like a fish, a mad chase through the house and garden, until finally the stalker catches up with Casey, and kills her. Even in her death throes, she is still holding the phone, and manages to choke her dying breath to her parents who are on the line. Casey is strung up like macabre modern art, to be found by her mother, who fittingly ends the scene with a piercing scream.I know I sound like I've been carping on and on about this one scene, but it is that important, because it sets the whole tone of the film perfectly. By killing off a famous person that early in a film, we realise at that point this is not going to be just any ordinary horror movie. Not since Psycho and the shower scene have we witnessed such a shocking event. At this point, anything can and will happen.And this is just for starters. The stalker (or stalkers) seems to have a personal grudge against Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell). But why? That's the beauty, and the genius behind Scream. The possible motive (if any) is left up to the audience to decide. Is it because Sydney's mother was murdered precisely one year ago? Is it just some insane psycho out for kicks? Who knows?As the body count piles up, we are introduced to each one of the characters, who is a stereotype in some way. Sydney, for one, is the plucky, headstrong heroine. Like Nancy in ANOES. Then there is Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox-Arqette), the tough as nails reporter. She never actually convinced me in that role, but that could be intentional parody on the part of Wes Craven, which may have escaped Courtney's attention.Dewey, (David Arquette) is the idiot deputy sheriff. Full of his own self-importance, it's a wonder he survives the film at all. In a terrific plot twist, his little sister played by Rose McGowan bullies him every chance she gets, pointing out his inadequacies in no short order.Finally, you've got Randy (Jamie Kennedy), the self-appointed expert on horror movies. Always coming out with the clichés, expectations and rules, he is like a walking encyclopedia on the subject, such as, "You never say I'll be right back in a horror movie because you won't be back."Everything about Scream is designed to comment on the horror movie genre in some respect, whether it be the actors or the situations, e.g. the sheriff was played by the same actor in ANOES who was the inept deputy, who tutors Dewey! The film is packed to the rafters with in-jokes, self-referential gags, and puns on the genre. Scream is a literal treasure trove of film references, and one of it's many joys is looking for them. Wes Craven has officially joined the ranks of self-referential irony that Joe Dante and Quentin Tarantino does so well.With a tortuous script, red herrings, and dead ends Scream is a complex maze that leads you a merry dance until the final, very bloody finale. Maybe a little too bloody, but it is added a line of invention by having a hidden camera on the premises, and the events being watched by Gale Weathers. A horror movie within a horror movie!This is horror movie making of the finest order. Scream has layers of sophistication other horror films only dream about. Wes Craven redefined the horror movie for the modern generation, and in the process spawned a series of inferior remakes. That goes for the sequels too, which increasingly became the thing the flawless original had been parodying to begin with.Scream, the ultimate horror movie buff's dream come true!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that resurrected the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People go to the movies for lots of reasons: they want to escape from reality, they want to learn a lesson other than education, they want inspiration, or something they want to talk about. Horror movies were dead in the early nineties where we didn't have characters that can scare us, but that made us laugh. Not only were people in America were starting to label video games but actually went to family movies rather than horror movies. Scream is a resurrection of the horror movies, where the film itself is a parody of horror movies and understanding the rules of who lives and who dies.The film's prologue begins with Drew Barrymore as a driven sex teenager who gets an anonymous phone call from a mysterious man that says he's going to kill her and her boyfriend if she doesn't cooperate with his scheme. They play movie trivia on horror movies where if she answers one right, the game continues, if she answers wrong, he dies. The boyfriend dies either way, so now it's up to Drew Barrymore's character to escape or die; the killer appears in a black costume with a white mask along with a sharp knife chasing her and than mutilating her body.We move on to the film's hero Sidney Prescott, (Neve Campbell of "Party of Five") an average high school bookworm who hasn't lost her virginity yet as her boyfriend Billy Loomis wants her to open up to him (you know what I mean); her father is leaving on a trip for the week, leaving Sidney by herself since her mom has died.The next day, its total chaos at Woodsboro High where reporters are all over the incident, questioning students, teachers or anybody who knew the death of Drew Barrymore's character and her boyfriend. Even Sidney's friends Tatum (Rose McGowan), Steward (Matthew Lillard), and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) the movie freak, find it all to be a big horror movie.One night, Sidney receives a call from an anonymous stranger and asking her what is her favorite scary movie. It's a dark and raspy voice just like the film's prologue where we don't know who the person is. It's the same murderer who killed Drew Barrymore's character and is now after her; Sidney escapes this time but the killer will return again.To quote Randy: "Everybody's a suspect!" Indeed the whole town is suspected after Billy Loomis had been taken in by authorities, because of a cellular phone he carried. Now a curfew has been placed, with people getting killed one by one, especially a new clue involving the anniversary on the death of Sidney's mother. The final showdown is taken place at Steward's house where the mysterious murderer is revealed with a twisted ending."Scream" is not a horror movie, in general, but a homage where everything we see is a reference to most of the popular movies from "Evil Dead," "Halloween," "A Nightmare on Elm Street," "When A Stranger Calls," "Psycho," and many more. Nonetheless, this a popcorn treat that I wouldn't recommend going to the bathroom after wards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the suspense filled movie Scream is really good! The 1st time i saw it I thought OMG this is freaky and i rented it as a scary movie with my bf so i could grab his hand and half way into the movie i didn't have to fake scared. I especially like the part when the guy with the ghost face shows up in the garage when Tatur (the girl) goes out there and it (the ghost face) cuts her arm and she tries to go out through the garage cat door and then he starts opening the garage and she goes up with it and then her head is on one side and her body on the other! Which I found to be very grueling! I like the scary movies where people aren't demon posses which there and a lot of those and this is the kind of gory, violent, murderish, movies if u like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart and scary. Influential too !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is a lot more influential than people give it credit for. Scream came at when the horror genre was running out of steam .Its witty post modern , self analytical script along with some genuinely great scares topped off with its whodunnit flavour gave the horror genre a kick in the ass and totally revitalised it.Its legacy aside, scream is still a superior slasher film on its own merit , better than many of the films it mentions and parodies. The performances are surprisingly strong too and the twist in the end is something i did not see coming. Its slashtastic! (sorry , i couldn't think of a better way to end this review.Cant be as bad as what some people wrote though can it ? )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream was probably one of the most popular movies of '96, and I can really see why. This was a frightening, gory movie that also had a bit of comedy mixed in with it. A series of murders occur and all the victims are from Woodsboro High School. The murders are gory and no one is safe. Everyone is a suspect and everyone is in fear. Courteney Cox plays in-your-face reporter Gale Weathers who is always ready to be at the scene and reporting the latest. Neve Campbell plays Sidney Prescott, an innocent girl whose mother was murdered and raped and now the killer is after her, too! Jamie Kennedy plays Randy Meeks, horror movie expert and comical friend. Rose McGowan plays Tatum Riley, Sidney's best friend who is the sister to Deputy Dwight 'Dewey' Riley. David Arquette plays Deputy Dwight 'Dewey' Riley, a brave deputy who must investigate the tragic events. Matthew Lillard plays Stuart Macher, wacky student at Woodsboro. Drew Barrymore plays innocent Casey Becker who is brutally murdered in the first 10 minutes of the movie. Liev Schreiber plays Cotton Weary, accused killer of Sidney's mother. So as you can see, there is quite an assortment of interesting characters. A fan of horror movies is almost guaranteed to like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devilishly clever spoof!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still relish this hilarious, ultraviolent first of a trilogy starring Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Drew Barrymore, and Rose McGowan. It's got very clever above standard writing, terrific scares, and load of belly-laughs, which really is what makes it fun. I don't usually crave standard horror where there is lots of blood but no laughter. I think my favorite scene is where Billy and Stu stab each other as part of their big scheme to frame Sid's dad for the killings. Arquette is wonderful, had lots of great comedy lines. McGowan's character is mean to Arquette, but it was sad to see her go!!! Jamie Kennedy is the heart of the movie, he is adorable!!! Any naysayers that declare this is NOT horror: Well, it is a spoof, a parody. But there are so many scares that will make you leap out of your couch, and so much blood and screaming, that it's safe to say that the horror element is very strong. It's a horror comedy!!!

		<shortDescription>Destined To Become A Genre Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scream" is an above-average slasher film from Wes Craven, who some consider "the modern master of horror", and deservedly so - he's accomplished quite a bit. The film centers around Sidney Prescott, a teenage girl who is trying to survive high-school, while balancing all of her problems, including her boyfriend and the memories of the savage murder of her mother a year earlier. After a student and her boyfriend are found brutally stabbed to death late one night, the entire town goes into a frenzy, with zany news reporters questioning everybody, and a frantic police department trying to solve the murders. Sidney seems to be all caught up in the middle of it, and as people begin to die all around her, her boyfriend (among others) becomes a suspect.Probably the best slasher film of the '90s, "Scream" is nothing short of a horror classic. I've always liked Wes Craven's work (particularly his earlier stuff), and while this film is much more light-hearted (for lack of a better term) than "Last House On The Left" or "The Hills Have Eyes", it's very stylish and thrilling. The engaging storyline never lets up and keeps the viewer's attention the whole way through. Dashed with lots of dark humor and countless references to other horror classics (even some references to Craven's films himself), this makes for some fun for seasoned fans of the genre. At times the film almost seems as if it's poking fun at some common elements in the genre, but manages to be taken seriously at the same time. Suspense is pushed quite a bit, and there are some spectacularly scary scenes. The opening scene will more than likely go down as one of the most memorable openings in horror history - very well acted by Drew Barrymore (surprising to see her in this film), and just plain scary to boot. Watch the film and you'll understand what I'm talking about.Our cast is led by the wonderful Neve Campbell, the innocent protagonist who is caught up in the middle of a town in hysteria. David Arquette plays a quirky police deputy, and Rose McGowan as his popular sister. And Courtney Cox plays a nosy reporter who will do anything to get a good story. I liked the fact that this film really focused on the actual community and it's reaction to the murders, and how the town became a hysteric mess over what was happening. I also liked the fact that the killer wasn't superhuman - those who find themselves in the track of the killer fight back and give the villain quite a beating, and the villain actually runs (the alternative being taking a slowly-paced stroll while trying to pursue a victim, something that has always kind of bothered me about many slasher films).There's plenty of gore, mostly brutal stabbings and such, so all those gore hounds will be pleased. But besides that, this film has a good story going for it led by a very good cast. The ending was a shocker, and was half of what I was expecting, so I was pleasantly surprised.Bottom line is, "Scream" is one of the superior modern slashers of the 1990s, and can't be missed by horror fans. While the two sequels that it spawned were good, they were nothing like the original, as in most cases. Craven really hit the mark on this one, and it's destined to become a classic of the genre. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream is awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is one of my all time favorite movies. As a fact most most rated R horror movies are trashy as h*ll. There is always nudity and sex scenes i mean come on. I thought it was a really good story line. It keeps you guessing until the very end. Wes Craven plays it out so everybody is a suspect. It was a good mix of cast and characters as well. I though Neve Campbell did a great job as Sidney! The Innocent victim and sole prey of a physco killer. The movie starts out at the house of 17 year old Casey Becker. A deep, creepy voice calls and threatens to kill her and her 18 year old boy friend Steven Orth.Even the first few minutes caught my full attention. The next day reporters and cops are sweeping the area for any clues and information. Unfortionatley for poor Sidney this is all but to familiar. Just less then a year ago her mother was raped and murdered by... Cotton Weary. Now she isn't sure anymore. And Tabloid Twit Gale Weather is out to prove his innocence and get the latest scoop on the story, no matter who gets hurt in the process. A group of 5 friends find their way into the middle of the bloodbath. The anniversary of her mother's death is approaching. Her father goes out of town and Sid is left to stay with her best friend Tatum Riley. who's brother, Dewey is a cop in Woodsboro. After being nearly killed, Sid'd boyfriend appears and the killer disappears. Billy spends a few nights in prison. She still gets a call from the killer that night at Tatum's. By this time my eyes were glued to the screen. Who is the killer and why do they want Sidney dead so much. Was it the same person who slaughtered and raped her mother the year before? Was it Randy Meeks the virgin who is obsessed with horror movies? Tatum Sidney best friend? Stu (the best character!) Tatum's awesome boyfriend. Billy Loomis Sidney boyfriend and right now the only suspect none to the police? Dewey Riley Taum's brother and cop for Woodsboro? Gail Weather the reporter who will do ANYTHING for a story and has no feelings for anybody? Or Sidney's dad who is no where to be found after the killings started. (hostile after the death of his wife the previous year?</fullReview>

Not only is it my favorite horror film ever, it also has a sense of humor that elevates it from 'good' to 'masterpiece'.The plot is pretty clichéd( teenagers, killer, death etc. ) but this is a good thing as it allows dozens of sly references and in jokes to the slasher genre.Scream is a great film for many reasons: The way it doesn't shy away from gore; the the solid performances from the cast; the way nearly everyone is a suspect; and the numerous jokes and references to the slasher genre.Scream is a classic film and one of my all time favorite.

		<shortDescription>My Love/Hate Relationship With Scream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up in the 70's and 80's with nothing but cheesy slashers. I hate the snappy and intellectual dialogue that slasher films have these days. "Scream" is an example of what I dislike about horror these days. Now don't get me wrong, Scream is refreshingly original. I only have a problem with it being a new "trend" that will live on forever and the slasher of yesterday will only be remembered as a passing fad. I hate it that they warn you about the "Rules you shouldn't break" or else you will die. How dare they know these rules. I want my teenagers to be dumb as hell and unsuspecting of the horror that lies ahead. I don't want them trying to follow the "rules". The teenagers of Scream (and other 90's/05 slashers) are portrayed as "smarter" than their 70's-80's counterparts. I want to go back to the days when twelve teenagers didn't realize anything strange was happening until only two of them are left, and the bodies of their girlfriends and buddies start falling out of trees, and out of closets.Scream made me literally scream, even though I still sorta liked it. It's just that I don't want parody-slasher such as Scream becoming the norm.The good times are gone. I'm an old-timer in my 30's. I guess the reason most youngsters are not in pain over this new breed of horror taking over is because there is not much nostalgia for the old. Nothing can compare to growing up in the 70's/80's and seeing the trailer for a Friday The 13th or The Howling or Slumber Party Massacre. I could actually deal with the way they make slashers these days if at least two or three directors would defect from the pack and start making slashers in true 70's/80's fashion. That way the playing field of slasher films would be even, and this new generation of slasher-fans can keep their "Dawson's Creek" dialogue and the "Buffy The Vampire Slayer" actors that they love so much, and we fans of old-school slashers can go back to the way a slasher was intended.I long for the unknown actor who has never appeared on a sit-com or TV drama to star in a cheesy horror. A character who would never take notes from previous slasher movies in order to stay alive. I would love to re-visit that dumb blond who rejects the smart nerd for the dumb jock, only to get killed while in the missionary position. The old man with the dirty dog who warns the kids of danger. The Deputy who pays the teens a warning-visit at the beginning of the film but doesn't show up again until the bodies are cold. And finally, the bloody finger that twitches from the corpse with an ax in his back as the paramedics are zipping him up in a body-bag.Those were the good old days.I give Scream an 8/10Yes, I'm sure my rating surprises you. I can't deny that Scream was a good movie. My anger lashes out only at this new trend that Scream has started. I just hope that it hasn't completely destroyed the slasher of old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Suspense Trilogy I</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story centers on "Sid the Victim" and the friends around her that are being killed by a ghost masked serial killer. There is also a back story that changes the suspects and Sid's reality. The movies take place in the "real world" where "all the horror movies have played" and aims to challenge/break the rules of the genre even as the rules are being told to the characters by an odd-ball character played by Jaime Kennedy (Malibu's Most Wanted, Jamie Kenedy Expierment. I did not know who most of the cast was before seeing this film, however, I do not believe I could have picked a better ensemble. You will probably recognize the names in the cast listings. Matthew Lillard (Scooby-Doo, 13 Ghosts) brings a comic style to the screen. Neve Campbell (Craft, Party of Five) adds her beauty and strength (she was\is a dancer) which she needed for some of the scenes. If you have not seen this yet, don't read the message boards or reviews of this movie that give spoilers. Rent it and decide for yourself. If you like it, you will like the other two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved all three movies. There is something about them that get me so involved in the story. It was a cast full of many unique talents. I don't know if its because I am a Neve Campbell fan or what. But This is one trilogy that I can watch over and over and never get sick of it. The thing I like best about a trilogy is that there are things you will find out in the third installment and that were never true in the first or that you didn't realize and will help you tie together pieces that you weren't sure of before. I believe Neve Campbell was the perfect actress to play the part of sidney. She is so genuine and sweet in her characters, even though she has played some not so nice characters before.

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Slasher Tribute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible VERY MINOR spoilers:Wes Craven is a freaking genius! This movie is so..well it's so serious and cool, but obviously there's a black comedy slant to it all the way. It's just a lot of fun really. Slasher fans will find all they want right here, except for nudity (sorry folks). Blood and stabbing, however is abound. I've never seen so much blood (except for maybe Evil Dead 2). Though the deaths never get more gory than the very first killing. Plus, any of you who haven't seen the gem that is "Halloween," you get a fine preview, as the fine folks in this movie watched this one on the tube. There are also many other horror references. Craven even has the stuff to make a joke about the failure of the sequels to his own Nightmare On Elm St. saga. Freddy also shows up int his movie, sort of. AS the cast puzzles over the killer's identity, so do you. With everyone a suspect, it'll drive you crazy. The there's the killer themself (is that a word? :-') Ghostface has become an instant legend in horror history. I still see scream masks in stores (it's the Halloween season now, and I've seen 'em, along with those Scary Movie parodies). Yep, Scream is a respectable horror classic. It's set the standard for teen horror flicks of the '90s. So get out there and rent this little classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films I've seen, ever (some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream (1996) is a teen slasher film in which an insane person living in the peaceful town of Woodsboro attacks and kills people by first sneaking into their house, freaking them out on the phone, then them. The killer wears a presently-ever-popular ghost mask in order to conceal his ID. Warning: THIS IS NOT A MOVIE TO GET LITTLE TIMMY FOR HIS BIRTHDAY!!!!!! (if you know what i mean). This movie contains non-stop provocative language and, as well as some suggestive themes content. However, this movie contains a very involved story plot and a movie you just can't stop watching after the ever-popular first scene (viewers know what I mean). Compared to other movies, this movie isn't THAT y, but if you're that affected by gory scenes, SKIP THE FIRST SCENE. Now, this movie's ending is SO AMAZINGLY SURPRISING I couldn't guess who the killer was if my life depended on it. Its plot is definitely very involved, keeps you watching, freaks you out sometimes, and doesn't disappoint in the end. Scream gets a perfect 10/10 in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, but very overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Scream' is at once a great horror movie and also one of the most hated films in the genre.**SPOILERS**A young teenager (Drew Barrymore) is viciously slaughtered, and shakes up her high-school. A group of friends, Sidney (Neve Campbell) her boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich) his friend Stu (Matthew Lillard) and his girlfriend Casey (Rose McGowen) start talking about how terrible it was and decide to throw a party to get the tension out. However, the kill has attracted big city news reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox, before she was Cox-Arquette) to town who immediately buts heads with town deputy Dewey (David Arquette). After Sid is attacked, Gail and Dewey decide to try to get along so they can help uncover the murderer. This proves very hard, as the killer arrives at the party being held and starts bumping off more teens, finally leaving Sid, Billy, Gail, Dewey, Stu, and local horror freak Randy (Jaime Kennedy) to stay alive in the killer's path. The killer reveals that s/he is also responsible for a back-story involving Sid a little over a year before.The Good News: Although it seems as though nothing more went on, that is it, and Kevin Williamson did a fantastic job with only those few scenes. He manages to get jumps and laughs coming pretty regularly in the short span, which is spread out over an hour and forty minutes. By sending up the genre, he gives himself more room to wriggle with than by simply parodying it. I feel this wouldn't have been as big if the film was like 'Airplane,' where it parodied the genre. The film does have some pretty scary moments, including my favorite when Sid is in the bathroom and she checks under the stalls for a person in the stalls, then sees the killer's boots and finally a long black drape come down to hide themselves, and she is forced to make the decision of either risking her life to get out or risk her life in a confrontation with the killer. A great moment and one of few really scary scenes in the film. I also love the whole ending, with Randy commenting on the movie he is watching while the killer is creating the same scene behind him, not to his knowledge, to the whole truth about the killings being revealed, to the final outcome. The whole party scene is great, with several deaths, a few false deaths, and a ton of blood. I do have to say that, while I am very good at guessing the killer the first time I watch one of these movies, it took a while for everything to click and I knew who the killer was. Some friends who also do that as well figured it out right about the same time I did, so it could through you off as well. It was also a nice creative twist to have a back-story that happened off-camera instead of being shown as the prologue to a film. Gutsy move and well worth it.The Bad News: I strongly believe this film is responsible for about 90% of the truly terrible 'horror' films out there right now. By poking fun of the genre within the genre confines is, at once a creative move, and the other a terrible idea because now you have the whole subgenre of horror films where everyone comments on the situation at hand by referencing it with another horror movie. It was nice the first time out, but now every horror film since has at least one person who will reference the situation with a famous horror film. It is very tiresome, irritating, and no one cares anymore. I blame 'Scream' for this trend, and for that I will not rate it above a '9' for that reason.The Final Verdict: Even though it spawned a whole annoying subgenre of the horror film, this is still a pretty scary film and at least deserves a look for anybody seriously interested in horror films.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence</fullReview>

Horror was six feet under till Scream came out and brought horror back to the big screen now I do agree a lot of bad movies came out after Scream but that is no reason to hate on Scream, Look at how many bad movies came out after Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street etc...Scream stands on its own and people hate on this movie for all the wrong reasons overall I think this film will go down a horror classic and people will be talking about it for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is one of the ultimate movies because of how it is done. By leaving it so no one knew who the killer was until the very end it kept the viewer really interested all the way through the movie. Although other movie shave done it obviously, no movie has done it this well. And then by making it so that there were two killers it covered up for any one being able to say that that person couldn't have killed them because he was here or he couldn't have killed him because he's not strong enough. One thing I would have liked to see them do is in the credits tell us who was meant to have killed who because that has always bugged me who killed Drew Barrymore's character because she looked at him and I would like to know who she was looking at. More movies should be done in this format where you've got to guess the killer/s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's no need to scream, it's actually quite good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A horror film that resurrected the sub genre of the teen-slasher movie, made us laugh, made us think, and above all made us scream? I didn't think it was possible. I thought I'd seen it all before. Gruesome deaths, virgins survive, everyone is a suspect, yadda yadda yadda. Scream gave us something similar but so very different at the same time. It played with the conventions of the genre and parodied it in a way that made us inquisitive about the storyline and interested in the characters, murders and the film as a whole.The plot of the film is typical of the teen- slasher genre, much like other films such as Halloween and Friday 13th which share some of the conventions of the genre with Scream. The small town of Woodsboro is shaken by a masked mass murderer. It begins with Casey Becker, played convincingly by Drew Barrymore, meeting her untimely death at the hands of the killer. Woodsboro then becomes one big crime scene which allows bitchy and ruthless news reporter Gale Weathers to research her next juicy, blood-splattered story. The town already has a history, after 1 year previously the mother of Sidney Prescott was brutally raped and murdered. The plot sees Sidney's friends meeting their gory ends as the killer has her in mind for the final conflict.The characters in the film are a piece of genius. They all have very contrasting personalities and personal issues which makes it difficult when trying to identify the killer. Sidney Prescott is the typical virginal character but with a strong, hard edge due to having to deal with the death of her mother. Her ongoing battle with Gale Weathers, who is constantly bothering Sidney and interfering with her life, acts as a strong and witty narrative strand. The portrayal of Randy as the film geek allows the conventions of the horror genre to be conveyed to the audience in an obvious way, highlighting the way in which the film parodies the genre. The performances by the actors are diverse and often chilling, which is indicated in the death sequences. Courtney Cox shows her abilities as an actress by making Gale Weathers a memorable and undeniably important character in the film.The killings themselves are psychotic and terrifying. Visually and acoustically they are realistic. You actually see the knife going into bodies and can almost feel the pain the characters are suffering. Most of them take place where the characters feel at home and relaxed only to becomes victims of gut-ripping, neck breaking, blood spurting deaths. This technique is enough to make the audience feel nervous in their own homes for days after watching the film!Scream is yet another work of art from director Wes Craven whose captivating horror stories sparked a new way of film making and a new sub culture. I would rate this film 9 out of 10 as it was successful enough to become one third of a terrifying trilogy and reinvented the face of the teen-slasher genre. Strong characters and strong performances from the actors complement a smart, funny and innovative storyline, it's definitely one for the DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reason that I find this film to be so clever, is that all of the characters are aware of the formula to slasher movies, yet they seem to be in one. The story involves a teenager named Sydney Presscott (Neve Campbell) who's mother was killed one year before the murder's start to happen again. No matter where Sydney seems to go, everyone around her begins to die. When the killer is revealed, you'll be shocked. Something you can't help but love about Scream is all of the quotes and references to older slasher movies. Scream can be just as funny as it is scary, and can be enjoyed by just about anybody. My only problem with Scream is the dragged out climax, but overall a real thrill. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSSome people say "Scream" ruined horror movies for the 90s because it was too hip and self-referential. Not only that, it spawned a whole slew of imitators like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Urban Legend". While I agree that the imitators were lousy, it can't be denied that "Scream" is a bloody good time.Or maybe it's better to say that if you'd seen "Scream" before all of the imitators, you would understand. Like "Halloween", this movie was a good idea that unfortunately made a zillion dollars and caused Hollywood to attempt to duplicate its success over and over, which somewhat took all of the attention away from the original.Wes Craven has an uncanny knack for creating tension. It's true that he resorts to graphic violence a great deal, but the thing that makes it work is that he also uses it to put the viewer on edge instead of just to titillate. While you're watching the movie, you already know Craven will not hesitate to show the violence, so you start to cringe even when he does not. Craven also pulled off an ingenious stunt by having his top-billed starlet, Drew Barrymore, ruthlessly slaughtered in the opening ten minutes. Nobody was expecting that, although now it's become entirely commonplace.Horror buffs got a lot of mileage out of Craven's sly references to other genre classics (and not-classics, too). For instance, I got a real charge out of Barrymore's final on-screen image, which was an obvious homage to "Suspiria". Some of the action is completely implausible--for instance, what kind of parents would allow unsupervised teenagers to have a wild party at a secluded house in the middle of nowhere when several local teens have been murdered and the killer is still on the loose? Still, I was on edge the entire time during this film, and it was exactly the kind of good time a horror movie is supposed to deliver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!!!!!!!!!Spoilers!!!!!!!!Scream- Neve Campell, David Arquette, Cortney Cox Arquette, Drew Barrymore, and Jamie Kennedy It all starts with someone giving a call to Casey (Drew Barrymore) and starts talking to her. He starts to ask questions like "do you have a boyfriend?" and "what are you doing?" then later he asks "whats your favorite scary movie?" and she answers Halloween. Later the conversation starts to get scary. He then asks "Who are you?" and she answers "why do you want to know?" and he answers "cause I want to know who I am looking at" On that part it all starts. She see's her boyfriend outside, and the killer pops out and starts to chase her in and out of the house. Then later he kills her. Soon the killer starts chasing other people in that town. My favorite part was th scene when Drew Barrymore dies. It was so scary, just like the rest of the movie. I enjoyed this movie with Screams and Laughs. Its one of my favorite scary movies. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edgy Horror movie...This is the movie some say transformed the horror genre into a phenomenon or a piece of crap...The 90's where an all new low for Horror movies not that many were made and than Horror fan freak Kevin Williamson wrote "SCREAM" the movie started out slow at the box office and than became a huge hit and weeks went on it got bigger and bigger. Scream is about a group of teens that are being stalked by a killer and not one person has a clue who is behind all this madness. I think Scream is a very entertaining horror movie its very clever the thing that stands out the most is the outstanding characters this is a solid cast everyone does a great job with the acting and Wes Craven does what Wes Craven does and that is direct great Horror movies.Overall, Scream is a fresh Horror movie so many people dislike it because of what came out after Scream so many lame teen slasher flicks it was never ending, But IMO Scream stands on its own and is a Horror classic.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redefined the Horror/Thriller Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, when this movie came out I was six, and horror movies scared me. When I was eight, I loved horror movies. I really wasn't interested in seeing Scream, since it was new, and probably sucked. When we went to Wal-Mart (don't say anything!), I saw a copy and thought I might give it a shot. When It started, I was in the basement, which I used to think was the spookiest part of the house. My father was watching it with me, since we both love horror movies, and he hadn't seen it either. SPOILER ALERT: TURN BACK NOW IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS!!! Ok. It starts with the title Scream, and a woman's voice can be heard desperately screaming, probably for her life. A hand picks up the phone, and we realize that it is Drew Barrymore. At first she doesn't think much of it, since they get into a conversation about their favorite scary movies (he he he). He asks her if she has a boyfriend, and she replies no. Liar. Anyway, he asks for her name, and says that he wants to know who he's looking at. That is when she realizes that she is in trouble, and we as the audience wonder how she'll get out of it. Drew Barrymore is a major star, she can't get killed off! Wrong. It was very much like Hitchcock and Psycho, killing off Janet Leigh early in the movie. Well, a killing spree takes foot, and our hero, Sidney (Neve Campbell), is the main prey. When the killer (he he he) is revealed, the answer is mind blowing. The sequels were actually worth watching, and I want to get the box set. This genre defining film is an absolute MUST for any horror fan. 10/10. PS: What are your favorite scary movies? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Possible spoiler***I should hate this movie, not only because what it is but because it has spawned hundreds of shoddy movies that has tried to cash in on it's success. I should hate it for what it is because it's a thriller which just tries to look like a horror movie plus it stars David Arquette one of the most annoying actors in the business. But I still can't help myself from liking it.The plot is at sometimes rather smart. A killer is slaughtering people and terrorizing them by forcing them to answer questions about (in)famous horrormovies. Craven could and should have used this element more than he did since it's a pretty clever idea. Still he makes it work well.The movie has got some good actors in it: Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Skeet Ulrich, David Arquette is actually good as the nerdy cop here but I think that we should have had the rights to see more of Drew Barrymore. She's easily one of the best actresses in Scream.The movie has got some scenes packed full of suspense and tension. Sure some scenes may seem clichéd, but not so much that it doesn't work. And this is a movie about movies, so I guess that it wouldn't have that much of a point if it didn't seem clichéd at one point.The first time I saw this, I had a special kind of feeling in my stomach. I had a feeling that anything could happen. I don't think I've had that kind of feeling watching a movie ever since. It was my first contact with the horror world, even though this is more of a thriller than pure horror.The only downsides I can figure out was that the plot weakens at the end, and everyone tends to be look a bit too crazy to make it work as good as it should.So to spell it out: if you want to start to watch horror movies but you don't know where to begin than start here. It might be a blend of thriller and horror but it's still a very fine start. It just worked for me.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Do you like scary movies?" asks an exaggeratedly sinister voice over the telephone, and with that, "Scream" is off and running. The bizarre phone conversation between this unnamed voice and Drew Barrymore continues as the caller runs down horror movie clichés. ("I am one second away from calling the police!" says Barrymore as the call takes a threatening turn. "But they never get there in time," the caller responds coolly.) Finally, she is challenged to play a game in which she has to answer trivia questions about horror movies. If she gets them right, she lives. If not, she dies.Despite the gruesome conclusion that this scene eventually reaches, "Scream" is really more of a camp send-up than anything else. What makes it work better than most spoofs, and helps it to establish at least some amount of suspense, is that the script is never quite aware of itself. It manages to pull this off with the clever premise that the characters, mostly teenagers, are all familiar with the traditions and clichés of horror movies. In the James Bond parody "Austin Powers," for example, the villain purposely engages in the action movie cliché of giving his captives an excessive amount of time to escape. But he doesn't do this because he's been watching James Bond movies; he does it because he's a character in a spoof. "Scream" pushes the envelope a little farther, even going so far as to have one character insist, "But this is real life, this isn't a movie!" while never giving the game away and admitting that it is, in fact, a movie.The main character in "Scream" is Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), a high school student who seems to be the killer's next intended victim after she receives a similar phone call ("The question isn't, 'Who am I?' The question is, 'WHERE . . . AM I?'") but escapes an assault by someone dressed in a creepy "ghost-face" costume with a black robe. Among the suspects are her boyfriend Billy, his friend Stu, local horror film geek Randy, and her father, who has gone missing. The combination works best in the second half of the film, when many of the teenage characters gather at Stu's house for a party and the killer makes an appearance.Aside from the mystery, "Scream" boasts some moments of deranged comic inspiration to rival many recent comedies. Some of the best lines come from Randy, who is always at hand to offer observations about how the situation parallels that of a particular horror movie (perhaps one of those "Wes Carpenter flicks," as one girl speculates), or, in one of the best scenes, a lecture about the rules that a character must follow to survive a horror movie. (In case you're wondering - never have sex, never drink or do drugs, and never, EVER, under any circumstances, say, "I'll be right back.") Kevin Williamson's script is also smart enough to toss in plenty of humour that is not directly related to slasher films, such as the weird dialogue between two characters on a Romantic Evening Walk. ("Do you know what constellation that is up there?" "No, which one?" "I don't know, that's why I was asking you.")The only problem with `Scream' is that director Wes Craven, a horror veteran, seems to want this to be scarier than it actually is. A few of the killer's attacks, especially the murder of Barrymore's character, make for genuine suspense and some real shocks, but most are surrounded by so much tongue-in-cheek dialogue that I was too busy laughing to be scared by anything. There is some general suspense of the `who-will-live and who-will-die' variety, but no more so than in any action thriller and certainly none of the cold-blooded fear that horror movies are supposed to inspire.There has been a lot of talk about "Scream" as a landmark for the horror genre, but other than a few scenes and Craven's name in the credits, there really isn't that much to qualify it as a horror movie - at least not an especially good one, in any case. Fortunately, there's enough campy humour for it to earn a well-deserved place as a cult classic, and one that will be a film buff's favourite for years to come.Verdict - Clever, funny and intermittently scary, the mother of all camp horror movies is a real gem. Filled with real atmosphere and genuine tension, this is a must see, but it is instantly disposable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies yet. (CONTAINS SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best movies ever(in my opinion), along with movies like Mars Attacks! and Scary Movie. It launched the careers of young actors today such as David Arquette, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy, and Rose McGowan. It also has the very special appearences of Henry Winkler(a.k.a. to some people as The Fonz) as the principal and Wes Craven in a cameo as Fred the janitor(where Wes dons a red and black striped shirt and a hat to make himself look like his other horror masterpiece character Freddy Kreuger). This is one of Wes Craven's best films, along with A Nightmare on Elmstreet. I feel the best performances were by Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy, who gives Jamie Lee Curtis the nickname The Scream Queen. I think the best scene is the bloodbath scene, with the deaths of Billy, Stu, and Kenny, the almost deaths of Dewey and Randy, plus a lot of action.I'm not a big horror movie fan, but I think this is the best horror movie ever. This movie was so great that it had to be made fun of in Scary Movie, a comedy version of this movie for comedy fans. My final thought for this movie is: If you're a horror movie fan, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ideal Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is almost without flaw. The concept to make fun of slasher movies in a slasher movie is genius. Mutiple killers never saw it coming. The best scene of the movie is when Jamie Kennedy pauses Halloween, stands up in front of the television set and explains the rules to survive a scary movie "There are certain rules one must abide by to survive a horror movie. Rule number 1, you can never have sex, big no no, big no no. Rule number 2, you can't drink or do drugs, the sin factor. And rule number 3, Never say I'll be right back, because you wont be back". Another reason the movie is great is because they explain that a serial killer without any apparant motive is always scarier(Michael Myers H1, Norman Bates Psycho, Hannibal Lecter Silence of the Lambs, and Phone rambler Black Christmas). Which I do strongly agree with. The thing that I love about this movie is that the killer's are so inventive with their style and methods.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's your favorite scary movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mine's Scream. I love this movie so much! I will never get tired of watching it. My favorite genre is most definitely horror to begin with, and so for me this movie was perfect, because it's not the cheesy, Prom Night (which is ironically mentioned in this movie), that never scares you and all it's focused on is big breasts and naked girls in the locker room. It's better than that...it actually has a plot and a story to it (contrary to what Scary Movie may say about it.). Neve Campbell, in my opinion is one of the worst actresses to ever hit the movie screen, and they could have done a lot better casting for her role. Matthew Lillard is gorgeous and I want him, although all the other girls seem to have a thing for Skeet Ulrich, who was very good in the movie, but not really the cutest guy who could have played, Billy. Rose McGowen was extremely funny and although I don't care for her in real life she did a fantastic job in this film and should receive more credit for it. Courtney Cox is also probably one of my favorite characters in this. She's so funny and she's not even supossed to be. The anamosity between her and her cameraman is laugh out loud hysterical most times and the friction between her and Neve, and the sexual tension between her and David Arquette is hilarious in itself as well.The inside stuff is the best part too. There are so many things that I still pick up when I'm watching it. For instance, one of the last scenes of the movie, Jamie Kennedy is sitting on a couch watching Holloween with Jamie Lee Curtis, and while the killer is standing behind him, he's saying aloud to himself, "Look behind you, Jamie, behind you!" It's pretty funny stuff.Great lines and humor while the first time you see it, if you're not used to these Teen Screams, may be scary, but after the first time it's just like watching a comedy. Not a You've Got Mail, thank God, but definitely lighter than some horror movies. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 and can't wait to see it again!That is the end of my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will anyone hear you scream!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hit horror film with a sharp tongue busted into theaters in the fall of 1996, and it was an instant sleeper hit, more notable for its terrifying opening with star Drew Barrymore. After a pair of killings in the Woodsboro community, police begin to investigate who's behind the slayings, realizing that it shamelessly connects to riddles of past horror movies. And when one of the victims are targeted by the mask maniac, she soon understands that she's also merely apart of the game. The killer uses telephone trivias and threats to ring up the suspense, then pounces out from where ever with a knife ready to fillet you like a fish. But with all the murders going on, there is still fun being poked at how to survive a horror movie, thus, a killer with the same murderous tendencies. If you know your movies, you will know how to avoid being killed. There are rules and they must be followed. All of this makes Scream a fun time, a classic, that really did not need a sequel, but when there's money, you have another movie. Rated ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing this movie, all I could remember hearing was how frighteningly original it was. The success of B-Movies like this can be attributed, in part, to their socko advertising campaigns. In reality, the film is not very original. Actually, it's not a very good movie, period. It's the usual fare--physically perfect teenagers are lined up for slaughter in the knife wielding hands of an immortal mass-murderer. That's it. That's the plot for which Kevin Williamson deserves an academy award for best screenwriter, and Wes Craven for best director. Later, Williamson--who hereafter shall be referred to as Scribe Wunderkind--went on to achieve even greater fame with his equally horrible script for _Halloween H20_.Slasher fans will embrace this movie for its gore effects. If you're a traditional horror fan like myself, there's not much here for you; if _Scream_ was intended to be a parody, then it succeeded beyond Craven's wildest dreams because it is not scary. For scary, you must go to John Carpenter, who already explored this territory definitively--even brilliantly--in 1978.</fullReview>

Besides, how could scary movies be complete without psychos or monsters. Ghostface is an unforgettable killer. Every Halloween people wear a costume sort of like Ghostface. Roger Jackson who did the voice for Ghostface did the voice for Mojo Jojo in THE POWERPUFF GIRLS. It was followed by 2 sequels and there were real murders based on the first 2 movies.

		<shortDescription>Above average for the slasher sub-genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is NOT your average, mindless slasher flick. Scream: a real psychological breakthrough in the genre of slasher movies.This movie demonstrates a most excellent advancement in the genre of slasher flicks. Let me begin by saying this is NOT a flick; a flick being a fluffy little piece of nothing designed to make money and nothing more, OR a movie which is so low budget (or the acting is so bad) that it can't do anything but make you laugh, regardless of the subject matter. This is a quality production. The direction was wonderful and the acting was believable. The key to this movie, in my opinion, is three-fold.(1) The characters seem to realize they are in a horror movie. They quote movies, site movies and refer to movies all throughout the dialog. This, to me, adds to this production, and establishes it as an homage to the horror genre in general. This is a serious parody; not meant to be amusing, but rather, thought-provoking. Randy points out to his friends (and the audience) all the basic rules of surviving a horror movie, as if he knows the now-famous quote by John Lennon that "Nothing is Real."Randy's rules for Surviving a Horror Movie.1. You can never have sex.2. You can neither drink nor do drugs. It's a sin; an extension of Rule #1.3. Never EVER under any circumstances say, "I'll be right back," because you won't be back. You'll be dead.(2) The citing of actual movies and events by the characters lends a total reality to this production that lacks in others where they actually make UP movies to site and critique rather than being bold enough to work real movies into the script. ("You can only hear that Richard Gere/gerbil story so many times before you start to believe it." Tatum) Perhaps they are afraid of being accused of endorsing certain movies, while slighting other directors'/actors' work.Regardless of the reasoning behind it, this movie grabs the bull by the horns and makes you believe the characters are real. You have the uncanny feeling that you are watching actual live footage of these people, rather than characters on a screen, that's how realistically these characters are portrayed.(3) The characters are SENTIENT. They realize there are consequences. They aren't mindless victims/killers. In a very poignant scene, the killer asks of the victim, "Did you really call the police? My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me!" in a tear-filled, pathetically whiny voice. It lends to the scene a certain reality that it would have otherwise lacked. The whole movie is blessed with these "reality checks," helping to make it more and more believable.Neve Campbell is completely believable; her character (Sidney Prescott) seems real and is so beautifully portrayed by Ms. Campbell that she has fully established her gift as a thespian. I do sincerely hope that she is not type-cast in horror movies for the duration of her career. Her talents could well be used in any leading role, in any genre. Her list of credits is already quite impressive, all things considered.Her character is not one of those horror movie heroines who falls down while running from the killer, who can't keep her head straight in a real crisis, or who proves inept and incapable of fending off an attacker. Her character is brave, and strong, and capable. I LOVE that!!The character development was so rich and deep, further lending credibility and reality to this production. Above the feeling of watching live footage, you feel as if you personally know the characters and care about what happens to them. This is key in ANY good movie.Henry Winkler was amazing in his role as the principal of Woodsboro high school. This is the first serious role in which I have admired his abilities. I hope it is not the last. He demonstrated a quality in this movie that I have never before seen in his performances. Even Wes Craven makes an appearance as "Fred the Janitor" in Winkler's most poignant scenes.As this story unfolds, you will be blown away. This is one of the best movies of the genre of "slasher," and also rates with "The Game," "Fallen," "Psycho," and a much later movie, "Identity," in the psychological thriller Hall of Fame.A most excellent movie; totally awe-inspiring soundtrack that works with the movie SO WELL. It is endearing to see a director take so much care with every little detail of a work; so much so that this is a true work of art. It is believable, watchable (if from behind a pillow, your half-closed hands, or your knees), and downright SCARY. Truly, I find those movies which tap into the category of "that which could actually happen" to be the scariest. This is definitely one of those movies. I have the whole trilogy right next to "Halloween," "Halloween 2," and "Halloween H20" in my collection. I honestly think this movie tops "Halloween," if only by a small bit.The twists are so amazing they will leave you sitting there with your mouth wide open.It gets a full 8.89/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A two gruesome murders in a peaceful community of Woodsboro shocks everybody. The killer was dressed in a ghostmasked suit. The killer called up his victim Casey a 17- year old girl and at first the conversation is just weird. Then it turns deadly as Casey is told if she does not answer questions right her boyfriend will be killed. She answers it wrong it is killed along with her boyfriend. Now it seems that Sydney and her friends are targeted by the same killer. It will keep you guessing who the killer is till the end.  Ok this movie is just great!!! Wes Craven in a genius. It has lots and lots of gore which bothered me both it also had a lot of jump scenes which i love. There were tons of horror movie references, and a cameo from Mr. Craven himself. Another great thing is they made the high school kids, look and act like high school kids. a must rent for all who love horror movies!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People may have expected 'Scream' to be a typical, boring teen-horror movie, but it was the complete opposite. The plot may have been typical, but it wasn't worn and the script was well written and clever. It's no wonder that the sequels did so well in the box office and the stars were willing to come back for all three. They are very good movies overall and fun to watch with people who haven't seen them to see how frightened they are. I give it a 9.0 rating out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream: 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is in the same category as The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. They've been parodied so much it seems like the movie is just a parody of it. Scream is a parody, but an unfunny parody, of the teen slasher flicks of the 80's, such as Halloween and Friday the 13th. In it, a masked killer runs around trying to kill a helpless teenager in a quiet, idyllic small town. Unlike, say, A Nightmare on Elm Street (which was cleverly referenced with `Fred the janitor'), Scream actually had some good scary parts to it, making it a great horror/slasher film, which it didn't want to be.Sidney (Neve Campbell)'s mother was raped and murdered a year ago. Her father is going out of town. A masked killer has already killed Casey (Drew Barrymore) and her boyfriend, and it looks like Sidney's next! Nobody's safe from the masked killer in the famous mask (based on Munch's `Scream' painting), but it's up to Sidney to figure out who he is and why he's killing everyone. I'm not a huge gore fan (but I am a huge Gore fan, pardon the political `humor'), but I'm not squeamish, and I wanted Scream to have a little more gore, but I wasn't complaining. Red was abound but not realistic (I'll get to that later), but I'm happy that Wes Craven didn't go for the PG-13 audience. This would not have worked as PG-13.What makes Scream so scary is that it's more realistic than other slashers. The killer kills in a realistic way (such as, not attacking in dreams), and the victims fight back, knocking out the killer. The killer is real, not some fictional being that exists in the head of the teenagers. The acting is very good for this type of movie, with the standout being Barrymore, who's billed high but is only in a little bit of the movie. Also, I liked all of the horror movie references, and how it's sort of a huge meta-reference. Overall, Scream is a screamingly good time that won't disappoint.My rating: 8/10Rated R for strong graphic horror violence and gore, and for language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scream"'s opening, with Drew Barrymore being toyed then destroyed by the masked killer, is surely now legendary, and indeed the only scary part of the film. The best realised part is Drew being dragged away from her torturously close parents, trying to scream out to them, but not able to. It's actually quite touching. But it all goes downhill from there.Firstly, "Scream" isn't scary. It actually works a lot better as a comedy than it does a horror film, as writer Kevin Williamson has a much better affinity with one liners and comedic rants than he does actual horror- but it was right to pitch this film as genuine horror, as otherwise it would have been farcial. Essentially, there are only two death scenes- the opening and the stretched out finale- and so through the rest of the film we are left to concentrate on the characters. This is always risky for a horror film. Luckily, though, the protagonist is generally interesting, and played by a capable actress- Neve Campbell. Her character Sydney faces an interesting and indeed scarier inner conflict than a frankly clumsy killer in a cheesy mask: what if her dead mother, enshrined in her memory, was in fact not the person Sydney would like to pretend she was?With this sort of pseudo-hip flick, cast is everything. Luckily it's not too bad. Courteney Cox is impressive and genuinely funny (in a very non-Monica way) as Satan in lime green heels, Gail Weathers. Rose McGowan plays Sydney's spunky best friend, and while personally I don't seem to enjoy her as an actress or as totty, she shines in this role(particularly in the exchange between her and Sydney just befoe the party, when McGowan's character is in the awkward position of trying to break something painful to a close friend- Sydney's mom was "maybe a very unhappy woman"). And at least she's a more interesting choice than some bland Sarah Michelle Hewitt flavour of the week.Skeet Ulrich is a little over the top in this, and is frankly just bad at the climax. When he screams the line "Movies don't create psychos- they just make them more inventive" you squirm, because he's not the sort of actor who can pull of incandescent. I was surprised to find I enjoyed Mathew Liliard's performance, as normally I can't stand him. He still has this mind numbingly irritating habit of sticking out his tongue like some inane drunken snake from time to time, but his manic, over the top persona suits the role perfectly, and gives personality to the most underwritten of "the kids". Jamie Kennedy is excellent as the comedic heart of the film, and gets one of the most sympathetic characters, while David Arquette, as Deputy Dewey, is annoying for any time over a minute, but funny in small doses ("Hello?...").The plot? Well, while usually in Hollywood teen fodder plot is minimal, there's lots of plot in this- it just doesn't make sense. At all. Why does Liliard's character pretend to kill Ulrich's? It's ridiculous to think the pair would wait a whole year between killings if they're this het up. And so on and so on. But hey, it's a popcorn horror film, no one cares.As for the idea of it being taboo busting or groundbreaking in any sense- I think not. It proclaims that it breaks the horror rules, but it never does. Sydney might technically loose her virginity, but she does so with integrity, love and trust shining in her heart. Figuratively, she's still "The Virgin" of the piece, so her survival, despite having had sex, isn't groundbreaking at all, and is utterly predictable. Indeed, "Scream" is a lot more conservative than most horror. All the bland/sympathetic characters survive. Cox plays a bitch, but we see her sweet side, so she lives. McGowan's character was too spunky, cynical, and self assured to be guaranteed a sequel card. Keeping HER alive and killing off Randy or Dewey (or both) would have been truly original, but oh well.As for the famed pop culture references- I personally find them jarring. In other pieces of entertainment- for example "Buffy"- they work, because they used for comedy and not mere name dropping for the sake of it. When Sydney says that her town under curfew is like some other horror film, it's unnecessary and takes you out of the film. Some of the references are witty, though- the Tori Spelling line even got paid off in the sequel (which also has a frightening opening followed by an hour and a half of nothingness).Overall, a good cast, lots of good (and some bad- the constant use of pop-psychology is lazy and grating, and cheapens the only interesting issues) dialogue, and an intruiging protagonist, leads to a so-so film that doesn't entirely work (as either a comedy or horror), but is fairly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another original contribution by Wes Craven.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven has provided audiences with original, entertaining work which has left their indelible mark on the movie world. One only has to mention 'Nightmare on Elm Street' for it to be seen that he is a director who has made a massive impact on the horror genre. Both movies had large followings and produced characters that will be long remembered. Creating characters that become icons within a genre is difficult and Craven has produced two. Not only is it because the material is so original, it is also because Craven uses a talented cast who appeal to present day audiences. He is able to blend classic horror, that is, the bogeyman with the mask who stalks the main characters from the shadows, with the window dressing provided by photogenic actors and actresses which is obligatory for today's movies. In effect he has made horror movies appealing to mass audiences ? something that only the very best could do. This has been accomplished by way of numerous means. As previously mentioned, the cast - window dressing - are usually fresh, bright, young talent. They can act. There is also a story of note. The central characters are all engrossed in conflict with each other and this is not only due to the fact that the characters have been created with a lot of personality differences, but also because they are given real dilemmas. A good example is in 'Scream' where Sydney is struggling to come to emotional terms with her mother's death and she then also has to deal with Gale Weathers who questions the legitimacy of her testimony which put away the main suspect. She also has to deal with her mother's promiscuity. This is a great basis for conflict and has a high degree of believability. In the hands of two good actresses, it enhanced the movies plot.The suspense is of such a high level, that you could argue the fact that this movie leans more towards suspense thriller rather than horror. Although it is argumentative, I believe that this movie is still rightfully classified as horror rather than suspense since the suspense is a catalyst for the horror. The suspense sets us up for the horrific scenes. The suspense thus provides a service rather that it being the recipient of a service.In accordance with present day adaptations of teenagers on screen, they are insightful with understandings of relationships, but not the emotional maturity to deal with them. This is well used within 'Scream' as the main characters have insight into the 'rules' of horror movies, but still put themselves at risk for the climatic sequence where they are secluded and vulnerable although probably feeling safe in numbers.Neve Campbell is excellent as the fragile Sydney Prescott. She has an extremely fragile way of speaking which makes her more vulnerable to the villain. She aptly portrays the emotional turmoil which seems to sap her characters strength. Her ability to show the dilemma concerning her testimony towards Cotton Weary aids in the audience acceptance of her trusting of her boyfriend - would she be able to deal with another questionable accusation? Given her portrayal, we think not.Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard are equally commendable. Ulrich does not get too offbeat when his characters true intentions are shown. This keeps the transition more plausible. Lillard remains as over the top as he was before which thus keeps his character consistent and hence believable. They were the best villains of the franchise and were a healthy contributing factor to the first movies success and its reputation, earned quite correctly, as the superior.You could not comment on 'Scream' without mentioning Kevin Williamson. He is the one who after all provided the seed for the most successful horror movie. Although he penned a few of the movies that followed on the success of this one, this is still the gem. The audience is kept guessing throughout and suspects are numerous meaning that some members of the audience may have changed their minds on several occasions as to who the villain is. Who guessed that there were two of them? Not many, of that I am very sure. There is ample plot here to keep attention as well as multi - layered conflict. This gave a new dimension to the slasher flick and redefined the genre for the 90's.This movie is not reverential of the genre. It rather pokes fun at the 'rules' that moviemakers kept to in order to operate within the genre. Success of a movie meant that others would follow and many similar movies were produced which were mostly a paler version of the source of inspiration or source of plagiarism, as would have often been the case in order to secure sound revenue. Audiences became indoctrinated with the same ideas and thus familiarity gave birth to contempt. Although this is true, the ?rules' must be kept to even within the most original script. A fine balancing act needs to be struck. It is important to note that all genres have their own set of rules which must be abided by if audiences are going to identify with the movie. Notwithstanding this fact, movies made for the drive - in theatre age, the B grade support flick, generally followed these ?rules' without much attention to plot and were therefore ridiculed. 'Scream' makes the most of this. It could have so easily fell into the spoof movie trap, but does not thus securing its place in movie history. Of more importance, it reignited the genre which had long been without a leading torch. The last one was ?Elm Street' and this is not coincidence that the director was Wes Craven. He is that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is beyond cool!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I've never been a horror movie fan, I didn't know who Wes Craven is. I never have the interest to watch horror classics such as Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street. I didn't know the REAL killer in Friday the 13th. Well, All of that changed after I saw Scream in 1996. I don't believe that someone like Kevin Williamson (an unknown writer) could pull off the humour and the cleverness in a horror movie. But he did it. From the scary opening scene to the neat ending, he provided a nice simple plot, lots of gruesome killings, and sharp, funny dialogue. In Scream, most of the characters knew horror movies. The knew horror movies usually sucks, so they just making fun of it. But when the real killer appeared, every one of them do exactly the same stupid thing the fictional characters do in movies. From that day, after I saw Scream, I'm a huge fan of Wes Craven. The guy has vision. He can create a very thrilling scene with lost of humour. That's why I adore him and that's why I love this movie. Movie fans out there? Did you know that horror movies are made these days because the success of Scream? Scream is the only slasher flick that reached the 100 million mark domestically. Scream is sort of cinematic history. It ressurect the horror genre, it create the trend of teen-flick, and it launched the career of some hottest young stars. I give it an A+. This movie is way too cool</fullReview>

But one by one each of her friends are being picked off as well.The part where I said how it's about the killers being after her, which they are supposed to be, became irrellevent halfway through the movie due to the fact that the killers who going after anybody.

		<fullReview>Enjoyable film directed by Wes Craven about a group of people who have watched far to many horror movies. A Girl gets killed and soon there are people being suspected for her murder but it is not just that also that she was murdered like in a horror movie. The plot is pretty good and it is a fresh idea . the Film is enjoyable but Scream has often been a bit misunderstood over the years. Some horror fans hated it, teenagers who had not seen a lot of horror movies loved it and then were perhaps people like me who loves horror movies but tries not to look Scream as a great horror flick. Scream is not exactly 100% original but that is the beauty part of it. It is so formulatic. It takes all these lines and killings from films such as Halloween, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Prom Night etc and creates a story about people who are really into this and SPOILERS eventually want their lives to be in a horror movie so they start to kill. Overall a good thriller and a comedy that works and has great cinematography however the acting could have been better 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is unfortunate that this movie redefined the modern slasher film and spawned so many bad imitators, but I can't fault the source...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(***1/2 out of *****)I guess most `true' slasher fans are supposed to hate this movie, because it was almost solely responsible for taking the once-controversial (and generally condemned) slasher genre and making it wildly popular with the teen crowd by cramming it with the latest teeny-bopper stars and making the dialogue pop-culturally hip and winkingly self-referential. Well, I agree that this series has influenced a slew of lame imitators ("I Know What You Did Last Summer," "Valentine,' 'Urban Legend,' etc., etc., etc.), but I'm sorry, Craven and writer Kevin Williamson make a good team -- I enjoyed this movie. It's clever, it's funny, the actors are mostly likable, and -- in spite of all the cutesy, tongue-in-cheek dialogue -- there are a few suspenseful (and quite violent) scenes to boot. And rather than out-right spoofing slasher movies (like the seriously UNfunny "Scary Movie" series), Craven and Williamson pay homage to this ?70s/?80s genre (they reference everything from "Halloween" to 1974's "Black Christmas" to even lesser-known stuff, like the 1981 slasher "Happy Birthday to Me.") It is unfortunate that this series has seriously changed the ways in which slasher/horror films are made today, but, honestly, has the genre really been going anywhere since, like, the late ?80s? David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and Jamie Kennedy are the most fun to watch here, and also in the cast are Neve Campbell, Johnny Depp--er--I mean Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Drew Barrymore, and Rose McGowan.HIGHLIGHT: The opening murder scene -- with Barrymore, telephone in hand, being stabbed and gutted on her front lawn, just a few feet away from her parents -- disturbs me every time I watch it.</fullReview>

This all star cast gives out information about horror movies. I've watched horror films when I was younger and this movie is some what educational. I called Scream: Horror 101. Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Skeet Ulrich, and many other stars have put some magic into this movie. It starts off with some horror questions, then the scare factor builds the rush for the victims. I liked the part where Matthew Lillard's character said, "I'll be right back!" Even though he was one of the culprits. Sydney(Neve Campbell) let it all out in the seduction scene with the killer as well. Altogether, I think everyone in the movie are all suspects, but when the smoke clears, it's all over. And this movie wasn't a wasted effort whatsoever. I've enjoyed every bit of it.

		<shortDescription>Screaming For More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox-Arquette, Skeet Ulrich, Jamie Kennedy, Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, W. Earl Brown, Henry Winkler, Joseph Whipp, and Drew Barrymore.On one night in the town of Winnsboro, California, a girl named Casey was called numerous times by a person with a disguised voice. Then, the person attacked her and gutted her with a hunting knife. After that the killer hung her from a tree limb. The next day, the school was like a circus. A girl named Sidney and her friends kept talking about the murders since they knew the girl. Then that night, Sidney is called and attacked by the killer. When the killer leaves, her boyfriend Billy come through the window to see if she was okay. Then a cell phone falls out of his pocket, leaving him as the prime suspect. The police arrests Billy, but they find that he didn't make the calls. One of Sid's friends has a party at his house that night, and in which nosy reporter Gale Weathers has planted a secret camera in the house. Sidney realizes that the murders are starting to occur exactly one year after her mother was murdered. Who is committing these murders? There's only one way to find out.This movie was more than I expected. A very good Horror movie. Jamie Kennedy was hilarious, and so was David Arquette in a way. Problably the best Horror movie since A Nightmare on Elm Street, which was also Directed by Wes Craven. 3 out of 4. My IMDB Rating: 7.5/10. Rated R for Graphic Violence, Language, Substance Abuse, and some Sexual Content.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREATEST HORROR MOVIE EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD!! really great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert I know some people think it's the worst movie ever. mainly because half of the world saw it on video. if you saw it in the theaters it had more of an impact on you because it featured more gore and violence than on VHS or DVD. the sound in the theater was louder so it made you jump more. ANYWAY this is the best movie ever. My favorite character in the original was TATUM. she was funny. i was mad when she died. i think she should've survived for the sequel. For some reason Parker Posey's charactor Jennifer in part 3 reminded me of her. The last movie isn't written by kevin williamson. i was surprised when i found out.FOR ALL THE SCREAM HATERS:BUY SOME SURROUND SOUND SPEAKERS AND SCATTER THEM AROUND YOUR LIVING ROOM. TURN YOUR SPEAKERs UP AS LOUD AS THEY CAN GO. WATCH SCREAM AT 12:00 A.M. MIDNIGHT ALONE. THEN YOU'LL BE SCARED, YOU'LL SEE. YOU'LL ALSO BE A FAN OF THE TRILOGY.-Dewey:he's my superior.-Tatum:a janitor is your superior.-going so soon. i wouldn't hear of it. fly my little darlings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is the Halloween of the nineties and is a horror masterpiece which sees Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson team together to form this great film. It is focused on a town called Woodsboro which is being terrorised by a Psychopathic Killer. Scream stars top names like Courtney Cox, Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich and Drew Barrymore, to name a few and the standard of acting is terrific. I recommend this film to anyone as it has something for everyone ? horror, action and sometimes very dry humour. Scream is a masterpiece that pokes fun at itself. I rate it 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is pretentious to criticize this movie, one of the best horror films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having suffered through numerous boring, stupid, overrated horror movies in my life, I found this one to be refreshingly excellent. Really, critics, with all the junk out there, isn't this movie a gift? It is scary, smart, well-acted and well-done cinematically. Scream III did suck. I hope people are unmerciful in their criticism of that pile of junk. But I think it is disingenuous to criticize Scream. By the way, the Drew Barrymore scene at the beginning is one of the most frightening and memorable in the history of horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite scary movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie about 4 years ago. I was one of those people who thought scary movies were disgusting and very pointless, however, after my friend and I watched Scream at his house, my mind was changed. To stop right there, I still found most of those other movies still very unentertaining. I fell in love with Scream because it certainly redefined the horror genre. Some say it is the child of Halloween, but after recently watching Halloween for the first time, I can now say that that is totally untrue. Halloween was all bark and no bite, period. Scream, though, is very funny, thrilling, suspenseful, and quite thought provoking. Since seeing it I have seen tons of other horror films and none of them live up to Scream, at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genre changing movie that has destroyed what horror used to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie and when I first saw it, I was amped up when I found out there was going to be a sequel. However, in retrospect I wish they hadn't made this movie. If you look at recent horror movies that are widely released you will see that horror movies suck unless you know about independent movies that film studios wouldn't touch. This is more or less a parody of horror movies. I would never have commented on this movie, however, I see that everyone thinks it's so great. If you are a fan of movies such as Dead Alive(by the now lame Peter Jackson), Re-Animator and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you hate the fact that this movie exists. Every horror movie except for the Ring is copying Scream. Think about every horror movie you see at the movies or hear about... all you have are a bunch of WB actors running around showing that they really aren't that talented and some aren't even that goodlooking. Wes Craven is a master of genre redefining movies. Last House on the Left, Nightmare on Elmstreet and New Nightmare were all awesome movies. But now we are stuck with gay movies such as Soul Survivors, They and Valentine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as purist will make it out to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I guess you can say I am a purist horror fan , and alot of fans hated Scream as being a lame teen oriented wannabe horror movie. Well I saw Scream when It came out more as a parody on horror cliches , not so much as a horror film itself. It is loaded with horror buff in jokes and references to old horror classics , but it also has a teen idol kind of vibe which turned alot of fans off , and gained alot of boppers. Scream is actually a good movie..the sequels werent all that great , and it isn't quite Wes Craven's shining moment but it is a nice take on the horror scene. It wasn't really that scream sucked so much..it was the after math of it's success. Before Scream's success , there wasn't a single theatrically released horror/slasher movie in years , the aftermath of Scream's success created this bubblegum teen star type of horror movie. It would be loaded with the trend of the hip hop alternative era , the leading roles would go to WB network stars or any other teen pin up idol , and it would be very tame and lack any horror elements that made films of the past so great , they basically all just ripped off this movie which is why it is so disliked by purist horror fans. I myself like it..I think it's a good movie and I will defend it as a parody thriller , not a horror movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better now than when it came out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard a bunch of crap lately about how "The Ring" is SOOOO scary. About how it's the first great horror film since "The Exorcist," and how it blows "Scream" out of the water. Well, folks, I've seen both films, "Scream" many times, and "The Ring" twice, and I have to say, "Scream" is better. By a longshot. Fans of "The Ring" gripe a lot that "Scream" was an over-rated teen slasher film. I will give them that. It is over-rated, maybe because when it came out, there had not been a good teen slasher flick since "A Nightmare on Elm Street," although I'm not really a fan of that title. Also, it seemed cool; it was in that mid-90's cool dialogue trend, where every movie thought it was written and directed by Tarantino or Kevin Smith. So when this thing came out, hey, it was cool. It was cool to see a teen slasher movie MAKE FUN of itself. It was also good to see Wes Craven finally get a good movie, probably his best, and to see Neve Campbell light up the big screen with her radiant smile and perfect "girl-next-door" mannerisms. And it was over-rated. Like many other over-rated flicks of the 90s, "Titanic," "The Blair Witch Project," "The English Patient," it was forgotten in about 6 months. The sequels didn't help. While they weren't bad, not bad at all really, they sort of insulted the superior tone of the first film by cashing in on a statement AGAINST such actions. And of course, we got "I Know What You Did Last Summer," "Valentine," "Urban Legend," and dozens of other movies EXACTLY LIKE THIS ONE that all pretty much sucked. But I watched this movie again the other day. And you know what? It's better now than when it came out. Like "Psycho" or "Halloween," this movie is the best of its particular sub-genre. We're watching the BEST way this type of movie can be made. We saw the sequels. The rip-offs. "The Ring." Now we see how much better this movie is than those, and we see it in a whole new light. "Scream" is not a great, great movie, no: The story line goes haywire at the end and wayyyy over-the-top. But it's a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like the film; hate the fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not that the fans spoil any secrets or anything, I just hate how seriously the viewers take it as though before Scream they knew nothing about horror cliches, and now they quote Scream as though it will make them some sophisticated horror critic. Sorry guys, it's a running a joke--it's mocking unintentional repetition in older horror films which kept coming back because most were B grade and couldn't afford a decent writer to come up with something good and/or original.Now, after Scream, we have films that feel obligated to meet Scream's horror requirements as though it'll be just as humorous as it was in Scream only no one's laughing any more. We're groaning. Now that they're requirements, it's not a funny thing that just caught on among bad films unintentionally. No, it's like the last guy at the party hears the joke and expects everyone else to laugh at him for telling it even though we've heard it a thousand times tonight already.Now Scream is the horror bible with its "Rules to survive a horror film." And anyone and everyone know is anything in horror worships this concept. I don't think so. It was funny that *a* film finally brought to light trends of crappy horror films in the past, mocks them, and ultimately commits the same crime but somehow hovers above the films it mocks. This self awareness allows us to take it both as a satire and horror film, as both good while mocking the bad. And most importantly, it's interwoven into the plot and that made the whole film. The "Rules" were never intended to be taken outside of the film and applied everywhere else. Get a grip, people, and notice that all the *good* horror films do not follow, rather, they break those rules. Despite what Randy claims, Halloween does not follow those rules either as stated by John Carpenter, himself.Scream delivered the welcome break of awareness of existing horror films, which does mark a welcomed turning point--that we're tired of idiotic slashers where the characters couldn't escape from Elmo if he turned Psychotic. Wes Craven effectively returns to the forefront of horror direction with this front, making the script work, and work well. Overall, despite the people who look back and bash it, Scream was a very good horror film with more pros outweighing the inevitable cons. The idea and originality behind it, it's self criticizing nature, added a new complexity and sophistication to the formula. And despite what many people say, the number of spin offs and films now sporting cinema-aware characters proves Scream's success and acceptance in general among all audiences.Most people despise Scream for also inspiring another trend of mainstream horror films that followed--the "teen horror" subgenre as it is known, which Scream did kick off and is responsible for. However, Scream really is not a part of that subgenre; it's in its own little category by itself. Psycho spawned the god-awful TCM, which is heralded as a triumph in horror despite it's lack of anything inspiring or worth watching. Later Psycho inspired the well executed Halloween, which spawned the infamously bad series Friday the 13th, which spawned countless imitators not even worth mentioning (the same films Scream for the most part concentrates on while mocking.) So technically, Psycho spawned all the slashers, good and crappy--why not jump on the hate bandwagon and actively bash it too?Good job Wes, and it's a shame that Scream suffered the inevitable with its sequels. Even with the same level of satire, same selfawareness that sequels generally get worse and worse and more humorous (as they obey that 'law') it just didn't seem funny anymore. Oh well . . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive slasher movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING * SPOILERS * I went to see a late night screening of 'Scream' about six years ago and i have to say i was blown away. In my personal view, Scream is the ultimate slasher movie. Never mind the likes of the over rated Halloween. Scream does for many people what it says on the box. Make you scream. The opening scene alone will do this in spades. The story is quite good for it's genre. A number of teenagers in the small town of woodsboro are stalked by a masked killer (Wearing a ghost mask and black robe with hood) who phones them. He then proceeds to ask the intended victim questions on horror movie trivia. If they get one wrong then it's curtains. While this is going on, young Sidney Prescott (portrayed effectively by Neve Campbell). A teenage girl is trying to still come to terms with the brutal murder of her mother a year earlier. What makes this even more difficult is the apearence of tabloid television news reporter Gale wethers(A scene stealing Courtney Cox). She, along with her cameraman are covering the brutal killings in Woodsboro. An uncaring vulture, Gale is an amazing anti-heroine. Constantly she gets in Sidney's face only to have it pounded. In on the hunt for the masked killer is David Arquette's Dewey Reiley. The Geeky Deputy sheriff of Woodsboro and brother to Sidney's best friend Tatum (The fiesty Rose McGowan). Dewey is the perfect foil to Gale and a unlikely relationship begins that runs through the two sequels. An endearing geek Dewey is rivaled only by Randy(Played well by the talented Jamie Kennedy). The ultimate movie geek and possibly the best character in the trilogy Randy should never have met a grisly demise halfway through 'Scream 2' His wise words on the cliches of the horror genre were part of how Scream took jabs at it self. The final twist however is the real revelation. Proving that the writers have accounted for everything and left no stone unturned. Rather than there being one killer. We're presented with two. Sidney's sex obsessed boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Urich) and Tatums crazy boyfriend Stu (Matthew Lillard) who shrieks that immortal line 'It's a scream baby'. The reasoning for the carnage they have commited is both conflicting. Both reasons are contradicting of one anther and ends Scream on a note that there are sometimes motives for why people kill and sometimes there are not. Each killer has one of the above. Anyway enough of the critique. Just sit back, relax and enjoy Director Wes Cravens finest hour and three quaters. Oh, and don't forget to scream. Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

Neve Campbell is also really good, proving she's one of the most talented actresses in Hollywood. Kevin Williamson wrote such a cool and edgy script, and he really knows how to mix horror with comedy elements. I remember when this first came out, and everyone was like, "have you seen Scream yet?" It was that popular, and it still is today. It has become a major pop culture icon for the teen films of today. I only wish they make a fourth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love scary movies! They are absolutely the most fun to watch! However, the genre seems to be cursed in that it is very hard to put out a decent horror film. Scream has done it!!!Creatively done, a mix of humor and scare, Scream is fun from start to finish. What makes it even better is that this film does not derive its scares from blood and gore (although there is a fair amount of it, especially in the opening scene), but it truly does have you in suspense in many of the scenes. What also adds to this benefit is that the film actually has a plot aside from the slashing that tends to dominate these films. Because of that this film is a whole lot more interesting and captivating. The slashing almost becomes a side part, but still offers a lot of fun to the movie.So for great scares and a whole lot of fun, Scream rates a 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] One evening a girl, Casey Becker, was at home alone. She was planning on making popcorn and watching a movie when she received a phone call from a stranger. Everytime she hung up, he called back. The conversation got a little weird. It started with he asking her what her favorite scary movie was. She replied Halloween. She's got good taste, but truly doesn't know the movie, otherwise she wouldn't have said Michael Myers stalks babysitters. How many times do I have to say that Michael Myers doesn't kill people because they're babysitters! He does it for the heck of it, I guess! Sheesh! What a dumb girl. Anyhoo, the conversation becomes dangerous, especially when Casey sees her boyfriend bound and gagged on the porch. The killer wanted to play a game of movie trivia, if she answered right, he lived. The question: Who was the killer in Friday the 13th? She answered Jason, which was wrong. Mrs. Voorhees did the slaughtering until Part 2. Her boyfriend was killed. Suddenly, the killer appeared and killed Casey. News of Casey's murder spread like wildfire. News reporters all over the school campus. Among them was feisty journalist and author, Gale Weathers, who was a real pile! A group of friends, Sydney Prescott, Billy Loomis, Stu Macher, Tatum Reily, Randy Meeks, and Cotton Weary feel it's something right out of the horror movies. Sydney was nearly attacked by the killer one night and when Cotton came to her aide, a cellphone dropped from his pants. Perhaps he was the killer. But he wasn't. Deputy Dewey escorted Sydney home from the police station when she received a phone call from the real killer, who later took out Tatum. They have a party at Sydney's one night. Stu explains the rules for surviving a horror movie. Pretty soon, the killer showed up and tried to get Sydney. She soon finds out the killer was none other than Billy and Stu! They kill each other and pretty soon Gale Weathers showed up and got the whole story.  My overall opinion: this movie was OK. The beginning was scary. The rest of the movie was just corny! A movie about teens living a horror movie. That's no fun! I'd compare this to I Know What You Did Last Summer, also a dull horror movie. Scream had two worthless sequels. So in conclusion, this is not one of my favorite horror movies, but I'm sure you all will like it, so check it out if you like this particular genre.</fullReview>

Just that, and the sort of cool and funny ending. I hope we won't get more of the genres crap, we have really have enough...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can i say about a movie that awakened the new wave of horror genere on the big screen, Yes, we did get a lot of movies that tried to copy it and turned out to be trash and Yes we got a lot of sequels that we just didn´t need to see (Talk about "I still know" and "Carrie 2")but in the process we got a lot of people to put a buck on horror movies again and we got the genere to live again even if some hardcore genere fans don´t want to admit it. Wes Craven re-invet´s himself with this slasher movie...it´s been a long time since there was an interesting teen mad slasher like this,this guy uses horror movie trivia to kill people,I just loved it. I´m definately a big fan of this movie, everyone was cool in their roles but my favorite actor is Jamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks "The horror movie buff" mabe because i also used to work on a big video store, the big "BBV" if you know what i mean and i really felt identified with him cause he´s suck a snappy and sarcastic guy just like me. Check out Matthew "Shaggy" Lillard as Stuart Matcher, he does a great job here. Check out this movie is worth the watch and i´m very proud to say that i own a movie maniac figure of this cool slasher called "ghostface" from the movie. I´ll give it a 10 out of 10 on Movie Maniac Slashers from the last century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sophisticated Horror Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the average cinema-goer this is just your basic run-of-the-mill teens stalked by nutter in a mask fare. But for a seasoned horror veteran who understands about the basic social significance of the slasher film, having seen every title under the sun this a masterpiece. It is a defining moment of contemporary horror, marking the resurgence of the slasher flick with a self-referential postmodern spin on proceedings. Wes Craven previously explored this with his return to the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise he created with Wes Craven's New Nightmare in 1994 but essentially it is Kevin Williamson's script that delivers the good. Craven's direction is slick as he keeps the action moving fast but with dragged out, tension-filled, brilliant composed scenes. But as a big horror fan I see this film essentially as a comedy, poking fun at the hallmarks of the slasher phenomenon whilst at the same time paying homage to it. It is like a reference book of contemporary horror and it is great and probably knows it is!10/10</fullReview>

Why can't this happen to her in some of her other movies? "Riding in Cars with Boys" anyone, or perhaps "Home Fries"? "Charlie's Angels" - you bet!! I could watch the first 5 minutes of "Scream" over and over again. The rest of the movie is pretty good too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE PLOT: In the small town of Woodsborrow, California a killer is on the loose. However, it is not the first time the town has endured such tragedy. Only a year ago a woman was found raped and murdered in her upstairs bedroom. Now, it seems the killer is after the womans daughter, Sidney. But why?THE ACTING: Neve Campbell gives a powerful and emotional performance as "Sidney Prescott", who is dealing with the loss and murder of her mother. The rest of the cast did equally excellent jobs portraying their characters. Others that stand out are Courtney Cox as the crude reporter, Skeet Ulrich as the strange boyfriend "Billy", and Drew Barrymore as "Casey".THE BLOOD: There is a lot of blood in "Scream". Not for the faint at heart!THE BODY COUNT: 7 (excluding Sidneys mother)THE RATING: This is a classic horror film. Not only did it spawn two equally successful sequels but it also brought back the slasher sub-genre of horror. "Scream" was definitely original and had a great balance of horror, emotion, and comedy. "Scream" deserves 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate it being considered being a great horror film when it isn't even scary. It's not even as good as Urban Legend or I Know What You Did Last Summer. It overshadowed better films than it. If this hadn't had been made neither would have Witchouse (1999)(V). It has a brilliant twist but you'll work it out but not as quick as you worked out The Sixth Sense's twist.The plot is a killer goes around killing teenager[Oh my god! That's even more original than the plot of Lost Souls (2000))]. He has a reason to though and he is obsessed with this one girl called Sidney. Sidney's mother died a year before the killer started killing the teenagers.The performances are good but the outstanding performance is by Neve Campbell.The film is well worth seeing but is well overrated. 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was just as casual 16 year old movie goer when I stepped into the theater to see Scream for the first time. I would see it four more times. Kevin Williamson's love of movies is infectious. Sure, it started with just horror films, but after a while I began to watch whatever I could get my hands on. That, of course, would lead to my decision to go to film school. When I watch the film today, I see a few imperfections, and by no means would I call it the best film of all time, but it is the film that made me want to make films... and that's saying something.</fullReview>

I like how you get to know the characters, and when they're getting killed you feel sorry for them, not many movies do that. All the other horror movies i've seen focus on the gore, and think that the bloodyer it is the scaryer it is, and that is not true. Other movies that copied scream, such as, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urben Legend, Valentine, and all those other crappy movies, dont even come close to the scream trilogy. And they never will make another horror movie as well as they made scream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the Best Horror Film Of The 1990s Easily</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking back on Scream(this is now 6 years later of course),I realize what a true gem this movie is in the Horror Genre,along with the fact that it pretty much saved and brought back the slowly eroding Horror Genre,which had pretty much died in the early 90s. To Sum it up............. The acting was good-to-great in many standards.The leads(Neve Campbell,David Arquette,Courtney Cox) were great,and flat out well casted,although most of the Leads were not really established yet in Hollywood,but thats what made the film so fresh,and new. The supporting Cast of Jamie Kennedy,Skeet Ulrich,Matthew Lillard,Rose McGowan, and Henry Winkler were great as well,as they serve their purpose throughout the movie. Another Thing I liked about the movie,was that the characters really werent stereotypical characters like we have seen in many,many previous Horror Films,especially the 80s.Everyone was pretty much their own character,which is always nice to see,especially when the Hollywood of today insists on having a production factory based on stereotypical characters in all their films. The plot was well executed,and contsructed brilliantly in great syncronization.I wont go into any details,but I must say,I loved the plot,especially because its something knowone really has seen before in this Genre,or in any other Genres all together,it was different,unique,which is why it succeeded. The Direction from Wes was great,as can be expected of him,although I would heavily criticize the work from him on Scream 3,but thats a whole other story. Overall,This movie is great,different,and an unexpected roller coaster that keeps you guessing whats gonna happen until the end.Alot of people can appreciate this movie for what it is,but there are those(and I mean alot of them),who cant stand this movie,because of what was produced in the aftermath of the film,which were horrid imitations like I Know What You Did Last Summer,Urban Legends,etc which is absolutely correct,and I will agree with them,but if they look past all the Horrid movies that came after,they can truly appreciate what Scream did for the Genre,which was saved it,but again its a double edged sword,because some will say it ruined the Genre. Oh well,thats my two cents,I reccomend to any who havent seen it,rent it,then decide if you want to buy it or not....... Bottom line,in my opinion,a true gem in the Horror Genre,any fan of the Genre should check this atleast once..... I'd give it a 8.5-10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Starring: Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, and Skeet Ulrich.There haven't really been any good horror movies since Halloween back in 1978. None of the Friday the 13th were ever intelligent. Do drugs, have sex, get slaughtered are the common formula for a past horror film. This one is far better than that. Sure people get drunk and die but that must happen in order to die. The movie is about a crazed killer who took horror movies a mile too far. (t)he(y) start stalking Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell). A high school party comes and a mystery of the killer starts to be unfolded. The movie has some very scary parts and very hilarious parts ("Jamie, Behind you!) That was funny. I highly recommend this and also recommend its sequel, Scream 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up watching Horror films from the 70's and 80's. While i don't hate the newer Horror movies they are just not my style.But Scream was classic. It had good suspense plus some good laughs if you know anything about Horror films.The movie opens up with Casey Becker(Drew Barrymore) she is making some popcorn and is about to watch a horror film.When her phone rings, on the phone is some man. He says he dials the wrong number. So Casey says it's ok then hangs up. He then calls again, they begin to flirt but the conversation gets real creepy.The man on the phone is playing a game with Casey, and the game turns Deadly as Ghostface appears and kills Casey.In what i must say has to be the best 15min in Horror history.Now Ghostface is stalking Sidney Prescott(Neve Campbell) Sidney is still coming to terms with the rape and murder of her mother a year ago. The man who killed her is Cotton he is serving time in jail for the murder. But is Cotton the man who did it?With the help of Sidney's friends and her Boyfriend Billy Loomis(Skeet Ulrich) she is doing the best she can.As the movie goes on Ghostface continues to call Sidney, and begins to kill off her friends.Deputy Dewey(David Arquette) is on the case and with him is Gale Weathers(Coutntey Cox Arquette).Gale is a reporter trying to solve the murders so she can become famous, but as the movie goes on Gale begins to care more about solving the case then the fame.Randy(Jamie Kennedy) is the horror movie geek, and has some great lines about the rules of a horror movie.Matthew Lillard who plays Stu is also a stand out.And to be honest Rose Mcgowan who played Tatum should have been the lead once again Rose Mcgowan does a fine job like she does in all her work.Scream gave a re-birth to the horror genre. Everything about Scream was good but the horror films to follow for the most part failed.Kevin Williamson who wrote the script for Scream did a great job. It was well written and gave tribute to the old days of Horror mostly John Carpenter's Halloween.Director Wes Craven did an amazing job. Wes Craven once again changed the horror genre this time not for the better though. But his Directing in Scream was great nothing bad i can say about it.While some horror fans hate scream and i can understand why but i loved it.The stand outs are Matthew Lillard has Stu, Jamie Kennedy as Randy and of course Rose Mcgowan as Tatum, and once again i must say Rose Mcgowan should have been the lead.Scream is full of suspense and takes some nice twist and turnsI give Scream 8/10</fullReview>

It really keeps you guessing.This movie also did not get all of its fame from famous actors/actresses because most of them in the movie weren't famous then.

		<fullReview>It's said that "SCREAM" is the best horror film of the 90's. Is it true? Absolutely NO!. Sure, this film gave popularity to the almost dead horror genre in the 90's but this is not a true horror film. It has gore, dumb teens, and an unknown killer but the 90's horror style felt in this movie can't be compared to "that" 80's sensation in a horror movie. "SCREAM" didn't change anything in the way horror movies are produced, it copies the 80's style and it fails in being scary. Remember, gore is not everything in a horror movie. This film lacks of suspense, solid characters, and an effective score.I don't know what the producers of this film tried to create, but something for sure is that it doesn't shines in the horror genre. Horror movies, died in the 90's. and "SCREAM" tried -but failed- in awakening the already dead genre. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie and great bonus DVD.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since there is no section for the Scream: Bonus DVD, I thought I'd use this section. First off Scream was a terrific film that got people interested in the horror genre again and introduced a new kind of horror to a new generation. Scream 2 was one of those rare sequels that either is as good as the original or better. Scream 3 was a great way to end a trilogy, especially during a time when trilogies in the horror/slasher genre or almost non-existence. When the DVD box set came out, I had to get it so I sold my VHS copies so I can build up my money and got it the best chance I could get. When I viewed the 4th discs I was amazed it had trailers from the made up studio Sunrise such as: Stab 2, The Blair Bitch Projectz and more. It also features an opportunity to recreate a scene from Scream 3 in which you can add deleted scenes to the beginning of the movie. This DVD also features audition tapes for Neve Campbell and others. So if you are a true Scream fanatic get this DVD box set while you still can. On another note PLEASE! release the director's cut version of Scream (which is only available on laserdisc at this point). Also release a DVD version that has a cut-scene section, that's the best part about having DVD's. Dimension Films could also release Scream , Scream 2, Scream 3 music video DVD's. Bye for now.</fullReview>

It's the typical story of a beautiful girl, in this case Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) being the target of some sick psycho killer. This one isn't your run of the mill movie though. While it's scary and very suspenseful it's also quite funny at times and you actually care about the characters. This one will keep you guessing! Some all around great performances from Neve Campbell (Party Of Five, The Craft), Drew Barrymore (ET, Firestarter), Rose McGowan (The Doom Generation), Skeet Ulrich (The Craft),and Matthew Lilliard (Serial Mom).

		<shortDescription>This is a killer film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years I've been complaining how all horror films that make it to the big screen in recent memory, have all been more like psychological thrillers. Movies that make you think instead of movies that make you, well, Scream. Remember back in the good old days, the originals of A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, and Halloween? These were films that didn't fool around. They were made just to scare the living daylights out of you, and they did just that. Scream takes place in Smalltown, U.S.A. A girl (Neve Campbell) is being stalked by someone. Coincidently, a year ago her mother was brutally murdered and it was Neve's testimony that put an (innocent?) man in jail. Her stalker, who goes around wearing an outfit taken from the famous painting Scream, knows her every fear, her every thought. Wes Craven has managed not only to return to the good old days of horror films, he also managed to make fun of those same films. One of the twists, and there are many, is that these kids know all about horror films. So they know that instead of running up the stairs when there's a killer in the house, you run out the front door, and never, ever say, "I'll be right back" because you won't. That's what is so fun about this film. It takes all the horror clichés, and turns them around so they're still scary and unexpected. Also, there are actually legitimate actors and actresses, including Courtney Cox and David Arquette (and look for a cameo by Wes Craven himself), that actually make you believe everything that is happening. Scream is one of the best horror films I have seen in years. If you're looking for a good fright, this is a good movie to go see. Just don't watch it alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was 15 when I saw this movie and it scared the crap out of me! It left such a huge impact on me primarily because, being 15 at that time, I actually thought that it was very well-written. What got me from the beginning was Drew Barrymore. Having been a fan of hers for so long, seeing her in a scary movie (pardon the pun) was quite a pleasant surprise. And for a horror movie with interesting plots, twists, and dialogue, the humor still prevailed, thanks to Matthew Lillard (my fave because of Hackers) and Randy (forgot the actor's name, sorry). Neve Campbell was okay as Sydney, she could've been a little less glum. I mean, given that she had just lost her mom and everything, but still. Besides that, all in all, Scream can boast that it was the one imitated, and that they did a great job of "psychologizing" previous horror flicks that had come and gone. Great job, Mr. Craven!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard Wes Craven was directing this movie, I knew this would have to be one to check out. Scream is definitely a worthy horror film and ignore Scream 2 and 3 as the first one is definitely the best.Neve Campbell gave an ok performance as Sidney but Rose McGowen's role as her doomed best friend was really great. Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard were also good although the stand out was Drew Barrymore even though she only had a small part - when she was on screen was the definite highlight of the movie.Courteney Cox Arquette was fantastic as Gale and a welcome change from her tv role. It's great to see when tv actors step out of their character to play someone different on film and she was great as the bitch tabloid reporter, in fact all her movie roles are so far removed from her tv character that she has grown into such a versatile actress and the only reason to watch 2 and 3 as she only gets funnier in each film.The only bad thing about a successful horror after a spate of bad ones is the rush of films in that genre, Scream 1 is a masterpiece in that type of genre and is a rare gem in a more miss than hit genre.This film wouldn't have worked without Wes Craven, he was involved in only A Nightmare on Elm Street 1 and he wrote the 3rd one and then with his New Nightmare in 1994 they were the standouts in that series, and the others were truly missing his genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Done Wes Craven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven is the master of horror in my opinion. Scream was the best horror movie in a long while. Before Scream came out horror fans had been starved of any great horror films.The idea may not be original but it didn't matter; Wes Craven made a good film in Scream. Most people will know the plot. It was great and there was plenty of gore throughout. The best part was trying to guess the identity of the killer. There were so many suspects both male and female and plenty of red herrings throughout the film.The casting for this movie was spot on. Neve Campbell was brilliant as Sidney Prescott and I particularly enjoyed Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers. Credit must also go to David Arquette, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard. This was a great film but unfortunately it spawned a host of imitators none of which could hold a candle to this film (although I Know What You Did Last Summer and it's sequel were very good). I doubt whether anyone who watches this film will correctly guess the identity of the killer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Suspense, not a Horror!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is not a fine line between Horror and Suspense or thriller, the line is big, and fat.. And Scream is by no means a horror.. A slasher, is a type of horror, the most extreme of horror, (lots of killings good to great death scenes, so on..) But a slasher is not a Suspense.. There are many types of Suspense, the average late 90's to 2000's movies with masked killers are in this category, Suspense/Thriller, a thriller is not a horror either, it is like, but simply is not.. How to tell the difference? Well here it is, When you know exactly who the killer is, if he has a mask or not, you know his name and who he is, and why he is killing, not so much the people in the movie all the time, but the viewer knows who he is and doesn't have to spend the entire movie guessing, than you have a horror, possibly a slasher.. When you do have to guess, and you have no idea who the killer is, when the movie as they would say "leaves you on the end of your seat".. ""What's going to happen next!!"" a mystery, where in the end everything comes undone and you find out who was doing the killings, "and I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for these medaling kids!!" Than you have a Suspense/Thriller.. There wasn't enough blood to be a slasher anyways though, well maybe random blood, but not enough skin penetration.. Some say it brought the LONG DEAD teen slasher movies back.. Not true at all!! Horror movies are like Rock music "you can't kill rock n' roll". (ozzy Osbourne) they have never, nor will they ever die.. The curse of Michael Myers was made in 1995 one year before, and Wes Craven's New Nightmare in 1994, and Jason Goes To Hell in 1993, hell The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation was done in 1994, all horror slashers around the same time.. Scream was in 1996. What Scream did for Horror is what Kurt Cobain did for hairbands, it crushed them.. Horror will never be the same, music will never be the same.. Yet still they will both go on.. But sometimes change is good.. I liked the 80's hairbands, but I love some of the great music made today as well.. Same applies for movies.. I liked Scream a lot, it was the first time it looked at horror for what it is, how it was, and how real it can be.. You always see these movies and you think how stupid can these people be, the acting is bad, and you say if I were that person, I wouldn't make that stupid move!! But Maybe that's not true, maybe in panic we all make stupid mistakes, I mean when your watching something it easy to see what is wrong. But when you are the person doing it, when your under the pressure, you can't watch yourself and think about things.. You just do it, in life that is where mistakes are made. Think about it, if you have ever done something in life you wished you had not, I would bet you it wasn't something you spent time thinking about right? Cause if you had thought about it, you wouldn't have screwed up!! This movie was too confused as a horror because of the fact that it is about a bunch of teens, that think of life as a horror movie, they have the, you know,, the famous Jamie Kennedy "There are Certain Rules you must abide by to successfully make a horror movie!" But this doesn't make it a horror, it makes it a look at how a horror is made, kind of like a documentary, in a way.. I liked the guessing in this movie, and the fact that the killer was just a couple of teens them selves.. And it was a great first time movie, nothing beats watching it the first time.. I would say it was the best and the king of Suspense/Thriller!! And I also thought it was one of the funniest thrillers in a while.. "What are you going to tell your parents?"..."peer Pressure, I'm far too sensitive!" (Matthew Lillard).. It's a good movie and I would say you should rent it if you haven't seen it, but if you said you hadn't seen it, than you would be lying now wouldn't you!... In the Suspense/Thriller category I would give it 10 out of 10, because it was the first of it's kind.. In the horror I give it a 0..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think one film could so blatantly RIP OFF Halloween more, but Scream has done it. This film attempts to work around its stolen ideas from such classics as Halloween and When a Stranger Calls by calling it an "homage" - that is hardly what this is. Scream did not "revive" horror, nor did it do anything for the genre. Horror has always been alive, and this sorry excuse (posing as a "thriller" no less) is nothing more than Kevin Williamson's little "how do I make it into movies by stealing good ideas from other movies?" flick that does not deserve the attention it has gotten. Williamson further desecrated the genre by giving us the treatment for Halloween H20, which was basically Dawson's Creek meets a formerly good series and attempts to ruin it. Hopefully Halloween Resurrection will be decent, but with Dimension at the helm, I'm not expecting much. Congradulations Mr. Williamson - you're an inpiration for braindead teeny-boppers across the country!!!!! 0 out of 10....................</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your typical slasher film with a twist. The killer actually tells you what you should and shouldn't do to avoid getting killed. Filled with scares, laughs, and some pretty clever death scenes, (esp. the garage scene.) With this all-star cast including Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowen, Jamie Kennedy, and Drew Barrymore it couldn't go wrong. The story begins when Sydney Prescott is stalked by the same killer that took her mother's life one year ago. Surrounded by suspects that include her best friends, father, and boyfriend, Sydney must try to survive a night of terror. It will keep you on the edge of your seat till the surprise ending. Just remember "the rules", don't pick up the phone, and keep in mind that movies don't create psychos. Psychos make movies more creative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm rarely actually scared by movies. I hate trendy movies that feature people from trendy TV shows. That's why I was truly shocked to have liked Scream as much as I did. The opening scene truly terrified me and I loved the humor of the "scary movie" theme that was carried through the film. Unfortunately, I was turned off immediately when the killer(s) are revealed. Would have been far better if the killer was never caught or identified.I saw Scream 2, knowing it would be terrible compared to the first and I was not proven wrong. Never saw the third film. The first is certainly worth seeing though, with great suspense and great humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream gives an excellent presentation to the horror genre.Over the past six years,many Scream clones have hit the big screen,but Scream still manages to stay out on top,achieving the goal of being a memorable horror movie that has great acting,buckets of blood,and chilling story.Wes Craven made a horror movie that will be remembered due to how much violence this movie contains,its deep,solid acting,and one of a kind story.Now lets keep the main flaws in prespective that this movie has.First off,its a tad predictable,lots of times it focuses to much on certain events in this movie that arent needed,and last,It gets old after you watch it to many times.Other than that,those flaws dont affect the movie.Great movie,watch it! 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can blame this movie for many things.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SCREAM was a slasher flick that is responsible for regenerating the teen slasher category. If it weren't for this film, we would never have seen CHERRY FALLS, FINAL STAB, and many other movies that never should have been brought to the screen. FINAL STAB is one audiences could have lived without seeing. So, looking away from that, what else can I blame SCREAM for? A lot. My reoccuring nightmares maybe!!!! Just kidding. This was a movie that, like so many movies these days, but isn't. The first time I saw it, I was afraid about what would happen next. When the movie ended, I was yelling at myself for being afraid. Because there were no scary moments of this movie. PLOT: masked killer walks around cutting people up, right in places where you would think that someone nearby might hear all of what is going on, but no. That's about all. So, for being no different than any other horror movie made since the 70s, I give this terrible piece of cinematic value 2/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching SCREAM back in '97 when it was released theatrically in the U.K. What an impressive opening I might add, the only problem was realizing where it was ripped off from (i.e "When A Stranger Calls").I will admit that I watched Scream time after time, But for me I feel it has somewhat gone downhill considering the HUGE media publicity surrounding it resulting in a further two sequels being spawned.I'm glad to see how Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson's creative formula worked really well for this flick not to mention that this really helped rejuvenate the horror genre again since there began to be a decline in that particular field. The only problem now is with a large majority of audiences associating this film whenever horror is mentioned as it's getting rather boring.It's interesting to know that films like The Beyond and so many other forgotten classic horror flicks are now beginning to get the recognition they deserve. So in a strange way Scream is partially to thank.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the big fuss all about?! Just another OVERLY self-conscious movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film numerous times, I still can't figure out why it is hailed as one of the greatest horror movies of our time, or why its ?cleverness' is so eagerly acclaimed. I thought that the ?we're talking about horror movies within a horror movie' gimmick drastically ran out of steam after the first few references. From then on, it seemed a blatant case of Craven and Williamson saying "we're not going to bother coming up with anything new, we're just going to make a point of saying ?Hey, we ACKNOWLEDGE that it's been done before so therefore you can't criticise us about it!'" And this feeling permeated the entire movie- Hey lads, you can't base a film solely on in-jokes &amp; movie references?. Oh yeah, and DO NOT drag the classic Halloween into this poor imitation- if you wanted to produce a truly scary, chilling movie, then just put up the money for Halloween to be re-released, or else rent out The Blair Witch Project to see how it should be done.The performances were nothing special, with only Lillard and Kennedy keeping the film afloat with their jokes, and, I don't know about the rest of you, but Marco Beltrami's musical effect that came on EVERY time a character reappeared into the frame annoyed the hell out of me!! The ending I found particularly poor: *SPOILER* I've seen less hemming and hawing about killing people in a James Bond movie, yet here the killers seemed so obviously uncoordinated that its a miracle they got away with it until now- I mean c'mon, even with a smidgen of common sense they would have surely killed Sidney and her father BEFORE stabbing themselves!! As for the identity of the killers, well yes, I wasn't expecting that, particularly the 2 killer twist. But hey, I doubt if ANYONE could've guessed that-- with the amount of red herrings that were given, I could've started a fecking fish farm!All in all, a bog standard horror flick that we have to blame for the ?I know-what-Urban Legend-you-told-last-Valentine's-in-Cherry-Falls H20' trend that followed, not to mention two pointless sequels?. Only watch if u must, but don't expect it to live up to the hype.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is one of my favorite all time films! Everything about just rings perfect, the cast, the direction, the script. Yes, it did spawn other evil teen horror movies that sucked incredible crap but that shouldn't strike any points against it, it is time a remarkable film. Purposely blurring the lines between reality and fiction it comments on our society's obsession with the media. Neve plays it wonderfully straight, David Arquette creates one of the best characters in horror cinema history and Courtney Cox is a wonderfully bitchy back-up to the whole cast. Even Matt Lilard and Rose McGowan are wonderful! Scream is one of those rare movies where everything about it just gels instantly creating a film that hits all the perfect notes. It's scary and funny as hell and I just looove it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining thriller from the good Wes Craven.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of reasons to hate this film, the most abundant one being that this movie inspired other movies like it to follow in its footsteps. However, this was the one that started it all, and although it can be annoying when you look back and see all the material that has been copied from it film after film, it stands alone. This is NOT a horror movie. I don't even know if you could call it a slasher, really. It's basically an entertaining mystery/thriller with gore. A sort of "Friday the 13th" meets "Scooby-Doo" detective story -- with teens. The dialogue was cool at the time (1996) and refreshing compared to the sometimes banal dialogue of others before it, but Williamson's script is a little too full of it and dependent on it. This film is notorious for its self-awareness -- the would-be victims have seen the movies we love and have learned a few tips from them. This is of course an original idea, but it takes something away from the atmosphere (who wants hip characters who fight back at the killer and make him look stupid!?). The film tries to be too hip and refreshing that sometimes it loses itself in its own overdone effort to reinvent a dying genre. And a little tip to Williamson: if you want to revive the horror movie genre, don't make a self-depricating parody of it! But overall the real kudos here go to director Craven. He took an okay script and made it into a good thrill-ride worth viewing. I have to hand it to him, what he did with this much overrated material is brilliant -- the opening sequence with Drew Barrymore is stuff made in movie history. And he doesn't cut back on the blood and gore, which is nice because it makes the film more shocking (most mysteries aren't concerned with horror movie tactics). And the killer is pretty damn difficult to guess. Thank God for unpredictability. The only thing the film needed more of, sparing the opening, was real suspense. From the end of the opening on, Craven shifts into overdrive and delivers the movie with shock after shock and good set-pieces with the phone-pranking killer, but he doesn't generate any true suspense. And how scary is an idiot who's most likely a high school student prancing around in a lame ghost costume that, I'm sorry, wouldn't even be scary enough for Halloween night? The costume plain sucks. And what's with all the characters kicking the killer's ass? At one point the killer is slammed with a door, kicked in the head, clubbed with beer bottles, and tripped! Not to mention that he or she always lets the victim get away at first (if he's seen so many horror films, shouldn't he be a little more competent?). Exactly how dangerous is this guy...? Overall, this film is not standard horror and is probably the only scary film between 1996 and 2002 that you should bother seeing, the others in between are all the same. I love the horror/slasher genre like the '80s films and those of the great master Dario Argento and Craven creates a nice outing here. He is a talented director, no one else could have done what he did with Williamson's material. Scary at points, and a great mystery that holds you from start to finish. But this film does make all my favorite (excuse me if they are not Oscar worthy) horror movies look trashy. A movie is supposed to be entertaining, and slashers are. Watch them for fun! And while "Scream" wastes a lot of time laughing and griping at the horror films that have gone before it, there are a few things it can work on, too -- don't try too hard.</fullReview>

Sorry to disagree but it´s not!The cast has some good and average actors. The best is the guy that played Randy.The screenplay written by Kevin Williamson has too many references to other horror movies. Too many! Specially Halloween and for that matter I think the movie itself is a little bit similar to the much better and scary JC movie (that´s a masterpiece!). Scream it´s also a bit boring at times (the dialogues of Sidney are horrible).And finally Wes Craven. In my opinion the man it´s a bad director (see Shocker and The Serpent &amp; The Rainbow).

		<fullReview>Teen horror from Wes Craven, where a vengeful killer runs riot, causing chaos in a small town. The killer uses a halloween like suit with a mask and begins his killings with phone calls to the people he is after to scare them even more.In years to come this film will be remembered as a classic. The cast is wonderful, with exploding performances from Neve Campbell and David Arquette. It is a typical Craven film, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats and confused about the identity of the killer until the very end when it is revealed. It's tension is accompanied with interesting humour that always gives the audience a break from the seriousness. The killing scenes are well choreographed, making them scarier and funnier. the beginning gives an indication of what the film is going to be like and it sets the scene for the rest of the film, making audiences want to watch it with the light on and the phone off the hook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no doubt that Scream is the greatest horror movie of all time. The entire series is phenomenal. There are a lot of reasons for the series' success. For instance, the cast worked great together in all of the Scream movies, it was like a family type atmosphere. Number two, the plot and the story were fantastic and enjoyable, it wasn't just some pointless teen slasher movie, you could really get into it. Finally, the third reason why the movie was so great was because the movie(s) had some comedy, action, drama, and romance and not just horror.The first Scream is my favorite even though the entire Scream series is fantastic. It is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleased with this film, both because I had fun watching it and I thought it was a quality film in its own right. Now that there have been several rip-offs, we can see that it spawned a new age in the genre and should be considered a classic/cult/must-see film. The second one stunk, but I felt the 3rd boosted it back up. 7 or 8 on 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever, Hip And Scary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a series of mysterious deaths, an offbeat group of friends get caught up in a lively mix of thrills and chills!The first time I saw the movie I rented it all by myself and watched at midnight the opening scene that opens with a scream over 9-1-1 and ends in a bloodbath freaked me out not long I realized I was sitting in front of a big sliding glass window! I stopped the movie calmed down invited a few friends over and we all had a slumber party.David Arquette (Dewey) plays a lovable cop not like the other movies with the cops that don't do nothing and you can't stand No Dewey is very involved in these murders and may even be a victim.Neve Cambell (Sidney) plays the main character, a teenage virgin whose mom was attacked and bruttally butchered supposedly by Cotton Weary. Her Mothers murder was one of the hottest court cases and her life gets turned upside down Campbell played this character with depth and emotion you feel sorry for her when she sees her mom's picture your heart bleeds for her.Campbell gave that a wonderful touch.Courtney Cox (Gale) plays an annoying reporter who admits to saying that Sidney has falsly identified the killer and that the killer is still on the loose. Cox gave off this gave a mean attitude whenever Cox would appear on screen you would just get a touch of hatered.Matthew Lillard (Stu) plays one of the offbeat teen . Lilliard's character is half the comedy in thois movie. Towards the end of the Movie the suspense digs up and to loosen us up is Lillard.Rose McGowan (Tatem) plays Sidney's best friend and Dewey's little sister and Stu's girlfriend. Although Sidney and Tatem have one or two arguments here and there they are great friends Dewey and tatem however can barely stand each other as we find out when they first appear together. Stu and Tatem don't have much screen time but when they do you can tell it is chemistry. McGowan brought to this Character reason the one arqument her and Sidney get into it is tell Sidney you know this is what is really happining. McGowan's performance overall doesn't really seem all to great but then again this is her first horror movie.Skeet Urlich (Billy) plays Sidney's boyfriend When we first meet him we see he loves his girl but then we find out she won't put out all because of her mothers murder last year. Urlich brings a dark side to Billy if you look very closely his grins are shocking.Drew Barrymore (Casey) plays a seventeen year old victim. First of all Barrymore is a wonderful Screamer she is the opening scene What better way to open a movie and to find a hot young almost adult get terriozed by a guy in a ghost mask? Barrymore's experience and talent and performance brought us to sit on the edge of our seats.Overall the movie was One Clever Thriller</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AWESOME!! Especially the first time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is great every millionth time you see it but there is nothing like the first time. The first time is great when you don't know who the killer is and you're guessing all the way through. It's extremely spooky the first time you watch it and thats the whole point. It's your typical teen slasher but it came at a time when a teen slasher wasn't typical. Of course now everybody tries to make stupid teen horror movies but nothing comes close to Scream! Scream 2 and 3 are also good but of course don't even come close to the original! Great Stars and great acting help this movie out too! Neve Campbell is perfect, Rose McGowan does great, David Arquette and Courteney Cox just have great chemistry! Skeet Ulrich is the new Johnny Depp for Wes Craven and Matthew Lliard and whoever plays Randy are just great. You couldn't have picked better people. Oh and Drew Barrymore looking great for her short stint in this movie! If you haven't seen it WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN??? You have to check this out! 10/10</fullReview>

Third, It Wasn't THAT Scary. Sure, it Had A Few Bloody Deaths, But What Else?? It Leaves us a Masked Killer Who People Should Defend Themselves Against Instead of Running Away. Last Off, No Good Music. All Classic Films (Puppet Master, Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, House, etc.) had A Good Soundtrack with Relaxing but Evil Music. What Do We Have?

		<shortDescription>The definitive horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Psycho." "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." "Halloween." "A Nightmare On Elm Street." "Hellraiser." "Scream."Yes, "Scream" ranks among the greatest horror films ever, and it rises above each and every last one of them. "Scream" is the definitive horror film. Every slasher flick released after "Scream" has tried to use the film's dynamic formula for success, failing miserably each time. Those films cannot assemble a cast the calibur of "Scream's," and the plots to those copy-cats are so obvious that a five-year-old could figure them out."Scream" did kickstart a dying genre, but, unfortunately, it may have also killed it. "I Know What You Did Last Summer," "Halloween: H20," "Urban Legend," and "Valentine" were all awful, and what does the slasher genre have to show for itself other than the excellent "Scream" trilogy. Nothing.The fact that "Scream" is responsible for the death of horror does not take away from the film's greatness, though. It spawned two awesome sequels and ranks as the best horror series ever, generating over $500 million in the box office worldwide. The first chapter is the best of the series and is the undisputed champion of horror.Starring Neve Campbell, Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich, and Matthew Lillard, "Scream" is the only name you need to know when it comes to teen slashers."Scream" receives a perfect score. ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Instant Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a known fact that in the mid-1990's, the horror genre was very dead. Very few horror movies were recognized. Until Scream came out, the only horror anyone would watch would be either an old Stephen King movie on TV or going to the video store so you didn't have to spend six bucks on seeing Candyman (1992). The Scream trilogy redefined the genre. The best is always the original Scream. It had an very original plot, a decent cast, true scares, some very good references to classic films (Wes Craven's cameo as the janitor in Freddy Krueger clothing and the use of colored corn syrup as blood, like what was used as pig's blood in Carrie (1976)), and it introduced an all-new terrifying serial killer: GhostFace. When I saw it in the theaters in 1996, I was truly scared out of my wits when GhostFace attacks Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore). Very few movies in the genre and the past five years since have been able to be as scary as Scream, except for Jeepers Creepers (2001). Believe me, rent Scream some time, make yourself a nice bucket of popcorn, turn off the lights, and prepare to scream endlessly!</fullReview>

I choose this because she hates these kind of movies. She hated it and hated all the blood. But i loved it. The scream costum is great. Now every year you can see how many kids are going to be in that costum for Halloween. I am glad to see Drew Barrymore in it. To bad she had a small part though. She is my favorite actress. I cant really stand Neve Campbell- Party of Five was bad enough. But the killer-Sidneys b-friend was hot. Everyone thought so. The second one sucked major. The third was much better.

Even the Principle Hembry is killed. Then, comes Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) an ambitious reporter. With her charm, she is using the naiveness of Deputy Dwight Dewey Riley (David Arquette) to cover the case. Her suspicion is the killer now is the same killer who is killed Sid Mom, Maureen (Priscilla Pointer), a year before. And it wasn't Cotton Weary (Liev Screiber) as the police thought. Even there's are curfew in Woodsboro, The #1 Fans of Horror Movies, Stuart Macher (Matthew Lillard ) alias Stu and Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), the video rental boy, is making a party on Stu's House. They are inviting their friends including Sid, Billy, and Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan), Stu's Girlfriend. But, on that night, is the final act for the killer. The Massacre is begin with Tatum.

With the very brave move, Sidney is challenge the killers. Killers ? Yes, there's are two psycho killer there.....! Superb, that's all I can say about this movie, the act of the cast is good, Wes Craven is a master, the score is terrifying. I still watching it again and again. I'm a true fans of this trilogy. I know that for some folks, this is nothing but a piece of garbage that need to throw as soon as possible to the disposal, but this movie actually is smart and scary, and you must watch it.This is a perfect combination between thriller and horror, and that make this movie is the best in the genre.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that set the standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie that started the whole teen slasher genre. Directed by the Grandaddy of horror Mr. Wes Craven and written by up and coming Kevin Williamson, Scream is 'the' horror movie of the 90's.Made really with teenagers in mind Craven has not only chosen actors/actresses that are well known by teens to appear in the movie, but has managed to incorporate widely known feelings and problems shown by the stars which relates to the audience (ok, not all teenagers suffer with a masked lunatic stalking them, but the problems of school,friends,sex etc).Scream was originally going to be called Scary Movie as it pokes fun at prior horror movies, especially Halloween. As Halloween is undoubtedly the best slasher horror movie ever made it seems fitting that Craven and Williamson pay it some respect. It is even shot in the same style, with the camera often taking the POV shot of the killer, also the tension building scenes are practically the same style used by John Carpenter. Some dialogue is also used, the line said by Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween to the children she is babysitting; "Run down to the Mckenzies" is said by Casey Becker's(Drew Barrymore) Father to her Mother except that they changed it very slightly to "Drive down to the Mckenzies".The story is very basic, teens being picked off by a killer wearing a ghost mask. But of course this killer seems to be focusing on one particular girl, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), but for what reason??A clever little horror film, with all the trimmings, but then would you expect anything less for the master of the genre? 10 out of 10, always watch for the well put in horror movie references.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a horror film, but also a sort of spoof of horror films. It plays around with some of the rules and cliches of the genre, whilst avoiding using them. Whilst in the middle it gets slightly sidetracked, it is a good horror film in its own right, with quite a few scary moments, and some 'false' scares, when we expect something to happen but something else does. There is quite a bit of comedy, but also this film has its fair share of tension.All in all, a film well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is most definately my favourite film of all time, okay so I haven't been around that long (16yrs), but I've seen alot of slasher flicks and this is the king of them all! Ever since those early hazy days of Halloween &amp; Friday the 13th, slasher's have gone from strength to strength, sequel after sequel. Now we know what it was all about, we had to get through 6 Halloween's and god knows how many Friday the 13th's so that Wes Craven could come along and knock them to the floor and show them how it's done! The reason that Scream is so fantastic is that the killer isn't invincible from fire, gunshots and decapitations (Halloween, Friday the 13th), it's just a couple of unstable individuals who happen to have seen one too many slashers. If you love horror and still haven't seen this film, shame on you, it's been out for 5 goddam years! See it! See it now!</fullReview>

Other than that, it's my favorite scary movie and an even better tribute to "Halloween" than the wrong-headed twentieth anniversary sequel.

		<fullReview>The Best: Being the first in the series of the over explored teen horror movies, the fact of being the pioneer. This first chapter as well as the third were the ones that scared more the viewer as well as were the more laughable ones relating to the black humour. The Worst: The movie has almost two hours but as well as any good movie it passes like it had only half an hour, which is something that can be not good. Rating: 8/ 10Two young teenagers have been murdered by a dysfunctional killer that took his love for scary movies one step too far? the day after on the local high school of Woodsboro, the police is in a commotion, every student his being asked about their relationships with the frustrated students. This story is particularly interesting the young student Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and her group of friends, her boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich), Tatum (Rose McGowan), Dewey (David Arquette), Stu (Mathew Lillard) and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and the opportunist reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox). Sidney's relationship with Billy isn't the best currently as her mother's one year death anniversary approaches, having in the background all of these sudden and macabre deaths on campus. Deaths are becoming more frequent, bodies ?pile' up, Sidney gets attacked, never knowing in who to trust she realizes that the deaths are all coming each time closer to her? The killer seems to be everywhere at any time, to scare everyone.As I said, after this movie movies with a killer with a knife chasing high school students and killing them start appearing countlessly. Although, the script and general quality of this movie started being insulted and imitated with movies trying to let themselves too seriously, of course failing? Anyway, Scream always came out as a winner and it still remains so as a common know. Not to be forgotten that this movie is considered one of the all time best horror films, and my God it deserves it so much! Like a declaration I heard sometime ago: ` Horror/ Scary movies are only good and really frightening when they can happen to anyone, at any place, at any time'.I was to write this review a few time ago, but I decided to go rent this movie again so I could be more inspired doing it. One tip: the perfect set is alone at house or with your friends at night lights off, closed doors, window(s) opened and curtains closed dancing in the wind! One last thing, a goof actually, one that really p***ed me off: when Casey Becker gets killed, and hanged on the tree, you can clearly see that she is a toy or a stunt as the faces are completely different, and when `someone' is killed on the garage and electrocuted you can clearly tell that it is a toy by the look of its skin.Don't wait and go see it, if you already have, do it again! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one great movie trilogy.For the longest time i never wanted to watch Scream cause i never liked horror movies, then one night i was thinking, "what the hell, why not?" so i put it into my VCR and watched, and when i say the begining of Scream with the girl (ain't gonna tell you who, incase you haven't watched it) was hanging from the tree, I stop the movie. I though that the move was gonna get a lot more bloody!Well 2 years later, after people talk about all 3 of the Screams, i dicide to watch it, but i started watching it at noon, in the light, not the dark. And I was surprised, it wasn't as bloody as i thought, and before having watched "Scary Movie", I knew kinda what was gonna happen! Well i liked the first Scream, and so i kept the tape playing cause we recored Scream 2 after it. After i watched both, I really wanted to watch the third, because "Scream" is not anything like "A Nightmare On Elm Street", "It", or "Needful Things" whihc had a crazy blood scenes to what i saw. The Scream movies are like Mysteries, with Swearing, and Blood. They also have Comedy, special in the third one, which they did i little too much. But if you are not into Scary movies to much, just like me, and think "Scream" is really scary, well you are wrong, go watch it, the first part is really scary but that's really the most blood you will see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teen slasher with an edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven &amp; Kevin Williamson's slasher came as a blessing, but is now unfortunately looked back upon as the movie that opened the floodgates for dozens of undesirable and truly awful cash-ins.It's important, therefore, to look at Scream for what it is, and ignore the imitators (AND the sequels), and judge it as an individual film, free from the influence of what this movie resurrected.There are many things to admire in this film. It stands out from most other slashers by making the film not *just* about the killings. While the murders and nearly-murders are masterly executed with flair, there is significant entertainment to be found elsewhere. It is the satirical humour which gives 'Scream' its edge. 'Scream' is like watching a spoof without it going to ridiculous and unsubtle lengths (a la Scary Movie), but instead taking more thought-out stabs at modern culture and, more than anything else, other horror movies (and indeed itself).On top of the comedy value, slick direction and thrilling set pieces ('thrilling', never terrifying), we have the wholly likeable characters and an ideal cast. Matthew Lillard is great as the repulsive, idiotic Stu, David Arquette is very funny as dim Dewey, and Skeet Ulrich is nicely creepy as the dodgy boyfriend. Neve Campbell has the wettest role, but she excels as scream queen Sidney. However it is Courteney Cox and Rose McGowan's sparky performances that really stand out. A horror movie is not the place to expect Oscar-calibre acting, but Scream couldn't have asked for a better cast, as everyone nails their characters perfectly.I, like many others, have tired of Williamson's self-referential style of writing, and suspect he's a one trick pony, but that's not to say it was a great trick... the first time around.Overall grade: A -</fullReview>

The only things in it I can vividly remember is right after Stu (Matthew Lillard) tells Sid (Neve Campbell) and Tatum (Rose McGowan) to bring food to his party, he imitates playing an electric guitar. The other scene is when Principal Himbry (Henry Winkler) says "Dumb little s***s!" as he opens the door and sees Fred the Janitor (Wes Craven), Winkler compliments on his shirt and Craven calls Winkler under his breath a prick. That's all I can remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hello Reader, Do you like scary movies???...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...Well my answer is yes! I know a lot of people who don't like the three movies (I for one hate the third!), but I think viewers (especially in the United Kingdom) forget that this is a kind of spoof. It starts brilliantly with our first encounter the the dreaded, though often injury prone "Ghost Face", never has any movie killer fallen over so many times!!! Then one by one the thirty year old teenagers drop like flies, why because they know daughter of the dirtiest mother in Woodsboro maybe in Hollywood movie history!!! (Sorry Mrs. Prescott R.I.P) I'll give this film 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A COMPLETELY BRILLIANT MOVIE!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>now if u haven't guessed, i love this movie soo much and the only movie that i love more than this is scream 3. ok so i might be well underaged to be seeing this movie but i know a great movie when i see one. ok the basic plot is that there is a psycho killer who starts killing every1 associated with Sidney Prescott whom he/she is obssessed with.very minor spoiler: now i might as well get rid of the one bad point 1st, now in the garage scene when tatum riley (sid's friend gets well u knowed, couldn't wes craven have made the dummy seem more...well realistic like drew's hanged dummy instead. cause i'm sorry but to me the dummy looked completely fake and plastic or whateva it was made of. there that's all the bad stuff, now for the good points :) well where do i start. ok how about this, scream is funny, very clever what with the movie making lots and lots of references to other horror films and how the whole film sort of explains the rules of a horror film, scary and pretty yucky at times. throughout the movie u keep guessing who the killer is and what's so particularly good about scream is that a person could do this. i mean the killer isn't an unstoppable force and doesn't come back from the dead or anything like that. the acting in this film is absolutely fantastic. courtney cox arquette is soo hateable in this film as the bitchy reporter gale weathers, which is a completely out of character person that courtney usually plays. i had never seen neve campbell be4 until this movie and now she is like my favourite actress. she is totally believable and likeable in this movie and personally i feel she was the best actor or actress in the whole movie. skeet ulrich, matthew lillard, dave arquette, drew rilley, rose mcgowan and james keendy were also very very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films of the 90s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been overly praised. It's been unjustly trashed. It's spawned many bad imitations. But at the heart of it all, Scream is one of the most entertaining horror films to come out in a while. Not scary, but suspenseful, witty, and downright funny.This isn't Craven's best work, but it's exactly what he'll be remembered for (along with the Elm Street movies)STORY: Not really original, but good nonetheless. Scream doesn't take itself seriously and nor should we. The movie was made for horror fans and just simply a lot of fun. You may argue that the story is worthy of much ridicule but that was the basic point. We get a great openner, a solid mystery, and a great, blood soaked conclusion worthy of a slasher film. Solid from beginning to end. The best thing about the story is how they took the "sex is bad" vibe from horror movies and expanded it into something a bit more dramatic. Here we see the uneasiness of preparing to have sex for the first time, how special it can be when you find have it, and...how your sweet sensitive partner can turn cold after the deed is done. It's good that the movie had that much thought put into it.ACTING: Neve Campell is good here and I really felt sorry for her character because of all that she went through. David Arrquette is alright as the clueless cop. Courtney Cox plays a bitchy tabloid reporter very well. Matthew Lillard was damn funny and Skeet Ulrich gives what's probably the best performance out of the whole film. His character ranges from easy going to intense and he pulls it off very well. I guess looking like Johnny Depp REALLY helps. Also of note are Rose McGowan as the blond best friend, Jamie Kennedy as the horror film expert, and Henry Winkler (aka Fonzie) in a rather ironic cameo. Oh yeah...Drew Barrymore is here too.DIRECTING: Good suspense. Good camera angles. No cheesy shots. Wes does very well for himself.MUSIC: Good score that incorporates dark industrial beats with a distorted choir. They even did some Friday the 13th-esque violin stuff for good measure. This movie also has a killer soundtrack with my favs being the ones by Birdbrain, Soho, and Nick Cave. "Red Right Hand" was so good that it carried on to the sequels. My only bitch is that they had a cover of Alice Cooper's "School's Out" instead of the real thing. That's just a crime....OTHER: Despite what some say, the gore in this movie is actually quite nice. We get some intestines, some good stabbings, the garage kill, and a F13-style throat slashing as well as pails of blood in the climax. All in all a good show. The Nudity here is no existent. Neve takes her bra off but no dice...why does every new slasher flick have to be so politically correct? Really...why? Also, I thought the whole Ghost costume was rather silly, though Craven made it look rather good in some shots. It just adds to the mentality that this film has: anti-serious. Scream is good film and I think that a few of the people who bash it without mercy should lighten up. Comparing this one to Halloween or the Shining is like comparing apples to oranges. Ya dig?**** of ****</fullReview>

Now that you know where I'm coming from you can see I'm not going to love it up front. But from that point of view, I have to say, the acting was impressive. Lots of new (to me) talent bursting through here. The story held my interest, and the gore was kept at a minimum so I could stomach it all easily. Even the end was good. I was entertained, but for scary I am jarred awake and unsettled by movies more like "Seven".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is the best horror flick ever, of course it does have a minor flaw. SPOILER I understand why Wes Craven did all the different killings because a movie of everyone getting stabbed to death does get really boring, but couldn't he have atleast made Tatum's face not look like rubber when she got squashed by the garage.This movie is excellent in my opinion, has a great plot and the actors and actresses did a great job on their characters.The cast was excellent. Great performances were made the following : Neve Cambell(Sidney), David Arquette(Deputy Dwight "Dewey" Riley), Courtney Cox(Gail Weathers), Rose McGowan(Tatum Riley), Matthew Lillard(Stuart), Jamie Kennedy(Randy), and Skeet Ulrich(Billy Lumas)10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just my favorite scary movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...it's my favorite movie of all time! It's so much fun; every time I watch it, I love it even more. It's extremely clever, hip, funny, and of course, absolutely terrifying! I remember the first time i saw it. I was like 10 and it was on Starz! and I couldn't watch the first scene w/o switching the channel. Actually, it wasn't until i rented it on video a couple years later that i watched the entire movie from beginning to end - simply because I couldn't change the channel!Scream is so original and creative - from Kevin Williamson's fresh, witty script, to Wes Craven's awesome direction. And of course, the terrific score doesn't hurt, either. One of the best things about this film is that it has many things that most other horror movies lack, such as a plot (big one!), well-developed characters, and even good acting!Drew Barrymore shines as Casey Becker. I mean, if she weren't able to cry so well on cue like she did, that first scene just wouldn't have been as believable as it was, nor would it be one of the most classic scenes in horror movie history, right up there with Psycho's shower scene. Neve Campbell (Sidney Prescott) is a very talented actress as well and makes a great leading lady. David Arquette is perfect for the role of Dewey. And who could forget Courtney Cox - she's such a good actress that when I watch Friends, it's hard for me to believe that Monica is the same person who played Gale Weathers! Jamie Kennedy makes a great movie geek - he's probably my favorite character in the whole trilogy. Everyone else is great too - Matthew Lillard was hilarious as Stu, Skeet Ulrich made a creepy boyfriend, and Rose McGowan was a cute best friend. After all, this movie did launch all of their careers!Although Scream is responsible for a lot of crap (bad imitators like Urban Legend, horrible attempts at mixing genres such as Idle Hands, and unnecessary sequels to classics like Halloween: H20 and The Rage: Carrie 2), there's no way any horror movie fan won't like this! I'm telling you, it's sensational! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just when you thought the horror genre was dead and buried Wes Craven released Scream in the mid 1990's and it was the surprise smash hit of most horror films of all time! Sitting down to watch this, after the first scene I was freaked. Every movie has it's one famous moment and Drew Barrymore's scene has gone down in history as one of the scariest moments of all time. The rest of the movie (although scary at times) is really comic relief. An enjoyable little film which has reopened us to a new kind of horror and has made it's cast stars. The film carries many spoofs and references to classic horror films and has repopularized them. Scream will remain with me as *the* film of my teenage years</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A summary of the director and cast of Scream(1996)!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only movie I have ever seen that was any better than Scream was Scream3. They were both excellent movies but I'm here to comment on the first one. Wes Craven (director)is a genius with horror movies. I think it was his genius along with an awesome cast and crew. Neve Campbell was a perfect casting as Sidney because she was actually stalked herself when she began acting so the part would have been quite easy to get used to. Jamie Kennedy played Randy just as he was supposed to be portrayed.Matthew Lillard was a hilarious Stu and Courtney Cox Arquette couldn't have been more of a b*tch if she tried!Of course, that was her character. David Arquette made it a perfect case of "opposites attracting" as sweet,slightly stupid,Dewey Riley. All in all, a movie masterpiece that is not given as much credit as it should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I love this movie. It wasn't particularly scary, except for a few good "jump" scenes, but it was a fun, humorous, bloody rollercoaster ride. I thought the cast was entirely likable with great characters, and I think Mr. Craven did a great job of directing (I like lots of his stuff). It was great to see Fonzie's cameo, too. This is an enjoyable film, but a true horror fan like myself was first delighted by this movie's success, then appalled by what actually became of horror's "Ressurrection." The floodgates are still open, and the crap keeps flowing through. A bunch of young, hip, teen-soap stars and a guy in a mask with a knife do not a good movie make....unless the script contains even an ounce of the wit, style, or energy that this one has....Horror fans get together, don't allow anymore "Urban Legends" (scarily enough part 3 is in the works) and there sorry ilk to make money....The first is always best and this one is it....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have found this to be one of the most enjoyable films of the nineties. It spawned a shed load of pale imitations (including to some extent it's own sequels), but not one of them came close to reaching this film's giddy heights. The first twenty minutes is an icredibly effective take on the standard slasher fare - Wes Craven shows how brutally efficient and successful he can be at manipulating an audience. In Drew Barrymore's character he presents an instantly identifiable person and shows how easily she gets sucked into flirting, literally, with death. Drew also deserves credit as she makes her brief appearance probably the most memorable of the franchise. After the tension filled opening - an expertly handled 'how to' of slasher pics - the film totally rips apart the whole genre. Lots of people don't remember how funny this film is. For a start, excepting perhaps only Sydney (Neve Campbell) all of the teens featured are so amoral - the instant reaction to news that the headmaster has been killed is to drive out and hurl stuff at his hanged corpse! The relationship between Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) and Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) is also touchingly sweet but comic. Much has been made of all the self-referential irony, that this is a horror movie about kids who have seen horror movies, and it certainly adds to the fun but I do not feel that it is the main selling point.The characters in this film are well drawn out, enabling the subtle humour present to surface. On first viewing, guesssing 'who dunnit' also adds to the fun, and both these factors can be attributed to Kevin Williamson's fantastic script, but the whole reason this film clicks is, for my money, Wes Craven himself. This must surely be his most accomplished film to date. The whole tone of the movie feels exactly right - for the most part it is incredibly light-hearted - allowing the characters to interact without stress or pressure, thus being able to emerge as more than pure knife fodder, but when the necessary killings occur they executed with the up most conviction and terror. This film as such simultaneously becomes a perfect example of the genre and a spoof of it at the same time, making films such as 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' (also penned by Williamson) redundant. It is also for this reason that the 'Scary Movie' spoof didn't really work - how do you send up a film that doesn't take itself seriously? 'Scream 2' and 'Scream 3', although very effective slasher movies don't match up to the original because they are just that - straightforward slasher movies. The humour diminishes with each sequel and so lose what made 'Scream' so enjoyable in the first place and what makes it such a treat on repeat viewings. As a trilogy all three hold up as being three of the best slasher movies ever made - but the first 'Scream' is the loudest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scream" is practically the best slasher film out of all of them (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, etc). The movie delivers a chilling plot and story, and makes you think your being watched by the murderer in the ghost costume. Wes Craven did an excellent job on the directing. The acting was very good. Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Rose McGowan, Drew Barrymore, Courtney Cox and David Arquette did an excellent job in their roles. This movie is very creepy and very good. It makes you think there is a killer stalking you. If you are a movie person I recommend "Scream", especially to horror fans. The movie is well done the acting is great, the filmmaking is excellent, and the movie is just plain great! This is a classic horror movie for anyone who has interest in horror films! This is my favorite slasher film out there. The movie is great! You should DEFINETLY rent this movie if you stop by your local video store. I'm sure any video store carrys it. This is the best slasher film in the world! This is a highly recommended horror fans! It is great! I give it a 10 out of 10!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is a pretty good horror movie but the problem isnt in the film it lies with the treatment of how the american public overhyped this movie and how suits milked it for all it was worth. One scream makes fifteen other imitations. It is a self aware version of teenagers who know how to survive cheesy horror movies. The film opens with the impressive Drew Barrymore scene and soon we are taken into the life of Sydney prescott. A masked killer taunts her as every cliche in the horror vault is examined. It's ok and if people accepted it for what it was instead of making it overblown it would be long remembered. Rose McGowan is very sexy in her role. Too bad she gets a stupid death. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece (some minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What else can I say that has not been said before ? Scream is almost perfect. I think the movie managed not to revive the horror genre as many said , but something even better : born a new kind of film , the mystery / horror . We have seen other movies with unidentified serial killers like Copycat . The brilliant idea of combining the mystery element with teenage stars representing the horror / slasher films is VERY functional . Many said that there are comedy elements and the movie is funny . I disagree because I think the writer wanted simply to make the film less scary at occasions so it would not be more entertaining. The heroes have seen many scary movies and know many cliches that are inherent in them . Personally think that the continuus quotes from other movies was a bit entertaining sometimes but very irritating other times and this is a big flaw . There are unforgettable lines like" It is a lot scarier WITHOUT a motive !! " or " Movies do NOT create psychos , they simply make psychos more inventive " .I won 't tell much about the plot because the less you know the more you will enjoy it . Basically gruesome murders happen in a small American town . The maniac killer is dressed like a ghost : black cape and cowl and a white - faced mask a direct copy from the famous painting " the scream " . He is a pure sadist : makes threatening phone calls to his victims always asking them if they like scary movies . After he intimidates them and scares the s**t out of them , he attacks and slaughters them with a knife in full-of-panic-heartpumping-suspensful -bloody chase scenes . The killer can be really anyone . As Randy ( Jamie Kennedy ) says wittingly " EVERYBODY IS A SUSPECT !!! " . So far nothing special you may say . Here is the evidence you are wrong1) The chase scenes despite the cliches are the most suspenseful in any film of the decade . Wes Craven proved that even the oldest and rehashed recipe can work magnificently if the ingredients are used properly.2) Finally a horror movie where the killer is a common mortal !!! If you hit him he will hurt . If you stab him he will bleed . If you shoot him he will die . At last ! Not some stupid unkillable " boogeyman " like Michael Myers in Halloween ( don 't get me wrong I like Halloween but it IS stupid ) .3) A horror movie with detective crime mystery . You don 't know who the killer is . Is it Billy ( Skeet Ulrich ) ? No , too obvious ! Is it Sidney 's father gone mad ? Maybe . No it maybe Randy gone crazy of all the thrillers he 's watching . Too obvious . Again Billy has a very mysterious eye look . But again is he . Is he not ? And how about Stew ( Mathew Lilard ) ? He seems a real wacko . And so on and on . The film keeps you guessing until the end . I believe the solution of the mystery was probably inspired of some Agatha Christie novels like "Ten little niggers" and " Crime Witness " .3) The performances are very good especially Skeet Ulrich as Billy one of the most controversial characters ever seen . He is very enigmatic. By the way if his figure reminds you of something it is Johnny Depp. Excellent performances from Rose Mac Gowan ( Tatum ) and Neve Campbell ( Sidney ) . Adequate acting by Jamie Kennedy , Mathew Lilard , David Arquette as the Deputy Dewey and Corteney Cox as the pesky reporter Gail Weathers who sees the story as a skoop for her carreer . Despite the acting the characters are very strong ( except Dewey ) and very memorable .4) I have read many comments and critics about the film but noone has made a comment about the psychological terror . There is a widespread threat throughout the whole movie . First of all the Ghostface is very scary . He seems like a divine supernatural figure . When Casey ( Drew Barrymore ) unmasks him in the beginning we are almost sure that he is a person she knows . But the most horrifying part in this excellent story is that despite the numerous suspects and the hints that the script provides us to keep changing our suspicions , the killer can be literally anyone : just a psychopath who has spotted these friends and wants to have his sick fun . Maybe he is even a guy from out of town. The threat is exposing itself when the murderer is in front of Sidney sweeping the blood of his knife implying directly , " You are next ". I have never seen such a frightfully intense scene in a film before : the danger is HERE ! The atmosphere really convinces you that this can happen to anyone .5) There are some excellent original scenes but I won 't give them away. All I can say is that the Drew Barrymore opening is regarded as a classic . Something I would like to comment is that finally the heroines do something I always wondered why not in other horror films : when the killer corners them , they simply kick him in the sensitive area.6) The revelation of the killer is simply SHOCKING . As for the climax I can assure you that it is the most nerve - shattering you have ever seen . You will probably need a sleeping pill to sleep afterwards because you will be frightened to death by the twisted mind a person can have ( the PSYCHOLOGICAL TERROR I mentioned above ) and moreover the final action scene is going to steal your breath and have your heart crazy . Trust me ! You will remember it as long as you live !A few weaknesses : Some scenes are very contrived like the murder of the Headmaster . Other scenes are quite boring like when Sidney is whining about her family background something which annoyingly holds the plot development back . But I guess we may forgive that . How can anyone NOT love this movie or even worse hate it ? I believe the only ones who hated it are people who simply don 't like action films or mysteries . But for you who like thrillers this is definately a must see.S C R E A M F O R E V E R 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film That Rewrote The Horror Rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is one of those films that took everyone by surprise. Wes Cravens previous films hadnt gained the attention that he had scored in the eighties with the Nightmare On Elm Street series.But in 1996, Scream opened and took a huge box office..Miramax's most successful film a the time(It has since been beaten by SCream 2, Scream 3 and SCary Movie)..That alone suggests that people keep coming back for more because Craven and Kevin Williamson (Dawsons Creek) have created characters that the audience warm to. The casting is also perfect. Drew Barrymore makes her big comeback following a dead patch in her career and proves that she was right to turn down the lead role in favour of that of Casey Becker. The opening scene is amazing and although the rest of the film doesnt match it, it still maintains an excellent pace and quota of slicin' and dicin'! Campbell slips nicely into the shoes of Sidney Prescott, a teen who is still coming to terms with her mother's untimely murder which happened nearly a yr ago to the day. As the anniversary of the death approaches she finds herself the victim of a stalker who dons a scary mask and starts cutting up all her friends! There is a great supporting cast with impressive turns by Rose McGowan as Sid's best mate (Tatum Riley), David Arquette, the local deputy sheriff (Dewey Riley) and Jamie Kennedy as movie buff, Randy Meeks. However the most impressive acting comes from Courtney Cox as fame hungry news reporter, Gale Weathers. Proving that she can do other stuff as well as being "friendly", Cox creates a character that is entirely her own! After watching teh film you cannot imagine anyone else taking her role.. As the killings increase, Dewey, Sid and Gale have to unite and track down the murderer and start to discover that it is a little bit too close to home..This film is absolutely amazing..It started a new trend of teen slashers and also kicked the careers of several young American hotshots back into action..(McGowan, Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard). It is also hysterically funny..if you know your horror films look for in jokes and references to Halloween, Nightmare On Elm Street, Friday 13th. Also you may spot cameos from Liev Screiber, Henry Winkler and Wes Craven (playing a caretaker called Fred who looks spookily like Freddie kruger!)Watch this film..There arent many as good as this!10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is not an excellent film. It's a good film, and an excellent slasher. It stands above every other film in the genre for several reasons.Firstly, it doesn't take itself seriously. It has a good humour and the irony is not as overdone or as irritating as some people claim. It stops the audience from grumbling about the unlikeliness of it all, and so shields criticism in that sense.Scream also has characters that you actually care if they die or not. Although, from the offset, its quite easy to tell who'll die and who won't, it still works. Thankfully, the cast do justice to the characters their given.Neve Campbell is fine in the 'scream queen' role, but it is the more minor characters that are played best. David Arquette is good as dopey Dewey, Matthew Lillard's overacting suits Stu, Courteney Cox and Jamie Kennedy are ideally cast, while Rose McGowan is impressive as the gutsy best friend.Scream is also well directed by Craven, with well-timed shocks and some excellent set-pieces.Williamson's script is what makes Scream special, but although it looked like a new talent had been spotted, with the cash-in that was I Know What You Did Last Summer, it seems that he's a one-note writer with little imagination.But Scream, although it's tarnished by the inferior sequels and the floods of truly awful imitations (Urban Legend et al), remains an example of how slashers should be done - more than just an excuse to cut up busty teens, it's a smart and funny film.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I saw 'Scream' 1+2, 'I know what you did last summer', 'I remember what you did last summer' (?). Now I'm waiting for 'I can't forget what you did last summer' and 'Damn I'm good, I still can remember what you did last ummm.. summer or something'. It was like watching the same movie over and over again. In a way I can say I enjoyed these movies. They make me laugh out loud. Watching a bunch of stoopid teenagers going beserk is entertaining. That's the only reason I can find one may want to watch something like 'Scream'. On the other hand after watching the first two 'Screams', I felt like email flooding Wes Craven with the message 'You're an idiot!!!'. Because I truly believe this guy is. The 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series I thought was smth to do with the 80's. I was a pre-teen kid then when I saw them and yes, those movies gave me the gibbies. These days I thought the genre was dead. Alas, it is not. I don't think anyone over 16 that has at least half of a brain could find this movie thrilling/terrifying in any way.Then again, maybe I'm not a horror movies kinda guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is the strong hold of the rival of teenage flick, although scream maybe the first it also lines up as the best of the crop.i really enjoyed the solid and gripping performances by Courtney Cox &amp; Drew Barrymore. but you cannot forget the ever funny Matthew Lillard. Each and everyone of these cast members give the performances of their careers and they have Wes Craven to thank for that.People maybe quick to smack the film because of the sequels, but we have to remember that they where planed from day one along with the original.I really hope Miramax does not make a fourth film or if they do i hope the cast don't agree to participate because it works perfectly as a trilogy and out rivals any other horror trilogy in history.Scream will definitely out last Halloween, the exorcist &amp; psycho for it's originality and revival of the genre. Thank You ScreamDon't see scream by it's self, watch the sequels straight after. MUCH MUCH BETTER</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost didn't even want to go see this movie when it came out, but after some convincing from a friend I reluctantly obliged. I was so blown away by it! I've have never been more satisfied after watching a movie in my life. This has everything a person could want from a movie; laughs, scares, drama, action, etc. The opening fifteen minutes alone leave a person breathless. Because of this movie I have found a new home in horror movies. They are my favorite to rent and go see. I used to be utterly frightened by them and now I watch them religiously. I'd just like to take the moment to thank Mr. Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven for opening my eyes to such an exciting and profound genre of theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A revival of horror movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After horror movies had been discarded and dismissed for years, Wes Craven and brilliant writer Kevin Williamson changed this completely. With a cast of the industry's up-and-coming teenaged stars, Scream is a film concerning a group of students whose obsession with horror movies is practically deranged. The murderer is difficult to pinpoint due to the fact that suspicion is placed on many of the characters, particularly Billy Loomis, who is played by Skeet Ulrich. The deaths are brutal and gory, especially the first death. Matthew Lillard is spectacular in his role of Stu--the hilarious and inappropriate boyfriend to Rose McGowen. The plot flows smoothly and contains many witty lines that definitely add something to the film. Although the sequels aren't as well-done, this movie established the fact that horror movies aren't always so corny and ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, in and of itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people hate this movie, mostly because it inspired the glut of awful postmodern horror flicks we've endured over the last few years. The complaint is valid (don't get me started about Urban Legends: Final Cut), but don't let that stop you from watching and appreciating this movie for what it is. Scream really is a good film. Sure, some of the characters are a bit annoying and some scenes just kind of slow things down, but as a whole the movie is exciting, well-written, and occasionally truly frightening. The Drew Barrymore sequence, as overly familiar as it has become, is horror filmmaking of a high order--Craven proves that even the same old cliches can be frightening if they are used with the right timing and balance. It's nearly impossible to make a good slasher film, since the genre has been so overdone; Scream pulls it off, and does it with a smile on its face.Sure the sequels and imitators and spoofs are awful. Sure Craven and his colleagues fell back into the same old rut that this movie protested. But Scream exists on a higher level than the rest of the pack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original and the best of the teen- thrillers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my all time favorite movie. Everything is here to make a great flick. The cast, Wes Craven and the king of teen- thrillers Kevin Williamson. I love this film so much and it really hurts my feelings when people say that this film ruined the horror Genre. It did not. The horror Genre was getting tired, "Scream" gave it a fresh new look. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox- Arquette, Drew Barrymore and Rose McGowan are all great. So is Skeet Ulrich, Jamie Kennedy, Matthew Lillard and David Arquette. With a cast like this, of course there will be some solid performances. And you'll never guess the killer. In my opinion, it's the "Halloween" of the 90's, creating a lot of cheap imitations such as Urban Legend and I Know What You Did Last Summer. But I love these films also. The teen- thriller rip off's are better and more creative than the 80's "Halloween" clones. Dimension Films made a big deal about making this a trilogy, now I hear Scream 4 is in the works! I wont lie, I will probably be one of the first to see this film even though the series is already getting tired.Overall, this is a truly excellent film that I recommend to anyone looking for a good time and some great scares. There is a lot more great things I could say about Scream but I'll let you point out it's little qualities for yourself!10/10 (of course.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? This movie rocked! Wes Craven reinvents the horror/slasher genre in this clever spoof, and it is also surprisingly filled with suspense!(SPOILER) The whole cast is excellent! Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Skeet Urlich, Jamie Kennedy, Matthew Lillard, Drew Barrymore and even Henry Winkler all perform well! The script is fantastic and refreshing, and there is plenty of clever jokes that's will make you laugh but at the same time give you the creeps i.e. Meeks saying "look behind you!" to the television! Great stuff and an excellent homage to the slasher/horror movie genre. 'Scream' stands out as a unique spoof on the horror genre and a memorable thriller with enough blood and guts to entertain most horror/teen slasher fans! This is vastly clever and original film that analyses it's own genre. 'Scream' is one of my favourite scary movies! ****1/2 out of *****!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What More Could A Horror-Buff Ask For?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What more could a horror-buff ask for? `Scream' has it all. Movie trivia, movie spoofs, twisted ending, twisted beginning, talented actors/actresses, a great motive, lovable characters, and even scary the second time you see it. `Scream' is about a young girl named Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who is trying to put her life back together after the brutal murder of her loving mother, a year earlier. The accused murderer, Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), is locked up and is waiting for an appeal to be put to death by the gas chamber. Out of the blue, these mysterious killings start to happen. The nosey, local news reporter, Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), is scooping out this mystery of why these killings are starting. Weathers believes that Weary is innocent of the murder of Sidney's mother. Sidney disagrees. But Gale Weathers isn't too far from proving Sidney wrong. So, is the real murderer getting nervous, about getting caught for the murder of Sidney's mother, and the framing of poor Cotton Weary? Is the murderer going to try and frame somebody else for the murder of Sidney's mother after Weary is proven innocent, like.Sidney, or even Sidney's father? Is that why there is a killing spree? Sure, why else would the murder want to reveal Weary's innocence? If the murderer doesn't do something soon, (s)he'll be caught. So (s)he wants to throw Weathers off track. Though we wonder what the killer with do next, we also wonder.who is the killer? Could it be Sidney's boyfriend, Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich)? Sidney's best friend, Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan)? Tatum's brother, the town's deputy, Deputy Dwight `Dewey' Riley (David Arquette)? Tatum's boyfriend, Stuart (Matthew Lillard). Sidney's secret admirer, the town's mastermind, who knows everything about everything, Geeky Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy)? Or even Gale Weathers herself? (Gale is money hungry, and seeking for fame, maybe she could use a little publicity, you never know.) But I tell you, the killer is great and surprising, with a fantastic motive. I did not see any problem with this movie, except for a couple bloopers (which no movie doesn't have), so I give it a 10/10. (And I'm the kind of guy who watches stuff like: `Citizen Kane' or `The Godfather)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE "Scream". This film is so well-written and well-acted that it never ceases to be entertaining. To the more ignorant viewer, "Scream" might appear to be full of cliches and to be unrealistic -- of course, I can't disagree. That's exactly the point. Wes Craven pays homage to the classic horror films of the 70's and 80's, most notably "Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Halloween" (or any Jamie Lee Curtis film). The opening with Drew Barrymore masterfully builds tension and combines it with Drew's penchant for creating semi-innocent, charismatic characters. Neve Campbell is realistic (if not a little annoying, like your whiny best friend) and Deputy Dewey (David Arquette, ridiculous and funny as usual) provides lots of comic relief. Just a good movie, perfect when seen in a crowded movie theater or basement with no lights, lots of popcorn, and big guys in varsity jackets to protect everyone. 9/10 out of 10, definitely. A modern classic in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream,one of the finest Wes Craven movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1996 Wes Craven, famous for directing A Nightmare on Elm street,the in-famous last house on the left and a few other cult classic horror movies.Craven directed a movie penned by kevin williamson(dawson's creek creator and director of clerks,chasing amy etc)the movie was scream a movie which kinda re-wrote the slasher movie and brought it back from the dead at the same time.The film was fresh and somewhat original,the movie used the cinema goers knowledge of the slasher movie to try and use it against them and parody the genre at the same time to fantastic effect.Sydney our main character in this scary movie played brilliantly by Neve Campbell(T.V.S party of 5,wild things)is not alone her boy friend billie(played fantastically by Skeet Ulrich in one of his first roles)friends,Tatum,her big bro Deputy Dwight"Dewey" Wright and maybe the not so friendly Gale Weathers news reporter and super bitch played by T.V Friends Courtney Cox who of course comes across as a friend by the final reel,the thing with Scream is you can't say to much or you'll give it away,it's a film when you see it it for the first time it keeps you guessing and they try to keep the predictable unpredictable so it's a movie you really have to watch for yourself,all i'll say is it's tops one of the best horror movies of the 90's and a right good laugh at the same time. Of course it spawned 2 sequels to make a trilogy parts 2 and 3 are o.k but not a patch on the original which stands as one of Wes Cravens finest flicks tightly directed ,full of suspense laughs and screams. So tell me "do you like scary movies" if so check it out</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't heard much about Scream, surprisingly, so I didn't even know what I was going to see. When I realised it was about murderers, I was deeply surprised and very intrigued...Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has alot on her plate. It's hard enough to be a teenager, coming of age in today's world, let alone have a boyfriend (Skeet Ulrich) with raging hormones, a father whose life is one business trip after another, and still feel healthy when your mother was brutally murdered one year ago. Just when things seem to be getting back to normal for Sidney and her friends, the small town is once again plagued by a killer. Someone who is taking their love of scary movies one step too far. To survive they must follow the golden movie rules - don't answer the door, don't leave the house, don't answer the phone, but most of all, don't SCREAM.Scream is one of those movies you can watch day in, day out and never stop loving. The performances are fine, Neve Campbell is the perfect heroin, while Drew Barrymore plays Casey Becker in her gory opening scene to perfection and Skeet Ulrich is perfect for the part of creepy Billy Loomis. Kevin Williamson is a marvellous writer, his "do you like scary movies?" terrorising plot is amazingly convincing. And, of course, Wes Craven has done it again...A total classic, Scream fulfills in all areas.I rate Scream 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not exactly a scream.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is a pretty general teen flick, that has some thinking put into it but not a whole lot. I don't care if this movie is a bit scary or isn't at all. (Along with most people, I agree that this wasn't at all frightening.) Instead of wanting to be scared out of my seat, I examine the different parts of the film, and specifically the plot and/or script.This film is quite entertaining and since I can manage through it more than five times, it must be okay. The plot and story that is created is clever but sort of a let down. When we find out who the killers are and what their motives were for going on a killing spree, it kind of leaves you with a thought of "that's it?" The idea works but if it would have been changed, it might have worked better.The characters and actors involved are good and fit the roles very nicely. Being not much of a Neve Campbell fan, I think that this is one of the areas they could have made a lot of improvements on. This is strictly my opinion, so just skip ahead if you don't care. Campbell does not strike me as the "scream queen" type, but obviously the casting department disagrees. Having to watch her act like she can...act, for almost two hours is torture. If they would have gotten anybody else to play the role of Sydney, I might have enjoyed the movie more. David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette, Matthew Lillard, Skeet Ulrich, and everybody else gives good performances.The writing is a little cheapo and bland, but it still pulls it off. It lacks creativity, but does have some humorous moments. (Which was a must.) A few, well, a lot of lines were poorly written and maybe they could have used some different writers. Considering that this is a slasher/horror film, I'm not looking for some intelligent and greatly worded lines. But at least try to put some thinking into it. This doesn't fall under the writing category but I want to point this out. Another problem and something that I found very irritating was the numerous amount of goofs,bloopers, blunders, call it what you will. Simple and huge things were ruined and that just shows that a couple of people weren't doing their job. So, I can watch Scream now and again, but this is far from a well organized film. If anybody wants to see a simple and easy-to-follow movie, this one is for you.</fullReview>

However, this movie failed to thrill me and make me "scream". Yes, it is very gory (guts splattering on the floor, heads flattened by garage doors, throats slashed, scissor-stabbing, squirting blood, etc.) but it was way too long and some of the twists were too stupid for their own good. Overall, I wasn't surprised or really that into this movie. The whole "Scream" trilogy is very, very overrated.

		<shortDescription>Craven Rejuvenates The Genre He Pioneered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven's Scream is a welcome, fresh, and fun endeavor into the seemingly tapped horror genre. It's smart, fast-paced, deliciously self-referrential and tense, but above that, it's a breath of life into the tired, predictable horror movie.When a killer begins terrorizing a small town with is love of slasher films and incessant quizzing, Neve Campbell becomes the object of his perversion and just about everyone becomes a suspect.Kevin Williamson's smart, tight script highly original method of literally revealing all the cliches and 'rules' followed in making a horror film. The fact that the film's devices make it much more interesting, leaving the viewer to wonder exactly what will be done to create suspense now that the bag of tricks has been emptied. Craven's direction is once-again in top form, and this is certainly one of his most suspenseful films since her introduced the proverbial nightmare walker, Freddy Kreuger. Unlike Nightmare on Elm Street, however, the tension is built not only by the killer but by the revelation of horror tactics. Scream is certainly not as gory as some of Craven's other outings, but it will still satisfy gore-lovers.Performance wise, the cast is an effective array of over-confident teens, with Lillard's annoyingly off-beat character stealing a few scenes. Neve Campbell does well, making Sidney a strong, formidable foe as the Langenkamp-esque heroine. Skeet Ulrich eminates Johnny Depp during some scenes and fares well as Campbell's boyfriend.With its self-referrential quirkiness, some truly genuine scares, and a pulse-pounding, satisfying last half hour, Scream delivers the goods as an inventive horror film and reinforces Craven's masterful standing in the genre.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though the 2 sequels showed a dramatic decline in quality and acting, the original still stands as the most original thriller to come out in the last 10 years (with Seven coming in a super close second.) Everything about this movie is top notch, from the acting to the great script and smooth as silk direction from the great Wes Craven. What I found so refreshing about this film when I originally saw it in theaters was how the characters were aware of all the cliches and plot devices that have been run into the ground by slasher/horror films. And the fact that it wasn't done in a goofy manner deserves a hand, since it could have easily veered into that direction with the wrong director.On a side note, not since the craft has the beautiful Neve Campbell been more striking. She keeps your attention throughout with a combination genuine acting skill and stunning yet highly original looks. All I can say is what a beautiful woman she is!Scream deserves it's place in horror history, and forget about the sorry sequels, this is where it truly all began and should have ended!rating:9</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody has seen Scream, if they haven't they certainly have heard of it. Most people can understand the basic plot, but the more the movie-buff you are the more you'll understand and thus enjoy it. Firstly, it's quite noticeable that it's a Kevin Williamson screenplay. The way the film refers back to past 'slice and dice' movies gives it away.The film is like an amalgamation of other films-but with an original plot, better twists and of course a lot more screams but still sticks to the rules of the genre(eg. the finale takes place in a desolate area)Secondly, it's directed by a great veteran of horror-Wes Craven. Craven uses his talent to keep the film gory but adds a modern, comical ingredient to it. The great twist at the end is an example of how the viewer never knows the outcome of the events. Also the viewer is always kept guessing who the killer really is, as unlike typical slasher films the identity of the killer is kept secret.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If this were a scary movie I'd be the prime suspect."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the later stages of Scream Neve Campbell lambastes the heroines of horror movies, claiming it's always "some big-breasted girl who can't act." Well, Drew Barrymore might fill part of that quota, but she certainly can't be accused of not acting in the best twelve minutes of the whole trilogy. This is Scream as it should be: self-referential in its dialogue, yet genuinely scary too. This "lone girl in the house" trick is pulled off twice, and works both times, though thereafter the film degenerates into self-satisfied smugdom of the highest order.There's perhaps a little more bad natured humour than might at first be evident, too. I remember laughing with friends at the humble reference Barrymore makes to Craven's back catalogue, when talking about Nightmare on Elm Street being scary. "Well," she replies, "the first one was, but the rest sucked." However, closer inspection shows that Craven had little input with many of the sequels - he wrote and executive produced the third, but had no involvement with any of the others. What would seem to the majority of the viewing audience to be a modest slice of self-mockery is actually a bitter filmmaker venting his spleen.But the major praise heaped upon Scream is that it's what film students call "recursive". It's a horror movie about horror movies. It acknowledges that some horror movies aren't real, so therefore maybe it could be, blah de blah... Of course, all this could be quite fun were the point not made with sledgehammer subtlety. How many times does the word "movie" occur in this mov- film, anyway? Every two seconds someone's asking someone else who would play him or her in a movie, or claiming "this isn't a movie" only to be met with "Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie, it's all one great big movie." Errrrr... is it a movie?From the second half, beginning with the irritating video store scene, things start to get awry. No longer is the film scary, just roaming around it's own backside. For the last hour the film serves not to scare with occasional reference, but to show us all how "clever" and "ironic" it is - or thinks it is. The whole idea of satirical endeavours is that they're finely tuned and discrete, Mr.Williamson. Carving a script that goes "ha ha ha we're in a movie, it's just a movie, it's like an old horror movie don't you know ha ha ha is this a movie I think it's a movie it's like a movie" does not make you a candidate for Jonathan Swift's line of ascendants.I probably enjoyed this more when I saw it on release. At the time Scream was probably one of the few horror films I'd ever seen, and so 90% of the references were lost on me. But now I've learnt a little more their gratuitous crow-barring into the dialogue really grates. You can almost imagine film nerds sitting there with a mental checklist, ticking them off one by one million. Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis (Oh, my sides! His surname is the same as the Doctor's in Halloween, and Halloween features in the film, too! And it's also the name of a character in Psycho, and we reference that too! And he looks a lot like Johnny Depp, who was in Nightmare on Elm Street; Wes Craven's other horror-revitalising movie. What a rib-tickler!!) enters, to be slated by another character "what's leatherface doing here?" Wait a minute - tee-hee-hee, snigger, chuckle! - wasn't Leatherface a character in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre? Well, I say! That really is superb!! What devastating wit! Ha ha ha! Oh, let's cap it all off by tossing in a reference to Carrie, and maybe you could talk about Jamie Lee Curtis being a scream queen. Oh, this is marvellous stuff!Next, we get the much-touted "rules of horror films" sequence. If you have sex you die, if you drink you die... etc., etc., etc. The lovely Courteney Cox is watching all this backslapping goo on a hidden camera and concludes with "Uh... boring!" I quite agree Courteney. The problem with this "rules" scene is that the "rules" it exposes are nowhere near as clever or as revolutionary as they would like to assume they are, merely blatantly obvious. Only a pea-brained idiot would comfortably sit there going "Oh, how clever! I never realised that before!" Craven, who holds a Master's Degree in Philosophy, justifies the whole genre towards the end with: "movies don't create psychos. Movies make psychos more inventive." Is that the best you can do? Don't get me wrong, the genre has been unfairly derided, particularly in England, and Wes is a good spokesman for its plusses. But is that really all he could think of to say? Perhaps he was too busy, and hey, lest we forget, he didn't write the script, but this rollercoaster of smug inanity trundles on with a "can you guess how this movie is going to end?" bore-a-thon. Wes did try his hand at writing similar stuff two years prior, with New Nightmare. While this seems to be destined to be regarded as a "proto-Scream", it's actually the better film, and showed that Wes didn't need Kevin Williamson half as much as Williamson needed him.Linda Blair does a cameo; a character peers into a mirror while saying, "after you branded him the Candyman?" It really does get very, very tiresome. As a historical document, this film will never lose its validity. It opened up a whole new subgenre within the field, albeit a short-lived one that has already passed. It is also made horror popular again, almost single-handedly upturning the fortunes of many genre directors. But as - I'll say it - a movie, it has sorely dated in under five years. Where it was once fresh and sparky, now it's glib and passé.Inevitable sequels followed, the second being arguably better. The third, written by Ehren Kruger after Williamson had moved on, was fine, but lacked impact. Maybe it was the familiarity of the characters, particularly the constipated expression of David Arquette (Who it's now impossible to take seriously after seeing his character reborn as "Doufus" in Scary Movie) and the hard-as-nails attitude of Cox. Moreover, it was a film whose time had now passed, and, the biggest irony of all, it failed to last as long as the movies it lampoons and unwittingly resurrected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was only 10 years old when I first saw "Scream". And I nearly c****ed myself. Seriously, Scream is the most scariest, intelligent, witty movies ever created in the horror genre.The first 15 minutes are obviously, the best, as Drew Barrymore falls prey to that Ghostface Killer, we've all got to love and hate.Neve Campbell acts really well as teen heroine Sidney Prescott - the poor girl who's being hunted down by a maniac with a knife. David Arquette also puts in a few good lines as the slightly thick 'Deputy Dewey'. Jamie Kennedy, Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard and Skeet Ulrich are also OK, but Courteney Cox is the stand out character in this film, as the annoying, bitchy self-absorbed TV reporter.I thought that Scream was very good. It had some pretty gory shots which added to the effect, plus the added bonus of making fun of horror movies and the whole idea of it.However, as the movie progressed I thought that the plot began to slide, and at some points seemed somewhat unrealistic and unfinished. But the final scenes at the house, were excellent, as Sydney attempts to get her own back on the people responsible for her emotional hell (and decapitation of friends and family).Anyway, I've seen Scream many more times since then, and can safely say it is a classic Horror/Comedy film. The acting was brilliant, the plot was good, the one-liners were excellent and Gale's bitchy comments to cameraman Kenny were even better! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>scream is not a typical scary movie, it's a movie about scary movies and that makes scream even more scary. the first time that i saw that movie i didn't like it, because i thought it's just one more scary movie, but after i saw scream 2 i found out that i was wrong. i put the two movies together and saw them as one all and it was then that stroke me that the story was excellent because it gives you a story about scary movies and other movies, in such way that makes it plausible that what happen in the movie could happen in the real life. also it was as scary as hell, having also the element of the "who is the killer?" that is very well worked in this movie, you are gonna have a big surprise at the end. wes craven prove once more that he is a genious in horror movies, the argument by kevin williamson is very good and has a great cast with performances of neve campbell, david arquette, courtney cox, skeet ullrich, jamie kennedy and drew barrymore. in short is one of best movies that i ever saw on screen, it's very good and very scary, and most of all is not brainless like most of the horror movies genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** I recently saw "Scream" for the first time a couple of days ago and I was very impressed. It was one of the best horror films I have ever seen. There are no bad performances, and the script was chilling. Drew Barrymore turns in a great performance in her short cameo role as Casey Becker, the innocent teen who becomes the killers first victim in the first 10 minutes. It is a great mystery which keeps you guessing. The end of the film is almost as scary as the beginning, for several people get killed in pretty gruesome ways. For instance, Rose McGowan's character, Tatum, gets stuck in a pet opening in the garage door and the killer makes the door open, so her head is flattened, or Kenny the Cameraman, whose throat is slit by the killer. Best of all, it has a suprise ending. Since I don't want to give away anymore, let me say this. "Scream" is a great horror flick which you should see right away. I'll leave it at that.</fullReview>

Most of the scenes I found myself laughing or enjoying the lines. The fact that everyone thinks that someone in the killer's outfit is a friend pulling a joke, makes it comic instead of scary.Some scenes are far from realistic, especially when Neve Campbell happens to toss the gun (the only thing to defend herself with!) towards the door opening and guess who happens to be still alive...You never get to wonder who the killer is, coz there's not a clear motive for anyone. So it could be anyone but why...?You wont remember this one for a long time. It's overrated: it deserves a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I'm absolutely no fan of the genre, this film kept my attention from the first minutes. It was scaring most of the time (there's a lot of slashing going on), but humorous just in time not to make you switch to another channel. The end I found actually kind of reassuring, because a murderer with a face is absolutely less scary than one without (I suppose it's the other way around in real life). Looking back, the things in the script that didn't seem to fit while watching fit perfectly once you know who the killer is, so rethinking the film is nice too.A side-show was seeing how cute 'the Fonz' (remember?) still is looking now that he's much older!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the first Scream. I didn't know what to expect and I saw it at one of those cheap seat theatres. It was the most satisfying $1.50 I have ever spent on a movie. I've been watching horror movies since I was very young and the first scene of this movie had me on the edge of my seat and legitimately scared. The self aware feeling of the movie and the many references to past horror films was a double treat for any horror movie buff. Wes Craven attempted this with the last Nightmare on Elm Street (new Nightmare) and suceeded mildly. For Scream, he honed this wicked sense of comedy and made a ground breaking, unpredictable film.  All the acting performances in this film were leagues above all the movies it is paying homage to. Campbell was convincingly tortured and confused as Sidney. Ulrich was excellent and subtly creepy as Billy. Courtney Cox makes the best PMS affected, over achieving, self centered reporter I have ever seen. For once, a movie combined suspense, gore, and humor in a way that leaves the audience satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The End Of Creative Horror Movie Posters...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MORD39 RATING: **1/2 out of ****SCREAM has become a classic already, and I think that's going a bit too far. It seemed so fresh when it came out, but that was due to the fact that the "slasher flick" had been taking a long nap up to the time of its release.Granted, I enjoyed SCREAM for the most part. It knew how to scare and also not take itself too seriously. You were always left wondering who the murderer was, and it was truly a creative surprise when we found out. Still, this was an idea suited for only ONE...I repeat, ONE...film.Now, about that terrible movie poster...I HATE, LOATHE, AND DESPISE IT!!!!! Whoever thought up the uncreative idea of having the young cast stare at us looking depressed have RUINED the artsy designs of horror movie ads of yesteryear! From the 1920's throughout the 1980's we enjoyed paintings and other talented flourishes that illustrated true horror which we expected to find on the screen. BUT TODAY.....all you need is a dumb photograph of brain-dead teenagers looking miserable and staring at you, all grouped in a boring semi-circle, to advertise a new film.This mindless concoction didn't end with the SCREAM film... it continued to the lousy I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and even infected the good HALLOWEEN H20 by having Jamie Lee Curtis and L.L. Cool J. (man, is it OVER!) stare at you grimly with no enticing artwork to back them up!Next time you check out a new horror film in your newspaper (such as BLAIR WITCH PROJECT 2 which has just opened) count how many times all those ads take the easy way out by showing you a bunch of manic depressive teens glaring at you in a daze. Proof positive that, as I keep maintaining, the horror genre is dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Started another horror trend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie started the third major horror movie trend. Psycho started the first, after a while people started to lose interest in the genre. It was brought back to life with Halloween which started another trend that was mainly made up of masked murders and gallons of gory makeup. Again that died down after a decade or so and then another trend was started by the movie Scream.In the small town of Woodsboro, California, two gruesome murders were committed. A small group of teenagers all become suspects until their deaths. Sidney Prescott is the main target of this killer whose mother was butchered one year earlier.I found this to be a really good movie. I think of it as a spoof of horror films. Then came Scary Movie which (Dennis Miller says) basically parodied the parody of horror films. This movie also suffered the same effects that Halloween did. Halloween spawned the Friday the 13th movies and a bunch of other clones. This movie spawned I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legends, Disturbing Behavior and The Faculty and I thought they all sucked. Even Scream's sequels I didn't think were that great. So basically I thought Scream was good but anything(except H20)that came after went downhill.This movie also contained a good cast. The extremely beautiful Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox give great performances. David Arquette, Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy provided the movies great sense of humor, which was one of it's stronger points. Skeet Ulrich gave kind of a creepy feeling to the movie I thought. Also the plot twists at the end were nice.Another thing that made this movie great was it's good direction. One scene inparticular that I thought worked really well was the scene where Dewey was searching the house toward the end and heard screaming and it was none other than Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween on TV. I've never been a big Wes Craven fan but I give him credit for this movie's good direction.If you don't hate horror movies, check this out. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only movie where FONZIE gets killed with a butcher knife. I saw the first two...didn't bother to see the last film. This film had a certain charm but the teen horror movie craze is dying fast. These films get release and within 7 days are yanked. SCREAM had it's success because it was the first in this latest trend followed by....I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER WHEN YOU WERE UNEMPLOYED AND BORED. Yeah, the women in these movies are cute but give me someone who can act....you know, EMMA THOMPSON. I could see doing a first film but the name of the game in hollwoood is run a franchise into the ground. By the time the last film came no one cared. The teen film fad is just that, a fad. However, film companies do this because they love to cash in on teens. (in more than one way ie. the casting couch) This film was original yet, glamorized gross out death scenes. I understand this however, I only went to see it once. WES CRAVEN is a good director he should step away from the horror genere and do a drama or a cop thriller or something and really show off his skills.</fullReview>

I didn't watch the sequels...but something tells me (I don't want to say they'd be bad JUST because they're sequels) that I wouldn't be missing anything, because the original was SO entertaining! I also loved the way this movie was structured...we all know those B-level horror movies we watch and then regret...but this one stylistically beats even movies that aren't horror, but suspense thrillers. For example, after the first killing in the beginning, I think we'd all agree that the humor was good to come after this because it was served as comic relief. All in all, a very impressive movie for its genre, a definite mark in setting a new standard for horror films to come.-Sep</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A milestone in its genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt, Scream, a splendid work of Wes Craven- Kevin Williamson cooperation, was really a milestone in its genre both owing to its very original plot and the imitations made after it was released in 1996. Well, you may laugh, but in my opinion, Williamson should have been - at least - a nominee for the Oscar for the best original screenplay that year. I simply admired the plot, and its originality. It rested on the idea that while it made fun of the basic rules of horror films, the events were based upon the same rules! Terrific!.. ( Warning: Spoiler) For instance, while Sydney (Neve Campbell) was talking to the killer on the phone for the first time, she said about scary movies:"...they're all the same.Some stupid killer stalking some big-breasted girl who can't act and is always running up the stairs when she should be running out of the front door; it's insulting." However, when she came up against the ghostface, she tried to run out of the front door but she could not do so because she had just locked it.Consequently, she necessarily ran up the stairs in order to escape from the killer like the"big breasted girl" she had just mentioned. What fun!! (Spoiler END) Apart from being extremely original, the screenplay was also a brilliant achievement due to the perfect concealment of the killer. ( Major SPOILER!) In the first hour, I highly suspected of Billy and was sure he was the killer. But all my suspicion died down when I saw the ghostface and Billy together in the bedroom in Stu's house. How could I have known that there were two killers indeed?! Besides, the characters were great! I especially loved Gale Weathers, who was ready to do anything in order to do her "job", and Randy, the young expert in horror films. (Spoiler END)As for the acting, I think Drew Barrymore was the best although her role was quite short. She acted Casey Becker so impressively that the most scary scene was hers, which was full of suspense and horror. The music was also fine, adding much to our suspense during the pre-murder scenes.In conclusion,this movie was simply a must see one that made the teen slasher movies popular in the late 90s. Actually, it was both Craven's and Williamson's outstanding achievement which made this movie a milestone in its genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But once again actors in their mid-to-late twenties are playing teenagers and the effect of the film is totally ruined as they behave and act so unrealistic. While most people may consider this a cool movie just because of the scares and the over-hyped 'irony' there is actually an intelligent plot with a pretty good twist. I notice this more as I am a writer and this is one of my fave horror/thrillers.I advise you not to watch this for the pumped up scares (to a very loud soundtrack) but for how a typical 'who's the killer?' plot line can be a little better than it is believed to be.Some of the characters can be really annoying. In fact the only one that doesn't enrage me is Dewey. His idiotness makes me laugh and diverts my attention from the other characters in the very slow 'character building scenes'. The direction and photography are very bland. Wes Craven did a much better job of a real horror film with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. Here it just seems as if he aiming at the teen/popcorn market. You'll notice that, with these kind of movies, most of the characters (not actors) are teenagers and the tone of the film is mostly 'safe'. In the Scream 'sub-genre' there is never any REAL edge. After this movie was made, many, increasing bad, movies that were all exactly the same rolled off a conveyor belt in Hollywood. They were easy moneymakers. Craven knew this beforehand but deep, intelligent movies do not sit well with mass audiences. The blander the style of film is, the more popular it will be with the majority of audiences. The plot in this one redeems these bad qualities. I just wish for a real horror film to come out of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is a fantastic film. This sleeper was very successful and went on to spawn two sequels that grossed even more money at the box office. It not only skyrocketed the careers of screenwriter Kevin Williamson and its star Neve Campbell but this movie also did wonders for director Wes Craven and Drew Barrymore. Barrymore has a Janet Leigh/Psycho-like part in the film but you'll have to check it out for yourself to see what I mean. It also features cameos from Craven and Linda Blair. And you can't miss Henry Winkler as the principal. It's a movie that revitalized a brand of scary movies that had been dead since the 80s and it started a whole revolution of teen films for the 90s and beyond, not just scary ones. If not for Scream we might not have movies like American Pie or that whole new group of popular teen actors. Bottom Line: Thank God for 1996's SCREAM and the unforgettable impact that followed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My usual answer to this question would be no. I always thought horror movies were silly. Just a lot of blood and idiot characters who just scream and do the most stupid things while getting away of the killer, who never dyes. `Scream' doesn't deny that. On the contrary, the great thing about this movie is exactly that: it plays with the `rules' of horror movies.Movies that take a silly plot serious doesn't work. `Scream' is always laughing of its own plot. In the middle of the movie Randy tell us the rules of his own movie. People talk about a horror movie and right after it, Tatoon appears dressed like the movie character. The parody doesn't end here, during all the movie Kevin Williamson comes with more sarcasm.The cast is great. Beyond all the people who dies, there's Neve Campbel as Sydney Prescot. Courtney Cox when I didn't know her yet, totally different from Monica as Gale Wethers and her future husband David Arquette as Dewey.Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven had a great idea and made a wonderful job with `Scream'. It was the first time a entertaining movie about teenagers being frightened by a killer actually gained the critics applause. Bravo!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After this series of teen 'horror' movies (Scream trilogy, I Know what you did Last Summer, Urban Legend ect...) I figure real horror is going away, this movies are dumb! There is always a fine woman, a psycho, and stupid comedy! Wes Craven has actually had real horror at one time (Last House on the Left) I just hope he comes back with a bang (and Wes, please nothing other than horror! People know you as a horror director and nothing else) The beginning was ok but no 'horror'! I hope there is a director that has the guts to put a good horror movie out in the upcoming years.If you are looking for a horror movie that has real horror in it see Cannibal Holocaust, Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Cannibal Ferox, Last House on the Left, Any Ruggero Deodato, Fulci film. Or if your looking for gore see Guinea Pig films, Story of Ricky-Oh, House by the Cemetary. As of late there has been some good horror/thrillers one of them being Stigmata.4/10-for the good casting, funny moments, and the big success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On Second Thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an earlier comment on Scream I was way too negative about this Wes Craven/Kevin Williamson joint venture. After seeing Scream 2, which I found very entertaining, I went to the store to buy Scream. I had to if I wanted to see it again, for I had erased my first copy. Seeing it for the second time I appreciated it much more. Although the opening scenes with Drew Barrymore are not really my kind of potato, for -call me old-fashioned- I don't like long-stretched brutality and yes I do think this qualifies as such, the film on the whole is good. Not nice, but good. I am particularly impressed by Neve Campbell's charismatic acting. Jamie Kennedy's humorous role is essential to this film. The story is not constructed in a bad way, as I claimed in my first comment, but in fact it really stimulates viewers to eagerly try and find out the killer's identity. In this sense Williamson has done a great job and the way he almost lets his story run out of control only to make it all fit in the end in a remarkable and highly entertaining way is praiseworthy. The scenes I like most is where Campbell hears two girls talking about her in school; the one where Kennedy becomes ecstatic in the video store; the principal (Henry Winkler, uncredited for some reason) apologizing to the janitor; and Campbell impersonating the voice on the phone ("Wanna play a game? It's called: Guess Who Called the Police..."). So on second thought, Scream is not that bad at all and Wes Craven deserves a little more credit than I first gave him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Scream after I saw Scream 2 &amp; 3 and I think it is cooler and more original than the sequels ! I never saw any other slasher movie with two killers that cover one on each other.

		<shortDescription>Revived the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slasher movies had pretty much disappeared after the late 80s because they were all poorly written and acted and had become cliched. Scream came along and changed all that. A fresh look into slasher movies with a 90s trendy edge. While the movie was not really suspenseful it did deliver scare thrills and some exciting chases. The acting was also much MUCH better than alot of the 80s slashers and should become a classic, much like Halloween and Friday the 13th became, down the road.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream was an excellent movie. It did it's job very well. The purpose of the movie was to scare the viewers and it really worked fine.This was the first movie of it's type, and after this film there have been many other movies made trying to duplicate it.The sequel of Scream (Scream 2) was not as succesful as the first one. And the last one (Scream 3) was a total chaos.The reason why Scream was so fantastic is, as I mentioned before, it was the first movie of it's type. No other movies like this had been made before, so nothing in the movie could be said that it was ripped off from other movie(s).The plot isn't that good, we all know that, and neither are the performances by the actors, but the reason I'm saying that this film is so good is because it accomplished it's mission, it gave a really good time to all the people who watched it (at least all the young people), so I guess I can't complain. I really enjoyed watching the movie.I'll rate it with a 9 out of 10. It's not really a 9 movie, it's more of like a 7 movie, but as I said, most (young) people enjoyed it a lot, it was original and the first of it's kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror ever? = )</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream may not be the best horror ever by critics but by me? its surely one of my favorites. I've been in tons of arguments (that I've won like everytime!) that scream is not a horror that it is a spoof/black comedy. my argument is this, Slasher was dead in the mid 90's, Kevin Williamson (creater/writer) came along and wrote a movie called 'Scary Movie' (Later changed to 'Scream') and it hit! it hit like crazy, the first scream was definitely a horror, and that ignited a flame back into the genre that I so dearly love of horror: Slasher and then all the 'Scream' Ripoffs came just like the nike ripoffs came trying to make money, trendy unrealistic movies aka : I know what you did last summer, The faculty, etc etc. Movies like this trashed 'Scream', serious horror fans dislike Scream so much its not even funny but you have to agree every horror has a trendy teen who loves beer/and drugs in it. Not saying there were any drugs in scream but you catch my drift, sure there were a few JOKES in scream but what horror doesn't have the teens making jokes, Halloween, F13, and TCM had jokes! Scream is a better script and higher production that is the main reason why it hit, it actually had good actors/actresses in it! and that isn't why you should dislike a movie, that is just my opinion!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh spin on a dying genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a film that is so saturated in Kyro-syrup, so over the top with media-savvy jabs, and so cynical, that it almost topples from it's genre-bending tendencies. Yet on most accounts, it succeeds. There's no denying that it helps to be a fan of the genre. However, the clever craftsmanship of this film should provide an entertaining experience for anyone in the mood to be scarred. The film starts out on a high note, with an extremely effecting opening sequence. Unfortunately, Kevin Williamson's script looses its punch towards the ? mark, suffering from an overly long (and gory) finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw "Scream" I was not a horror/suspense movie fan, but the film really hook me up. The first scene let me breathless and I was thinking it was all a joke, until I saw the first murder. That was enough to keep my eye watching it all carefully. And the story, how everything lead to the end - and what an ending scene! And I thank my cousin for rent this video.Unfortunately, I can't tell much about the movie, but there something I can tell you: when you watch the movie, follow its ideas and look for some horror movies as "The Exorcist" which is one of the many sources of this movie - if you haven't looked yet.Many people can tell this movie sucks for a reason or for another, but one thing is certain: at least the new moviegoers like me who liked the movie will have an encyclopedia about horror movies. It's up with us read it or not. And, again, I thank my cousin, 'cause she loves scary movies, most the oldest ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rightfully imitated revival of the teen slasher flick follows a group of high school students through the usual threats and deaths, with a twist: they have seen many films just like the one they are starring in, and comment incessantly about what is happening. Terrific film features a multi-talented cast, a witty, starmaking script by Williamson, and tense, perfect direction from Craven. Very funny and very scary. Followed by two sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scream" is a movie that will entertain anybody. The acting is incredible with powerful performances by Neve Campbell and David Arquette and much, much more. I think that a lot of uniqueness was put into this movie and the killer-on-the-phone part of it was by far the best. But one of the best things about Scream though, is that its not just a movie about a psycho killer butchering up teens with a sharp knife, it also has mystery and a story behind it. Believe me, if you haven't seen Scream, you should definitely give it a try. And if you like it, there are two great sequels to go with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slasher / thriller classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly a classic slasher / thriller movie, for it is truly scary, has a good plot, great actors, a lot of blood, celebrity cameos (very rare for the first film of a series, which says something about the film already), a good soundtrack, great direction and it is funny. Though I still do think Scream 2 is better, this is good too, even though this is the second time I watched this one. I had to, but soon I'd be seeing part 3 and I wanted to be all back in the history of Scream. The killer still is frightening, although I knew who it was. I knew it also the first time I watched it, a minute or so before it was revealed, well kind of anyway. But still, the ending is just great. If there would be persons to thank here for doing a great job, it would be all of them, what a great ensemble, man, but special thanks to the casting, for picking these eye ? feasts, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Drew Barrymore and the well figured Rose McGowan, who was really sexy here.Other good things in this film were, that the comedy wasn't focused on only one person, but they were all funny in a way and that they were not all just people, but they were characters, which is really rare in a slasher film.7, 5 (so that'll be an 8 here) out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is a word to those who don't like SCREAM.I can agree at some points, some of the people who loved it has probably not laid an eye on the classic ones, and the scary stuff is scary for those peoples. But are you aware about that SCREAM IS A SPOOF AT THOSE MOVIES?It's a SPOOF! So why, oh why keep on comparing it to HALLOWEEN and THE EXCORCIST. HELLO???? IS THERE ANYBODY HOME???? Maybe you don't know WHY it's called "Scream"??? Ghostface, the painting (scream), hello... Oh, and the ending might be refered as a satire on how long the killer can survive in all the movies (nobody can survive an umbrella to the heart twice)? Why do you see this as a horrormovie. I have actually seen PSYCHO, THE EXCORCIST and HALLOWEEN and all of these movies are very good films (Psycho is one of my favorite movies), but SCREAM IS FUNNY! It really is, didn't you even notice that Fred, the janitor, had Freddy Krueger's clothes? Didn't you see the fun where Jamie Kennedy shouts to himself to watch out? Come on... I loved SCREAM and since I'm the movie-nerd that's worse than Randy, I put this movie at nr.3 on my top-movies. SCREAM is the movie-trivia-heaven and THE ULTIMATE HORROR-SPOOF.It is a comedy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pathetic attempt at such classics such as halloween and psycho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All those teenage girls who drool over this cra* have no idea of what a true horror movie is. They have never seen masterpieces such as Halloween, the Exorcist, the omen, Rosemary's baby, or pyscho. They have only seen Scream and nightmare on elm street. Scream is not a horror film at all. It is not scary the least bit. it is a trendy teeny bopper chick flick in which the characters date and gossip. I have to admit i was unsure who to suspect, however, the climax was unbelievably stupid. The two guys start slashing each other Why? Neve campell dresses up in the costume, and the killer somehow comes back to life at the nerds summoning. It produced a few chills at the beginning, but that was all. A thoroughly forgettable date movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever and funny... oh, and also scary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, Scream is without a doubt my favorite film. I have always been a big fan of slasher films, but most of them are absolutely horrible even though they might be a lot of fun. However, when Scream came out in 1996, I became absolutely fascinated with this genre and went to my video store to rent all of the Halloween series and the Friday the 13th series. There is no doubt in my mind; Scream is one of the very best, up there with the first Halloween.Sure, not everyone will recognize this fact right now, but believe me, in a few years, people will look back at this film and consider it a horror classic. One only has to look at the life it put back in the genre, as a ton of very bad imitations came running on the screens, trying to cash in on the horror madness. (One only has to think of I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, and Halloween - H20.) Obviously though, not one of these movies has been able to reach the height, the standard that Scream has set.The film is both clever and funny. A lot of people might be inclined to say that I'm exaggerating, and I will let those people attack me and Scream as long as they have noticed the very subtle reference to the second most famous scene in Psycho (the one where the detective gets killed). It has to be one of the smartest references in cinema history, and if you can see it, you can truly consider yourself a horror fan.All in all, I gave it an 8/10. In a few years, most people will probably think I should have given it a 9.Feel free to send your comments to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the *best* movie ever(along w/ the sequel). Scream, is not only scary, but also funny. The characters are wonderful- you will probably relate to someone in the movie. There's Sidney Prescott, the seemingly average high school girl, except that her mother was raped and brutally murdered; Randy Meeks, the geeky horror-movie buff and a friend of Sidney; Billy Loomis, Sidney's boyfriend that's kinda creepy; Tatom Riley, Sidney's best friend; Stu Macher, Tatom's boyfriend and friend of Sidney; Dewey Riley, the Deputy of Woodsboro and older brother of Tatom; Gale Weathers, the sneaky self-centered news reporter; Cotton Weary, the guy that's suspected and arrested as the killer of Sidney's mother one year ago; Casey Becker and Steven Orth, two high school seniors from Woodsboro High School. Take all of those characters, a psycotic killer that makes phone calls to most of his victims, some great surprises, a little comedy relief, and a town setting like Woodsboro, and you get one hell of a movie......... SCREAM..........It's A Scream Baby! 10/10 A+++</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film! (Spoilers!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I myself am a fan of horror, from Universal Monsters of the 40's to modern takes on the slasher films. And I found scream to be a really great film. The first time you see it, you really don't know who the killer is, but you do have an idea, which is then shattered when you see the boyfriends fake death. It's not the best horror movie I've seen, but it was a great attempt. It was a slasher flick, but not a mystery that they made it to be. I figured it out, first time I saw it.There were just little things I didn't like, but I knit-pick. The thing about everyone in town being a movie historian freak was kind of weird. The fact that with all this technology we have these days and the cops couldn't get any clues??Well, what made up for it was the fact that the killer could be hurt! When you hit him, he fell down, that was good.I liked the "Rules of a Scary Movie", and I enjoyed the hints at past movies (the phone calls, etc.)Overall, not bad. I'd recommend this to a horror fan, because I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Slasher Film is Reborn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while, a movie comes along and revives or re-defines a specific genre. Two great examples are "Die Hard",which gave the action genre a shot in the arm, and "FatalAttraction", which gave new meaning to the term "psychologicalthriller". In 1978, John Carpenter's "Halloween" revived theslasher picture, which was spawned 18 years earlier by AlfredHitchcock's classic 1960 film "Psycho". In 1996, 18 years after"Halloween" scared the hell out of movie audiences, the slashergenre was revived and redefined yet again by Wes Craven's newnightmare flick "SCREAM". "Scream" tells the story of a rash ofspree killings plaguing the suburban California town ofWoodsboro. These murders seem to be connected to teenager SydneyPrescott (Neve Campbell), whose mother Maureen was brutallyslain exactly one year earlier. The film opens with a tour-de-force performance by Drew Barrymore, who has the JanetLeigh role from "Psycho" (first identifiable character who iskilled off early on in the story). Barrymore is terrorized viatelephone (borrowing from such horror classics as "When AStranger Calls" and "Black Christmas") by an assailant wearing ablack cloak and eerie "Ghostface" mask. After this harrowingopening sequence, the fun begins again as the people in Sydney'sorbit become either suspects and/or victims. These characters(superbly written by Kevin Williamson) include: bitchy,ambitious journalist Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox, in a knockoutperformance); Sydney's best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) and herditsy policeman brother Dewey (David Arquette, Cox's on-screenand off-screen paramour); Sydney's boyfriend Billy Loomis(played by Skeet Ulrich, a dead ringer for actor Johnny Depp,who starred in Craven's 1984 classic "A Nightmare On ElmStreet". Ulrich broods much like Depp, and his character's nameis an obvious reference to the characters in "Psycho" and"Halloween" played by John Gavin and Donald Pleasence); Billy'sgoofy buddy Stu (Matthew Lillard); and horror film buff Randy(Jamie Kennedy). The script includes rich characterizations (theactors are all in top form as directed by the brilliant Craven),several plot twists (you'll change your mind a dozen timesbefore you guess the identity of the killer), references toother horror films, and an audacious sense of humor. "Scream",like "Psycho" and "Halloween" spawned a countless number ofclones and imitations in the wake of its success. A must-see forfans of this genre. My score: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scream" is an outstanding horror film with a sharp sense of humor. Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson conjured up this very entertaining movie that pokes fun at the slasher movie genre. Neve Campbell's film career took off with her role here as Sidney Prescott, the young high school girl who's a target of the killer that does practically the same thing Michael Myers did in "Halloween". In the midst of all the gory murders, there's delightful bits of comedy. David Arquette (Dewey) and Courtney Cox (Gale Weathers) provide alot of the humor, as do Matthew Lillard (Stu), Jamie Kennedy (Randy), and Rose McGowan (Tatum). Even Henry Winkler has a funny bit part as the principal. Williamson (his first screenplay) became such a hot item after the success of "Scream", he followed this with "I Know What You Did Last Summer", "Scream 2", and "The Faculty". All these movies were either big or modest box office hits. And as for Wes Craven, this is probably his best film to date. I liked "Scream" better than his earlier hit, the original "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (which was good). Craven would eventually follow "Scream" up with two sequels, but neither one could top the original. Still, a pretty good trilogy that starts with a bang with the first one. This one is the best.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

Honestly, I thought horror was stupid and really did not have any story, just a bunch of people getting killed. Yes, I know that that is stearotyping. Scream is different. I was amazed at Kevin Williamson's masterpiece. It is very intelligent!Scream is about a group of kids that get terrorized by an unknown masked killer. It will keep you guessing who the killer is until the end!After Scream I became a horror movie fanatic! If you liked this, I reccomend Haloween, and A Nightmare on Elm Street, which is also directed by Craven.If you have not seen Scream, RENT IT!!

Sure we've seen some real crap, but at the same time some greatness (''The Faculty'', ''The Blair Witch Project'' (I know, its not the same, but really, do you think anyone ever done it if 'Scream' never came`?)). The movie itself then. This movie is my third favorite movie of all time. Its so entertaining and funny. Except for the opening scene you can't buy any mean say that its scary anywhere, can you?Craven and Williamson have cooked up a standard slasher-film where teens get sliced up by a maniac. But now the teens are prepared (from all movies of course). The thing that makes ''Scream'' so different from the rest is that we find out about all details, compairs, and rules of scary movie, who we all know existed but never thought about. And if that wasn't enough it is funny! Craven and Williamson makes, among much else, fun about how long the killer can survive (how many can survive two runthroughs in the heart by an umbrella?) and just look at the school-cleaner, Fred. Take a look at his clothes too. By the way, he is played by Craven! The acting is very funny (I just loved the super-stupid Dewey), the music is standard-good, but the soundtrack is great (I have it myself).Of course these slashers can't be really called as horrorfilm, so I can say that this is the best slasherfilm ever!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>90210 meets horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many IMDb-Users have commented that this is the movie who brought the horror genre back to life. I disagree. What Scream really did was to invent a more or less new kind of genre. It definitely has horror elements in it but more important are the teenagers that are all over this film. All right, "Halloween" (1978) did have teenagers too but still the film was about the killer (Michael Myers) himself and not about the kids he happened to kill.What I'm trying to say is that Scream is a good film. But after the huge success many other studios tried to make money with other teen-horror flicks that were aiming at the same audience. And that's where it got really stupid. Scream could have been unique but unfortunately it spawned a whole generation of similar films that fed of the same basic idea but just failed to be original. The makers of Scream were lucky to publish the film at a time where there were almost no good horror films anymore and that's why it attracted that many people.Scream is a good combination of horror and comedy/parody, there's no question about that. The general problem with this kind of film always was that it is very difficult for a film to be scary and funny at the same time. Craven and Williamson avoided to mix comedy and scares in the same scenes and separated these two elements. That's the reason why Scream did what others haven't been able to do.The film is by no means as scary as the "true" horror films (Halloween, The Evil Dead, A Nightmare on Elm Street and others) but has its scares. The opening scene is very intense and sadistic but we already get some allusions to other horror films. This scene is more intense than the whole remaining 100 minutes. There are other scenes where the killer is very sadistic when killing his victims but it never gets really scary. Although the killer looks great in the white mask I didn't have the impression that he was as dangerous as good old Michael Myers or Fred Krueger. The idea of a 18 year old psycho-boy hiding behind that mask didn't make it any scarier.But of course Scream wasn't supposed to be plain horror. More important are the allusions to other horror films and these were done very good. Some of the jokes were a little too obvious but I guess otherwise most of the ignorant viewers out there wouldn't understand it. On the other hand I think I still haven't noticed them all myself.Another important aspect is the who's-the-lunatic-behind-the-mask question. We have the time to get to know all the persons including the one(s) that is/are responsible for the murders. Honestly, I didn't have the slightest idea who would be the killer (I didn't think about it very heavily though). Some persons have commented that they found the film to be predictable. They are either very clever or lying and I tend to say the latter thing is true (no offence included).I hope I didn't make it sound as if this movie was mediocre because it isn't. It is clever, suspenseful in some places and very amusing in others. Overall it is one of the most original films of the decade and perfect to watch with a group of friends.I highly recommend this movie but also advise you to stay away from the imitations that followed.My rating: 10/10 (Don't expect the sequels to be equally clever!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horror genre did not require saving in the first place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, this was mainly a watch-able movie, with the odd 'jumpy' scene and a few chuckles. It is however not the saviour of horror as many of the comments aired here would have you believe.Horror, and slasher movies in particular are by themselves parodies. They don't need to be sent up as they do this well enough by themselves! Like the Matrix did for sci fi films, this seems to have unleashed praise well over the level of the actual movies quality.The opening was by far and away the best thing about this film, I watched it and thought, here we go! but by the end I was left unsatisfied and slightly cheated. What is it all about? its certainly not a genuine horror film, its hardly a full blown comedy and the plot or characters are not substantive enough for a thriller. The whole thing smacks of a 'look at me I'm so clever' attitude.I think the people who say this film has somehow 'saved' the horror genre don't actually watch horror films. Horror films have, and never should be about box office receipts or pleasing the general movie going public. Horror at its best is subvertive, dark, demanding and disturbing. True horror can create an intensity of atmosphere and emotion that no other genre can touch. This film just tries a little to hard to cover all the bases and I'm afraid I can't buy into the irony of this film when it is done with such a sledgehammer subtleness and a knowing postmodern ("jee aint I cool!") wink.Entertaining forgetful fluff this may be, saviour of the horror genre it is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Rediscovers A Genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1980s' the horror film genre took off in a big way. Initial films were followed by sequel after sequel after sequel. This ended up making the genre into a laughing stock, the scares weren't scary the acting was at best 'hammy'. To coin a phrase it all went a 'bit pear shaped'. Upon watching Scream for the first time I set my expectations low, this was an error because this is a truly brilliant film, a masterpiece of horror in its own right.Wes Craven uses the tired nature of horror flicks to his advantage throughout this carefully plotted film, with constant jibes and references to inferior slasher flicks of the past. Both Craven and Williamson have combined to deliver us a well presented and scary movie that is a thrill a minute from the first Hello to the final fright.The plot centres around a teenage girl named Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who is being terrorised through phonecalls and attacks of various sorts from a person in a ghost-type costume. As the film carries on many victims succumbe to nasty ends to the killer, who is trying to make a statement until the time comes for his ultimate and essential victim.The location for this film is a quaint little middle-class American town. As usual in Hollywoodland, there only seems to be one type of person in these surroundings and they would be White people. The race card is played again by Hollywoods big bosses which doesn't necessarily let the film down, but does rub me up the wrong way somehow. So for me the film loses some of its high status that I'm building for it.This aside it is a really good film, the best horror for a long while, and streets ahead of the many similar films such as I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Faculty and Urban Legends.This film does put things right for horror films in many ways and sets them back up alongside any other type of film in the world.This film will probably go down as a classic. Leave all other horror films alone when making your choice, this is the one you will appreciate the most, a thoroughly good, enjoyable, witty, thrilling and scary film. Nuff said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when I saw "Scream", it was back in December of 1996, when the film first opened. I went and saw it with my oldest brother whom had never been into horror movies, but thought the trailer of the movie looked good. Well, when I walked out of the movie I have to say, Craven and newbie Williamson did a great job. What I thought would be a horror spoof turned out to be a chilling real life horror movie. Not the cliché unstoppable killer (i.e. Jason, Freddy, Michael, etc.). The movie takes place in a small fictional California town, called "Woodsboro" I can't say too much without giving some of the movies secrets away, so I will just say the movie is about a killer who starts stalking Sidney Prescott (played by Neve Campbell) and threatens to kill her and takes credit for her Mothers murder the year before. As the movie continues, the killer continues to knock of a few people and along them, some of Sidney's friends. From the opening sequence to the ending sequence, this movie is DEFIANTLY worth a look. But don't take mine or anyone else's opinion. See this movie for yourself. You may love it or hate it. I'm just the messenger :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great piece of innovative horror film thinking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scream" is one of the first horror movies I have seen that has ever managed to scare me and delight me at the same time. It it fun and enjoyable because it's scary, yet it pokes fun at the very genre it's categorized under. It makes fun of horror movies, and it's scary as hell at other times. That unique combination is what really delighted me about "Scream". It's a horror film that doesn't really take itself seriously. The film begins with an ingenious sequence where Drew Barrymore is in her house by herself(great setup), and receives a phone call from an unknown stranger. She assumes it's some sort of prank, and continues to on the phone, which develops into a conversation about what her favorite scary movies are. Then, fantasy seems to turn into reality as the person she is talking to lets her know he's watching her, she sees her boyfriend tied up and killed, and then she too is attacked and killed by the intruder. Never have I been so scared by a beginning of a film! Sadly, the rest of the film which was also quite scary, never lived up to the fear the opening sequence produced in me. Throughout the movie, the characters talk endlessly about sci-fi/horror films, and constantly compare the murders and incidents to how they happened in horror films. This was where the real genius of the film came into view, because now the audience doesn't know whether to be scared or to simply laugh it off. We don't quite know where "Scream" is going, and that makes it all the more fun. My only true disappointment in the film was when the killer's identity was revealed. I know it was something that had to be done, but I always found it scarier when the killer's identity was kept a mystery. The costume the killer wears is great, and it reminded me very much of the movie "Halloween". However, "Halloween" was a different kind of movie, because it was a serious horror film, and "Scream" is not. I just wish that the sequel could've been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>in the 90's we have had some really bad horror films the genre was dead, the last good horror film was in 1988 with Halloween 4 but that all changed in 1996 when Kevin Williamson wrote Scream the movie is very suspenseful, the first 15min to this film is horror at it's very best. Wes Craven the master of horror did a great job at the directing the cast was great, the only problem i have wit this movie is that so many bad horror films tried to cash in after this. alot of people say how original this movie is, that is not true it rips off countless horror movies but Kevin Williamson mixed it together the right way. if you're a horror fan you will find this movie very funny with the rules to survive a horror film speach by Randy. if you're not a horror fan you will still probably like this movie. and Deputy Dewey is just so classic, the one original thing in this film is when you find out who is behind all the murders what a twist it takes i never saw it coming, check this movie out you will love it good for a few scares and laughs. i give it 9/10. the only good horror movies to follow this were the ones wrote by Kevin Williamson, and once again what a great job by Wes Craven the king of horror</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes I don't know why I like the Scream movies. Sure, they are funny, and I do find them all to be acceptably suspenseful, but they're all extremely flawed, as well - including this, the original. While this movie probably contains less flaws than the other two, it's still full of continuity errors and unlikely occurrences. The question is, how much of it is intentional? Who can tell? (Example: *spoiler* somebody fakes his death with ketchup while making it appear to an onlooking character that he really is being stabbed by another character. Come on.)In the end, though, it doesn't really matter because all three movies manage to entertain despite their flaws, partly due to decent acting on the part of some of the supporting players (Courteney Cox, David Arquette, and especially Jaime Kennedy) and the direction of Wes Craven. I do NOT, however, credit Kevin Williamson that much. While his concept is good, he really only creates a couple round characters and his script succeeds onscreen only because of the aforementioned individual efforts. One need only look at anything Williamson has ever done outside of the Scream series to realize how bad a writer he really is.Incidentally, I predict that the Scream movies aren't going to age well - not at all. Why? Because all three are so wrapped up in nineties dialogue and pop culture references that in fifteen years no one under the age of 25 will understand them and those older than that will probably be embarrassed that they ever did. Still, in today's context, I give all three an 8/10.See also my reviews of Scream 2 and Scream 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the coolest and more original horror movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed SCREAM. I haven't seen too many horror movies that struck me as great, especially since most of them are the same. I like THE SIXTH SENSE, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and SCREAM for the same reason, they are more original than the default horror flick.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is still mourning the death of her mother, who died nearly one year ago. She seems very distant, even from her best friend Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan) and her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich). She, and most everyone else, thought that the killer was already behind bars. But when people close to Sidney start to get killed, Sidney realizes the the killer is still at large. Deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette) is there to protect Sidney and reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) is there to get the scoop.I think the plot of this movie is very interesting and fun. The best part of it is that the killer does his murders in the style of horror movies. The rules of horror movies are often referred to and horror movies are even spoofed fairly often as well.The actors do a very good job. Neve Campbell is excellent as the primary target/victim and main character of this movie. David Arquette does a fair job as the inexperienced cop (but not as good as in the sequel) and Courtney Cox does a great job as the bitch reporter. Drew Barrymore did very good in her very brief part as Casey Becker. Jamie Kennedy does an OK job as Randy Meeks, the movie expert (but again, not as good as in the sequel). Roger Jackson is the best possible choice for the phone voice and Henry Winkler had a great cameo.The character development in this movie is good. You'll probably often yell "Look behind you, moron" or "Get out of the room, idiot" at your TV, which this movie is probably going for. Sidney is the most interesting character, with Dewey and and Gale at a close second.I was surprised that I found Scream 2 to be even better than Scream was. But both are really good. Go out and buy them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made Me Become a Slasher Fan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream has to be one of the greatest horror movies ever made. People that have not seen the film or its sequels would probably think of it as a plotless horror movie with bad acting, just like its inspirations (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend). That steriotypical remark is so far from the truth it's amazing. Scream is a funfilled, extremely clever, and exceptionally funny movie that it is right up there with Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Psycho as my favorite horror movie. This movie has everything a scary movie can offer. The beginning is the greatest beginning to any movie I have ever seen. The Ghostface costume and the terrifying voice is bone-chilling. It is pretty scary (And I'm a guy that doesn't get scared by movies too often) and it has many edge-of-your-seat thrills. The script is so original and fresh. It has such thoughtful and great characters. And who the killer(s) turn out to be is totally awesome. I really loved this movie. It made me become a teen slasher fan. This movie has inspired me to see the Halloween movies, the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, and even the ghastly and horrible Friday the 13th movies. The story is totally unpredictable and is so funny in places that I was on the floor laughing (especially the scenes with Randy). If you are a fan of teen movies and horror movies, you have to rent this movie. It is complete and all out fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that reestablished the horror gender's authority</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quality rating: *** out of ***** (three out of five). It's interesting to watch Scream, because this was the movie that reestablished the authority of the horror gender. After the tremendous success of Wes Craven's film, Hollywood delivered to us Urban Legend, Scream 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream 3. Some of those movies were great, others were just rip-offs made to profit from the box-offices. Scream is an entertaining thriller, and the greatest goal of it is to quote the stereotypes of those kinds of films. There are many references, from Halloween to Hellraiser, and Scream is specially delicious for those who really enjoy not just bloody pictures, but also cinema in general.The dialogues are sharp and funny, and the energy and talent offered by the young cast brings strength for the motion picture. Wes Craven increases suspense and fear in some sequences and he does succeed to create memorable moments, honoring masters like Alfred Hitchcok. Neve Campbell is a good actress, and the supporting cast is great as well, but the problem is that the plot was a little bit previsible.Anyway, this is what Craven wanted, once his film is , above all, a tribute to the horror flicks.Overall, Scream is one of the most entertaining, fast-paced and valuable films from the nineties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film (slight spoiler below - warning!!!!!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins in a way that makes you sit up and take notice, the stalking scene has been widely talked about but is still very atmospheric and sets the tone for the rest of the film. It is interesting to see how each of the characters develops in light of the events taking place and this means that you find yourself watching the film again with hindsight to see if there was any way you could have realised who did it earlier.(***spoiler (sorry)***The fact that there are two killers are what adds to the who dunnit element of the film. Of the two killers both have an alibi for at least one of the murders and the possibility of accomplices only dawned on me at the very end.There are some excellent performances, notabley by Sydney, Stu (my favourite) and at the end a real transformation in Billy when he becomes genuinely scarey.For the most part there is also a believability about the film which adds to it (admittedly we don't know where Billy hid the fake blood after he'd been having sex with Sydney but we will forgive this) and the fact that it becomes part horror, part thriller, part comedy and all entertainment is what has made it so popular.The directing is also excellent with lots of shock moments and subtle use of reflection and camera work. I also like the way that the killer can get beaten up so much as it makes a nice change from an invisible baddie.Overall 8 / 10 (better than the sequel although that was still a good film and worthy enough to be mentioned)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about Scream, I was sure that it was going to be another bomb but as the buildup for the movie continued I learned that Director Wes Craven was directing this with Kevin Williamson writing. I figured I might as well give it a try. I went to the 9:15 showing and stood in line for about 30 minutes. I went into the movie with my expectations low but when I walked out of the movie theatres I couldn't help but have a certain tingle come about me. It's one of those movies that gives you a feeling of.. I didn't waste my money. It was completely original although some traits through the movie were taken from older classic movies. All in all, This movie is definately a new generation for the Horror Genre. It has been quite a while since it came out and I still enjoy watching it from time to time. I recommend you buy the DVD. If not, Just buy it. It's definately memorabilia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best movies ever made. I can't remember how many times I have watched this movie. I never saw it in theatres but I rented it months after the video release and I loved it. The characters were great and the fact that the killer is not revealed until the end was awesome. The ending will shock the hell out of you. I absolutely wanted a sequel for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie. When this came to my town, I went to see it with the here's-another-halloween-ripoff-attitude. Boy was I wrong! Craven pulls a very good hitchcock move by killing off one of the biggest names right off the bat and it just keeps getting better. Too bad the sequel didnt live up to this one. Oh well here's hoping number 3 will rescue the series.P.S. Try to find all of the horror movie reference in this movie. I watched it last night and found 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>while i wouldn't label this completely a horror flick (thriller is more like it) i was still genuinely impressed. the acting was solid, the murders inventive, and Wes Craven's direction was top notch. being a huge horror/slasher fanatic i appreciated immediately how all the characters had the same knowledge of all of the cliches that have become rampant in the horror genre. that immediately made me realize that they wouldn't be acting in the 'i'm in this movie just to earn my free pack of cigarettes' style that is prevalent in slasher movies.the plot deserves special mention (especially the opening scene with Drew Barrymore) and at only a couple places did it get a little too pleased with itself.this also deserves special mention as one of the more violent movies to come out in the last few years. (rent the director's cut for 20 more seconds of deleted gore.) little touches like the steam rising off of Barrymore's guts in the cool night air were nice and pleased this gorehound.while the sequel let me down somewhat (don't most sequels do that anyway?) this film stands heads and shoulders above the slasher competition in every conceivable way.rating:8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Small spoilers below, small but they who have not seen the movie should still keep away for best result in the movie****Also includes spelling mistakes, that I know about but I don't have enough energy left to fixe it up**''Scream'' is huge! 'Scream' super-blockbuster! 'Scream 2' naturaly mega-blockbuster! 'Scream 3' will probably be even bigger. Those who love horror (or all related genres) films have so much to thank this movie. ''Scream'' kicked up horrorfilms from the grave. Sure we've seen some real crap, but at the same time some greatness (''The Faculty'', ''The Blair Witch Project'' (I know, its not the same, but really, do you think anyone ever done it if 'Scream' never came`?)). The movie itself then. This movie is my third favorite movie of all time. Its so entertaining and funny. Except for the opening scene you can't buy any mean say that its scary anywhere, can you?Craven and Williamson has cooked up a standard slasher-film where teens get sliced up by a maniac. But now the teens are prepeared (from all movies of course). The thing that makes ''Scream'' so different from the rest is that we find out about all details, compairs, and rules of scary movie, who we all know existed but never thought about. And if that wasn't enough it is funny! Craven and Williamson makes, among much else, fun about how long the killer can survive (how many can survive two runthroughs in the heart by an umbrella?) and just look at the school-cleaner, Fred. Take a look at his clothes too. Buy the way, he is played by Craven! The acting is very funny (I just loved the super-stupid Dewey), the music is standard-good, but the soundtrack is great (I have it myself).Of course these slashers can't be really called as horrorfilm, so I can say that this is the best slasherfilm ever!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film combines some great elements of classic scare film style and creates a classic in my book. The clever and unique way in which the story is developed gives the viewer a new sense of what it is to be scared at the movies. The characters are smart, witty and dynamic. This falls into the catigory of favorite films for me, and as I have seen several thousand movies, it has stood against some stiff competition. It stands out among so many teen movies as original, scary and smart, and with little flaws, a great addition to any collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great horror thriller, this movie rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is the movie that started it all for me. This was the movie that got me interested in the horror genre. Because i liked so much, i started renting almost all the horror movies in the video store. Although Scream 2 came close, none of the movies i have rented were as creepy and scary as this one. It is very rare for a horror to be so plenty of dark humor. The whole idea of a killer getting his inspiration from scary movies is, in my opinion, very realistic and creepy. It shows what a scary movie freak is capable of doing.It's no wonder Kevin Williamson is very busy writing at the moment, he's brought back the whole horror genre. If it wasn't for Scream, we wouldn't have I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, The Faculty or even Halloween H20. Not that it would be a big loss if we didn't have any of these movies, but still.But the person who's to credit more than anyone for this movie is director Wes Craven. It was this guy who gave the movie the creepy feel it had, especially in the opening scene.Scream is without a doubt the best horror flick of the '90s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HIGHLY OVER-RATED!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this before I started watching horror films and when I saw it, I thought it was highly entertaining. But now that I have watched many horror movie I've realized it's not all that original. The movie hasn't got much violence and gore and no great killing through the film (the one in the garage, was cool) The phone calls were good, but the calls in lack Christmas were so much better cause the killer was crazy and he wanted to let the person know on the phone that he was crazy and he was after her. I also didn't like the killers, because they were too clumsy and got their butts kicked by Sidney, you don't see Jason or Michael tripping over things and getting beaten by a girl. The movie trivia was a good add and very original. The story is It is a year since Sidney Prescott's mother was raped and murdered, now someone that has a fascination for horror movies is killing people close to Sidney. But who is it? Overall the movie is a fun watch, but people who say it is the best and so violent must not watch many horror movies because there is much more worst stuff out there and a lot of that stuff Scream ripped off. Highly over-rated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I watched this movie already six times, and it still scares me off. It's one of the horrorclassics of the 90's, maybe even from all times. The movie is a parody on the many other teen slashers, but you really don't see that. I saw it like a good teen slasher movie, not as a parody on the genre.I rated it 10.Now, what makes this movie so great is the opening scene...Drew Barrymore plays Casey Becker who gets dead pranks from a real psycho. This scene lasts 10 minutes, it starts slow but comes to a great finale which isn't only a gore scene.It's also very difficult to know who the killer is, I didn't know till the end. Many horrorfans (I am too) hate this movie, but I think it's a real classic in the genre. So, give it a try (or another) and terrify yourself. The only sad point on this movie is the sequel: it's just a comedy. So, I have my high hopes fixed on Scream 3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slasher genre reborn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I review this wonderful movie, I'd like to give you all a brief history of slasher flicks. Halloween created this genre. Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street revolutionized it. And Child's Play nearly destroyed it. Scream of course saved this dying genre which by the 1990s barely turned out a good horror film (excluding New Nightmare and Halloween 6 &amp; 7 of course).Scream is a classic and Wes Craven is a genius. He realized what John Carpenter realized with the first Halloween, gore doesn't equal scary. Sure, you see a lot of blood here, but the movie doesn't rely on it. Scream has a story and great scares.During the film, it is impossible to not wonder who it is and why. You can't just sit there and not think, 'maybe it's the deputy or then again maybe it's the guy who keeps talking about the rules of a good scary movie.' Scream is wonderful slasher film that is a non stop ride of action, suspense, thrills and even a little comedy. A must see.</fullReview>

Wes Craven has certainly done good in the film as compared to its sequels ( which is rather shameful to the name )and other silly bunch of movies showing only big breasted girls running around in white shirts, screaming at the top of their lungs as they are about to be striked by a hook. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The catalyst for and killer of postmodern movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any film that draws a person to the cinema six times has something serious going for it.Taking its cues from Wes Craven's previous film, New Nightmare (1994), Scream takes up the trail to postmodern cinema and succeeds in finding it. Of course, postmodernism theory existed well before Craven (and Kevin Williamson) picked it up, but Scream uses it better than possibly any other movie (with the possible exception of Scream 2's opening in-cinema sequence).The scares are there, although most of the shock effects come in the first ten minutes at Drew Barrymore's expense, and there is a constant artificial world theme pervading the whole story. This film works only because the audience watching it already knows the rules of the genre it is operating by. Anyone who misses that will miss the whole thing.Good performances, a nice retread (if quicker) of Hitchcock's macguffin from Psycho - ie killing of the biggest name before things have even got started (and Barrymore was definitely the biggest name here in 1996, Cox about to achieve superstardom with this and Friends).If movies have to be re-paced for less attentive nineties audiences, then Scream shows how you can do it right, which means it doesn't look like an MTV programme.A few other points, Scream has a cool twist which was initially extremely effective; the characters are mostly well-developed, Neve Campbell's Sid makes a good Final Girl, and Billy and Stu are cool together (spot the homoerotic undertones with them, most of which was removed from Williamson's original script).You might be able to tell that I LIKED this movie. If I had to give a rating, it would be about 92%.Gabe.</fullReview>

With an all star cast, SCREAM is irresistible to watch, it has more twists and turns that you would ever imagine. the plot outline is basically about a girl Sidney Prescott who is being stalked by a serial killer in the small town of Woodsboro no-one is safe, and EVERY ONE'S a suspect. you will be totally blown away with the ending which i will not spoil for those who haven't seen it, but it catches you off guard. The most POWERFUL scene in the movie is at the beginning of the film, Drew Barrymore makes the character of Casey Becker come to life. This film is one of the best of all time. 10/10 !!!</fullReview>

Unlike your average horror movie it isn't all slash 'em kill 'em with no plot. Scream started the new age of horror movies. I could not figure out who the killer was. I think that added to the movie and made it more intersting. I changed my guess to the killer about five times and I ended up being wrong.

		<shortDescription>What a film!!!!!!!!! (No spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It begins with a terrible murder that is now a classic. Sydney Prescott is a teenager who goes to school with her many friends. She seems normal but she is not. Her mother have been murdered and raped one year ago and a killer tries to kill her. The phones rings and people screams and everybody's a suspect.This movie allows us to discover a new genius: Kevin Williamson. His script is totally wise and original. The character are not cliché and stupid, they seems to me realistic and they are great, all of them. The story itself is extremely good and original. The ending petrified me with the revelation of the killer. I thought that all the scenes are extremely good and breath taking. And a thing that is wonderful is all the movies references in the movie. I am a horror movies fan since my childhood and I grow up with Nightmare on elm street, Friday the !3 and Halloween and it was a pleasure for me to see that the characters in the film also saw those films. It was a big fun also to find all the references. This movie does not take us for dumb teenagers.The interpretations are very good. Neve Campbell is wonderful and great. Her character is not a dumb girl. I think that she is one of the best actresses of her generation. David Arquette is very funny and he is perfect in his role. When I saw that Courteney Cox was in the film, I was worried because of her last films but she impressed me a lot. She is one of my favorite actresses. For the others, they are great too, especially Billy and Stu. For those who saw the film know why.Wes Craven made most of the film that I watched when I was a little kid. This one is his best I think. The actors are pretty well directed and everything is good. I can't wait to see Scream 3.There are a lot of people who blame the film for violence in our society because of his realistic violence. I think that it doesn't influence badly the teenagers or adults or whatever. The violent scenes are not funny or light. The first scene is totally terrible and it does not make me wanted to kill blind girls. The rest of the film is like that. Murders are terrible and I think it's a movie that takes it seriously. Not like Steven Seagle or Jean-Claude Van Damme's movies where murder is as important as dirt on a roof. Also the movie explain a lot how the American filmmakers do their horror film. We learn that they make them do drugs and have sex just to kill them. It's insulting and totally stupid and pathetic. This is clichés of horror film. The end explain it very well, the killer also, in a fascinating scene.Well SCREAM is my favorite film of all time. The not cliché horror film are too rare. We have to explain Hollywood man that having sex, being black or gay is not a reason to be killed. It is not good for our generation to be insulted like that. Scream is not like that and His writer also and that is good news for the teenagers or for others who are bothers by the messages from Hollywood Movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the movie that made I Know What You Did Last Summer look like the complete turkey that it undoubtedly was. Scream is a clever, slick, inventive slasher from beginning to end, with an absolutely riveting first 15 minutes where one of the famous actresses of the film finds herself in a life-or-death situation with the killer.During the film, you begin to suspect almost every cast member of being the killer, due to something that they say or do, but the identity of the person or persons responsible isn't revealed until a fair number of the cast have been hacked to death. The plot is as follows. Someone is dressing up in a gown and scary mask and is killing people. Sounds dull as hell but don't you believe it! This is a tremendous re-invention of the slasher genre, which has (and will) spawn numerous inferior sequels.There are plenty of surprises along the way, such as how many cameos you can spot. Linda Blair and Wes Craven both appear, and although famous actors Drew Barrymore and Henry Winkler are in the cast, they don't actually take up too much on-screen time. It's the lesser known Neve Campbell and David Arquette who take the acting honours. The only one I wasn't sure about was Courtenay Cox who wasn't wholly convincing as a reporter.All told this is one of the best horror movies of the 1990's.</fullReview>

Some of the jokes are really funny and Stew(Matthew Lillard) is too cool with all the faces he does and his stupid jokes. The coolest thing in this movie is that you have to find who is the killer.

		<fullReview>I've just seen Scream for the first time last night on TV. Well, before, i had watch its final, but not the whole movie. I don't think that this movie is a masterpiece, but is really worth a watching. Before i've seen it, i was thinking that it wasn't as good as people around me said, and also wasn't a movie i would really want to see. But it was. So, i found Matt Lillard's acting, um, in a way exaggerated alittle, but it doesn't count so much. Anyway, i give that movie an 8, and end the discussion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that restarted it all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film spawned the 90s slasher craze thus being as important as Psycho or Halloween in continuing the serial killer phenomenan. While maybe not as sophisticated as either Psycho or Halloween this film is not a classic horror but a 90s spin on the genre. It is essentially a homage to the 80's horror genre unintentionally spawning an entire new subgenre within horror.Neve Campbell is at the center of the film playing Sidney Prescott who becomes the target of a maniac in a costume. Rose McGowan is her plucky friend who is the only one she truly trusts because everyone else is a suspect, including her own father. The cast brings the script to life with some of the best acting I've seen in a horror. Neve Campbells performance is what you'd expect from your standard (standard being - Jamie Lee Curtis standard)lead heroine, with the rest of the cast also fulfilling expectations, especially Cox (as a bitchy tabloid writer) and Kennedy (horror fan gone wrong) whom surpass them. With several plot twists clever parodies and sharp pop culture references, Scream is way above the usual drivel that occupies the teen slasher genre. It's as good as either Psycho or Halloween and had just as bigger impact as well. Grade - A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got so used to many other weak horror films, Scream actually shocked me with it's incredible story telling, natural characters (though the "guilty" is unnatural), and of course, the many scary moments and jumps. Scream is a work of art, and it's the kind that should lead the way for modern horror movies in America. Scream is so unique, it deserves more attention. Go watch this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream sucks, ok ? Wes Craven is a great director, hats off to him, but this movie is for the teenage chick who doesn't have a life. I know girls have seen this movie 32 times because it has Skeet Ulrich in it.The movie is a scare the first 20 minutes of the first time you see it, but then it starts to go down hill. The references to movies, and stupid comic relief make this movie cheesy, and lame. I'm sorry but Wes Craven made a chick flick, that you can only watch once, that lacks originality, and is a "Scream" for the Razzie Awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie to revive the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people may think this is just another typical slasher flick. I disagree, and I'm sure lots of people feel the same way. First off, when "Scream" came out in 1996. it started off mild at the box office. When more and more things were said about this movie, it became better and better and had big success. After this movie, several teen slasher films came out as copycats of the film. I am a huge fan of Kevin Williamson as well. I have seen "Scream," "Scream 2," "The Faculty," "I Know What You Did Last Summer," "Halloween H20" (which he helped with the script but was not credited), "Teaching Mrs. Tingle" (which, in my opinion, was his worst film), and TV's "Dawson's Creek," but I have stopped watching that because me and Kevin both feel the same way: the show has become too "mushy." He is starting a new tv series called "Wasteland" which you can be guaranteed I will tune into. Anyway, back to "Scream." This film was entertaining from start to finish, and the fact that Wes Craven directed it also helped as well. He is as creative a horror director there ever was. This was the first well known horror film of the 90's, and it helped revive the genre in a HUGE way. Its creativeness in the sense that people were having the movies get to their head, and the killers were two of the main characters (don't worry, if you are one of the few people who have not seen this, I won't tell you who they are), was excellent. This is a great, somewhat classic, horror film that should be in anyone's library. Also, go see the sequel (it is just as good, if not better) and watch out for when Scream 3 comes out Dec. 10, it is sure to complete the already incredible trilogy in a huge way. My grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as they say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scream" was praised when it came out for being a fine send-up of slasher movies and a good work of satire. On the contrary, "Scream" is, while markedly witty, woefully under-clever and simply another lousy slasher film aspiring to be more.Furthermore, like many films of its ilk, "Scream" is not what most people would call scary. It uses guys in masks popping out of nowhere and buckets of blood to create the illusion of horror, but slasher flicks are not "horror." Psychological horror movies like the films of Steven King are true horror movies."Scream" does seem to be somewhat of a satire of slasher films, but its problem is that the satire is too obvious, as Kevin Williamson's script delights itself in pointing out "Hey, I'm a work of satire" every few minutes.At least, unlike its followup, the even less clever and completely un-witty "Scream 2", this movie is at times partially enjoyable if highly unrealistic. In real life, a person who gets stabbed any number of times will probably not be able to still get up and walk around pretty well.All in all, the movie tries to be something it isn't and shouldn't aspire to be: by making a slasher pic trying to satirize other slasher pics and making it even more bloody than many other slasher pics are, you haven't elevated yourself above them at all. The movie has only one truly great scene that I'd guess was probably lost on most people: when Randy (played by Jamie Kennedy) is watching Halloween and doesn't see the killer standing right behind him, all the time exhorting Halloween's heroine, "Look behind you, Jamie! Turn around!" A gleeful bit of self-reference that provided one of the few enjoyable moments in an otherwise forgettable film.</fullReview>

This movie is a thrill ride from beginning to end. Clever and Witty dialoge, great actors, and a clever script by Kevin Williamson make this film a must see.The acting is great all around. Neve Campbell is very good in the film. Unlike some horror movie characters you actually feel sorry for her because she is so convincing. Courtney Cox is good, but even better in the sequel. David Arquette is always funny. But the standouts are Skeet Ulricha nd Matthew Lillard.

		<fullReview>This was a really good movie. Even though we've seen this type of movie thousands of times before, it still remains spine-chillingly scary. So what if it is predictable, it is fun! This is what scary movies should be about, take the innocent young girl, put her alone in a big house with a psychopathic killer lurking around and WHAM, you've got a hit. That is the ultimate recipe for scary movies.Drew Barrymore's performance is gut-wrenchingly real. The actors in this movie portray terrified and confused teenagers with endearing realism.

		<fullReview>Scream could have been a disaster. First of all to all of you out there who cannot understand how it wasnt scary enough, Scream is a horror spoof. It makes fun of everything to do with horror. It makes fun of the acting, directors and basicly the whole ideas. It COULD have been a disaster if it wasn't handled by a genius who knew the genre well and had a unique talent for moving swiftly between edge-of-the-seat action to ironic humour at its blackest. Now the humour is very funny and the irony makes it funnier (Sidney says if a movie was made about her "they'd probably cast Tori Spelling" and in the sequel in the movie Stab based on the Woodsboro incident the star is Miss Tori Spelling!!) So basically it comes down to this. Scream is an amazing achievment. Its a great original idea from a great script by Williamson and Craven handles it like a master. A grade A movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is a good entertaining horror flick. It has twists and turns through out especially toward the end! Its about a stalker/killer dressed up in a dark costume with a ghost mask and right from the beginning starts slaughtering teens. The direction by Wes Craven is good, and the script by Williamson matches it in this witty slasher. But, it wasn't really all that scary as soo many people seem to say, I think it had a couple of shocks here and there, but the scares toward the end take a back seat to the stylishness of the references found through out the film. And the cast, the cast is alright, but nuthin too special unless u compare them to the 80s horror films (except to a few like Nightmare on Elmstreet, first Friday the 13th, and Child's Play). But they do try, and i'll give them that. Over all the movie is really fun to watch and if your into horror and yet want something different and refreshing, watch this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something to "Scream" About</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven's "Scream" is a horror movie with a difference: the characters in it have watched (and know all the cliches of) horror movies. The film was written by Kevin Williamson, whom was paid a rumoredly very large sum for his horror-comedy screenplay called "Scary Movie," and it's easy to see why. On paper, this is a movie with scares and a surprise abundance of laughs and in-jokes; it's a crowd-pleaser and a critic-pleaser as well. Miramax bought it, a famous director was attached to it, and the title was changed. The rest was history.It tells the story of Sidney (played by Neve Campbell), who begins receiving threatening phone calls from a ghost-masked killer that quickly begins slashing the local teenagers. The movie also stars, among others, David Arquette (as a dim-witted policeman), Courtney Cox (as a nosy reporter), Skeet Ulrich (as The Boyfriend), and Drew Barrymore (as a possible victim).The plot in "Scream" is definitely pretty standard and plays out just the way we expect it to; it has fun letting us guess who the killer really is. And the standardness of the plot is really more of a tool than a setback. By showing us a typical horror movie plot with a rather typical outcome, screenwriter Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven have come up with a worthy showcase for kids who know all the angles of the movie genre they find themselves in. Rated R. 111 minutes. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first preview I saw of scream my first impression was" A typical adult thriller with a serial killer stalking a town and a group of people try to track the killer down". I hardly expected it to be a teen horror film as they went out in the eighties and with a cast of Courtney Cox, Neve Campbell and Drew Barrymore I didn't possible think it could be anything but serious...... Boy was I wrong!!!!!! Iloved the movie particularly the chilling first scene withDrew Barrymore. I've never been more scared before in a film and its easily the scariest scne in this movie and the sequel. My main complaint though is the amount of violence in the film. It's one of the most violent films I've ever seen and what makes it worse is that it is totally unneccesairly violent and gory. The blood and gore only adds a darker tone to the film which wrecks it and tkaes away one of the key differences it had from other horror films. I think i would have liked it heaps more if it wasn't as bloody and gory as it was. I've nver seen more blood in my entire life!!!I still enjoyed it though and recommend it to all partically the first scene which will always remain a classic in my eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scream" happens to be the first horror movie I ever watched. So of course I was terrified out of my mind. What a horror movie to start on. I was shocked and horrified by the amount of blood in this movie. Well, that was back in 1997, and now I've seen almost any horror movie you can think of. Was I only scared by "Scream" because it was the first movie I'd seen with so much blood? The answer is no. I've seen this movie at least 40 times, and enjoy it every time. Each time I watch, I discover something new I didn't realize before. I was obviously disappointed that Neve Campbell didn't show it all, but it probably would've been rated NC-17. So that was a good call. Of course Neve didn't go nude in "Wild Things" either. She's a rather respectable actress. "Scream" scared me out of my mind, and I'll admit it, I slept with the lights on after I watched. I gave it a perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And a genre is born.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>" I want you to go down to the McKenzies house and call the police. " Laurie Strode, from Halloween, Casey's mom, from Scream.As I have said in my various reviews of horror flicks, I grew up loving horror movies. Everything from the great ones like Halloween, Nightmare 1 and the early Fridays, to even the stupid quirky flicks like The Prey or Sleepaway Camp. There is just something sinister yet fun about an unseen force that tries to kill you for no apparent reason except that you are on his turf. I think Kevin Williamson watched the same films as I did and similarly appreciated them. Because what he has done here is write a film that is an homage to all the great horror films of the last 25 years. He treats all of us fans to great memories of films of years past and he assumes that he has an intelligent audience. There are so many horror movie references here that even I don't quite get all of them, and believe me I have seen a lot of horror films. But not only is the script entertaining, funny and witty, the film is scary. Not as scary as some of the films that it tries to pay homage to, but that's okay. Because you will have so much fun trying to pick out references to your faves that the scare factor is just a bonus. One of the most brilliant parts in the movie is when Randy pauses Halloween and explains the rules of surviving a horror movie if you are a character in it. Not only is it funny, but it so honest and sharp that when you listen to what he says, you realize that he is so right. And that is one of the great pleasures of the film.I admire a film like this. It is not afraid to take chances and it tries to give all of us former teens that made the genre so popular in the 80's, something to enjoy. I'm not saying that if you are under the age of 25 you cannot enjoy this, but believe me you can enjoy it a whole lot more if you are about 25-30. Because it is us who rented those films way back when. And to understand the references and the homages to films like Halloween ( 1978 ) the original Nightmare (84), the Friday's (80-84) you have to appreciate the films for what they are. And what they were and what they did was entertain and scare the hell out of us 15 and 16 year olds. And to remember that feeling by watching this film is reward enough to me. But then to have the film be so well done is an added bonus.Wes Craven is the perfect director for this film. I wonder is Williamson ever pitched this to Cunningham or Miner or Carpenter before going to Craven? I guess I am glad that he didn't because I think Craven adds some nice touches to the film. The cast is also brilliant. We all know the major one's involved here but I want to call attention to Mathew Lilliard. His portrayal of Stu is so amazing. He honestly should of received a nomination for best supporting actor. He took his character and added his own twist to him. And because of his tiny idiosyncrasies, he adds so much to the film. A subtle use of the tongue, the facade of hurt just by one of his expressions, a triumphant thrust of the arms, his laugh. They are all forever imprinted in my head as a great character study.This film started a whole genre on it's own, made a name for Lilliard and most everyone else involved, revitalized Craven's career, made Williamson a millionaire, made horror movies popular again and gave me hours of viewing enjoyment. Not just from this one and its sequel, but it made me go back and watch all the older films that I liked so much.You should do the same. And try to rediscover what was so fun about horror movie from the 70's and 80's. I have figured it out on a personal level, but have you figured it out on your own level? That is what makes horror films so much fun. Because they mean something different to everyone. Actually that is what makes film in general so profound.</fullReview>

When I saw it, and realized that Drew got bumped from the movie in the first 10 minutes, I didn't know what to expect. What I saw was constant thrills and chills, plus some unexpected laughs. Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox did a great job, plus Rose McGowan delivered (what I thought was) a breakthrough performance. I hadn't heard of her until this movie, and she truly stood out. It was sad to see her get violently killed, but what a way she went. From then on she will be known to me as "Tatum"- or more Scream-esque as "Garage-Door-Girl". Now aside from Rose McGowan, "Scream" was a non-stop rollercoaster where you never knew who-dunnit. Kevin Williamson's screen-play was brilliant.He made you believe everyone was a suspect from the black boots to the suspicious looks people gave to one another. Aside from a gruesome splatter fest that almost got slapped with and NC-17 for violence, "Scream" is a great parody of all the cheap 70's horror flix made. Do yourself a favor and rent "Scream" tonight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember the seemingly endless stream of stupid teen horror flicks in the 1980's? Just when you thought Hollywood might start making REAL horror movies again (Exorcist, Shining, Poltergiest, Alien) along came Scream. Now everybody is back making teenybopper slasher flicks like I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, and Halloween H20.Scream claimed to be different by satirizing slasher flicks, but it ultimately sucks. As in most Teen Slasher Flicks, the Heroine is a whiny, unlikable character. She has perfect friends, a boyfriend, and lives in an upscale neighborhood. A shining example of most teenage horror flicks.Now I don't know about you, but I have never been scared by horror films with stylish, beautiful characters and pop soundtracks. Not once did I really get scared at this movie. In order to have a scary movie, you have to have characters that you can identify with. Jump scenes every 2 minutes get old reeeeal quick.Scream isn't a terrible movie (it is much better than the atrocity 'I Know What You Did Last Summer') but it could be much better, much much better. What is it about putting teenagers in horror movies that makes the movie suck?Don't lose hope, horror fans, the Blair Witch Project is coming, if it is as scary as everyone says, we'll show Hollywood what real horror is all about.</fullReview>

David Arquette plays Tatum's Brother who is the deputy in their home town, Woodsboro. Courteney Cox plays the Bitch Reporter Gale Weathers who everyone hates after seeing this movie. Jamie Kennedy plays the horror movie fanatic, Randy, who has very good theorys about all the murders. Drew Barrymore olays the first Victim, Casey Becker.(The Best scene of the whole movie!).

		<fullReview>Scream is the type of movie that defies the rules of the genre. To start with, the main victim Sidney Prescott(neve campbell) is not your typical big breasted blonde who runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. As she points out in the film. Also, Sidneys friend, Randy(played with perfection by jamie kennedy) is not your typical bicep sports player. This movie is scary, funny, sexy and is the most imitated film since Norman Bates in Psycho. Also stars Skeet Ulrich(touch) Rose McGowan(the doom generation) Courteney Cox(ace ventura) David Arquette(never been kissed) Matthew Lillard(dead man's curve) Drew Barrymore(gun crazy) and Henry Winkler(happy days).

		<fullReview>Scream is another masterpiece from the director Wes Craven who brought us the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. With a terrific and truly magnificent script written by Dawson's Creek writer Kevin Williamson, Scream makes you wonder who the killer is for the whole duration of the movie. There are many twists and these twists make you question who the real killer is. An excellent cameo appearance from Drew Barrymore make Scream even better and great performances by Neve Campbell (Party of Five) and Courtney Cox (Friends), Scream will frighten you and make you SCREAM for more! Horrors haven't come better than this since Carrie and Halloween. I eagerly await Scream 3 with great anticipation.</fullReview>

While giving plenty of scares, it keep intelligent twists, and some very witty dialogue that was missing from earlier films of the genre. While it gives odes to such films as " Halloween ", and " A Nightmare on Elm Street " it keeps the horror film fans watching, while newcomers to the genre can still have full enjoyment. The film's only downfall, is with its horror genre revival. So comes " Bride of Chucky ", and " Urban Legend ".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream would have to be the best film of its genre. Wes Craven is the king of horror. Along with Halloween, Scream actually had a story behind it - which is usually rare with this type of film. Everything from the writing to the acting was brilliant - it is not often you find a cast that suits their character. The only thing I was not happy with was making one of the killers obvious. I picked this character early on in the movie but the second I didn't pick up on until just before Tatum was killed. Drew Barrymore, without a doubt, was the best actor in this film. It was such a shame Casey died 12 minutes into the movie - hopefully with Scream 3 being a prequel/sequel we might get to see Drew in a cameo??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream was definitely more than I thought it was going to be. I thought it would be typical slasher movie with the killer who never kills twenty people, and the one person left alive has to come back and destroy the killer in the ten other sequels. I was amazed at how great the script was and hot well it was acted. I felt the screenplay should have won an Oscar for best movie and screenplay. The dialogue in this movie is exactly the same as a what a teenager would say. (I should know because I am one myself.) Because of all the plot twists, you never know the outcome of the film or who the killer is. I loved this movie and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scream" is a sharp, startling and thrilling slasher movie that deserves all the praise that it received. I strongly believe that is the most influential horror films of the 90`s, it revived the dying horror genre. Instead of recycling cliches that have been used to a tedious extent, "Scream" is brilliantly created with it`s own ironic, mocking style. The script is one of the film`s main highlights, as it constantly delivers references to other classic horror films, while it takes place in one at the same time. The film certainly entertains as well, from the first nerve-jangling twenty minutes to the electric climax, "Scream"`s wit and scariness is impossible to ignore. All the characters in the movie are complex and believable, mainly because the actors who play them are fit perfectly for the role (Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, David Arquette, Rose McGowan, Courteney Cox, etc.) and second, because they actually have brains.(Unlike the conventional "Help me, I`m being stabbed repeatedly"! kind of bimbos seen in inferior slasher flicks). If gore is a problem for people, this movie is a lot of it, but not to a repulsive degree. "Scream" never ceased to surprise me, not even after the climax was over, and I don`t think it will for most people either. A great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror back with a bang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror movie is most definitely back - with a bang. Scream delivers, rescuing horror fanatics and fans of film in general from the jaws of straight to video gore fests that have plagued the 1990's after the classic stalk and slash flicks of the '70's and '80's. The reason that this film succeeds is that as well as scaring and thrilling the living daylights out of the audience, Wes Craven takes the opportunity to take the mick out of the horror genre, and this hint of comedy is great alongside the much slicing and dicing going on around it. Funnily enough I wasn't that impressed with the film the first time around but I watched it again and picked up on a lot of things which I didn't get the first time around. I recommend that you do watch this again if you have already seen it as, knowing what happens, it is great to see how clever it is and how the story unravels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>However, I have to adress something. Scream, while, as I said, a very good movie, is NOT a horror movie, no matter how hard it tries.Now, before you call me something I'm not, let me explain why. Horror movies take your fear of something and work off that. For example, Nightmare on Elm Street worked of one's fear of going to sleep and never waking up. Candyman worked off the fear of going too far into a subject you shouldn't. Jaws worked off the fear of something coming out of the huge, dark ocean. Even Hellraiser worked off your fears of getting to curious.Scream does none of these. The only 90's horror movie that does is I Know What You Did Last Summer. It works off of a fear of your secrets coming back to get you.All in all, see this movie, but know you aren't going to see a horror movie, but a very entertaining mystery/thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't seen a horror film for a few years 'till I came across this.My initial reaction was, what a treat it was.The genre was pretty much dead before this, so things obviously had to change. There has been a lot of criticism of this film from the horror enthusiasts due to its somewhat 'user-friendly' style, but I don't see that as a problem.Times have changed now and film making is much more sophisticated than 1978 when the awesome Halloween graced our cinema screens. This was as much a parody of horror films as a horror in its own right, it also doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is......which is a refreshing change. The writing and directing were excellent, and the acting was better than you will find in any other film in this genre in my opinion. There was not any point in the film that I was scared (which was a bit of a disappointment), but then I've seen so many that I don't know if I can be anymore.Also the storyline and whodunnit factor suck you in to the point that you are too busy concentrating on the killers identity and looking for clues to take in the horror.....as my friends have pointed out. There are also a lot of jokes in it that you MIGHT miss if you are not a horror regular......but then you might not. All in all I think that this is a fantastic film whether you look at it as a genuine horror film or a mystery/thriller/suspense type of film, and much more satisfying than the sequel. I just hope that now this has been such a big success that another wave of horror might soon be upon us......you never know, some might even be worth seeing!</fullReview>

However knowing that sort of makes these scene more intense.Neve Campbell is a megababe and she does sort of look like a young Heather Langenkamp who played the main character in A Nightmare on Elm Street.The film is good but was not as scary as I expected when I went to see it when it opened. However even though the horror is not up to what you expect the film is so entertaining it doesn't matter. Not just a great horror film, a great film.</fullReview>

This man is the reason I want to learn Script Writing. Scream illustrates the things that horror movies should be built of. The opening scene is the best 15 minutes I've ever seen in a movie. Because of the deadly game that the killer is playing with the victim on the phone. And the ending....wow...it's so surprising. You could never guess who the killer was. I've seen that movie 30 times now (I have it on video) and I still enjoy it. For my opinion, it's defiantly an A movie, 10 out of 10! THE best slasher movie!</fullReview>

When I first saw that, I gave a standing ovation and everyone else watching had to yell at me to sit back down again. Scream is a great satire on the horror genre with an intelligent and witty screenplay by Kevin Williamson; low and behold, it also features the first film directed by Wes Craven that doesn't suck.Unfortunately, Kevin Williamson then went on to create Dawson's Creek and subsequently lost all respect I ever had for the man.

		<fullReview>Without a doubt. 'Scream' made me excited by movies again, particularly horror. I had thought I'd never be scared by a film again because one, I'm older, and two, horror sucked! Too much was relied on gore than actual terror. Yet from it's first opening minutes to the end credits, 'Scream' made me feel tension, laughter and exhilaration. Much to the thanks of writer Kevin Williamson (my new idol) and director Wes Craven.Since pretty much everyone living outside a cave, knows at least OF 'Scream' and it's plot about a nut-job in a mask who taunts victims with horror trivia before dicing them up. I wanted to concentrate on something rarely focused on in horror. The acting.Since 'Scream' went from the little film that could into a teen blockbuster, not enough credit was given to it's extraordinary cast. All of whom turn in strong, solid performances.In what are usually throw away roles, Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy grab their limited screen time and run as the almost cool, almost handsome but seriously funny Stu and horror buff geek Randy. Skeet Ulrich is intense but always creepy as Billy. David Arquette ads his own quirky appeal to the Barney Fifish deputy Dewey.As for the lovely leading ladies, Drew Barrymore (who just can't seem to be bad) as Casey, is both tragic and phenomenal in her limited run. Courteney Cox surprises all with her very convincing portrayal of tabloid vixen Gail Weathers. In what is usually a thankless role of heroine's best friend, Rose McGowan takes the usually bimbo-esque(in any 80's slasher) character of Tatum and adds genuine sex appeal, smarts, and feistiness.As for the heroine herself, Sidney Prescott,(a seriously underrated Neve Campbell) she is without a doubt one of, if not the most realistic characters you're likely to find in this genre. Strong, intelligent, resourceful, this is a character that would flourish in any film. Provided the beautiful Campbell is the one to infuse her perfect handle on teen-angst.As for the film itself...EXCELLENT!...;o)</fullReview>

This movie hit the nerve to get horror films back on track as one of the great reasons to go to the movies in the first place....to be scared. It's fitting to let Wes Craven direct this film, it's basically an dedication movie to all the great slasher films of the 80's. The first 15 minutes of this film are amazing, the rest is tight, it just never holds up to those 15 minutes. The film is well casted and well written and there are a lot of great moments for horror movie buffs. Wes Craven has had a long career in horror films and he deserves a big hit such as this film.

This movie features top-notch scares and great suspense that reaches the roof. You'll love this if you like slasher movies. You love it if you like comedies. This is the kind of movie that has something for everyone. I only regret seeing it some many times before I knew how to enjoy slashers. The jump-feeling you experence in these type of movies is addictive to me. I just want to be so surprised that I almost have a heart attack or something. I already know when a scary part is coming so it doesn't really work. I just wish I could erase it from my memory. Watch it again and pee my pants. If you haven't seen this yet, I suggest you watch it alone at night with the lights dimmed and turn you surround sound up. I envy you so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is NOT your average teenage slasher flick. Granted, it is responsible for the flood of cheesy teenage flicks which annoy me greatly, but Scream is definitely different. You can give Scream credit for injecting some much needed life into the horror genre, and credit that to the geniuses of Craven and Williamson. This film successfully satirizes just about every horror cliche, while maintaining a very scary plot at the same time. You can either watch this movie as a straight horror flick, which it is very good at being, or you can watch it as a very entertaining look at the history of the genre as well as a look at where the future of the genre is headed. The bottom line is that Scream is the most clever horror film to come out in a long, long time. Hitchcock would be proud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, single-handedly, changed the face of horror. It mixed in traditional horror along with a casual ribbing of other horror films. Scream somehow made horror cool again. Here is the basic plot for those uninformed. A killer is stalking people over the telephone and kills them after harassing them. Sounds like a tired plot, right? Wrong. There are plenty of injokes about the business as well as a large quantity of jokes about other horror movies. It mixes humor and horror together beautifally to become what I feel is the best horror movie ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my God. Words cannot describe how wonderful this movie is. Everything about it is top-notch: the acting is three-dimensional, convincing, and charming; the scares are potent and chilling; the laughs are hilarious and common. Neve Campbell turns in a star-making performance as Sidney Prescott, who is not your typical "big-breasted girl who can't act who's always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door"; Sid is a tough cookie, and she faces off against the killer with admirable strength. Likewise her friends are not typically bland oversexed teens who merely exist to be butchered in all sorts of gory ways. Jamie Kennedy plays Randy the film geek, who has one of the largest followings in all of filmdom; the character is an amazing, wonderful creation. Rose McGowan is now more commonly known as Marilyn Manson's better (if not more normal-looking) half, but before that, she was known as Tatum, the perky blond sidekick to Sid with a sassy mouth, a saucy wit, and a bod for sin. Yummy. And Matthew Lillard is maniacally perfect as Stu; his wild eyes, goofy face, and squealy voice make him a memorable addition to the Scream family. Then of course there's Gale and Dewey, played by now real-life sweethearts Courteney Cox and David Arquette; Cox is awesomely bitchy as the backstabbing reporter with a knack for ticking people off, and Arquette is sincere and charming as Gale's total opposite, a small-town deputy with an aw-shucks attitude. But enough about the characters - the in-joke references are great too. Everything from Halloween to The Town that Dreaded Sundown is mentioned and/or made fun of in this film; it's like the end-all, be-all for every horror movie ever made. But the best part is that it is completely scary and completely funny at the same time. What other movie do you know that can do that? Well, other than Scream 2, of course . . . I give this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is a classic 'slasher' movie. Kevin Williamson's send-up of slasher films is extremely funny and extremely scary. The opening of the film, which features Drew Barrymore is classic horror. The film is about Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who is tormented by a vicious serial killer. Her friends Billy, Stu, Tatum, Randy, and the journalist Gale Weathers and Poilce Officer Dewey Riley add to this mix of blood and clever jokes. Kevin Williamson's script is terrific and Wes Craven's direction is chilling. This is the best slasher movie of the 90's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has it all; action, suspense, adrenalin, a great bunch of actors and one of the most original scripts that the film world has seen in a long time. Scream helped to redefine and re-invent the horror film genre of the nineties and has helped many other great horror films develop since its release. That's what it has and what it's done, but why is it so good??Wes Craven surpassed all that he has done before and brought the element of believeablility to this film, as a result it takes you on a twisting turning ride that makes you feel sick and dizzy but leaves you begging for more.Because of its closeness to reality through its "it could happen to you tomorrow" mentality the film grips you in a way that few other films could. Because of its horror theme it makes you intensely intrigued by its nature.It may not be the finest film in the filmmakers sense of the word, but for me it has to be the finest film that I have seen at the cinema this decade, and out of the all time list only takes a slight second place to the magnificant Star Wars trilogy. See this film above all others, trust me.</fullReview>

For horror movies, SCREAM is a reference, a whole writing and directing class. A must-see for everyone who claims to understand about cinema.

		<shortDescription>A wicked and helacious ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good deal of horror fails in the reactions of the critical characters in the plot. "Scream" suceeds, from the start, with reaction. It isn't enough to scream--you have to MEAN it. Drew Barrymore looks truly shaken as the beginning of the movie hammers her poor psyche. From that moment, one thing was clear:This movie was coming from a place that it knew to be in dire need of reform. That there was any thought given by Kevin Williamson to how atrocious horror movies had become gave me a charge. I realized that the movie was going to play with my expectations, and as a die-hard, horror-movie addict who can't give up on the genre despite myself, I realized I was in for a ride and a half. Perhaps I was lucky to see "Scream" at its East Coast debut. The crowd was wonderful, and the feelings were all celebratory, because not one of us had seen a trailer or knew anything about what was to follow. Such a thing complemented the film's attitude of taking you by surprise to dish out something fresh, something new, something that was aware of all the standard pit-falls.The writing was good, yes. Sure. The direction was precise, yes. Sure (save for that one boom shadow and a few quick cuts that don't seem to fit), but what hooked me most were the characters, acted wonderfully by Campbell, Arquette, Kennedy, Lilliard, Ulrich, and Cox. What a group of great people, no? Such memorable characters are a pleasant surprise in light of the usual, cardboard actors a horror movie dishes out. "Scream" makes you care about the people dying, even if they're not around very long.Though despite it all, it's the seedy core of the movie that gets me the most: the rape and promiscuity of Sydney's mother as well as the absolutely vicious attack scenes show guts, so to speak. It eliminates a great deal (not all, however), of what I consider the Hollywood Barrier. You know the feeling--that feeling of restraint on the part of the killer. That feeling that the evil It, or evil He, or evil She would LOVE to go further, would LOVE to kill as it is created to do, but can't, because, well, who would want to see that? "Scream"'s opening sequence goes further than most films would dare, and I greatly admire that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just another slasher flick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can be said about this film that singlehandly re-ignited a genre had all but died ten years before. Writer Kevin Williamson has crafted a clever script built on the premise of high-school teens who are fans of horror films. The film is chock full of references and tributes to other films, from the opening scene with Drew Barrymore (inspired by the 1979 film "When A Stranger Calls") to the party scene where Jamie Kennedy explains the three things that one should never do in a slasher flick (if they break these rules, it spells certain doom). The film has as many twists and turns as a Hitchcock classic, especially setting up many people as suspects that will keep you guessing until the very end. If one is not a fan of the horror film genre then you may not want to invest the time in this film, because although it is top notch for its prospective audience, it won't win over new fans to the genre (this would probably be an impossible task for any film of any genre). Those of you who have seen the film, but haven't seen the version packaged in the boxed set (the film with running commentary by director Wes Craven and Williamson) you may want to check out this second tape and see just how they crafted this modern horror flick.</fullReview>

But for the most part, this one really keeps you on your toes, rather than yelling "don't go in there!" at the screen.Scream is certainly bloody, so it's not for the squeamish.

I don't understand why Hollywood lets anyone except Kevin Williamson write these scripts. Disturbing Behavior, Urban Legends, and all the other non-Williamson movies have been, in a word, pathetic. The best part of this movie is how throughout it, they make a complete mockery of horror movies, and yet come up with one of the scariest ones I've seen in a while. This total self-satirizing style kept me laughing when I wasn't screaming, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.I don't think Wes Craven or Kevin Williamson "rediscovered" the teen horror genre. I don't think it's really a genre worth rediscovering, at least based on the recent flops that have been released. It's only through the brilliance of Craven and Williamson that this movie was so wonderful, in my opinion. I wouldn't have enjoyed it nearly as much if it wasn't so cleverly written. I give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very cool film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a landmark film of its genre, and homage to it can most strongly be payed by the certain lacking of subsequent sequels and similar films. The opening scene, with the short-lived Drew Barrymore is a piece of cinematic genius in the terror it creates despite the fact the audience have no affinity with the fated characters. The rest of the film follows in much the same vein, and what makes it scary isn`t the daring level of gore but the finely directed chase scenes and the realistically terrifying actions of the killer who is alarmingly human as opposed to the robotic psychos of Halloween and the like. The film has been rightly noted, with good and bad reviews, for the irony and self-referencing that prevails throughout it, this is in fact more subtle than made out and gives licence for any number of clichés which Wes Cravem is sparing about using in what is a highly originally directed picture. The death of Sydney`s friend Tatum is one to close your eyes (and ears!) for if you have a weak stomach, but as mentioned the violence is never excessive and is very well acted out. Watch out for the tributes to Halloween in particular, from the blatant discussion of it to the more subtle name games "go to the McKenzies....." and of course the clips of it shown during the excellent party sequence. The complements are replayed in Halloween H2O incidentally!. Scream deserves as many points as it can muster in polls, films like this are few and far between.</fullReview>

Think--it's all a gimmick. Wes Craven had come full circle, after his Nightmare on Elm Street series finally fizzled out after like 25 installments. He needed to jump-start his income, so he thought that by making fun of his own movies, throwing that bit of banal sarcasm into the script, he could start a whole other series. And his fresh batch of teenagers ate it up. Now, thanks to him and the willing youth of America, here come the sequels once again.Maybe everyone will have learned their lesson after "Scream 8" and "I Still Know What You Did That Summer 10 Years Ago."

		<shortDescription>"Scream" defines horror films of its generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scream" is a film that did for horror films what "Star Wars" did for science fiction: it re-awakened the horror genre. In the 1970's, when horror films stopped being made well, people stopped taking horror films seriously for the most part. Predictable slasher films generated fairly strong followings, such as the "Friday the 13th" and "Halloween" films. When that general string of films died out in the late 80's, these films were still watched, mostly when people wanted a good laugh, the way people watch "Plan 9 From Outer Space" (Most commonly believed to be the worst movie ever made.) Now, in the late '90's, with the advantages of modern special effects and blood that doesn't have the texture of Kool-Aid, horror movies are being taken seriously, and are being well-made instead of just pumped out every five minutes, and "Scream" is the one movie that started this up. Writer Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven do brilliant jobs of making the film interesting, even BETWEEN death scenes, a concept that completely escaped the makers of the '70's and '80's slasher flicks, which went no further than scenes of sexuality in those cases. One element that made "Scream" so brilliant was the strategy the filmmakers used to get around the standard-cliched-situation problem. Instead of trying to disguise the fact that a certain scene had been done numerous times before in countless horror movies and was predictable for anyone who has seen any of them, they took another approach. They explained these cliches used in older horror movies before or while they were supposedly happening, making the scene funny when you hear about how lame they are, and scary when you realize they are actually happening to the characters. Although the movie was good all the way through, the best part of the movie is the opening scene, especially the first time watching it. This is because it starts out with a seemingly harmless phone call from a seemingly harmless person which lasts long enough for you to get the feeling of tranquility, until the voice on the other line says something you didn't expect, and catches you, as well as the person he's talking to, completely off guard, and the only reason you don't wonder if you heard correctly is the fact that you know you're watching a horror movie. Although that line was in the trailer I had seen many times before seeing this film, I still got the chills when it came. The "slasher flick" idea is also combined with the idea of standard mystery movies, which is that everybody's a suspect. This really goes well with the slasher idea, and I believe this is the first ever film that has these two ideas paired together. Other films, of course, followed using this same idea, such as "Urban Legend" (1998), but just know that "Scream" was the first. There is also very good acting in the film, and the main characters all have very distinct personalities which are portrayed very nicely by the individual actors. My personal favorite is teenage film expert Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), probably because he was so much like me it's freaky. Neve Campbell does an excellent performance in the leading role of Sydney Prescott, the primary target of the killer. Other very notable performances include over-the-top Stuart Macher (Matthew Lillard), dweeby Deputy "Dewey" Riley (David Arquette), obnoxious reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), and token main suspect Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich). No matter what you think will happen next and who you think will eventually turn out to be the killer, there is always one more surprise waiting, and a definitely unpredictable ending. Scream makes a great film to watch alone in the dark, or in the broad daylight if you are the kind who just can't handle it. A must-see for horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>rating (* to *****) : *****To me, Scream is the most wonderful movie ever made. Me liking scary movies, it satisfies me, but it's also from time to time hilariously funny. Especially the opening sequence is brilliant. It kicks off really gently (someone's made a wrong phone call to a teenage girl), but suddenly, things start to get creepy, and tension is accumulating. Moreover, it's not only scary and funny, but it's also a parody on late '70's/'80's slasher movies. All the main characters know that the killer is following the common rules of those scary movies, and Wes Craven is constantly showing us several horror clichés and meanwhile scaring us to death. I had never seen a Wes Craven movie before (except the weird Swamp Thing, which looked really messy to me), and this movie showed me his qualities very clearly. I think he has viewed a lot of horror material, and he knows how to use it, combining it with his overall scary movie directing experience. David Arquette is quite alright, although a bit awkward in his acting. First time starring in a box office smash hit is really something of course. I've seen Scream 2 as well, and I thought his acting in that movie was really bad, but here, he manages. I always regarded Neve Campbell as a soapy bad actress, who's just lucky she got the Sidney Prescott role. But she is unexpectedly great, her character is interesting and after me viewing her in the cinema I had a lot of respect for her. Courteney Cox is good, she seems quite fit for this over-the-top role of obnoxious tabloid TV reporter, and it requires no special acting abilities. Matthew Lillard was great. He was funny, but he also managed to show some real acting skills. Rose McGowan does an excellent job, I've seldom seen an actress liking her part so much. She's Neve Campbell's best friend, and she brings life into her funny character. Skeet Ulrich is okay, considering he just has to stand there, talk like a normal high school guy, and be handsome. I think he could do better in other roles. Jamie Kennedy is, although somewhat annoying, great. He's very convincing as the horror movie genius. Finally, it's not really fair of me to review a Drew Barrymore movie, considering she's my favourite actress and mere idol. But she was lovely! Although she dies after five minutes, she manages to portray a real character. Oh, she's fabulous!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scary modern version of the old school horrors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVE this movie and could go on about it forever, but don't worry I won't. When this first came out I didn't think it would be all that hot, and also I wasn't a big fan of horror films apart from Halloween but I was eventually persuaded by my friends. And I'm happy they did. I love this film. The plot is quite simple. It starts off with Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) being horribly killed. We then go to the aftermath. At the school she went to the press are having a field day and Sidney Presscott (Neve Campbell) is having to deal with this and it also being the year long anniversary of her mother's murder. Then the murders start up again, first with the high school headteacher, then Sidney's best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) At first Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) is suspected but he is then released. It's then a free for all with everyone suspecting everyone else. I won't give away who does it but I must say I was surprised. Neve Campbell is fantastic as tortured Sidney, Skeet Ulich is great as the suspicious boyfriend Billy, Courteney Cox is excellent as the bitchy all for herself journalist Gale Weathers (A refereshing break from Friends.) Jamie Kennedy is cool as the film buff Randy, and David Arquetted is sweet as the quirky, nerdy Deputy Duey. This is a great film but the first 10 minutes where Drew Barrymore is killed is of course the most thrilling and scary. This is a great film. If you haven't seen it yet where have you been the last 2 years? Get your head out of the sand and rent it now!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I nearly had to force myself to sit through this. This film is an insult to the intelligence, and the fact that so many people fell for it disturbs me more than anything in the film. This film just grabs every cliche of the genre and runs with it, but insists on giving us a knowing wink all the time as if just because it knows it's bad, that that somehow makes it great.Well here's a brain storm, the old films it's "spoofing" knew they were bad to, duh. There's a line in the movie something like (I didn't write it down):"Those old horror movies just have some bad actress with big tits running up the stairs when she should be running out the door". This is shortly followed by a bad actress (Neve Campbell) with big tits running up the stairs when she should be running out the door. I mean yes, ha ha, but this is pretty straightforward sarcastic stuff. Was this film written by a 15 year old? That's what this film is full of, quick forgettable laughs. The film had a few good sadistic splatter laughs too (the opening scene, the garage door) but they were too few and far between. In between we put up with the banal going's on of a bunch of loathsome teens played by 20 something actors. I felt like I was watching Beverly Hills 90210.The acting by b-grade TV actors/actresses (which makes them d or e grade film actors) was extremely ordinary. You've got to have questions about any film where Courtney Cox gives the stand-out performance. I see a lot of you other commenters (bless your little souls) have praised Barrymore and Campbell. Um....have you not seen any other films. I imagine if top actresses, the likes of Meryl Streep or Michelle Pfeiffer ever lowered themselves to this type of film and you could compare, then you might think differently about Barrymore and Campbell.I was not scared once in this film. Any chance of scares was ruined because they played everything for laughs. I think that the word "horror" is misused when describing these types of films. This can hardly be called a horror film, it's a slasher film. True horror is felt when watching films such as Silence of the Lambs, Seven, or classics like Psycho.Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, it'll do if you can't think of anything else quickly, it looks like Williamson couldn't think of anything else with Scream. Instead of telling a good story or building strong characters, Scream spends its running time smart-assing around. Well the jokes on the audience who think that this is clever. Mr Williamson and Mr Craven are laughing all the way to the bank.</fullReview>

This movie is what a REAL movie -- not just a horror flick -- should be like. Perfect mix of comedy, horror, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat for two hours.When I saw it it was the middle of the day, the sun was shining, and the lights were on.

		<shortDescription>Scream vs Halloween vs Prom Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Kevin Williamson came along I was avoiding horror movies like the plague because of the lack of originality the later 80's slasher movies had, i.e. Nightmare on Elm St. 2-4, and Halloween 3-6. The whole genre was becoming tired and over-used. Kevin's 'Scream' was what the genre really needed. I think that Williamson's clever add-ons from 'Halloween' and 'Prom Night' are delightfully on-point, i.e. remember when young Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) tells Tommy and Lendsey to go to the McCensey's and call the police because of the killer, now, remember Cassey Becker's father tell her mother to go to the McCensey's to call the police because someone has killed their daughter. And remember when Tatum gets stuck in the garage while trying to flee from the killer, remember the girl in 'Halloween' trying to climb out of the window from the washroom and she gets stuck. Oh, and remember the principal Mr. Himbry expelling the kids and remember the Mr. Himbry from 'Prom Night' (also starring Jamie Lee Curtis) expelling kids from his school. In a nutshell, the humor is very hidden with in the plot of 'Scream' and Kevin Williamson did a great job writing this movie. But, if you haven't seen 'Halloween' or 'Prom Night' in a while rent them and see for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream is a psychological thriler directed by Wes Craven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The killer in Scream has apparently seen too many scary movies, and can quote chapters and verses from Halloween, psycho, and the silence of the lambs while terrorizing the teens is this California town. At the top of the killers list is Sidney, still grieving from her mothers brutal death one year ago,too depressed to grant sexual favors to her boyfriend, and angry at a Tv-tabloid reporter Gale, whose book claims that Sidney wrongly accused Cotton for her mothers murder. This movie is filled with moments of hilariously funny comedy to blood and gore. It is a rollercoaster ride. Matthew Lillard was casted to play Stu in this movie a pretty laid back sort of guy who is dating Sidneys best friend Tatum. He brings the comedy to this movie along with Jamie Kennedy. You can tell throughout this movie that these actors and actresses had fun making this movie. They allow them selves to crack on there own genre which makes watching this movie worth your while There is no real way to explain what makes this movie great it took brilliant acting super scripting and direction not to mention the many dificulties they had to overcome while making this film. This movie is not just a everyone dies and blood goes everywhere the end type movie. It is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw 'Scream', I was expecting a real horror movie. After all, I had heard that this was a very scary movie from people who had seen it before me. But, I wasn't hardly scared at all. I don't know why. Maybe it's because after living with my parents for the last 15 years, everything else seems a lot tamer. But like I said with 'Halloween', just because it wasn't scary doesn't mean I didn't like it. The movie made me laugh more than it made me scream. It's hilarious but not because it's lame. It's not lame at all! It's funny because the movie makes fun out of other slasher films. Even in the middle of the climax, I was laughing my ass off because Stu had started crying about how his parents were gonna kill him. This movie is awesome. It's just as entertaining as 'Halloween'. See it if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror movies had sort of run into a rut before Scream came along with its wit and new take on these predictable films. It is, in the simplest terms, a spoof, (a very scary spoof). But there were two things that made it so good: 1, Everyone was a suspect, 2,The Killer could have been anywhere at anytime. The fact that the audience had to deal with something popping out around every corner and hints at every character being the evil-doer made it intriguing and frightfully entertaining. Our movie buff, Randy, directed us through the film with his accurate insight into the horrific plot unfolding around him..."There's always some stupid bulls!@t reason to kill your girlfriend, that's the beauty of it all: SIMPLICITY! Besides, if it gets too complicated, you lose your target audience." Comments like these made it so enlightening and showed writer Kevin Williamson's ingenuity and brilliance. Overall it should be remebered as the horror film of the 90's.</fullReview>

Just as the audience believes they know what is about the occur, the filmmakers twist you in the opposite direction. The protagonist, Sidney Prescott, differs from the norm as a horror heroine in that she has dealt with trauma in her past, and is smart and strong, definately not your typical screamer. Clues as to who the antogonist is are dropped throughout the film, but in such a way the audience wanders down the wrong path consistantly until the final revelation in the last reel.

		<fullReview>I had high expectations before watching this famous horror movie, and as I don't usually watch movies from this genre, I was a a bit scared that this will be too frightening for me.It turned out that it was completely unnecessary for me to be worried. There wasn't a single moment in the movie which made me scream, and the jump-scares were predictable even for someone who isn't familiar with the genre. Most of the acting was worse than what we see in a home video, and it wasn't hard to guess who the killer is, although the ending gives a little bit of a twist to the plot.On the contrary, the whole movie seemed like a parody, and if we look at it this way, it is quite a funny film, with lots of laugh-out-loud moments. The movie has some comedic characters who are witty and fun to watch. It is also excellent for a drinking game: drink whenever someone dies, screams, a phone rings, and a horror movie is mentioned. All in all, I would recommend you to watch this movie with your friends. Don't expect to be scared, but expect and enjoyable evening.</fullReview>

Excellent acting, tension, music, and death scenes, make this one of Wes Craven's masterpieces! Along with it's sequels this film was able to bring back the horror genre to its initial popularity and the 90s was changed into teen slashers until recently, where we mostly see found footage "horror" and paranormal films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The slasher film that started it all (again) CLASSIC!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 'slasher' film, i.e. a killer stalking a selection of dippy American teenagers, had kind of gone out of fashion in the late eighties. Therefore, the early nineties were a barren place for masked nutjobs wielding knives. Then Scream came along.It's about a young girl, seemingly destined to spend the entire film being stalked by a masked killer who despatches her peers in many different knife-related ways. Nothing particularly unusual there, but don't let the basic nature of the plot put you off. There is definitely more to this than meets the eye.It not only revitalised the 'slasher genre' but it also was the first of such films to poke fun at the whole genre in itself. If you've ever found yourself yelling at the 'dumb blonde' on the screen to run the right way and not straight back into the serial killer's clutches then this is the film for you. It uses the horror clichés to the max and takes great pleasure in, not only pointing them out, but dispelling them.However, Scream wasn't just hugely successful because it poked fun at the genre. It was also a damn good mystery. With other similar films, the killer was normally quite obvious, i.e. the big disfigured bloke in a mask, wielding a chainsaw. But in Scream, pretty much every character is a suspect. The only time you can really rule them out is when they end up the wrong end of the killer's knife.If you love horror then you've probably already seen it. If you haven't... watch it now. The only downside you might find is that it was so successful that there were almost an infinite number of (nowhere near as good) copies. However, Scream is the original and BEST. It's fun, gory, well-written with great characters. What more could you want if you like scary movies?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A revolutionary horror movie that was the first to do something that many have tried to copy since, having a vast amount of the traditional horror movie traits, thus managing to instill a sense of danger and despair, all while still managing to not take itself to seriously and still supplying some comedic moments that don't take away from the movie being in the horror genre, this theme being continued throughout the following movies. Scream also manages to make some deaths more than the normal 'stab and the body goes down' kills, with a few imaginative final scenes for characters. An example of this is when Tatum is seemingly going to be stabbed by Ghostface just like the other victims, only for her 'death by garage door'. This, like the aforementioned dark humour, is another notable great feature throughout the series. This is a movie I actively recommend to people in real life and I will keep doing so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I'm not going to write any spoilers. I usually don't anyway, but knowing any more than some of the most obvious deaths/twists in this movie or it's sequels can ruin them. These movies are murder mysteries, so you shouldn't know much about who lives and dies going into one of them. Now onto the review. This movie is scary. Lots of jump scares, violent killings, and edge-of-your-seat chase scenes. But Scream is also smart: The characters put up a fight, they are smart, and they really try to escape. The characters also make many comments on horror movies and how to survive a horror movie (This adds to the movie sly but subtle satire). The movie itself is very well written and acted. The characters are realistically written. They almost all have something to make you think "There's no way they would kill someone!". That's why it's so hard to figure out who the killer is. The plot ain't bad either, but after the first scene it takes a while to pick up, but when it picks up, it picks up. The acting, like I stated earlier, is decent. You really feel for the characters, you don't want them to die, and, unlike in many other movies, they have a good chance at surviving. Scream is an exceptional horror movie. Kudos to Wes and Kevin. Remember, like most of my reviews this is a rating specific for films like this one. It's not like you can compare this to Forest Gump or something. I compare horror movies to other horror movies, so thats what my rating is based on. 8.6/10 (or four and a half stars out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A maniac is killing off teenagers in the small town of Woodsboro. A bunch of teens (among them Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard) try to figure out who's doing it and why. Meanwhile reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) is trying to get the story from the town deputy (David Arquette).This came out in winter 1996. By then horror films were all but dead. However this one was a big hit with critics and audiences and started off a new wave of horror films. Why? Because it has a clever script with MANY references to older horror films; established the rules on how to survive a horror film; had smart, intelligent and likable teenagers and basically played with the genre and reinvented it. Also there is a good sense of humor in this but there's also some very graphic gore (especially at the end). This got an NC-17 from the ratings board until director Wes Craven agreed to tone down on the violence. The acting is good all around, it moves at a fast pace and I was constantly entertained by it. Also the opening 15 minutes with Drew Barrymore is terrifying. The only debit is Lillard. He overacts to a downright embarrassing degree and gets very annoying...especially at the end. Still, him aside, this is a great horror film. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody thinks it's just a dumb slasher, with no plot, no point, just blood. Oh how wrong they are. One of the most complex stories for a horror film. Sydney's mom was murdered and one year later the murders start again, wow. Funny, scary, suspenseful, and fun (don't forget violent). The scene were Tatum is trapped in the garage door is suspenseful and disturbing. Fantastic killer, with so many kids dressed as him/her for Halloween. I love this film. When deciding whether, or not to let your little ones see this, remember the intense horror violence (was originally NC-17) strong language, drug and alcohol use, and some mild sex (mostly talking) Watch this movie, I'd recommend 14+ (know your kids).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless horror classic, putting the audience on a fun roller coaster ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of those that is and always will be timeless, the film at the time was fresh funny scary and original in it's own unique way. This film has all the great elements for a successful scary movie, it has some funny moments mixed with some tense and scary scenes giving the audience a clash of laughing and the jumping or feeling uneasy. It's a great fun ride that is extremely cleaver, what makes this film unique is that it's self aware of itself and over horror films. The characters are aware that there are other horror films out there and they know of the clichés and rules that those films follow and so this makes for a great fun device for the characters to use. The movie does a brilliant job of playing with audience's expectations of horror films keeping them on edge when they're expecting the killer to jump out and when he doesn't it shakes the audience and keeps them guessing about what will happen next. This film is genius and puts shame on it's sequels ( i haven't seen Scream 4 yet) I could go on and on about this film but if i did no one would read it. It has a fantastic feel about with a very strong 90s feel but that's what the scream films are about, their about a statement of a generation at the time it's set (which is what Scream 4 looks to follow). This film is fun to watch on your own but is also fun to watch with friends it's a great ride filled with laughs and scares something most horror films miss. If you haven't seen this film why not? Go see it it's an experience you must take at least once alone or with friends just make sure you remember to turn of the lights and don't answer the phone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream was amazing from the terrifying beginning to the graphic ending. Scream rescued the slasher film cycle and actually parodied itself and the horror the genre. The Scream series is extremely successful. This and the fourth installment are the best in the series, in my opinion. Scream was graphically gory and fun. The fresh, offbeat teenagers have personalities we can all relate to. The fact of someone calling you and stalking your every move is just the most frightening thing ever. Rating: 10.0/10.0 Rated R For Strong Bloody Horror Violence, Some Pervasive Language and Brief Sexuality (My Rating) Final Conclusion: This film is a must-see! It's my favorite horror film of all time. The film excels in every subject, from humor to the graphic gore Scream displays, proudly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun movie that effectively parodied the slasher genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the big flop "New Nightmare", which was not actually a bad film, Wes Craven came out all guns blazing, armed with a nice script from Kevin Williamson, and made the single biggest movie of his career.The script is a lot of fun with various in jokes, and it doesn't take long for them to start coming. "The first nightmare on Elm Street was good, the rest sucked," was an obvious reference to Wes Craven directing the original and not the later ones, Craven later makes a cameo appearance as a janitor named "Fred" wearing a green and red jumper. Several other classic horror films are also referenced including the Exorcist, Friday the 13th, Halloween 1 and 2, Hellraiser, Prom Night, The Howling and Rosemary's Baby.The plot revolves around Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), a young high Schooler who's mother was viciously murdered a year or so earlier. Sidney was convinced her mother's murderer was Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) who was convicted of the crime and is in now in jail. Tabloid news reporter Gail Weathers however, has her doubts and has printed a series of articles and a tell all novel pleading Weary's innocence. Her theory is given credence as a series of copycat killings, modeled after 80s horror movies, occur. Sidney soon finds herself living in a real life scary movie with no allies and everyone's a suspect.I find it a bit hard to rate Scream as a slasher film, as I don't see it as one. I see it as more of comedy thriller, which was successfully marketed as a horror film. Not that it was hard given the many litres of fake blood used in the story or the rather grisly subject matter.On the acting side, Skeet Ulrich easily steals the movie from under the rest of the cast, while Matthew Lillard and Jamie Keneedy are both delights. David Arquette is equal parts annoying and endearing, and Courtney Cox is convincing as a bitch, but not so much as a reporter. Neve Campbell puts in a strong performance as Sidney, while Rose McGowan is under used, and unlikeable in her few scenes. Drew Barrymore's cameo in the opening ten or so minutes has become an iconic scene in 90s film making, and is some of the best work she has ever done.Craven's affection for the horror genre has been evident in many of his movies and he does a fine job here of both sending up the genre he helped create, and also redefining it for a modern audience. Well done to Craven and his script writer Kevin Williamson for breathing life back into the slasher genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily the greatest slasher film since "Halloween", "Scream" is the film that bends the rules and breaks them into smithereens, leaving the viewer spellbound and begging for more.Directed by horror master Wes Craven, it tells the story of a killer on the loose in the picturesque town of Woodsboro. The viewer is introduced to some genuinely likable teens, including Neve Campbell, Rose McGowan and the hilarious movie geek Jamie Kennedy. Together they must try to stay alive in this cat and mouse movie of gut-wrenching proportions.The performances are great, (particularly Jamie Kennedy) the soundtrack rocks, and the theory behind the film is genius. ("Cops don't watch enough horror movies, if they watched "Prom Night" they'd save time, there's a very simple formula, EVERYBODY'S A SUSPECT!") Highly recommended to all horror fans, as it truly is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The teen slasher genre is re-born!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's proved very difficult to re-boot long gone genres that defined early Hollywood (the Western, the musical, gangster films). There has been limited success of each case, but in actuality, only one genre has been (for better or worse) re-booted to extreme success in the last decade and that is the horror/slasher film. That success can be directly attributed to SCREAM (1996)! And not just the teen variety (URBAN LEGEND, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, CRY WOLF, etc.), but also films like SAW, HOSTEL, and a host of other horror films. Just base on influence alone, SCREAM deserves a place in the history of film.While SCREAM essentially references all the old 70s-80s slasher flicks (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, Friday THE 13TH, HALLOWEEN), make no mistake, the film itself is a highly original, involving experience with a witty script, a solid story, and excellent performances. The film starts with former teen icon/idol Drew Barrymore (perfect in her small role as Casey Becker, her real last chance to play a "teenager" before time just plain takes over!) getting a "wrong number" phone call from a mysterious weirdo, who quizzes her about those famed slasher flicks and their villains (Jason Voorhies, Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers). But this is no ordinary quiz: the caller has kidnapped and tortured Casey's boyfriend. If Casey doesn't answer the questions correctly, her boyfriend is dead and so is she. This opening scene is both terrifying and tongue-in-cheek.Cut to our story's heroine Sydney Prescott (a perfectly cast Neve Campbell from PARTY OF FIVE TV show fame). Sydney's mom was murdered a year before (the killer is in jail) and she lives with her father. Her boyfriend Billy Loomis (excellently played by Skeet Ulrich) is sensitive to her situation but wants to consummate their relationship. Their best friends are Tatum, Stuart, and Randy (Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, and Jamie Kennedy in solid performances). They soon find out about Casey Becker's demise and postulate who the killer might be and the motive. Of course, they reference every slasher flick known to man while doing it! Separately investigating the crime is Tatum's brother Deputy Sheriff Dewey Riley and up-and-coming investigative reporter Gale Weathers (real-life couple David Arquette and Courtney Cox rounding out the perfect cast). Eventually, all parties collide at the climactic teen weekend party where the real culprit is revealed.SCREAM, while having a memorable beginning and end, also has an extremely solid middle act and that is vital. It is fun thinking along with the characters trying to figure out what is really going on. And the final reveal is a humdinger! But even knowing the ending, it is so memorable and well-executed that you want to watch over and over again. The modern day slasher flick all starts here with SCREAM!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A seminal slasher flick for the 90's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time we had reached 1996, the horror genre was in a pretty stagnant state. With nothing to define the decade but cheap sequels and even cheaper direct-to-video productions, the timing was just right for a film to come along that both defined its era and spun the genre on its head. In the 60's, it was "Psycho." In the 70's, "Halloween." The 80's were owned by "Friday the 13th" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street." Enter "Scream," the one true stand-out genre flick of its time, a film that has incited as much praise as it has criticism from horror fan-boys, as well as inspiring and reviving a whole new breed of self-aware slasher films that were, sadly, not nearly as good as this big-boy.After losing control of the franchise he started with "A Nightmare On Elm Street," director Wes Craven got his groove back with "Scream," settling in as the director of its two sequels and earning himself back some of the credibility that the late 80's and early 90's stripped him of. With a clever script from newcomer Kevin Williamson, it was the first slasher film where its characters were aware of what was happening to them. Heck, they even invoke a set of rules to survive a horror film, while blatantly taking stabs at the well-worn classics of the horror genre. While this formula became rather redundant by the time "Scream 2" rolled around (let alone, "I Know What You Did Last Summer," "Urban Legend" and the like) it was rather inventive and fresh for its time, and taken in the correct context, makes for a brilliant and unique slasher film.You'll spend the bulk of the film trying to guess the identity of the killer, but thankfully the script is smart enough to lead you astray and only by blind luck would you be able to identify him/her. The death scenes are surprisingly intense considering how neutered the genre was at the time, and in its most notorious scene ? the opening ? does away with a big-name star in a way that sets the tone for the rest of the film by leaving you with the feeling that anything can happen. Part mystery, part comedy, part slasher, "Scream" pays tribute to its influences but has enough of a sense of humor to poke fun at the clichés in the genre. One of Wes Craven's finest films, and certainly a definitive film for the 90's, not just in the horror genre, but in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream A Thrilling Horror Film With A Few Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is a thrilling horror film with a few flaws but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Filmmaker Wes Craven continues to show his skill with Scream giving audiences a horror film that delivers on what fans expect from the genre bloody deaths, a scary villain, and some suspense that doesn't quite pay off entirely but it's still worth seeing at least once. The cast of relative unknown actors at the time including Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and Skeet Ulrich are admirable in their roles. David Arquette (Courtney Cox's future husband), Matthew Lillard, and Rose McGowan turn in decent supporting performances but they aren't given much screen time. Drew Barry makes a brief appearance and then is written out of the movie rather quickly. The rest of the cast including Jamie Kennedy, W. Earl Brown, and Liev Shreiber in a brief cameo make the best of their small parts in the movie. There are surprises in the movie one I sort of saw coming and the other I didn't about the identity of the killer(s)were satisfying but once they're revealed there's no more real suspense. With it's flaws aside Scream is still an entertaining horror movie that has just the right amount of gruesome deaths, anticipation, and some suspense that makes it worth the time to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror movies of all time! Wes Craven is a genius!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream was released in 1996. This was when horror films were losing popularity.Wes Craven, director of classics such as Nightmare On Elm Street 1 and New Nightmare, decided to make a semi-spoof horror film.Do not think of it as "Scary Movie"(which was a spoof of this and other horrors), because it is not much of a stupid comedy.It's an actual horror film, but also an intelligent spoof of crappy horror films of the 1980's.The characters are self-aware of this and make fun of them.In one scene, a character lists what not to do during a horror film.Another character talks about the nightmare on elm street series, saying the first one was good but the rest sucked! These comedic elements are interesting in contrast to the rest of the film which is a decent slasher flick.The main plot is about a teen girl who'se mother was raped and murdered about a year ago.The case re-opens as another killer is on the loose.People are trying to find out who it was.The ending is definitely shocking, you will not expect it! The film was meant to kill off the horror genre, but instead made it popular again.Films such as "I Know What You Did Last Summer" were released, this one even spawned two sequels.Overall, I think it's one of the best horror movies of all time and you owe it to yourself to check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharp reflection of the concept of horror flicks will keep you screaming till the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the murder of her classmate, Sidney (Campbell) is stalked by an unidentifiable lunatic in a white mask one year from her mother's shocking death.Wes Craven's horror reflects on the past releases of classic horror to manipulate the genre into a highly creative slasher movie that will make you guess and gasp right until the gob smacking climax.Named as the film which spurned the continuous parody releases in modern times such as Scary Movies and Epic Movie etc the 1996 shocker has perhaps been shunted aside as it resembles an easy target for such ridiculous parody releases. But the important thing to see is a sharp and witty film that showcases horror in a thrilling fashion.Opening with an anonymous caller and a horrible murder and we are plunged head first into a story about survival against the insane. There are twists, shocks, jumpy moments, horrible deaths and some gory sequences that will make your stomach turn. So what you might ask is different from every other horror film? For starters Scream is set out to be a lighter version of horror. Throughout the 111minutes we see humorous references to other "scary movies" including Nightmare on Elm Street, The Exorcist and Halloween, all established classics in the horror market. All finely executed with that degree of teen subtlety that makes charming and acceptable viewing. I have never watched any of the titles mentioned but this was thankfully not necessary as brilliantly, this film is all about the sheer concept of horror.As Jamie Kennedy's character clearly identifies, there are certain rules to survive a horror film. What follows are references to this humorous theory and the intertextuality from the other releases are used exquisitely to emphasize the point made.Performances wise Neve Campbell is perhaps the star, very quiet but also aggressive. Her anger scene with Courtney Cox was brilliantly funny.Where Scream fits the horror genre easily, there is a high degree of drama. The fact the murders are happening a year from Sidney's death makes everything more fragile. The romantic inclusions add to the intensity and the sustained threat places Scream into the thriller genre also. Cracking mysteries likewise as we are guessing right till the very end.Craven's direction serves up waves of screaming action and his creation of the masked murderer is now a legendary icon. His picture really is a scream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true old school slasher homage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 80s slasher died. It was slow and sorrowful death. The fans remained and the audience stayed true long after its passing. All that was left was the memory and sequels to past corner stones (Halloween, Nightmare on elm street, Friday the 13th). And then 1996 "Scream" came and breathed new life into the genre giving birth to one the greatest entry's and series in the genre.Scream may be called a spoof but its more a homage. Pulling together the original elements (masked killer, teens being stalked, the killer using a hunting knife, and a twist in the end). But it is not a spoof. Its not making fun of the genre its paying well due respect.The only difference is in Scream slashers exist and are consistently mentioned. A masked killer is recreating the films and the teens know it. But of course the practical police would rather play cat and mouse then sit through "Prom Night" which as Randy mentioned might have helped them out more then any silly lead would.The idea is itself is creative. Instead of just doing a imitation that takes itself to seriously *cough* I know what you did last summer *cough* it makes it fun. Pokes are made at slashers on occasion but are mostly in good fun and are not insulting. It has a good balance of fun and serious such as when the killer is finally killed someone says (I won't disclose who so its not spoiled) "Now this is the part where the supposedly dead killer comes back for one last scare" and then yes thats just what happens. And of course you laugh and say to yourself "Of course!" but despite its comical moments it has a nerve racking tone that puts it in its genre.The characters are as well a big part of the film's quality and they don't necessarily fallow the character stereotypes of slashers. We have Sidney Presscot, our main girl who will of course live in the end, She's strong, likable and just so happens to be the main target, We have Tatum Riley the silly best friend who you actually grow attached to and hope lives, The boyfriend Billy Loomis a smooth character who is suspect number 1, Billy's best friend and Tatum's boyfriend Stu Macher is a typical goof ball type but not the only comic relief, Randy Meeks is our slasher buff other comic relief character, Deputy Dewey Riley Tatum's older brother is a slightly slow but extremely lovable guy, And Gale Weathers is a very annoying, pretentious news reporter who wants to get the big scoop on the woodsboro murder spree and even pretends at first to like Dewey to get inside info and even though she is annoying at first she proves useful and I must admit you grow to like her. The character development is on a really personal level. You grow attached and really get to know the characters. Its hard to pin point the killer because you like them all. Even the first victim Casey Becker you feel for. In her 10 minute scene you get a real sense of her personality. The acting is more real and not silly. No outlandish screaming and the actors just look like scared senseless people. This movie is my personal all time favorite and a must see for any horror buff. If you're like me and are an obsessive slasher fan you'll get a kick out of the references and nods to all the classic slasher greats!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without Doubt The Ultimate, Original, And Best Teen Horror Slasher Flick Ever Released</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** This Comment May Contain Spoilers *** I for one will say that I am not a fan of horror movies, least of all stuff such as The Nightmare On Elm Street series, but I did enjoy watching the Scream trilogy. If anything, thanks to Wes Craven it has totally reinvigorated and rejuvenated the horror genre, thus transforming it from what was deemed as old fashioned and catering towards older folks into a trendy, contemporary and youth based genre and introducing movie goers to a new sub-genre of horror: the slasher flick.Scream in truth for most part, is a thriller which incorporates and juxtaposes elements of horror movies to it. Evidently, its success spanned other movies of a similar- yet not as good nature, likewise I know What You Did Last Summer, in addition to silly and innocuous spoof movies such as the Scary Movie series.What was so great about the Scream films though was that there was no way of telling who the killer was, the first time you'd seen it. Rather you'd assume it would be this person, when in fact he/she wasn't involved whatsoever. When I first saw the first movie, I had no idea that Sidney's boyfriend was the killer, alongside one of her so called best friends. Also, the victims weren't as hapless and hopeless as we'd come to expect, as all of them put up a brave fight and attempt to make their escape unharmed.The twists in Scream were clever, but what was also clever was in finding out and discovering the sheer motives and reasons, as well as actions that led up to and during the killings by the killers themselves. The performances from the leads ranged from the very good to terrific; hence, Friends's very own Courteney Cox Arquette successfully manages to plays against type as a roving reporter, and the build-up to the actual revealing of the killer's identity is full of suspense and intrigue, whilst Neve Campbell does a good job playing would-be hero, Sydney. Therefore, it's not so much the blood, gore and killings that shock and leave the audience baffled but rather the final outcome when everything is out in the open, the whole truth is revealed and the murderer unmasks himself.In all, Scream is one rare and yet extremely intelligent horror thriller. It is full of suspense, intrigue and some of the scenes will make you jump out of your seat. It is undoubtedly the ultimate, original and best teen horror film, as well as the best contemporary horror movie you will ever see. The sequel meanwhile was good, although not as great as the prequel, whilst the third, well it is not as good as the second and no where near superior to the first.As a horror movie, Scream is a scream and the killer's mask itself is almost an iconic movie trademark that is reminiscent of the Michael Myers version from Hallowean. The best horror movie of the 90s methinks? well, its certainly one of the cleverest that's for sure</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is a genuine postmodern mainstream horror-movie classic; Scream impressively manages to reward sophisticated viewers whilst offering pleasurable mainstream horror movie fluff. Its neatly balances mainstream appeal, by obeying the fundamental conventions of horror, with sophisticated satire of the genre's clichés and tendency for conservative discourse.When viewed retrospectively, the efforts of successive films in the genre, and the parody of it in the (at best) sporadically charming Scary Movie, may lessen the impact of this film. Nonetheless, this potential criticism itself stands as testament to Scream's influence and its legacy of having reinvigorated and informed what had become a tired and clichéd genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent, such great special effects just left me stunned. Great deaths and pretty gory. The movie kept me guessing and I was shocked at the end. Had quite a lot of laughs which kept me entertained. I absolutely loved the killer's outfit and the games he played with his victims over the phone. Had some scares. I mainly loved Randy. The movie geek who believes the police are idiots who should watch more movies. He made me laugh especially when the killer is behind him whilst he's watching Halloween yelling look behind you when he should be doing it himself. He really put this film together. Even Dewey.The dimwitted cop. I also liked this movie as it felt like real life as it mentions all the horror movies. The things people in real life know as in other movies like I know what you did last summer they had no clue about horror movies.I only gave it a 9 because i just don't believe that Billy and Stu could do all that by themselves. I just don't think that's believable especially when the killer is seen reflected in the fridge door at the shopping center. Wouldn't he have been spotted?? But anyway to summarize an excellent movie that I will never get tired of watching. One of Wes Craven's best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>funny,scary and unpredictable altogether</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>personally my favorite slasher flick of the 90s. It is a blur of comedy,horror,mystery and thriller. Very original and unpredictable! I recommend it to everyone.Lots of surprise and plenty of gore. Anybody that likes a blend of everything altogether would love the hit "SCREAM". It is without a doubt, an edge of your seat thriller.I love the costume they selected for the movie. Ghostface rules!!! You can see it 8 times and not get tiresome of it. I actually watched it about 12 times. My favorite slasher flick ever made! It is a must-see slasher flick classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>out of every movie ever made, this is the best movie made. if you like violence, this is the movie for you. it has guts, slit throats, and stabbing, with much more. its worth two hours. as I've said, I've seen almost every movie, and this is still my favorite.the DVD is loaded with features too. it has commercials, bts, and outtakes, with like 10 more things. the story is your typical slasher movie. someone is stalking kids and even some adults. but this movie beats newer slasher flicks like Texas chainsaw massacre remake and Freddy vs. Jason by a long mile, and i highly enjoyed those movies. it even beat see no evil by a lot, and i thought that was a great movie. this is a very enjoyable movie, so watch it!HIGHLY Recommended! 11/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream is FINOMINAL!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is my favorite movie along with Scream 2 and 3. It offers some laughs, it is full of scares, and an excellent plot. Very original, a great and smart twist. Definitely great materials for a movie. Neve Campbell is a beautiful and extremely talented actress. She plays the innocent, "sexually-anorexic" Sidney Prescott in the town of Woodsboro. One night two body's are found, one gutted, another hung. There is a killer on the loose, and body's keep piling up. Along with David Arquette as Officer Dewey Riley, Courtney Cox-Arquette as ambitious reporter Gale Weathers, Rose Mcgowan as Tatum Riley; Sidney's best friend and Dewey's younger sister, Skeet Ulrich as suspicious boyfriend of Sidney's; Billy Loomis, and Matthew Lillard as Tatum Riley's funny, party-hosting boyfriend, Stu. They all are great actors put together. This movie and the second and third movie are all well-deserving 10's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream is the best!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you like scary movies? I sure do, and my favorite one of all time is definitely Scream. Not quite a standard horror film, not quite a standard comedy, Scream is the film that single-handedly re-defined the horror genre. Some people say that this is a bad thing, but what I say is that no slasher film in the 90's will ever rival Scream. The whole bloody, mysterious, downright funny legacy all starts with the ringing of a telephone.Young girl Casey Becker, played by Drew Barrymore, answers the call, and it turns out the anonymous caller on the other end has an obsession with horror films, an obsession that is deadly. He begins quizzing Casey on horror movies, and what follows is the greatest and most intense openings of a movie i'vie ever seen. I'm not gonna totally give it away, but it does involve Casey, her boyfriend Steve, lots of blood and a knife. The next day, Caseys home town of Woodsboro is shocked at this double murder. Woodsboro High is filled with police and news reporters. Enter Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell). After these murders, Sid is feeling a little uneasy, as she is still grieving from the murder of her mother a year ago. Later that night, Sidney receives a phone call similar to that of Casey's and escapes a brutal attack by that same psycho. The killer is also claiming to be the killer of Sidney's mother the previous year. As Sidney continues to receive phone calls and get stalked by the killer, nosy news reporter Gail Weathers (Courteney Cox) is always on the scene, looking to get a story, while friendly police officer Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) protects Sidney. Also along for the ride is Sid's best friend and Dewey's witty sister Tatum (Rose McGowan), Sid's horny boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich), Tatums loony boyfriend Stu (Matt Lillard) movie buff Randy (Jamie Kennedy), and Principal Himbry (Henry Winkler). As more residents succumb to the killer and his knife, one thing becomes clear-the killer is someone very close to Sidney and her friends, and to survive, they must follow the rules of the horror movies they grew up watching and know so much about. Scream is full of great actors, which is a rarity in the horror genre. For her 15 minutes on camera, Drew's performance is phenomenal. Neve C. plays the heroine well, and Rose McGowan makes Tatum one of the best characters in the film. Matthew Lillard's portrayal of Stu is so fantastic, there should have been more of him in the film. Skeet Ulrich playing the brooding boyfriend hit the spot. They all made the characters seem so real, not forgetting David Arquette and Courteney, who was such a laugh as Gail. And of course, Henry Winkler played the principal with such glee, i cannot imagine anyone else playing the part. The way Scream manages to be suspenseful, while also poking fun at itself, is probably what has made is so successful. If you haven't seen this film yet, i suggest you do so immediately. What are you waiting for? Go!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream is awesome!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that Scream is the greatest movie ever. It came out in 1996. I was born in 1990, so I was six when it came out. My cousin rented it at Movie Gallery and we watched it at home. Even though I was just six, I remembered watching the girl getting her head crushed in the cat door built into the garage door. I always thought that she was hot. I never even knew anything about her. I am now fifteen and I thought that I should rent the movie to find out more about it. I watched it at least fifteen times. Now that I'm older, I see that Scream is the greatest movie on earth. It's killings are well thought out. (Congrats to Kevin Williamson's assistant for thinking of Tatum's death scene...it was amazing!) Scream isn't like any other movie. Rose McGowan (Tatum Riley) was my favorite character. Now that I've seen Scream, I have become more interested in Rose McGowan. I never was before. I had no idea who she was. I'm also interested in Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, and Drew Barrymore. I don't believe in sequels, but Scream was so awesome, that I think I will definitely rent both Scream 2 and 3. Thamks! I enjoyed the movie! You will too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best horror film of its decade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great, block-buster horror film that re-introduced the genre into Hollywood and stands out as one of Wes Craven's best films! In Woodsboro, California, a young high school girl is still having to deal with the mysterious murder of her mother a year before, while it seems that someone is taking their love for horror films way too far!!Gripping and entertaining from its shocking opening sequence to its nail-biting finale, Scream is probably the finest horror film of its day. Screen writer Kevin Williamson hit it off with his terrific screen play for this film, which pokes fun at the slasher conventions all the while that it draws us into a thrilling and suspenseful story. Horror master Craven shows he's not lost touch with his horror roots as this film comes off in a very terrifying manner. Kudos also go to a great score and soundtrack.The cast is first-rate. Neve Campbell is touching and sympathetic as our leading character. David Arquette is humorous as an unlikely hero, police officer. Courtney Cox is perfect as a snappy reporter looking to solve a murder. While Ulrich, McGowan, Lillard, and Kennedy make for awesome teens and suspects!A truly smashing horror film, that would be followed by two pretty decent sequels and a number of knock-offs. Not to mention being the basis for the crazy Scary Movie spoofs. Scream is a movie that's not to be missed by fans of the genre!**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>scream changes your view of the entire genre forever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie revived the genre, with it's clever analysis of other horror movies and the simplicity of the revenge plot. This proves that you don't need to lay it on thick, with the gore and mountains of corpses to produce a clever, entertaining and truly terrifying horror movie .The original and very scary telephone calls create more suspense than music,lighting or strange noises ever could . This "anticipation of death is worse than death itself" philosophy is very apparent in a lot of craven's work, but non more so than scream."the rules", the focus of the movie are genius , they add purpose to a tart trying to crawl through a kitty door when she should be beating the crap out of the injured killer.the rules change the way you look at all horror movies and this art imitating life imitating art is what makes this movie great.a truly perfect substitute for all that gore. In sum,Scream is the daddy of all horror movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Re-birth of Slashers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A welcome return of the Slasher movies, which started out in the 80's with such titles as Friday The 13th, Halloween movies and etc, which fizzled out during the late eighties, but in 1996 came Scream and the re-birth of the Slashers came back spawning several imitations.The movie starts off with Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) alone in the house, making popcorn and getting ready to watch a video, when she starts getting menaced by phone calls from the killer. Casey then realizes the killer has her boyfriend tied up outside and she has to answers questions to stay alive but when she fails he gets gutted and the killer strikes and comes after Casey, stabbing her cruelly 7 times then hanging her up outside with a piece of swing rope against a tree for her parents to see.This was a brilliant opening to the movie and Drew Barrymore plays it down to a te as the terrified victim.We then meet the main character Sydney Prescott played wonderfully by Neve Campbell, the lead heroine, we see her alone in her and getting a visit from her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), then it cuts to the school and we meet her friends Tatum Riley (Rose McGowen), Stu Marcher (Matthew Lillard) and Randy Meeks played brilliantly by Jamie Kennedy as the horror nut and the love slave of Sidney.The movie just keeps getting better and better after the cool opening, and down to the final climax between killer and heroine.The case are excellent, Courtney Cox is great as the bitchy Gale Weathers, the reporter you love to hate and David Arquette is also great as Dewey Riley.The kills are quite effective in this movie, girl gets gutted at the beginning, another girl gets her head crushed by a garage door, a guy gets a TV on his head and even the Principal gets it.Overall a welcome return to slashers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Wes Craven almost singlehandedly resurrected the horror genre in the mid 90's with this film. Prior to Scream the 90's and the entire 80's had been decades with tireless and tiresome retreads of once popular horror films. These films adhered to the same formula, had little or no innovative or imaginative ideas, and were filled with empty-headed teens big on looks and almost totally void of any real talent. Craven adheres to many of these notions as well in Scream, but he is always using them in a self-mocking way. Scream has much going for it as a horror film: one of the best opening sequences of any horror film with the subtraction of star Drew Barrymore very quickly, some genuine thrills and chills as well as some genuine laughs, and a constant homage to the genre with references such as Wes Carpenter as a popular director of the day and the rules that one should learn having watched horror films. Craven even manages to insert a clip of Whale's Frankenstein for good measure. BUT...and you might have guessed this was coming...I get real disheartened when so many people say this is a classic, one of the greatest horror films ever made(if not the greatest itself), or even Craven's finest film. It just isn't so. I would not even imagine any scenario where I would put Scream on my top ten...top twenty...top thirty... greatest horror film list. Great horror films have great scripts. Scream does not. Aside from the roller coaster introduction with Barrymore, the film never manages to reach those same heights. There are a lot of good plot twists, but let's face it - the story is pretty preposterous. Great horror films usually have great actors giving great performances. Scream does not have any great performances. The cast does a nice job smiling through much of the film - even in the face of impending death. As an audience we are never asked to take anyone seriously. And as an audience we don't. Great horror films have great, memorable scenes that linger with the viewer. Scream DOES have some of these. the opening is very effective. Craven deserves a lot of credit for it, but it is never rivaled again in the film. Don't get me wrong - I liked Scream. It was a fun movie. It gave me a few reasons to jump from my seat. It made me laugh here and there. But it never left any long-lasting impression on me that I had just sat through a masterpiece like when I first saw Psycho, Rosemary's Baby, or Carpenter's Halloween. Craven is a good director and has made many good films. I like his 70's work best: Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes(films that may well repulse many viewers but left a lasting impression on me, though most of it was pure shock!). Those films are really better than this film. Craven plays up to a modern audience whom he is making fun of indirectly in the film. He laces the film with all kinds of genre references that most of his younger, hip audience will have no understanding of at all. He tells us that those people in horror films that have sex or drink or take drugs will die. He shows his audience exactly what they want to see and then pokes fun at it. Surely this hip approach has a lot to do with the wide accolades the film has received from its loyal audience over the years. I think Scream, though not a great film, deservedly is due recognition for making horror popular again and mainstream. This mainstream approach has led to many new, innovative horror films since its release and has made the horror genre certainly one of the more profitable genres to produce a film for. Yes, we still have the umpteenth sequels and unnecessary remakes, but there have also been some new films that I believe are direct descendants of the legacy of Scream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie there are many things that can make me interested and scared. In all of the three parts there were some really scarry moments. I thing the movie is great. There are many good actors in it. I didn't manage to guess who the killer was in the movie. And I was very surprised that there were two people involved in the murders. While i was watching the movie almost all of my suspects died. I guess I wouldn't be a good detective. I specially like Courteney Cox. I was a little surprised that Drew Barrimor died in the beging of the movie. The killer was a real psycho. I think that the character of Matthew Lillard - Stuart had no motive. Anyone who hasn't watched the movie should do it right now.</fullReview>

I think that this movie was thought out very well and it deserves way more credit then it already gets. I also think that they had some very talented actors and actresses for this. Skeet Ulrich (Billy Loomis) and Neve Campbell (Sidney Prescott) are very good at acting. I'm glad that at least one of them survived! And, I really wish Billy wasn't one of the killers! I really think he could have made the Scream movies after the first better if he didn't die in this one. I give this movie 10/10 stars! If I were you, i'd go and buy it now!

		<fullReview>What can I say? I first saw scream when I was 11, and I loved it. As I have grown older I can appreciate the parodies of other horror films. However the juvenile gags ("liver alone") and the dark humour give the film multiple contrasting ways of making the audience lose all control of there bladder. Admittedly I am one of very few people who think that scream's best aspect is its humour, but surely no one can say, honestly, that they didn't laugh at least 5 or more times. Scream manages to capture a realistic view of teenage culture, however simultaneously juxter supposing teenage culture that we (teenage audiences) can relate to, with the flaws in teenage culture and the ideals we possess (whether 100% factual or not). To anyone who took the time to read this thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is a very origanal horror film. Wes Craven the director of the legendary horror film A nightmare on elm street in wich he created Freddy, who became a major horror icon has done it again with a supperior film. That film is scream. It brought new life to the horror generation and is more than responsible for I know what you did last summer and Urban legend. Even the recent vs. film Freddy vs. Jason stole a few things from this film wich goes down in horror film history along with the origanal Friday the 13th and Alien movie. Check this movie out for a great fun time. 9/10. Its hard to be perfect but it makes a good run for it, with likeable charectors, a nice twist at the end, good comic releif and some very scar scenes. But scream 2 and 3 i dont recommend due to bad writing and bad acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people hate this movie. And maybe they should, after all hideous films that have tried to copy this one (Valentine, anyone?) it's no hard thing to do. Scream still stands as the best of the genre it invented i.e. the "slasher-wannabe" genre. This means it tries to be something it actually isn't. Scream is not a slasher movie, plain and simple this is just a thriller dressed up for Halloween.The story is simple; a man murders teens just like in numerous real slasher films. This is what makes the movie pretty funny to watch, there are dozens of jokes that relate to films of the slasher genre. A pretty solid cast makes this work fine. Neve Campbell (what's she doing nowadays?) is probably the best of the lot and she looks wonderful too. A crappy ending makes the movie a bit less entertaining but it's still fun to watch and well recommended both for those who know the horror genre well and beginners.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream to me is a great roller coaster ride. This movie manages to poke fun at all the horror movies that have gone before it, while still managing to be scary in it's own right.I felt the acting was actually fairly good and the scares came at a good pace.It also kept me guessing until the end. I can usually figure out who the killer is, but this movie kept me guessing.Spoilers ahead:My favorite scene has to be when the reporter and the cop are in the van watching the video feed of the party on a 30 second delay. They are watching one of the guys who has been enjoying his favorite horror flick. The guy in the house starts talking to the screen saying "he's right behind you" and, unbenknownced to him, the killer is right behind him. The people in the van start yelling at the screen "he's right behind you!!!"Classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not into scream the way so many are, meaning I can't remember it scene by scene nor do I have any interest in seeing it again but I liked the movie and got the premise which really was good. a horror within a horror-it was nice to see something that hadn't been done before and the cast was great as were some of the more memorable scenes and lines.But I still don't think scream was a perfect movie, there were at least 2 things I didn't like about it one being the amount of violence it featured. I realize that for the premise of the movie-some violence needs to be there but cmon-after awhile, it was a bit much, scream was more violent then many regualr horror films! I think the movie's best moments were diologe driven-the showy emphasis on all the gore was overdone and done for effect and ditracted from the whole movie in general. I also felt the ending was a bit ridiculous and unlike the plot in general there was nothing brillient about it, it seemed thrown together. I'm trying to do as honest a review as possible because so many either loved or hated this and I'm in between-I definetly did not love it, but moderatly enjoyed it and am glad I saw it. I think they could have stopped with one though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fairly big horror fan I put off seeing this one because I got tired of hearing the "best scary movie ever" chant and knew it couldn't live up to the hype. (Although anything with Barrymore, Cox, Arquette and Campbell is in it's self a scary proposition) As a spoof of slasher films it's pretty good at what it does, the acting isn't all that bad believe it or not and Craven, who's not my favorite, did a fairly good job. The tongue in cheek humour was good and I esp. liked the homage it gives to it's forefathers. Some great background music which probably lends itself to giving away the killer. On a scary scale however, it rates up there with "The Little Mermaid". Mostly it rehashed all the old slasher modus operandi and if you've seen a Craven film before you can tell when someone is going to get it. No suspense at all and it constantly resorts to the old "Pop Goes the Weasel" jump outs for it's frights. Also, it put out too many red herrings about who the actual killer is for my tastes.6/10 (because of some good lines and paying respects to Hitchcock but sadly no Phantasm or Romeros) but if you think this is the end-all-be-all of horror watch a few of the movies this one took from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven's Phenomenal Comeback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of teens are pitted against a masked murderer that tests their knowledge of horror movies.Can we admit that Neve Campbell is a terrible actress? She managed to get in all four "Scream" films, and "The Craft", and "Wild Things" and "Party of Five". She was a dominant force of the 1990s. But really, just admit it, she was the Kristen Stewart of the 1990s -- very wooden, not much range, and considered more appealing by studio executives than by actual viewers.But that criticism aside, this is a great film, and definitely among Wes Craven's best. He has had his great films and his less-than-great films. Some, frankly, we might want to forget. But this was so powerful, really added some wit to the slasher film, and for that we must respect the man. Wes Craven is the all-time greatest horror director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Using every slasher-movie cliché in the book, Scream's deadly, blood-drenched story of vengeance and madness worked, for the most part, because it took the time to actually laugh at itself.Featuring a very strong opening sequence ("Hello? Who's calling?") that literally sent shivers of terror running up &amp; down this viewer's spine (seriously), Scream certainly delivered the horrific goods in the course of its adrenaline-rush story.Competently directed by Wes Craven, I'd say that Scream and A Nightmare On Elm Street are 2 of this dude's best horror-movie offerings, to date. I can't believe that this movie actually spawned 3 inferior sequels.My 2 beefs about this film are - (1) The final sequence (which revealed who was behind these ghastly murders) was too dragged out and this seriously weakened the story's fever-pitch momentum.(2) Product placement of Chex cereal and Jiffy Pop popcorn lost this film some significant points.</fullReview>

Great slasher, funny, gory and scary, what more do need in a horror movie. I am going to give this movie 9 out 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you like scary movies? If so you're going to love SCREAM!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SCREAM has got to be one of the top one hundred greatest horror films of all time! The film starts off automatically, stripping away everything else &amp; getting straight to the heart of the matter, as we watch a beautiful teenage girl (DREW BARRYMORE) receive a mysterious phone call from whom she assumes to be someone who has made an error &amp; called her house by mistake, the caller seems nice enough, somewhat humorous, even charming, but when she hangs up, he calls again &amp; he manages to coax her into talking about horror movies, when he asks her name, she wants to know why he is interested, only for him to make the comment "Because I want to know who I am looking at"? when she calls him on it, he denies it &amp; when she threatens to hang up, he threatens her with death. In an even more terrifying moment, she discovers her boyfriend tied &amp; gagged out on the back porch, with the killer threatening to kill them both, if they answer wrong on his slasher movie trivia, naturally it being a horror film do you think she can get it right &amp; if they do, do you think he'll let them go? After both characters are brutally dispatched, SCREAM is able to move on from there &amp; were introduced to what is thankfully a surprisingly fresh, witty &amp; inventive, horror thriller! SCREAM is a true love letter to the slasher films of the 1980's &amp; calls them out on all the clichés. What is actually so memorable about the movie, is how in many ways it's a love offering, a valentine to slasher movies past, it embraces, mocks, skewers &amp; breaks the fourth wall on all the clichés we've come to expect from slasher movies before it &amp; since it's arrival. The after mentioned opener, is perhaps one of the best moments &amp; scariest openings to ever grace any horror film in slasher film history &amp; a real shining example, that while it heavily borrows many elements from it's slasher movie brethren, SCREAM isn't the same as all the rest, it's smart, it's sophisticated, it's loaded with irony, well executed moments of suspense, tension &amp; atmosphere, it's very well acted, sharply written, with fun characters, great dialogue, numerous in jokes &amp; the film is expertly directed, with film-maker WES CRAVEN able to milk out as much excitement &amp; mileage he can get, out of scaring the wits out of a horror audience, since it manages to keep on the edge of their seat, as they watch &amp; try to figure out who is the killer &amp; why &amp; that's another things that is so great about SCREAM, everyone is a suspect! The score by MARCO BELTRAMI is awesome &amp; the film boasts a very unique &amp; surprising twist ending &amp; does answer the question of how the killer is able to be in two, sometimes three places all at once. SCREAM is filled with memorable moments, both scary &amp; funny. Unlike the slasher films that came before it, SCREAM is set in a universe where horror films do indeed exist, with all the characters well aware of the do's &amp; don'ts in order to survive a potential slasher carnage. Pretty much every popular genre film is referenced throughout from Friday The 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Hellraiser, Evil Dead, I Spit On You're Grave, The Bad Seed, Silence Of The Lambs, Halloween (Williamson's biggest inspiration behind writing the film &amp; a film whose soundtrack he played in the background for the three days he was writing the script &amp; a film which plays in the back ground as all the carnage is going on at the party the kids are attending), Prom Night, Terror Train, The Howling, Candyman, Carrie, The Town That Dreaded Sundown, Frankenstein &amp; The Exorcist &amp; speaking of The Exorcist, LINDA BLAIR actually cameo's as a news reporter! heck even non horror moves are referenced including BASIC INSTINCT &amp; even CLUELESS! &amp; the film gives a well knowing nod to the original scream queen JAMIE LEE CURTIS. The biggest inspiration for SCREAM (aside from the slasher films mentioned) is PSYCHO, as the film swipes many ideas &amp; concepts from the film, like that film, the most memorable element taken is how we are introduced to a popular name actress (Barrymore) whom we will assume will survive until the end of the movie &amp; possibly become the heroine of the piece, only for her to get violently killed ten minutes into the film. There are other references to PSYCHO as well, as one of the leads last name is Loomis (The name of Marion Crane's boyfriend in PSYCHO &amp; the last name Of Michael Myers doctor in HALLOWEEN which was also inspired by PSYCHO). The films opening could also construed to be a nod to WHEN A STRANGER CALLS (1979) wherein a heroine sitting all by herself while babysitting received mysterious phone calls from a threatening assailant, which in itself is based on the popular urban legend. The film also doesn't skimp out on all the gory goodies fans have come to expect from the genre, as fans are treated to quite a few gory deaths, multiple stabbings, gutting, slit throats, electrocutions, that sort of thing, ironically enough, the one thing the film does skimp on is the nudity, which was so prevalent in almost all of the films mentioned. What's so funny is how despite knowing the rules of the slasher genre, the kids break them anyways &amp; the killer??...well he doesn't necessarily follow the rules either...In the end, you're not a real horror fan unless you've seen this film, at least once. Not surprisingly the films tremendous box office returns resulted in a TV series of the same name &amp; three sequels, starting with, SCREAM 2 **** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Scream (DVD 1996)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It actually took me 9 years to finally watch this slasher flick classic, and I'm now kicking my rear that I should've watched it when it premiered in local theatres back then. Credited as sparking off a slew of copycat slasher films in the late 90s, and reintroducing Wes Craven to a whole new generation, Scream will remain an important milestone for the horror-slasher genre.Starring a relatively young and unknown (then) cast, Drew Barrymore opens in what is probably the most recognizable start to a horror movie, with her demise after being caught in a cat-and-mouse telephone call with the primary killer in the movie, a psychopath who dons the Halloween "Scream" costume.That famous opening aside, Neve Campbell plays the main lead Sydney, a student who's now the new target of the killer. Given her complicated background of having her mom killed about a year ago, she is spooked by the fact that she could have sentenced the wrong killer to prison, and the real one is still out there, stalking her.As with slasher movies, her group of friends become suspects and cannon fodder for the killer. What works is that although the cast is huge, and almost everyone is a suspect! The film doesn't let off throwing at you the red herrings, making you wonder what could be, and if it is.Looking at the film, the killer is not the invulnerable being that always gets his prey. Here, he does get hit and attacked, which adds a totally new, believable dimension towards the instinct for survival. Also, there are tons of movie references which will keep every movie buff totally happy and jumping with glee at identifying them. I'd like the part where one of the characters laid down the 3 rules of horror films: Never have sex because only virgins survive, never smoke or drink, and never say "I'll be back", because you won't. Sort of summarizes every horror movie out there, doesn't it? And the ending totally rocks. The script is intelligent (for a horror-slasher movie), and will catch you off guard, if you haven't been reading anything to spoil the movie, after 9 long years.Sadly, this Code 3 DVD contains no extras besides the norm of scene selection and subtitles. Pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a classic horror movie, and thought it may not be one where the audience are scared to death, it still made it as one of my favourites, and believe me I've seen a lot. The downside to this film in my opinion was the fact that there is nearly no acknowledgement of Rose McGowan or her character Tatum on the cover of the VHS/DVD or in many of the trailers. She was, to me, one of the star characters of the film.The special effects aren't the best I've seen, though the blood looks real in parts, but certain deaths do look like they really could have happened. The fear factor isn't necessarily very good in this film, as I am a younger viewer, but didn't find myself freaking out after, or during, the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good parody of horror films?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This "horror" movie is set in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California, and tells how the young Sidney Prescott, a year after the brutal murder of his mother, is pursued by a mysterious psychopathic killer, masked with black clothes and a mask that looks like something out of a Munch painting. Directed by Wes Craven (who became famous with the franchise "Nightmare on Elm Street"), has a script by Kevin Williamson and includes Drew Barrymore, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette in the lead roles, playing respectively the young Casey, the protagonist Sidney, an ambitious reporter called Gale Weathers and the sheriff's deputy, Dewey.As audience, we are in doubt about what really is this film: if it is a mere horror movie then we are facing one of the worst: although some situational scares, the film does not scare anyone, on the contrary: the killer is bumbling, fumbling and spends at least half of the film playing with the phone and stumble around the stage. In turn, the victims are mostly young immature teenagers, so pathetic and mentally retarded that we come to the point of delighting us with their deaths. There is no terror, just false terror, and there is no suspense, only false suspense.If this movie isn't a horror movie but a teen film (perhaps one of the most indigestible film genres that exists), then they are on their favorite ground and I just wish, when they saw the sad end of the teenagers here, they decided to spend more lifetime devoting themselves to reading and developing their maturity.Finally, if this isn't a teen or horror movie, it can only be a comedy that seeks to parody both genders. And, if this is true, then this is a great film, which made us laugh from start to finish and ridicules, in a funny way, both film genres. The dialogs of the adolescents, seeking to theorize the "formulas" of horror films and how to survive in a horror movie, are particularly funny. It's quite possible that it was the Wes Craven's intention with this film, instead of making a conventional horror film. May have been ...?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream is a double-edged sword.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masked killer begins killing teenagers in the small town of Woodsboro. One young girl and her friends realise that as the number of deaths go up, to survive they must follow the rules or horror movies. One year after the death of Sidney Prescott's (Campbell) mother, two students turn up gutted. When a serial killer appears, Sidney begins to suspect whether her mother's death and the two new deaths are related. No one is safe, as the killer begins to pick everyone off one by one. Everyone's a suspect in this case. Roger Ebert wrote "Wes Craven's "Scream" violates one of the oldest rules in movie history: It's about characters who go to the movies. They've even heard of movie stars. They refer by name to Tom Cruise, Richard Gere, Jamie Lee Curtis. They analyze motivations ("Did Norman Bates have a motive? Did Hannibal Lecter have a reason for wanting to eat people?") True, they went to the movies in "The Last Picture Show" and the heroes of "Clerks" worked in a video store. Even Bonnie and Clyde went to the movies. But those movies were about the *act* of going to the movies. "Scream" is about *knowledge* of the movies: The characters in "Scream" are in a horror film, and because they've seen so many horror films, they know what to do, and what not to do. "Don't say 'I'll be right back,' "one kid advises a friend, "because whenever anybody says that, he's *never* right back." In a way, this movie was inevitable. A lot of modern film criticism involves "deconstruction" of movie plots. "Deconstruction" is an academic word. It means saying what everybody knows about the movies in words nobody can understand. "Scream" is self-deconstructing; it's like one of those cans that heats its own soup." The irony is, 'Scream' spawned dozens of imitators, and by spawning imitators, all the new avenues opened up by 'Scream' quickly got old and boring once more. Still, purely on its own merit, it's an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really smart horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) is alone at home and receives crank calls from a creep. Ghostface ends up killing her boyfriend Steve and Casey. It's a great start reminiscent of Psycho where the obvious lead is killed off. This is a horror that knows the history of horror and references it.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is a virgin despite the efforts of boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich). Sidney's mother had been killed a year earlier and she's alone with her father. Sidney put Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) in prison for the crime but he claims to be innocent. The next day, the sheriff with deputy Dewey (David Arquette) start interviewing the students. News reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) is on the case. Sidney and Billy gather with Tatum (Rose McGowan), Stuart (Matthew Lillard) and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) to discuss the murders. Then Ghostface calls Sidney.There is no doubt that Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson have come up with an interesting take on the slasher movie. It's not just about being more gruesome and bloodier. It's about being smarter. It's not the first one to be self-referencing. It is the one that built a movie around it. The teens are smart and aware. The beauty of this is that this movie is smart for a smart audience with smart characters. The only problem I have is the twisty nature of the reveals and the misdirections. There are quite a few of them and that part seems over-written. Of course, that is commented up by one of the characters and he's exactly right. The movie kind of lost me in that aspect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most unique teen slasher flick ever made, Scream is easily Wes Craven's best slasher movie. Starring Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Neve Campbell, and with a special appearance by Drew Barrymore, Scream has a well rounded cast. Despite a relatively simple plot, this film manages to captivate the audience with excellent acting and suspenseful, well-crafted scenes. This film may not be for everyone, as it does contain some strong violence and features mainly teenagers as the central characters. Scream expertly fuses slasher-horror genre, comedy and suspense thriller, which could have been a messy experience, but instead creates an exciting, enthralling movie that both revives and parodies the slasher genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a new killer on the loose who loves to terrorize teens!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film including the way the killer(Ghost-face)is killing these teenagers in such brutal ways. When some of the teens were turning around to see if Ghost-face was still following them, I was like "don't turn around, keep running, he's right behind you, run for it!" This film was great I loved the characters Sydney trying to figure out who is trying to kill her when the one she is dating is actually the killer who is blackmailing the real one, the true killer. I was afraid for Sydney when she had finally found out that the killer had killed her mom years ago. I was scared that she would suffer the same fate as her mother and her friends and schoolmates. I was surprised when Gale had shot her boyfriend who had nearly killed her with a gun and a knife. I thought of her as the hero and a savior who had saved Sydney and Dwey her soon would be boyfriend. I thought the film overall was great because you would never suspect a boyfriend close to someone who had seen her friends dying would be a killer. I really hope that there is a sequel to this film because if there is I am going to see it and hopefully write a review for it. I do hope that Sydney is going to finally get rid of anyone who killed her mom, because in the film it did say that she did die from stab wounds and blood loss, because I don't think that they had killed her. Maybe copycatting a similar death.</fullReview>

If you rate this a one then you probably don't like anything. If you are looking for a good scary movie that keeps you wandering what will happen then you should definitely watch Scream. You should also watch the others. Like I said, one of the best slashers I have ever seen. And don't say that I have poor taste or that this is the only slasher that I have seen.

Although, I see it as more of a murder mystery than anything, that doesn't make it less than enjoyable. My advice: Watch this movie alone or with many friends, and you're in for one heck of a ride! Although the movie has more gore than I expected, it focuses more on suspense, and having the viewer "on the edge of their seat" until the finale. Simply, I'll never forget this movie, and nothing came along that will ever replace it.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever Horror Comedy is Craven's Best Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Wes Craven delivers the best film of his career, based on a rather sly screenplay by Kevin Williamson, and boy did it pay off in 1996! "Scream" is the most sophisticated and well crafted work Craven has ever done, in terms of style, performances and, most of all, effective scares. The simple plot capitalizes on media influence to great effect, and the energetic script, not to mention the cast, brings what could have been a routine slasher to life with verve. A young girl (Neve Campbell of "Wild Things" and "Party of Five") named Sidney Prescott finds herself the main target of a psychotic slasher who appears to his victims wearing a Halloween ghost costume, tormenting them with sadistic phone calls before going in for the kill. Sidney, who has a tragic past involving the murder of her mother just a year before, is forced into a paranoid position of suspicion against everyone in her life. Aided by her best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) and bumbling deputy Dewey (David Arquette), Sidney also has to deal with the likes of such shady characters as bitchy reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) and affectionate boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich). As her friends are picked off one by one, Sidney realizes the psycho killer in question has been inspired by a long slew of slasher films, and many are mentioned throughout the film."Scream" wisely draws upon the rules established by earlier entries in the genre including "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th", a clever gimmick to let the audience know that the film itself is aware of its place as a teen oriented horror film, therefore throwing the viewer off guard with a good dose of turning the expected clichés upside down and injecting some real character development, so that we actually care about these kids before they start dying. Self referential humor aside, "Scream" still manages to be dreadfully scary, especially the harrowing opening scene in which a young girl receives several calls that she first assumes are from a harmless prankster but gradually begins to realize she's not safe in her own home. The actors are wonderful, especially Neve Campbell as the smarter than average heroine and Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers. You want these people to live and it's all the more thrilling when they come face to face with the killer.Williamson's script is chock full of references to other horror movies and unexpected twists, and Craven is at the top of his game, setting up the scares just right and keeping the mystery of who's behind the mask genuinely hard to solve until the surprise climax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream single-handedly resuscitated the teen slasher genre for the media-saturated 1990s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Scream a cine-literate serial killer stalks and murders a series of teenage girls. The film revitalized the slasher film genre in the late 1990s, similar to the impact Halloween (1978) had on late 1970s film, by using a standard concept with a tongue-in-cheek approach that combined straightforward scares with dialogue that satirized slasher film conventions.Scream is a 'meta' slasher film, and one which certainly knows whereof it shrieks, functioning as a superior example of the genre it's spoofing. The in-jokes will please fans; the only downside is that it's a little too pleased with itself. Following the film's success, two sequels were released in 1997 and 2000 respectively, and a third sequel is currently in production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of the greatest slasher series of all-time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Scream trilogy, the horror genre was brought back to life continuing the face of iconic fear. Wes Craven, as mentioned before, is the master of suspense. When Kevin Williamson's script was out on the prow, Craven was really the only proper choice to direct. His method of scaring the audience never fails. He has so much control over the three stories without the feeling of "over-directing". For many years, Freddy Kruger was hailed as Craven's masterpiece, this trilogy is now and will be his crowning achievement. Kevin Williamson wrote the original and the sequel, then Ehren Kruger came along to write the third when Williamson declined. However, Williamson basically outlined the story for Kruger, leaving the dialogue and details to Kruger. All three scripts are absolutely incredible and tantalizing original. The story grows as the series continues and it becomes more intricate. Now, it'd be tough to choose between the three, which is my favorite. But, I think as the story becomes more complicated, I was more intrigued, which may be the only factor to say the films get better as we go along. That aside, the three are so close together with quality, entertainment, suspense, and as films overall. It's difficult for a film trilogy to achieve that. Most times, sequels get worse, but here? No such thing.The thing that really separates Scream from the average film series besides the screenplay, the direction, the suspense level, the tech stuff, and the visuals is the acting. This is what I call true acting ensemble. The two dazzling standouts are Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox. What performances. Now, it's no surprise that Sidney, Gale, and Dewey are in all three films. So Campbell and Cox have to sustain their performances over three films. It's extraordinary. David Arquette, I'll check him off first. He is funny and dorky in the first two films. He really adds to the table in Scream 3. He finally "grows up" and isn't as insecure, which is a lovely thing to see.You see the actors grow and fall as their characters. Campbell really finds Sidney Prescott, the true essence of the character. Campbell does something tricky here. She shows us a girl who is in a horrible place in her life, who is strong and can make it in the world, but is also vulnerable and weak. It's tricky, but she pulls it off with grace. Sidney is this tormented young woman, and Campbell never shies away from that; how she can act with her eyes can simply not be put into words, it's that great. Courteney Cox is fierce as Gale Weathers. She leaves her comfy zone (the control freak Monica Geller on Friends). Cox steps up the dramatic work here, especially in Scream 2. The character Gale Weathers grows from being a "wannabe" b*tch, to being a successful and rub it in your face more of a b*tch. Then in Scream 3, she changes. After her true feelings for Dewey were revealed in Scream 2, Gale was tamed and not so much of the witch she once was. I've mentioned her dramatic work in Scream 2 a few times. It is simply the best of her career. In Scream 1, she was hinting that she had feelings for Dewey, but also hinting she was using him for information. In Scream 2, she finally lets lose and says 'I don't care," and gives in. Right as she confesses herself, the situation diminishes. Cox is so good in the scene where she is the sound room and sees Dewey being stabbed through the mirrors (to what she thought was his death). It's heartbreaking. Scream 1's acting was the most surprising. Mainly because with the horror genre you tend not to think, "Oh, I'm in for some great acting". It's stereotypical. After you see the first scene with Drew Barrymore, you'll be blown away; I was. She is so powerful in her one scene. She kind of pulls a Janet Leigh in Psycho. She was the biggest movie star, at the time, of the Scream cast. No one expected her to be the opening kill. Her acting isn't short of Leigh's either. For that scene to work, you needed an actor who could really hold his or her own and make it convincing. Drew was that actor. Skeet Ulrich plays effectively the infamous, Billy Loomis. Ulrich is spine chilling and creepy here, but does it with so much charisma.The Screams are also grand on the technical scale, too. The ghostface costume has become the most frightening, iconic horror film costume. It screams fear. The brilliance of it is, this mask wasn't made specifically for the film. I was a regular Halloween costume sold in stores everywhere. That's what makes it scarier. The great master, Wes Craven once said, "Something isn't scary unless people can identify with it and could possibly be in the same positions as the characters on the screen. The films also include a killer score and frightening sets (especially John Milton's house, where the climax of Scream 3 takes place).Bob Weinstein, the producers of the Scream trilogy, now demanded a fourth installment. Why? To make a few bucks? Scream fits perfectly as a trilogy, without any loose ends and had a wonderful ending filled with metaphors and a great chase scene. Williamson is back writing. Having him back on board with Craven directing and three survivors back gives me some comfort that it won't fail completely, but I'm scared for it's survival. Let's just hope for the best. Overall, without a doubt, the best trilogy ever made. My personal favorite films; they're fun, very scary, with excellent performances, writing and directing. What more could you want? The three easiest 10s I've ever given.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this film, I first saw it when I was 5 - with my brother. I did not find this movie scary then, so obviously, I don't now. But I think it's a really entertaining film and definitely worth watching. And I guess if you put yourself into the position of the characters, the film could be quite creepy and for people who plan on watching it, it will probably make you jump first time around The first scene is a good opening: A killer calls a young girl and eventually ends up killing her when her parents are meant to be visiting. In the end of the sequence we see her disembowelled on a tree.The ending sequence is also quite good, although the killers were suspected throughout the film, I think it kind of worked as they played the double bluff. (Made you think they were the killers which makes you think 'no they won't be' but in the end they actually are).So... despite it being an 18 and in the horror genre, I think this film is more a comedy with it's sort of 'cartoon violence' and funny moments.But... good film, watch it if you already haven't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about it? I have always loved horror movies and it would be extremely unfair not to regard this title as the one which brought this genre back from wherever it went in the late 80s and early 90s. The opening scene with Drew Barrymore is one of those moments which you can never get out of your mind... horror, blood, screams and much more horror. It is entertaining and frightening, it includes hundreds of meta-references -like much of what Kevin Williamson writes- and its characters are generally well-played. I really loved the female roles in the film -Neve Campbell's, Rose McGowan's, Courteney Cox's-, but Jamie Kennedy's and Skeet Ulrich's performances are also worth mentioning. David Arquette, however, seemed to overact, but it does not really matter with such an excellent cast standing by him.On the whole, I don't think I could ever get tired of watching this movie. I can't wait to see the new chapter -Scream 4-, but I'm pretty sure that it can never equal this one or, worse, I fear it can get to disappoint me. Despite this, "Scream" is exactly what the 90s needed. Teenagers -attractive cast- being chased by a masked, crazy killer amidst a very nice soundtrack. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, in a way, yet...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the take on horror films that drives this particular film series. A bit bloody at times but that is all part of why it works as a horror film. I see many of the other reviews for films and other people seem to write so much more than I do about any given film. I think there is something to say about movies but not a lot, in terms of films in general. Watching a horror film alone is a recipe for freaking yourself out, as if the world doesn't throw enough crap at you in general. Many newer horror films, including this one, all have something in common, they are all aimed at young audiences. That is to say the 16 to 18 crowd. I suppose it works from a monetary standpoint-younger people will spend on horror films more than people over 30, nonetheless, it relegates the horror genre into being Collegiate fair only, which I think narrows the field down considerably as to the subject matter dealt with in modern horror films. Films like The Hills Have Eyes are remakes of 1970's horror, which I think isn't really going forwards. Films like Rosemary's Baby are not made anymore, surprising given the crazy pits that many apartment buildings in big cities have become over the years. Go team go is an interesting rallying cry for the horror genre. Kind of a bit tedious perhaps. This is a not bad film, but I think that because I don't mind films that have a cast mostly all under 25. On the other hand, there is really nothing else out there to watch. Hobson's Choice is no choice at all. Same goes for the I Know What You Did Last Summer movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Wes Carpenter" Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The characters in Wes Craven's meta-fest are in a horror film, and since they've seen so many horror films, they know what to do, and what not to do. "Don't say 'I'll be right back,'" Jamie Kennedy cautions a friend, "because whenever anybody says that, he's never right back." In a way, this movie was unavoidable. A lot of modern film criticism concerns plot deconstruction. Kevin Williamson's script does this to itself, using conventional slasher procedure with an ironic combination of genuine scares with dialogue that satirizes slasher film customs: Rather than leaving it to the audience to expect the horror banalities, the characters discuss them candidly. "Horror movies are always about some big-breasted blonde who runs upstairs so the slasher can corner her," says a character in this reference-happy film. "I hate it when characters are that stupid." The movie starts with Drew Barrymore at home alone, naturally. She gets an abusive phone call. All in all, she gets the Janet Leigh Treatment. It's a dry run.Then, we meet another young woman. Her father has left for the weekend. Her mother was murdered . . . why, precisely a year ago tomorrow! Her boyfriend climbs in through the window. At high school, grapevine of cult killings spreads. The killer masquerades in a creepy Halloween costume. There are more phone calls, more attacks. The suspects include the boyfriend, the father, and a lot of other people. The Fonz as the high school principal is a likable little dash.All of that is the plot. This revitalizing tongue-in-cheek genre piece is not about the plot. It is about itself. That is to say, it is about characters who are aware they are in a plot. These characters read Fangoria magazine. They even use movie-style dialogue: "It's called subtlety! You should look it up!" or "I was attacked and nearly filleted last night." or "Life is like a movie. Only, you can't pick your genre." The heroine has been declining her boyfriend's advances, and as another character brings up, virgins are never victims in horror films. Just bad boys and girls get slashed to pieces. Understanding they're among the thick of a slasher plot, the characters talk about who could play them, Tori Spelling, a young Meg Ryan. The movie itself, for all of its unexpected in-jokes, also works as a horror movie, a bloody and gruesome one, that employs as many clichés as it parodies, usually the same ones. That is it's wittiest charm: By exposing the conventions of the genre, the audience expect something else to happen, but the film then plays by those very same conventions.One old linchpin is the scene where someone abruptly enters the frame, scaring the heroine, while a menacing musical chord stings. These scenes are ripe for parody, because the chord carries a theme of emergency, but in fact the surprising person is always an innocent friend, and although we can't see the newcomer because the framing is so tight, in the real world the scared person would naturally be able to see the newcomer all the time. Williamson is also educated about the way TV reporters are depicted in horror movies. The reporter this time, played by Courteney Cox, canvases delightful inquiries, such as "How does it feel to be almost brutally butchered? People have a right to know!" As dogged and crafty as she is, she still touts to a local deputy that they shouldn't drive to a remote country house when it's a nice night to walk down an unoccupied rural trail in the dark while a slasher is loose.As a cinephile, I liked it. I liked the in-jokes and the behavior-conscious characters. At the same time, I'm disappointed in how many audiences have been duped into taking it seriously. It is truly ironic that it indeed resuscitated the entire horror genre and spawned countless take-me-seriously imitations. Even fellow filmmakers made a franchise out of spoofing it, when it's already a spoof. It's the violence and the gore, which are plentiful and sometimes intense, that deliver on the same note as it would if it were a normal cash-in slasher. The key is that the graphic violence and gore are disarmed by the ironic way the film utilizes and annotates it. Craven and Williamson have their cake and eat it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Director Wes Cravens, who plays Fred the janitor at Woodsboro High School, craven attempt to make the ultimate teenage slasher film hits the bullseye with his 1996 smash hit "Scream" that has all the elements of every slasher movie known to man, or the movie audience, in it.Played along the lines of the 1978 horror thriller "Halloween" which is seen on TV all throughout the movie "Scream" has this masked psycho tearing up all of Woodsboro in pursuit of Sidney Prescott who for some reason he has it in for. The cues to the psychos maniacal hatred towards Sidney are many with the most obvious being that her deceased mom was up to something no good when she was brutally murdered a year ago. But as the movie goes on it becomes evident that all the movie, and Wes Craven, is trying to do is out do every teenage slasher film that proceeded it and does an excellent, and gory, job in doing it.We have such a diverse cast from a wild eyed Linda Blair paying an obnoxious and shrieking reporter as well as Henry ' The Fonz" Winkler as the strict disciplinarian principle Arthur Himbry, of Woodsboro High. It's in fact principle Himbry, together with about two dozen other Woodboro residents, who ends up being one of the Psycho's many victims in the movie. Himbry is attacked murdered as well as, thank God off screen, gutted and hung from the high school's football goalpost for sticking his nose where it shouldn't belong! The psycho killers business! The killing goes on at such a fast pace that you eventually don't seem to care anymore for those who get offed by the masked psycho in that they, like in almost every other teenage slasher films, are made to look, by their wild sex and drug parties, like they more then deserve what's coming to them.The ending sequence that takes some 15 minutes is so off the wall and ridicules that by then you get the feeling that you've been had by Director Wes Craven's attempt to out do the teenage slasher genre to the point where the film, despite the massive blood letting in it, is more of a comedy then a horror movie. All you have to really do in finding out who's to be killed or not to be killed in the film is to see who's either naughty, besides the psycho killer, or nice in it. With those being naughty, fooling around and getting high on booze or drugs, making up almost 98% of the, movie's cast members!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The brilliant second coming of the slasher flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that Wes Craven's Scream gave a solid re-birth to the slasher genre. In an age when Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street sequels had left even the most avid fans like myself kind of drained Scream came along and somehow added its own special twist. Sure it had a lot of the same ingredients but instead it took to poking fun of the generic slasher while still creating a very real one and leaving the pieces everyone loved in tact. Another thing Scream does is that it adds a human element to the horror slasher genre. The killer isn't supernatural in any way and is in fact a serial killer with a motive, and a mystery to be unraveled with a "everybody's a suspect" type game being played. Despite the lack of supernatural "Ghostface" easily became synonymous with other legendary hacker greats. Scream also doesn't particularly go out of its way to showcase unique and strange deaths like say Friday the 13th where there has been so many that they need to have smart deaths, Scream is about "Ghostface" stabbing his way through everyone in his way. One thing was for sure...Scream was only the beginning.Neve Campbell was in the height of her Party of Five days and was easily the next "It" girl although that never truly happened. Scream could also be nailed for bringing together a hot young Hollywood A-List or future A-List cast. Campbell is really the perfect scream queen lead role. She IS the embodiment of what Jamie Lee Curtis was for Halloween or Heather Langenkamp was for Nightmare on Elm Street. Sweet, smart, disturbed, haunted, a twisted past of sorts, Campbell is perfect. She is the girl next door but has a hero inside too. Courtney Cox Arquette (before she was Arquette) plays sleazy ambulance chasing reporter Gail Weathers, that really does have a heart of gold. This is almost a more serious role for Cox although her clumsy silly side shows through a little bit. David Arquette (her now husband) plays lovable loser Dewey. This is a great role for Arquette...defining in many ways. He is an everyman's hero, and despite his nerd like exterior, gets the girl, the bad guy, and goes out guns blazing. This is easily his best role but that isn't saying much really. Jamie Kennedy takes a step back from slapstick to play the smart, level headed movie buff Randy who pines for Sydney. I love Kennedy's character in this film and subsequent Scream films and I only wish he had a bigger role in the first installment. He is comedic relief but in a subtle way and a hero in other ways. Matthew Lillard and Skeet Ulrich I put together as sort of second string supporting characters. Neither of them really have a lead role but their presence is well known in the cast. Both are decent although I felt like Lillard's character lost some credibility at his sort of silly outbursts towards the end. He was one comedian in the film that seemed to be unable to let go of his slapstick antics. Also worth mentioning is a great cameo however brief by Henry Winkler, and the iconic opening scene featuring Drew Barrymore who does an outstanding job being terrorized. They also introduce Liev Schrieber in a small role that will become far more significant in the future.Wes Craven really single handedly brought the slasher genre back to reality. He put together an incredible cast with incredible chemistry that would hold together through 3 (soon to be 4? films.) The first Scream feels like an introduction to a bigger picture which as we know by the end of the trilogy is exactly true. Essentially especially for Campbell, Arquette and Cox Arquette he gave them what would be defining roles for them. Scream also coined defining iconic moments like Ghostface and "Do you like Scary Movies?" and "Hello Sydney." For horror buffs this is classic at its best. It is easily a must see film and is sure to delight, fright and even make you smile. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Than I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to see this because it has become a cultural icon. Having seen so many slasher movies, I decided long ago they just weren't very interesting. This is mainly because of the predictability that is presented in this film. Yes, that does make it gimmicky, but then it also makes it clever. Nothing is left out when it comes to violence. It's all there. Of course, there's about ten "jump out" scares and all the stereotypes. Still, it kept me going. There is layer upon layer of surprises and we actually do care somewhat about the people in the film. The mask must have been quite the thing when this first appeared. I still see them when I answer the door on Halloween. One nice thing is that, for the most part, now that I've seen all the classics of this form, and have seen this movie as well, I don't need to watch any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favourite Film..EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey, well i've seen so many films being a film fanatic but for me its got to be my favourite film of all. Horrors are so difficult to make, shown by the failures of so many horror films since and thats largely because Scream set the bar at a whole new level. The story is a who done-it within a idyllic little American town with a past story that has to be unravelled to get to who's responsible. The music is really memorable but it still is the ways in which people get killed that make it such a great horror. The characters are fantastic and although for me Sydney is probably the least charismatic and endearing, mind you her background probably made her that way, the star studded cast gives Scream characters that you feel like you could know. Scream is such a brilliant template for a horror and it has seldom been topped since and despite it being 13yrs old it still has bits in it that get you to flinch. Quality. Definitely doesn't feel as old as it is. Brilliant acting. Great Story and a great script. The greatest horror of all time but for me my favourite film of all tied with its sequel and the trilogy. 10/10</fullReview>

This film is easily one of my favourites after watching it since a young age, it was this film which led me down the path of film. The direction is superb, but my favourite factor of this film? The fact that it makes tribute to all the great horror films, Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th, I Spit on Your Grave, Prom Night... I could go on. Needless to say this film is simply amazing, not too gory or fake, and a perfect homage to every horror film out there. The character Randy I can perfectly relate to, and thanks to this film, I know the rules, and if ever I am unfortunately in the state of being attacked, I'll know what not to do. The storyline is also great, and the acting, well, in parts it's a little shaky, nonetheless this film is a clear 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingenious, manipulative thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From possibly the master of horror for this generation comes the ingenious, manipulative thriller, "Scream". An apt name for the best horror movie I have ever seen. This is actually the first Wes Craven movie I have really enjoyed. The "Nightmare on Elm Street" series did nothing for me, though perhaps that was because they took themselves too seriously. Craven not only scares us to death in "Scream", he sends himself and other horror films up brilliantly. Maybe a horror film cannot succeed without some comic element or a degree of self-parody. It's a theory.The cast do a great job as they work with Craven to tease us through this clever tale. Neve Campbell is the ideal victim, and Skeet Ulrich the perfect brooding boyfriend who is one of the early suspects, much to his chagrin. Courtney Cox plays the scheming journo super-bitch, and others such as Henry Winkler and Drew Barrymore drop by to add flavour to the proceedings.All credit though to Craven, who has reached the pinnacle of his genre with this effort. Having said that, many purists would probably claim that "Scream" is more thriller and less horror, and I would be the first to agree. But what of it, it's still a great flick.Saturday, July 18, 1998 - VideoOne of the most clever and original horrors ever made. This tongue-in-cheek send up of its own genre proved Wes Craven to be the horror-master of his generation. And it's scary too!Owes a lot to a great young cast and Craven's manipulative script.Sunday, April 4, 1999 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm gonna go out on a limb and say: best horror film.Yes, I said it. Combine gore of Friday the 13th, the disturbing phone calls from When A Stranger Calls and add in some comedy. The story is very exciting and it's fun to analyze the movie to see "who killed who" since the killer is two people.I think this story is very original though it has some similarities to other films. Now add in a grand cast and you've got a great horror flick. The realism is good too, they don't make the killer invincible. He can be knocked down, and he can be killed.Neve Campbell is the star and plays Sidney Prescott. Her mother was murdered nearly a year earlier and she thought Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) was responsible. She still can't get over it as the new killer seems to be linked somehow since when he calls Sid he mentions her mother.Skeet Ulrich plays Billy, Sid's boyfriend. Sid gets him arrested thinking Billy is responsible for the calls to her and all the other victims but when the phone company's info comes back, Billy is clean.Matthew Lillard plays the friend of them all and is dating Tatum, Sid's best friend. Matthew provides the most comedy with his lines and his ad-libbed lines. Combined with Jamie Kennedy they are the perfect comic relief.Drew Barrymore has a 12 minute opening scene as the introduction to the killer's appearance and first kill. Matthew Lillard (Stu) is seemingly the first suspect as he dated her before, but Tatum says that Stu and her were together when it happened.David Arquette plays Dewey Riley. He's the brother to Tatum and friends with Sid. He is also Deputy of the town of Woodsboro. He does a good job but throughout the series his character changes the most, I think.Finally, last but not least, Courteney Cox-Arquette plays Gale Weathers, a small town local reporter who is writing a book on Sid's mother's murder story. She is actually quite a sweet character as the series goes on but she has her bitter sides as well.All of them are very important to the overall movie. Their performances are all some of the best I've ever seen. If the award Best Ensemble Cast Performance was available, I'd give it to this movie for 1997's award show.Just about every scene has excitement, drama and comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Trilogy Ever hands Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many reasons to why Scream is the best horror trilogy, and movie out of any other Horror slasher film such as Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th, etc.1. Actually has a story, rather than just killing people, and stalking them like in most films.2. Always a different killer in the same costume in each film. Rather than it just being Michael Myers, and Jason in each sequel. Which is why the person who is causing the murders is a mystery.3. New Rules to abide by in order to survive through each film.Scream: 1996 ****/****This movie is the best in so many ways, you will want to watch it over and over if "Horror" is your favorite film genre. This film stars: David Arquette, Cortney Cox-Arquette, Matthew Liliard, Skeet Ulrich, Neve Campbell, and Jamie Kennedy. Directed By: Wes CravenWhere to begin. The actors are well casted, the story is brilliant, there are clever scenes, good jokes, and this movie will keep you at the edge of your seat trying to figure out the mystery killer. Plot: Scream is a film about a killer who has watched too many scary movies, and is now making his own real life horror film attacking High School Students from Woodsboro, CA. The target is Sidney Prescott (Campbell). Late one night, she has gotten a phone call by the killer who is able to see everything she is doing, and later tries to make a move to murder her, just like her mother who was killed a year before all these tragic events. Now, who can the killer be? Can it be Billy Loomis (Ulrich), Sidney's boyfriend, Randy Meeks (Kennedy) the geeky film genius, Deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette), the quiet sheriff of Woodsboro, Sidney's father, or Stewart Macher (Liliard) the goofy weirdo?I highly recommend this film to all horror fans, and for you to watch the whole trilogy. This film never gets old!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Post-modernism has never been so scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to become prejudiced against Scream: after all, it's the film that launched the career of Kevin Williamson, who has since been responsible for pathetic teen soap Dawson's Creek and rubbish werewolf pic Cursed, plus it provided the inspiration for countless dreadful imitators and the godawful Scary Movie slasher spoofs.But the fact is, when judged purely on its own merits, Scream proves to be excellent entertainment?an extremely well written and expertly directed horror that brilliantly integrates witty, post-modernist self parody with genuinely effective scares.An awesome opening sees arguably the film's biggest star, Drew Barrymore, being terrorised and brutally murdered by a killer wearing a mask fashioned after the famous Edvard Munch painting The Scream, after which director Wes Craven quickly introduces his main cast: Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott, a virginal teen traumatised by the murder of her slutty mother a year earlier; Johnny Depp-alike Skeet Ulrich as Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis; nipple-icious Rose McGowan, crazy Matthew Lillard, and nerdy Jamie Kennedy as close pals Tatum, Stuart and Randy; Courteney Cox as ambitious TV newswoman Gail Weathers; and David Arquette as dorky police deputy 'Dewey' Riley.Having established his array of characters, Craven then proceeds to scare the pants off his audience with a series of well orchestrated murders, interspersed by thrilling/amusing scenes in which people almost get murdered and wax lyrical about the 'rules of horror'. There's not a whole lot of gore to speak of, but the tension is kept high, and there's always the 'in-jokes' to keep viewers happy between kills.Along the way, Craven cleverly interweaves several plot threads, offers several possible candidates as the killer, and shows once again why he is a true 'Master of Horror'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rule number one: If you have not watched any of the 'Scary Movie' or 'Scream' series, watch 'Scream' first. Rule number two: Watch 'Scream 2' and maybe even 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' then you may safely move onto 'Scary Movie.' I've seen 'Scream' multiple times, but 'Scary Movie' ('Scream's spoof) many more times. It's hard not to laugh throughout this viewing of 'Scream' remembering the hilarious scene-by-scene, line-by-line mock-ups in 'Scary Movie.' That being said, I do remember my first reaction to this movie 13 years ago at its premiere. What a fantastic movie and though it's an homage to previous slasher films (there has to be six dozen references, names, scenes, innuendos in 'Scream') it really reinvented the genre, leading itself into multiple and extremely poor quality rip-offs. In fact, as this brought back the slasher horror and gave it more intelligence, it also brought it back crashing down, harder than before with the horrid carbon copies following. The movie starts with a bang, and the horror references begin early. You think you're watching a Drew Barrymore film, but quickly it shifts to main character Sidney and her group of friends who get picked off one-by-one while everyone's a suspect. Director Craven (loved him as the janitor) has definitely hits/misses (even see part 3 of this series) but his two most influential films ? of my generation, that is ? is 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and 'Scream.' While this one's not perfect, it's a real gem, with great comedy, homage, great acting, horror; 'Scream' was an excellent balance of all the right elements to horror-comedy and a perfect teen-night-out. Sure, it's now dated, and teens now probably need a little more (thanks, 'Saw' and other torture porn) but anyone growing up in the genre should appreciate this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of Screams Heard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scream", released in 1996, is a great horror film that stars Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox (now Cox-Arquette), David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Drew Berrymore, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, and others. This film pays homage to many horror film classics that many horror film fanatics never forget. Two sequels proceed. Its release started a new frenzy of horror film fans. It encouraged its audiences to watch the classics that influenced this film. This later became Wes Craven's highest grossing film to date. It received critical acclaim, including a consideration for an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay (which was overlooked). "Scream" desplicts a group of people in a town that is terrorized by a "serial killer" whose obsession with horror films goes too far. He, she, or they call the intended victim, alters their voice through a machine, flirts with them, threatens them, and attacks them. The police force's only lead to the killer's identity is a ghost mask. Sidney Prescott (Campbell) seems to be the main target to this killer. Does it connect to the brutal slaying of her mother a year before? Does the killer want revenge, or does the killer want to play copycat? Until the questions are answered, everybody is a suspect. And those who break any of the horror film rules become a target. Director Wes Craven certainly knows the true meaning of horror as he combines these films into this film, yet, fitting wonderfully. He doesn't spoof any of them. Rather, he creates his own horror film that is truly chilling. He occasionally includes non-horror projects that fit the film well, including "The Ricki Lake Show". Meanwhile, he adds the occasional teen humor that relates well to that age group. Despite branching off other horror films, his creativity is expressed greatly as in his past films. He takes the typical horror film traditions, mixes them, and makes them his own. He makes every chase scene a roller coaster ride, every suspicious scene suspenseful, and every bloody violent scene intense. Horror film commemorations include "Friday, the 13th", "Halloween", "Carrie", "The Exorcist", and his own "Nightmare On Elm Street". Wes Craven plays a cameo as the janitor "dressed as" Freddy Krueger. Through these various homage scenes, the main storyline of people being stalked by the killer is never distracted. Meanwhile, he gives this film its own legacy beyond the now-infamous ghost mask. While many other previous blockbuster films have tried paying homage to other films like it, this is the first that has succeeded in high quality. Through this storyline, the actors finely express the crutial points of the film that make it more entertaining. They scream wonderfully, they express their terror wonderfully, and they offer their own sense of humor through the perfect scenes. Campbell expresses the terrorizing theme the highest while stretching Jamie Lee Curtis's legacy as Laurie Strode from "Halloween". Cox and Arquette offer the sense of humor the most as an annoying news reporter and a police officer. The actor or actors who play the killer or the killers offer their terrorizing moments greatly that make their character or characters more chilling. "Scream" begins an unforgattable fine trilogy that will hold its position in film history for a long time. Those interested in this trilogy must watch this edition first. Otherwise, they will not understand the storyline. This will surely continue pleasing its audiences as it has since its release.</fullReview>

I still think they are fun to watch but you know what's going to happen. I still really liked it though because like my favorite scary film Halloween, it could be real. These people don't get shot in the face and wake up. When that does happen, it is meant as a joke. If you think about it, the Scream trilogy is a bit of a joke because they sort of make fun of other scary films. Like, saying"I'll be right back" is never a good thing to say because victims in movies usually go missing after that. They kind of make fun of that in this film. It's kind of funny. Scream has laughs, and for people who have never seen it before, scares. I really liked Scream, so I give it a thumbs up.Scream:***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream: A Parody Of The Slasher Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is always wrongfully called a horror movie. To be 100% truthful, Scream isn't a horror film by any means. Some Contemparary horror audiences might find Scream to be terrifying, but true horror fans can find the gimmicks and little laughs to make the film entertaining. Scream is not entertaining by the horror standard at all. I first seen Scream when I was fairly new to the horror genre, and I didn't find it to be suspenseful or scary by any means. It didn't even get to the graphic scenes until the very end. I couldn't exactly appreciate what this film was until I searched further in the horror genre, then I re-watched Scream, and found all of the parody moments.Scream was directed by Wes Craven, who is mainly known for directed A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and several exploitation films from the 70s (Last House on the Left (1972); Hills Have Eyes (1976)). However, Wes directed Scream several years after directed A New Nightmare, which would be the final installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. A New Nightmare basically took place in the real world outside the movies with the actors playing themselves. Scream basically works in the same way. It parodies the films that inspired it. For me, this film is a first rate comedy. I'm sure that some people will find this film to be absolutely terrifying in the last half an hour, but others will just find it to be guilty fun. Which category do you fall into? Well, when I referenced Last House on the Left (1972), did you know what film I was talking about? If so, this will seem like a pure comedy to you.While Scream IS a comedy, it still supplies some fun graphic scenes near the end of the film as well as some decent performances by the cast. The twist at the end was expected looking at the rest of the film, but was still nice to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people bash this movie for many reasons:Its a modern horror. Its got big name actors. It tells a story of itself.But, thats not how I see it. I'll admit the big name actors being present almost made me not want to see this movie, but when I saw that anyone could be killed at any time, I changed my mind. The story here is quite simple: a killer in a "ghost face" costume goes around killing teenagers. Seems too simple?Well, actually, its quite interesting. The teenagers are not stupid, horny junkies who do stupid stuff and get themselves killed. Well...mostly not anyway. The style of this movie is what made me enjoy is so much. One of the teens is the killer, and you sit there trying to guess who it is. Also, they refer to many past horror movies, and make it known that they are in what appears to be a "horror movie turned real".David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Skeet Ullrich, Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, and Jamie Kennedy all gave great performances. No cheesy "scare" acting involved.I recommend this movie to fans of crime and thriller. Horror fans may find this a bit difficult to watch, but give it a try anyway. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven resurrects the Slasher genre with one hell of a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror movie are considered by most bottom-of-the-ladder cinema. And let's face it, they have a point. The True Classics can be counted on one hand. A Nightmare On Elm Street is fantastic, Carrie is brilliant, but only a few other movies in the genre deserve to be mentioned in one breath with them. 'Scream' is definitely one of them, a scary movie with real scares, a more than decent soundtrack, acting that is of a very rare quality in the genre and a very surprising ending for a change. What makes the movie work on the level of believability is the nifty way it was written. By the characters' constant mentioning of real movies, you get the sense that the world they live in is in fact ours. Countless movies use this technique (Donnie Darko with Evil Dead for instance) and it works very well on a subconscious level.Another thing the movie has going for it, is the clichés. Craven actually embraces them and the film is filled with them on purpose. It actually ends with the ambulance and police cars shot, seen in countless action or horror movies.Many people who haven't seen the movie may assume 'Scream' is just the next over-hyped brainless pubescent cinema, but it's far from that. It's without a doubt the best of the rebirth wave of slasher movies of the mid -90's (although I liked 'I know What You Did' too), and can in no way be compared to the truckload of bad horror movies coming out every day still. The plot is original in all it's cliché-glory and the characters are relatively complex, the mask may be a little laughable but 'Scream' was never meant to be taken seriously. It's a homage to slasher movies, and the homage turned out to be better than almost all films of it's kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary flawed entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I do feel this is a classic. There are certain parts that annoy me. First here are the good parts. The opening scene with Drew Barrymore is terrifying. It is heart pounding with the scenery and the blue of the TV screen giving a eery light to the set. On another high note Drew's blonde wig is fabulous looking and it is a shame that she is killed off so early, but it does catch you off guard, similar to what Janet Leigh did in "Psycho." It is suspenseful and filled with exciting chase sequences and clever kills. With the exception of the first scene there is not too much gore which makes this a good movie for people who like suspense but not so much blood. The not yet married Courtney Cox and David Arquette offer comic relief as the lovable Gail and Dewey! Now the down side. The whole movie is supposed to be a tribute to horror films. "Halloween" is constantly referenced and Jaime Kennedy's character has an uncomfortable obsession with Jaime Lee Curtis. In the end the charchter's reveals their motives where to be like charchters in the movies. He references some of my favorite horror films such as "Halloween," "Friday the 13th," "Carrie," "Psycho," and "Silence of the Lambs." What is so bad about it is that they overdo it with the movie references. It gets to a point where it actually kills all those other movies for me. If I were to remake the movie that is the only thing I would do differently is not make such a big deal out of being a "tribute." Overall plenty of chills medium amounts of blood and a few laughs make this a worthwhile choice!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is pretty much the only horror film that hooks me every time I watch it. Scream is a true classic that everyone will enjoy, even people like me who don't usually like horror films. It doesn't have too much gore, pointless sex scenes, aka "torture porn" (ick) or whatever they are calling it these days. The only bad thing is that Drew Barrymore dies in the first 10-15 min but she is great even in that small part. All of the actors/actresses were great too...can't really complain about much. Scream is a fun movie to watch and thoroughly enjoyable. It's smart, at times very funny, and a suspenseful thriller...check it out!</fullReview>

I made a good decision.This film is one of the most original films of that last two decades. It takes a look at all of the horror/slasher clichés and says "we're gonna do something different here." The writing and acting are both great and, unless your friends have given it away, you won't see half of it coming from a mile away.Scream is a movie that no horror fan should go without seeing.

		<fullReview>Scream! Now this is a great movie. It may seem a bit weird but it has a really good plot, the way it's written is very good because it entertains you throughout the whole film and the speech is good; not "she died" more like "she got brutally murdered". If you buy it on DVD then, like me, you may get bored of it and like any film, you will watch it again and again and again! I seriously would say watch it people! Its on SKY MOVIES SCI-FI &amp; HORROR a lot lately. The actors are good in it. The plot is interesting. PLOT: Casey gets a mysterious phone call, she answers the phone all calm but THEN! a man says hello. She says hi, wondering who it is?. Casey (Drew Barrymore) says why do you want to know my name, then the mysterious man says "because I want to know who I'm looking at". Casey then kinda screams (hense the mane SCREAM). Anyway, the killer on the phone jumps through the window and then starts chasing her then she says arrrrrrg! Then she dies, she gets killed obviously, murdered (oh no!) Then strange things happen in the High School she goes to or should I say went to. If this makes you want to watch Scream then either wait to watch it on T.V or buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

The idea is fresh and exciting to watch and you just don't know until the very end who the killer or should i say killers are going to be. I loved the character of Randy, i think he is great and its also nice to see Courtney Cox play something other than Monica from Friends, and i have to say she plays Gail Weathers extremely well.

		<fullReview>Scream is my favorite scary movie of all time with it scary moments,and it's comedy moments,memorable characters which makes this movie a classic.The film is a about a killer who calls his victim first then eventually kills them.really he mostly focuses on teenagers and Sindey.Sindey is eventually confronted by the killer but survives.she at first she thinks it's her boyfriend but is found inconnent by police and now she must find the identify of killer before he kills her first.really this movie has a twisting plot really have you thinking who's the killer at first you think it's this person but it isn't or that person but isn't.and gets more interesting by the minute.as for the acting and the characters some really stand out than the others.The best characters in the film are Stu played by Matthew Lillard and Randy played by Jamie Kennedy.Stu is your everyday jokester who just really make the movie fun from all the seriousness and horror.with his jokes and funny attitude.Randy is a Scary movie nerd which makes his character odd and weird but funny.with his rules of how to survive a horror movie or his memorable "every one is a suspect" Scene which has you laughing.Neve Campbell who plays Sidney does a good job making her character believable and showing emotion in her character.David Arquette plays the dim-witted rookie police officer Dewey I mean he does a good job with the role but it's just the character that's stupid and very corny and some funny scenes.Skeet Ulrich who plays Billy Lommis at first he gives a bland performance in the beginning.But in the end he gives one of the best performance as the Psycho Killer.Courteney Cox who plays Gale Weathers the eavesdropping reporter who gives a good performance and this role fits her perfectly.she has some funny scene when she insults her cameraman for being so fat.as for the rest of the characters they all do a good job with what there given so I give props to Wes Craven for making this horror classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream is a modern teenage-horror-classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven's SCREAM quickly became a staple in modern horror history, the movie took everything we beloved from the 70ties slasher movies and turned it into a humoristic flick which contained just as much nerve and blood-spilling as its inspirations as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH. The teenage-setting of the 70ties movies may have been even more realistic, in a world where bad girls got punished by the killer for being naughty, and the "un-flowered-girls-will-be-killed" plot is just as intact here in SCREAM. The frights are dead-on, never being sloppy or clichéd, they are tightly directed killings that surely will get you blood pumping. Neve Campbell is great in the main role as Sydney, as she is the only one who truly manages to battle the killer (popular named "Ghostface"). And the movie was a groundbreaking take at the horror genre in the 90ties as the movie kick-started a bunch of teenage-slashers, making it a pioneer for exactly this genre for being both the first and being the best. SCREAM fits perfectly a Friday night with friends, as the movie is truly made for those teenage-gangs who're out for a fright, as it encounters them and faces them with its brutal slashing of themselves.</fullReview>

And if you like this movie, then Scary Movie makes a great parody of it and, to tell you the truth, makes you seem to like Scream even more. But don't take my word for it and see both of them yourself. If you want my opinion, it is the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. You definitely need to see it.

		<shortDescription>Horror had fallen until ' Scream ' came along.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is a 1996 horror film, directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. The film revitalised the slasher film genre in the mid 1990s, similar to what Halloween (1978) did for the 1970s, by using a standard concept with a tongue-in-cheek approach that successfully combined straightforward scares with dialogue that satirised slasher film conventions, (for example, the final girl). The film features many teen idols of the time, including; Neve Campbell, Drew Barrymore, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy, and in addition, Courteney Cox, David Arquette and Liev Schreiber.Scream became a major commercial success upon its release, and was one of the highest grossing films of 1996. It was also highly acclaimed by many critics worldwide, who appreciated the film's tongue-in-cheek approach. It got an 86% rating at rottentomatoes.com. As a result it spawned two sequels, Scream 2 and Scream 3.The film also provided the direct inspiration for the horror movie parody tetralogy, beginning with Scary Movie (2000)?which also became a box office success, spawning its own three sequels, as of 2007.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can I say?: My favorite movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream (1996) is one of the biggest, if not the biggest influence to the horror genre. Many people will mark the rating down just because it gave us a really bad decade of 90s teen slashers (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend). Don't blame a movie for that. Blame the producers for making the lame movies.I'm not saying that Scream (1996) is the best movie ever made. What I am saying is that it made a huge influence on the horror genre, and I find it one of those movies that I never get tired of. It was one of my childhood favorites, and I always have a hard time getting rid of those.The movie starts out with one of the strongest scenes in horror film history. I don't want to spoil anything, but that scene is something I can watch over and over again. It truly still scares me. The rest of the movie is the same way.Scream also launched the careers of a group of young stars that we probably wouldn't have today if it weren't for this movie. So if you want a really fun slasher movie, even if you're not a slasher fan, you may still enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parody at its apex.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie that so many people, including a reviewer on this very website, fail to properly comprehend or get, and one that I'm sure will be looked upon far more affectionately as the years pass. From beginning to end it's one huge tongue in cheek exploration into the conventions that follow and define the slasher movie genre. Never does it take itself as seriously as many of it's viewers do, and never does it lull you into taking it seriously as a plethora of overt clues (the big star death in the opening scene; the movie geek who predicts everything that happens before it actually does; the fumbling underdog who becomes an unlikely hero; the ridiculously overdrawn murder sequences etc) crop up throughout the film time and again just in case those pretentious little twits among us ever get the urge to place this alongside Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho," or something as equally outrageous. The habitual camera winks the script and the performers give and encourage (Particularly the brilliant Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy) are what sets this apart from many other feeble attempts within the genre and this arrogant form of film-making is probably what made many viewers misconstrue just what the film aims to do.Yes, this movie could be considered horror ("slasher" is the ridiculous term more commonly abused), but to pigeonhole as such is to do one of the 90's greatest parodies/black comedies an immense disservice. If I could hyperbole for a second: not since Shakespeare have comedy and tragedy met in such a dynamic concoction; and rarely has a film captured the imagination of the its viewers so firmly that it's actual premise and concept have been completely ignored and misinterpreted to a point where it has been taken far more seriously than the writers, the director and or the script ever intended it to. That's the beauty of this most wonderful film. So clever it hurts. In fact, it was so good, it still, to this day, continues to be taken seriously. Magnificence personified.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream is the best slasher i've ever seen. Not only is the acting phenomenal, but the amount of gore is what it should be. I hate it when there's just a little bit of gore, this one has more than the others. It is also very, very scary. Who wouldn't of been scared when Barrymore looks up and see's the Ghostface mask? And it wasn't a copy of any other movies, I don't get people who say it was a copycat of Friday the 13th, because it's not! No other movie before Scream was anything like it, and no one can argue with that. The amount of killing is also really good! It's not just like 2 kills like some of the new movies. It also is really hard to guess who it is. There are all these twists that keep you guessing. I recommend this movie to someone who wants gore and scares.</fullReview>

It's fun to watch and see the clues that we were given, and really should have paid attention to during the first time around (when viewing). This movie was pure genius.

		<shortDescription>Best slasher in years....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hands Down! Scream is a parody in itself filled with laughs and scares. The movie starts off in the very dark and atmospheric home where young innocent Casey Becker(Drew Barrymore) awaits her boyfriend's arrival. What she does not know is that he won't be coming at least not in the way she predicted.What I really LOVE about this scene is the suspense of the first scene. It actually ran chill bumps down my back. Drew was terrific in this scene and so was Roger's menacing voice. I also love the part where she can't talk but she's like 10 feet away from her parents. That's what movie creativity is all about my friends. On the sad side Drew ends up getting it, she gets it BAD and so does her boyfriend. I do believe this is one of the best opening scenes in horror movie history(behind Halloween and Black Christmas'74).Later in the film Sid now realizes that the guy who killed her mom is the same guy who took out Becker. Another thing I like about this movie are the characters. Never in my viewing of horror movies have I said "I like everyone in this movie". Tis true, Neve Campbell gave an amazing performance and was a great heroine. Skeet Ulrich was great as the red herring boyfriend. Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy added that comedy spice to this film that I love. Rose McGowan was terrific to as a hot best friend of Sid. Even the Kenny The Camera man was cool.I also enjoyed the very creative death applied to this such as Casey's and Tatum's garage death. The ending is still one of my favorite parts. I craved to know who was the killer in the Randy and Stu scene. Then we find out the killers. That's right there's more than one folks, it's Billy Loomis and Stu Macher. Billy Loomis was all ticked off because Sid's mother had an affair with his father causing his mother to abandon him. Stu Macher....well....Stu was just out of his mind. I like these two as a combo. I found Stu to be hilarious and Billy looks really psycho. I really like the Norman Bates line revealing Billy is the killer and I liked Stu's as well.Buy Scream on DVD. It has twists and turns that will leave you filling like you've just got off a roller-coaster after it's done.</fullReview>

Also, as a film fan, it's great when they both take a swipe at the genre they are working in, as they do here.Both men having great senses of humour, you just knew that when they came together, they would produce something pretty special. Special, in fact, doesn't do it justice. It is abso-flaming-lutely amazing! From the opening sequence, which hits you, like a well-aimed punch to the gut, right to the end, which leaves you wanting more, this movie is everything you could ever want from its genre. It's genuinely scary, evokes real sympathy for the frightened high school kids and is most definitely hilarious. This is one of, if not the best offering of its genre.If you love horror flicks and movies in general, or you just like a laugh, Scream is for you. In fact, its for everyone... Scream is pure gold.

		<fullReview>What a clever idea -- make a horror movie within a horror movie, complete with references to horror films of the past and even rules, said by one of the characters, of how to survive a typical slasher flick.The movie stars Neve Campbell, a high school student in a small California town whose mother was murdered a year ago. She, and others, begin to realize that there is a serial killer obsessed with scary movies and that she or some of her friends may be the next victims.Also starring in this horror movie/spoof are David Arquette, who plays the deputy, Courtney Cox (the future Mrs. David Arquette) as the aggressive tabloid journalist covering the killings, Skeet Ulrich as Campbell's boyfriend, and Rose McGowan as Campbell's best friend. With this talented cast, terrific direction by horror movie whiz Wes Craven, and a great script by Kevin Williamson, it's hard to go wrong with "Scream."Henry Winkler (of TV's "Happy Days" fame) has a cameo as Principal Himbry, and Wes Craven appears briefly as Fred the high school's janitor (he's wearing the same sweater as Freddy Kruegger in the "Nightmare on Elm Street" films.

		<shortDescription>My all time favorite movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven is a real genius! Scream is my totally favorite movie ever. Considering the year it was made, it was really original and really frightening. I bought the Ultimate Scream Collection last July and I was so happy since I had wanted to buy it years ago...Anyway, I think that the original Scream is better than Scream 2 and Scream 3, and it's not THAT unpredictable...although some parts kinda were... The way everything twists in the end is one of the things that I loved about this movie and I think I'll love until the day I die. Why will we talk about the classic (yeah, classic) introduction with Drew Barrymore's murder? THAT IS THE MOST FRIGHTENING OPENING SCENE EVER!!! I think that if you want to be really really scared with this movie, you have to watch it ALL ALONE. It's a great movie and it's still considered great, not just me, but millions of people and Scream fans around the world.I say go ahead and buy it or rent it or steal it, but you MUST watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Effective Horror Spoof, Manages To Make A Joke Out Of Every Horror Cliché and Still Remain A Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the last decade the painting "Scream" by Edvard Munch has become better known from the creation of what is now an infamous Halloween mask. The classic image of the white face stretched in a painful scream has become iconic for it's simple and yet un-nerving look. First thing that comes to mind for most people when they think of Scream is the "ghost face" mask and rightly so, it managed to create one of the perfect horror villains. The fact that throughout the film you never know the evil that is behind the simple mask and it makes it all the more brilliant.I feel guilty saying that I love this movie and yet I still feel I have every right to like it. On first glance I felt I'd been for the typical clichéd teen slasher movie, in which dumb teenagers get picked off one by one and still making sure there are two victims of the ordeal remaining to make room for a sequel. Of course the film does make room for its two-follow ups and still manages to reference another certain Wes Craven originated franchise that became an awful money making machine.The fact that "Scream" is a horror movie aimed at teens and it still manages to be fun and intelligent. The cast's chemistry is amusing and you can tell everybody had a lot of fun on set. The film's biggest star would be Courtney Cox who plays a highly entertaining and overwhelming character. Drew Barrymore also makes a small role for the infamous opening sequence, one of my favourite scenes. There is a certain moment in the 15-minute scene that stands out for proving the film's sarcastic, twisted and almost guilty comedy level. The moment is one where Drew Barrymore gets put in a tight spot and runs into the kitchen, the cliché joke (in what is actually a very tense scene) is that the kitchen table is empty apart from a box of kitchen knifes. Very sardonic humour, that you'll have to look out for and it certainly is honest in the way it studies the art of making a horror.I've never been a fan of Wes Craven, yet I think Scream proves that he can make a good movie when he puts his mind to it. After watching Scream, I've gained a newfound respect for the horror director. There's a scene in the high school that involves an excellent cameo from the director himself, so keep an eye out. The script is very clumsy, yet it somehow still manages to be perfect for the type of film Scream is. The fact that there is "rubbish" is Scream, still does not take away the fact it is an excellent film. The characters are likable and memorable which helps you to become involved in the film.The film's pacing is one that keeps you wanting to watch and always tricks you into thinking the killer is someone else and then when the thrilling finale comes to a close you'll certainly feel tricked. The whole last 30 minutes of the film are sure to keep you on the edge of your seat with suspense that even Hitchcock would take note to. The film's references to classic horror movies are certainly impressive and will please all the horror hounds out there. Scream is somewhat a mixture Halloween, but with a slight Carry On edge clinging on. The lighting and the music help create the tension for the crazy and darkly funny death sequences.Avoid Scary Movie which is a painful attempt to rip off the Scream franchise with a spoof attempt (as if they didn't realise Scream was a spoof). If you're looking for a movie that you hope will scare you, then don't watch Scream. But if you want an amusing horror movie, that is from it's roots and still manages to be original then look no further. Perfect to watch with a bunch of friends or just on your own for pure "sit back" entertainment value. Criminally underrated, don't feel guilty for loving it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSThis is, by far, the very best slasher film since Halloween. A very good plot and some of the best deaths ever. My personal favorite is Tatum Riley being crushed by the garage door. And there is of course Casey's When a Stranger Calls opening. This is actually one of the first slasher films that I saw with more than one survivor. This film also has some big stars. Henry Winkler as Principal Himbry. There is also Drew Barrymore as Casey, the girl that is gutted and hung in the opening. Overall, this is one of Wes Craven's finest work.9/10 Rec.

Wes Craven is a freaking genius I own all three screams and if I watch the first one I have to watch them all. I don't care what any one says about this movie I think its brilliant. To me this is the best movie ever created except for Superman of course. I know that not many people think its scary but the thing that makes its scary is that she trusted all of her friends and they just turn out too be crazy and the scary thing about that is that something like that could happen to anyone you never no who you can trust. I don't know its strange but something about that trilogy just does something to me. Its funny, and brilliant yet its scary in a way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is with those lines uttered by Skeet Ulrich as Billy Loomis that my life changed. Before this film I was just a casual movie watcher being only ten years old. The only films that had stirred my attention by this point were Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Star Wars, and Alien. Even though Alien was my first encounter with horror, Scream catapulted me into an obsession for the genre. Scream introduced me to so many franchises and pop culture phenoms that I was now an instant film buff after watching this film. Irented it no less than twenty times before my mother gained the good sense to buy it for me. After I owned it I had free reign to dissect the film. And dissect I did. I went through found all the quotes and references and then went on to find those films thus increasing my obsession for the genre. Thank you Wes Craven for many, many, many years of enjoyment. I now share this film with my little eight year old sister who her self is becoming a fan of horror. This movie is great, ten stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scream", released in 1996, is a great horror film that stars Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox (now Cox-Arquette), David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Drew Berrymore, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, and others. This film pays homage to many horror film classics that many horror film fanatics never forget. Two sequels proceed. Its release started a new frenzy of horror film fans. It encouraged its audiences to watch the classics that influenced this film. This later became Wes Craven's highest grossing film to date. It received critical acclaim, including a consideration for an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay (which was overlooked)."Scream" desplicts a group of people in a town that is terrorized by a "serial killer" whose obsession with horror films goes too far. He, she, or they call the intended victim, alters their voice through a machine, flirts with them, threatens them, and attacks them. The police force's only lead to the killer's identity is a ghost mask. Sidney Prescott (Campbell) seems to be the main target to this killer. Does it connect to the brutal slaying of her mother a year before? Does the killer want revenge, or does the killer want to play copycat? Until the questions are answered, everybody is a suspect. And those who break any of the horror film rules become a target.Director Wes Craven certainly knows the true meaning of horror as he combines these films into this film, yet, fitting wonderfully. He doesn't spoof any of them. Rather, he creates his own horror film that is truly chilling. He occasionally includes non-horror projects that fit the film well, including "The Ricki Lake Show". Meanwhile, he adds the occasional teen humor that relates well to that age group. Despite branching off other horror films, his creativity is expressed greatly as in his past films. He takes the typical horror film traditions, mixes them, and makes them his own. He makes every chase scene a roller coaster ride, every suspicious scene suspenseful, and every bloody violent scene intense.Horror film commemorations include "Friday, the 13th", "Halloween", "Carrie", "The Exorcist", and his own "Nightmare On Elm Street". Wes Craven plays a cameo as the janitor "dressed as" Freddy Krueger. Through these various homage scenes, the main storyline of people being stalked by the killer is never distracted. Meanwhile, he gives this film its own legacy beyond the now-infamous ghost mask. While many other previous blockbuster films have tried paying homage to other films like it, this is the first that has succeeded in high quality.Through this storyline, the actors finely express the crutial points of the film that make it more entertaining. They scream wonderfully, they express their terror wonderfully, and they offer their own sense of humor through the perfect scenes. Campbell expresses the terrorizing theme the highest while stretching Jamie Lee Curtis's legacy as Laurie Strode from "Halloween". Cox and Arquette offer the sense of humor the most as an annoying news reporter and a police officer. The actor or actors who play the killer or the killers offer their terrorizing moments greatly that make their character or characters more chilling."Scream" begins an unforgattable fine trilogy that will hold its position in film history for a long time. Those interested in this trilogy must watch this edition first. Otherwise, they will not understand the storyline. This will surely continue pleasing its audiences as it has since its release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream. Don't shout. Scream for Scream, the revival of the cliché, the slasher. As I stood in the middle of my room examining the commercial, I thought: Not another slasher. As I stood in my room, a good 2 weeks later, examining the final act, I thought: Not another slasher. Scream is a great movie in almost every respect. A good sense of parody to Horror clichés from the unquestioned master of horror Craven, and a good sense of suspense and fright to couple it.Scream will keep you on the edge, and perhaps a bit after. Rated R for several scenes of suggested sex, and language and bloody violence throughout. Not recommended for 10 and below.10/10. Period.</fullReview>

You think you know who it is, but once you get certain of who it is, the movie will violently prove you wrong. Wes Craven hasn't made another horror classic or anything, but it is a nice cult classic.WARNING: The second movie is 'ok' but not worth it. fun for a few viewings.The third isn't even worth looking at.

		<fullReview>A quiet, peaceful town in California becomes dangerous after the raping and slaying of Mrs. Prescott, mother of teenage daughter Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbelle), occurs. Almost a year later, 2 of Sidney's classmates (Drew Barrymore and Kevin Patrick Walls) are found dead and gutted where everybody in the town is a suspect including Sidney's best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan), her brother budding cop Dewy (David Arquette), Tatum's joking boyfriend Stu (Matthew Lilard) and geeky Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy). After Sidney is attacked and manages to escape, Sideny's boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich) seems to be the prime suspect. A local bitchy tabloid reporter, Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) is on the case to find out who the killer is. She tells Sidney that it could possibly be the same man that killed her mom one year earlier. But when Billy is proved innocent, a confused and upset Sidney tries to find who really is causing all the past murders and soon to come murders.This film has chills, thrills and laughs. Courtney Cox, Neve Cambell, Drew Barrymore, and especially Rose McGowan all look stunning. I do not know what happened to Neve Cambell's career but it looks like it is going to be back on track. The men in the movie all do excellent work. If you see this movie at the video store rent, No wait BUY IT!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's have a joke on horror's behalf.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Prescott is a high school girl still coming to terms of her mother's murder over a year ago. But things get worst in Woodsboro when a couple of high school students are knocked off and even more so for Sid when a masked killer who loves their scary movies sets their sights on her with some threatening phone calls. Sidney survives the first attempt at her life with the police deciding to keep an eye on her and looking at the many possible suspects. Which range from her out-of-town father to her sex depraved boyfriend. Also the media circus has arrived, led Gail Weathers, which she and Sid don't have too much of a good relationship.The horror boom of the mid 90s is thanks largely to Craven's memorably, refreshing, but post-modern slasher flick "Scream". I notice this film really divides the horror fans. People either loathe it or like it, well I fit in the latter half. I'm a fan of the flick since it added something new to the dying sub-genre. Although, most of it imitators were painful, but "Scream" is miles ahead of those inferior rehashes. What sets it out from most of the artificial slashers is that it's exciting and it has brains. Kevin Williamson's cerebral script parodies the whole slasher set-up remarkably well in a self-aware attitude by exploring the rules that flood these type of films. The way he works in the inventive twists around the usual horror devices only enhances the film's originality and engrossing interplay. While, the gallant script might be cluttered with plenty of in-jokes and horror references. The character's also come to the party with rich details and strong persona's that seem real, which makes you really wanna see them get through. Humour wise it hits it off, but that's not discarding the highly suspenseful thrills. Like that of the well-staged opening that actually frightens and horrifies. Craven not only delivers some hacked up teens, but just like in he did in his "New Nightmare (1994)" film he plays around with plenty of horror techniques and themes in such a convincing fashion that it's unpredictably intense. Clues and hints are displayed with flair and the alarming amount of red herrings make the mystery even more enjoyable. The characters just seem more rational in their actions since they themselves know the vital rules of slasher flicks, which gives the film more of an urgency and this makes it harder to figure just who'll get out and who will not. The actors on board all put in solid performances with some being more exceptional than others, but at least there was a dynamic chemistry between them all. Neve Campbell nails down her role as the emotional wreak Sidney Prescott. Courtney Cox goes against the grain as the venomous TV reporter Gail Weathers. David Arquette manages to raise some chuckles as the dopey Deputy Dewey. But more so the buoyant Jamie Kennedy gets the laughs with the most interesting character - the horror movie geek Randy Meeks. Mathew Lillard generates a lot fun, Skeet Ulrich is perfect as the shady boyfriend and Rose McGowan gives the film the bite with her cunning remarks. There's also some small amusing roles from Drew Barrymore and Henry Winkler. If you looking for some blood you shouldn't be disappointed as there's a fine build up and a good quota of it. Working with that element is the fitting sound effects which are crisply effective, like that of the knife swishing through the air. An atmospherically, suspenseful score by Marco Beltrami pierces the flick and the mellow soundtrack is rather well assembled in depicting the mood. Especially that of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' haunting tune "Red Right Hand". Another factor to set itself out was that of Mark Irwin's well displayed camera-work that lifted off the screen with many prominent shots. Craven keeps it fast moving and Williamson's script makes sure that it delivers a successful outing that works to it's strengths with flying colours."Scream" is a nice gruesome mix of irony and violence that started up the craze for mainstream horror again and turned horror conventions upside down.</fullReview>

It's sarcastic humor, extreme gore factor, and creepiness combined make Scream one of the best, if not, the best horror movies of all time. It's strong ensemble, probably the best ever in a horror movie, consisting of Neve Campbell, Rose McGowan, Skeet ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and drew barrymore all bring out their characters in an unbelievable way (considering horror is not a genre known for its great acting) The script written by Kevin williamson is probably one of the best parts of the movie especially the sarcastic humor as it refers to other movies of the genre and the suspenseful and witty dialogue undoubtfully along with the great acting. Let's not forget suspense master wes Craven, who pretty much created the death scenes and shocking violent movies that truly made this movie one to be remembered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>people who are waiting for that certain horror movie the great twist, a good cast, and an awesome script, wait no longer, for SCREAM is the movie you have been searching for. It starts off with a chilling opening scene with now famous actress Drew Barrymore and her character's boyfriend(spoilers) getting killed by a psychopath in the "Ghostface Killer" costume, and builds up with more clever scenes from there on. Overall,SCREAM is a great horror movie with a great ending twist, a good script, and well-done acting. I give this modern pop-culture filled masterpiece a 10 out of 10. You should also check out it's cool (but not as good) sequels. They're a scream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great scary movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a not so ordinary movie from the '90s! Remember I know what you did last summer, Halloween and those horrors! Scream is nothing like that; Scream is a nice horror flick to watch over and over again.*SPOILERS* But, I should tell you that if you haven't seen Scream yet, and want to watch Scary Movie 1, you should first watch Scream, because than you won't be able to scream without laughing in every scene.Scream is a movie for all generations, my mom even watched it, and I saw the first movie when I was 8 or 9.The actors are great. In what movie can you watch Courtney Cox as a cocky reporter, Or David Arquette as a clumsy cop, or Rose McGowan as Sidneys best friend! The characters are really great: Gale Weathers- a cocky reporter that will do just about anything to get a story! Tatum Riley little sister of Dewey Riley(David Arquette) is portrayed by Rose McGowan and is perfect in this movie. Dewey Riley the cop and a good friend of Sidneys.It has an expected twist at the end.All out of all, I'd give this movie 10 out of 10... One of my favorite movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Desensitization, on a couple of levels - but really only the most painful, and superficial. The plot concerns Billy (Ulrich/Depp - could have sworn it was Johnny Depp, or Johnny Depp playing James Dean - I don't know - Ulrich probably gets a lot of that) and Stu's acting out their obsession with horror films, shared by friend Randy, who is not quite as far gone as Billy and Stu. It's Columbine, 1999, in effect; although other school shootings took place before and since the release of this movie for Christmas 1996 (according to IMDb). Like those real life killers, this movie tries to portray real life killers of its own who have lost their sense of self, from whatever personal grief and problems, to the horror film genre. They now consider real life to be a movie, but perhaps just without all the horror/slasher film 'rules' that Randy would place on it.Williamson, in the trailer/documentary, says that a horror movie, particularly the 'slasher' film I would guess, is therapeutic and a good emotional release. Bates didn't really kill anyone in Psycho. It was just a movie. It's always just a movie. Movies never encourage actions or influence real life. Oh - of course. Laugh, scream and hold each other tight. It does at least encourage that. But the problem with Scream is that it's a movie about . . movies. The characters actually discuss the corn syrup blood. And right after that, they expect the audience to believe that's not corn syrup and sound effects in the next scene. (It was the problem in the adventure/comedy with Tim Allen about space aliens - one minute, in the studio, next minute it's supposed to be real? why? walk us through it, Mr. director) And if the whole thing is phony, and seen as phony, and known to be, and so much of it is telegraphed, if there's no real expectation that the audience will suspend their disbelief, but rather sit in the director's chair behind the lights spouting clichés and watching the cameraman, then I think it bothers me. It's a depiction of what's supposed to be, in some way, a murder conspiracy involving two vicious serial killers. And yet it's played for . . laughs, for entertainment. It's a bit lazy. It's no Hitchcock. And that wasn't the subtext in Psycho, either; or in Silence of the Lambs, for that matter. The excuse, here, would be that because it's not real, these aren't political prisoners fed to the lions in the arena, for example. Murder can be entertainment, when it's fake. Just so it's not that sort of murder. This isn't Auschwitz. The actors are not wearing stars. It cannot desensitize.Well, golly, sure it can. If some say this film doesn't cause one to identify with the killers, possibly they're wrong. The killers not only see life as a film. They see themselves as part of the cast. But because this is a wink at movies, and the horror/slasher film specifically, the audience sees the killers as actors in a film, and literally as part of the cast - as they playact at random human slaughter, discussing horror movies, all the while. It's real. It's not. It's all in good fun, as the obviously fake bodies, and scenarios, hang around and goof around, and lay around until they pop up again as if at a Halloween haunt at the local amusement park. No one dies. There is no death. As the killers basically say - life is just as unreal as a movie.Looked at another way, the plot is simple, as Randy says is a hard and fast rule. But it's not a rule, in . . other horror classics, apart from the exploitation flicks they take care to mention. This film is sloppy. And the 'cleverness' is meant to disguise that failing. Silence of the Lambs was simple, in a way - but not stupid. Scream is not supposed to be Airplane '1996', either. And yet it has more in common with that sort of thing, or with a Wayans Bros. comedy, than Silence of the Lambs. The opening scene, with Drew Barrymore, plays like a fiction, from the start. You expect to zoom out to see people in a theatre, or that the protagonist is merely writing a novel (and that is briefly the suggestion in the following scene). The film gets off to a bad start just trying to establish that these murders were part of the protagonist's reality. And it gets more confusing, in scene after scene. And what exactly . . is . . the point of the father - who just gets tossed in, perhaps as the embodiment of yet another horror flick 'rule'? He goes crazy and kills half the town? That's the killer's plan to frame him? And so on.A movie within a movie doesn't seem to work for just any film. It might work in an old musical. It might work as some annoying flashback (which are often overdone). But if that, rather than the killer pair, is the real gimmick of this movie, then a movie long joke about whether it is or it isn't fails simply because everyone knows it . . . isn't (and can remember the cost of the ticket/vid/DVD). Maybe, in that light, it's therapeutic (for potential serial killers)? I don't know. Maybe it's just sick. Maybe it's a depiction of a certain disturbed, homicidal, lunatic geek fringe, and not intended to be a suggestion for behavior even to same? It's creepy on so many levels. Maybe the same audience would appreciate, 'SAW II'. I just don't know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doomed to mediocrity by its own merits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to give Kevin Williamson credit. His attempt to revive a dead genre is entertaining, but any script - even an intelligent one like Williamson's - that is based on parody and smack-you-in-the-face horror film references is by definition unoriginal. I admit I enjoyed patting myself on the back during various parts of the film for understanding the winks and nods, but as I became more focused on catching the script's sub-references I inevitably became less interested in the plot and its characters. I know that it's supposed to be a fun, don't-take-me-too-seriously kinda movie, but I just thought it could've been better. Especially since the film started out with such promise. The opening scene with Drew Barrymore is slasher cinema at its best. Young girl, home alone, cue creepy phone caller, etc. The best way to instill fear in filmgoers is to make them believe that IT could happen to them, and it was easy to empathize with Drew as she became a prisoner in her own house to someone she couldn't see. The rest of the scene while not perfect (I thought it would've worked fine without the boyfriend's involvement) is a testament to Barrymore's acting ability. In five minutes she was able to make me care whether or not she survived the scene, which of course she doesn't (the scene's end in particular was one of the best parts of the movie).Unfortunately, though, that scene was director Wes Craven's only highlight. The rest of the movie devolves from a horror flick with potential into a Franken-film made up of slasher clichés that are supposed to be rendered fresh simply because the script is self-aware. And I have to say it just bugs me that Wes repeatedly has the killer chasing a victim from inches away at high speed only to be thwarted, oftentimes temporarily, by some sort of Keystone Koppish maneuver. Totally unnecessary and totally not scary. Even more so if it was a conscious attempt to parody chase scenes from earlier films.If you're a fan of slasher films then this movie is a must-see just so you can feel good about your knowledge of the genre and its conventions. If you're looking to be scared, however, then stick to the classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sucks, if your from the ages of 10 to 18 I'm sure you love it,because todays teenagers don't have a clue about good filmaking.Halloween,TheExorcist,Alien,The Omen,Carrie now these movies are classics,and moreimportantly these films are smart on so many different levels.The acting andfresh story lines as well as the amazing soundtracks in these older classics are timeless and often used by film students to study filmaking,Scream on the other hand has nothing to study, there's not even a mood or style to a film like this,The acting is horrible the two killers who try to be cute and funny are just plain annoying. Movies today like Scream and I know what you did last summer arejust tongue and cheek copycats of the true well made horror classics of the 60s and 70s.Scream and its followers give the genre a bad name.Everything inthese movies is fluff,with quick jumpy editing,no original music composedexcept for maybe some bad rap music or headbanger music,no art direction nomood,no real characters developed.Which leaves the young audiences today tonot think for themselves or have any imagination,also the blood and gore in this film is just plain cheesy!My advice to a lot of these kids watching is when you get a bit older and have some knowledge of film,go and watch the classics and learn something about true film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS INCLUDES SPOILERS!!Scream! AHHH!! This was a great movie due in large part to the director. Wes Craven who is probably the best horror director of our time!! Another part why this is a great movie is the cast. Neve Campbell is the star. Co- Starring is David Arquette, Courtney Cox Arquette, Steve Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, and Drew Barrymore.The plot of the movie centrals around a group of high schoolers who are getting hacked up one by one. It is a great mystery because you have to figure out which of the friends is the killer or is there two killers??In the beginning we met Casey Becker, played by Drew Barrymore, who keeps getting phone calls from an unidentified caller. When the call goes awry, she gets scared and tries to call the police but a phone call interrupts her. It is the killer. Long story short he breaks in and kills her.The rest of the movie is a big mystery to figure out whodunit? Many plot twists keep you guessing. Bottom line as the carnage develops don't trust anyone... no matter what!!Cast: 8.3/10A-/A+++ Direction: 8.9/10 A/A+++ Score: 8.0/10 B+/A+++ Plot: 9.0/10 A/A+++ Costume Design: 8.5/10 A-/A+++ Set: 9.5/10 A+/A+++ Script: 9.5/10 A+/A+++ Special Effects: 9.658/10.0 A+/A+++</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler When I first saw this movie, I wasn't scared because I was not alone. Scream is in my opinion, a must see, but not alone, kind of movie. Neve Cambell did a good job as far as the screaming sounding real, but as far as fitting the part as Sidney Prescott, i did not think she did a great job. This Scream was definitely better than Scream 2 and 3. Scream 2 was awful and Scream three was good, but did not have the horror I was impressed with in the first. David Arquette did an awesome job as Dewey, and Courtney Cox was good as far as acting, but...in my opinion...even better in looks. I also like the way Tatem died. I would have thought though, that if she stepped on the lazer for the garage door, It would have opened back up and she could have ran. Scream is a horror movie I could watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK... better than what we have today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scream" was OK and somewhat scary, considering the fact that every "Horror" movie out today is either not worth it or is just "funny", not "scary".There were some parts in the movie that were sort of stupid... before the party, how does the killer get into the grocery store and watch Sid and Tatum?... without being seen. And when Sid shoots the killer in the very end, right after Randy says he will get up for one last scare... the way he gets up doesn't even look close to him wanting to kill somebody.The cast was perfect for the parts. Neve was great at playing Sidney.The killer is pretty easy to identify in the middle and at the party in the end. For one thing, after Tatum dies, Billy comes running from the side of the house... the same side the garage is on. And Stu does tell Tatum to go get him a beer in the garage... hmmmm. I wonder.The first 10 minutes and the last 25 are the best. And the bathroom scene in the school is pretty good, too. Check "Scream" out instead of "Halloween: Resurrection". Way better results.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SCREAM interrupted the eternal rest of the slasher genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong I like slashers; in fact it's the genre of which I've seen more movies. SCREAM is a slasher, but I don't stand that it's said to be the best horror movie of the 90's. Not even one of the most original slashers.GIME ME A BREAK! SCREAM failed to be better than the slashers from the 80's (the main inspiration for this movie. Fans of the movie say that SCREAM brought the genre to the 90's! they actually think that SCREAM is the basis for the new horror films. Technically SCREAM made the genre because it stormed the box office on it's release year. Well how sad is that, this movie is just the maximum expression of horror mediocrity. It came out of time where the genre was dead, Mr. Craven tried to bring it to life just because he needed some bucks. Don't get me wrong I'm a Craven fan, I enjoy watching LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, or even the ANOES series. As a die hard slasher fan I'm sure that other fans agree that SCREAM ruined a possible return to the slashers. It wasn't the right time to resurrect the genre.I mean this movie tried to copy some slasher icons like Friday the 13th, Halloween, or even He Knows You're Alone (mm in part 2). The result was a lame spoof to this horror gems. Fans of the SCREAM series (I mean people who are new to the genre) should watch the films that SCREAM references to, then they can have an idea of what a good horror movie should be. Trust me, comparing SCREAM to the mentioned films will totally change your mind about it.This movie is not scary, it's not interesting, it may have some gory deaths which is the intention of any slasher, and maybe it has some good character development but overall it's a lame horror movie. The acting is somewhat good, too bad that these actors had lame characters. The mystery of who the killer is is something we've seen long before, and the killer himself it's laughable. Arguments such like "the movie meant to parody slshers from the 80's - early 90's" just don't work, this movie tried to point that those movies were lame and that really p****s the die hard fans of the genre. In summary I'd say that it's sad that the new generations will place SCREAM in the throne of the best horror movie of their generation, that's a place that belongs to Friday the 13th, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, HALLOWEEN, ANOES, ETC. and others that in fact changed something in the genre. The fact that SCREAM came in the mid 90's does't mean that it's the best horror movie of the 90's, you can't forget the horror masterpieces from the 70's and 80's, they are no longer vigent but they are watchable. They may be forgotten, but they are still there defending their position against the new horror cinema trash.SCREAM didn't generate a single contribution to the genre. SCREAM can't be compared in any way as some people try to with good and memorable horror movies , if you want slasher gems. I just want to point that the genre didn't need any addition. It's OK if new horror and slashers come out, I mean a dead genre still generates new ideas; but please give credit to the movies that inspirated SCREAM don't give this movie the credit that obviously it stole form others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ok film...for horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I have to admit that I am not a fan of the horror genre, there are a few that I really like, but for the most part...not a fan. With that said, let me get on with the review.I thought "Scream" was an ok film, it had a lot of good things going for it, but there were a few things that just didn't sit well with me. Overall, I thought the story was actually pretty good and quite suspenseful. The comedy was also just spectacular in the film. The best character (hands-down, no contest) in the film is Randy (played by Jamie Kennedy)! His character and the way he says things totally made the movie for me.Alone with Jamie Kennedy, the rest of the cast was pretty good as well. Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Skeet Ulrich, Neve Campbell, Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, Drew Barrymore, and Henry Winkler all did great jobs with their characters.Like I mentioned earlier, the story is actually pretty good in this film. The only complaint that I have is that there are a number of murders and killings that take place in the film that are completely useless (I guess that defines a horror film). For instance, it is never explained why the killer kills Drew Barrymore and what she has to do with the entire story....maybe that's cause she DOESN'T!!! I just don't like that they always seem to throw in a killing here and there that have nothing to do with the story, just an excuse to have another gruesome death scene. Oh well, you can't win them all. There were a few other problems I had with the film here and there, but nothing I can't deal with.If you like horror films, and especially if you like teen-slasher films, then you should definitely see this film. If you are like me, and just like the occasional horror film, then you may also want to check out this film. If you do see the film, I hope you enjoy it. Thanks for reading.-Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one that started the teen movie boom of the late 90's and was the basis for the most successful horror movie series in history. The film is about a teenage girl (Neve Campbell) that is still suffering from the murder of her mom. Exactly one year later, teens in the community are being killed by a ghost faced killer who quizzes his victims on their horror movie trivia via a cell phone and his main target appears to be Campbell. Fast paced, exciting, and very scary horror film with enough in-jokes and humor to keep you entertained from start to finish. Campbell is especially appealing and Skeet Ulrich is very creepy. The opening sequence is amongest the best in horror cinema history.Rated R; Extreme Violence, Sexual Situations, and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This horror flick has killers who kill per horror film conventions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream is a rarity: a horror movie spoof that succeeds almost as well at provoking scares as laughs. That's because director Wes Craven in addition to having a genuine affection for the genre, understands how wildly improbable and easy to lampoon it is. And, with Scream, he skewers it at every corner, using self-referential humor and a flood of in-jokes (some subtle, some obvious).In a way, this movie was inevitable. A lot of modern film criticism involves ``deconstruction'' of movie plots. ``Deconstruction'' is an academic word. It means saying what everybody knows about the movies in words nobody can understand. ``Scream'' is self-deconstructing; it's like one of those cans that heats its own soup.But this movie is not just a horror film. The self-referential tone of the movie allows us to step back from the horror. Also, the presence of detectives and inquisitive characters focuses our attention away from fear and toward curiosity. We can stop the killing if we can only unmask the killer.For those who know horror movies, the self-referential tone provides some funny moments when characters point out the "rules" of a horror movie, mention director Wes Craven, or comment on what would be happening "if this were a movie."And, for those looking for a good scare, Scream is an excellent choice. The mask the killer uses (which appears to be derived from Munch's "The Scream") is really quite frightening. The killer is more human than in most horror films, and therefore more terrifying. He is not invisible, but he is only seen in a quick flash. His advantage is not supernatural power - victims can lash out against him and have some effect - his advantage is surprise and fear. The killer's humanity and thus his potential vulnerability makes him all the more frightening, and makes us all the more tense for his next victim.MESSAGE - Horror films may breed copycat killings.Conclusion: This is a modern type of heart-thrilling horror movies and it really does scare you who are not a real fans of horror movies. I rate this movie as a good movie and it is also a good way to thrill the audience. So it realy does had a very strong effects on the thrilling part. I rate it 3,5/5. But for the story of the movie I rate it as a fair story. Great score for a movie like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie...EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I have a problem and I can't help myself. I've watched it over a hundred times, I've memorised to entire script, I dream about it and make sure everyone within a ten-mile radius of me has seen it. I admit it-I'm addicted to Scream.Everything about this movie is genius. The extravagant death scenes, the witty humour and the ?on-the-edge-of-your-seat' excitement, all add up to make the greatest slasher movie of all time. In my opinion, Wes Craven should be crowned and made King of the World. He created the classic Nightmare On Elm Street and then went and conquered the horror genre once again with Scream. Combining his incredible directing and Kevin Williamson's expert writing, Scream was sure to be a winner right from the beginning.I think I'll side with the majority and say that my favourite scene is Casey Becker's part. With, once again, brilliant acting from Drew Barrymore, she manages to get away with such a long dying scene without it getting tedious.But it's not just the brilliant direction, writing and effects that make Scream so good, every one of the actors deliver a professional and convincing performance. Jamie Kennedy's movie geek Randy Meeks was particularly good. Also Neve Campbell's character was one of the few leading women in scary movies, that didn't make you want to slap her.I could fill a whole website with good things about Scream, but I won't. Instead I'll just say-GO SEE IT! It'll be one of the best movies you've ever seen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't imagine that so many viewers love this one and consider "Scream" as the best horror movie of the 90's,a cult classic etc.The intro,when Drew Barrymore and her boyfriend are murdered,is actually pretty creepy,but Kevin Williamson obviously ripped off some ideas from "Black Christmas" and "When a Stranger Calls".There are some bad points about "Scream" for example not enough gore-the climax is violent enough,but the rest of the film is relatively gore-free;no suspense whatsoever-there are some shocks,but I wasn't scared;the film is also too funny,I prefer watching dark,disturbing horror movies.On a plus side expect several great lines("If they'd watch Prom Night they'd save time")and tons of references to older horror flicks("Halloween","Friday the 13th","Prom Night","A Nightmare on Elm Street","Terror Train","The Town That Dreaded Sundown","Hellraiser","Evil Dead" and even "I Spit on Your Grave"-all these movies are actually better than "Scream").OK,for mainstream audiences this one is enjoyable and fun to watch,but certainly it is not a masterpiece.By the way,the character of Randy is my favourite.He simply rules!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when I stepped into the theatre to see this film, it had been praised as a masterpiece and the greatest horror film in the nineties (which it's NOT, if you ask me). I was in a good mood while leaving the theatre, having been very entertained throughout the film. The events in the film actually managed to surprise me, and when the killer/killers was/were unmasked, it was proven to me that my guesses were completely off track. I did not however think that it was a masterpiece, for one reason mainly. The point of a horror film is to be scary, and this one wasn't. I have three criterias for a great horror film, and for it to be okay it has to pass atleast one, they are: Scary, Exciting and Entertaining. I found the film to be highly entertaining, somewhat exciting in places, but not scary. But two out of three ain't bad. The actors are okay, the cinematography is slick and good, so's the editing, but the music, AAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!! It's utter and total crap! CRAP!!! Okay, now that that's out of my system, perhaps I can continue with some more thoughts on the film. A lot of people say that the film owes a lot to "Halloween", which may be a valid point, but the film this one mainly reminds me of is "Black Christmas", just think about it, the phone calls, the hiding places and all. Plus it's a who dunnit. You've probably already seen it, but in case you haven't, then give it a try, you'll probably find it very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't argue that this is the movie that brought the horror genre back. But with this as a "teaser", it isn't hard to see why there is so many horrible horror movies out lately. This is what was good about Scream: 1) The old horror movie references 2) Fonzie. That's about it. This is far from a great horror movie. In fact it is quite bad. I have little respect for "sell out" horror such as this that tries to somehow redeem value by putting big stars in it. For example, Drew Barrymore was in the movie for 3 seconds and she was on the cover. The movie suffered highly from the 90210 syndrome. Neve Campbell was a Golden Girl compared to the age of the character she played. And Predictable? Oh yeah. Especially for a old horror movie buff like me. Not to spoil the ending (there's not much to spoil, trust me), but I narrowed it down to the two freakiest guys in the movie and VOILA, it turned out to be them. Big surprise. The parody in this movie was horribly done. Instead of poking fun at other horror flicks, it only poked fun at itself. If you want to watch a good horror parody, watch Comedy of Terrors. You may even stay awake, which is more than you will do in this excrement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the worst excuses for a horror/suspense movie I have ever seen. If you want to watch a real horror film watch: Night Of The Living Dead, Dawn Of The Dead, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Lucio Fulci's Zombie, The Evil Dead, The Phantasm series, Eaten Alive, Maniac, or e-mail me and I can tell you many more. Scream sucked. I watched it with a friend and my brother. We all had the killer figured out early into the movie. I cannot belive this movie is called violent or gory. If you want to see gory watch the girl puke up her guts in "the gates of hell". If you want to see a bunch of trendy teen agers then watch this but if you want to watch a horror film, then don't watch scream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW........ this movie was brilliant, it was the most mysterious horror movie that I have ever seen, it kept me wondering who actually was the killer, but then something happened to throw me off track,and I was not expecting it when the killer was actually revealed. I was disappointed at the fact that they killed off one of the best characters , well one of the best female characters anyway.If you think this is a stupid waste of time and it is just the same as any other horror movie, and that it is just "some stupid killer who stalks some big breasted girl who can`t act who is always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door" well then you will get a phone call......and here`s my advice if this does happen....Don`t answer the phone, Don`t open the door, Don`t try to escape......This is basically a very very good horror movie, that puts Horror into an all new perspective for that genre, and like Billy says......."life is just one long movie".Also check out the cameo appearance by the great Wes Craven himself.........this is a top class movieIt gets a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream would earn a C+ in my book. I will admit I kept guessing who it was, because Williamson creates so many possibilities. But when was a horror movie supposed to be funny? If I'm watching a horror movie, I'm watching it to get scared, not to laugh. That is were Scream fails. There is absolutely no mood of scariness. Unlike Halloween ( which this movie tries living off), there is no creepy music or set-up of suspense. After the part when Drew Barrymore gets killed, there's no suspense. It's like a comedy where people get murdered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The slasher film that started it all (again)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 'slasher' film, i.e. a killer stalking a selection of dippy American teenagers, had kind of gone out of fashion in the late eighties. Therefore, the early nineties were a barren place for masked nutjobs wielding knives. Then Scream came along.It's about a young girl, seemingly destined to spend the entire film being stalked by a masked killer who despatches her peers in many different knife-related ways. Nothing particularly unusual there, but don't let the basic nature of the plot put you off. There is definitely more to this than meets the eye.It not only revitalised the 'slasher genre' but it also was the first of such films to poke fun at the whole genre in itself. If you've ever found yourself yelling at the 'dumb blonde' on the screen to run the right way and not straight back into the serial killer's clutches then this is the film for you. It uses the horror clichés to the max and takes great pleasure in, not only pointing them out, but dispelling them.However, Scream wasn't just hugely successful because it poked fun at the genre. It was also a damn good mystery. With other similar films, the killer was normally quite obvious, i.e. the big disfigured bloke in a mask, wielding a chainsaw. But in Scream, pretty much every character is a suspect. The only time you can really rule them out is when they end up the wrong end of the killer's knife.If you love horror then you've probably already seen it. If you haven't... watch it now. The only downside you might find is that it was so successful that there were almost an infinite number of (nowhere near as good) copies. However, Scream is the original and BEST. It's fun, gory, well-written with great characters. What more could you want if you like scary movies?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No shocker and not even a leg shaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a good friend of mine introduced me this flick as a "classic" of the horror genre I thought he was actually joking. I had never watched this movie because it seemed rather bad and stereotypical to me and when my friend convinced me to give it a try and when I heard that a new fourth part has come out I opened my mind and watched the whole trilogy. The first movie was actually about as bad as I expected.I mean there are tons of great horror movies out there to get discovered like the classics "Nosferatu", "The mummy" and "The Amityville Horror" to only mention a few or even more recent stuff like "Jeepers Creepers", "My little eye" "5150 Elm Street" or the more exotic stuff like "Marebito", "Infection" or "Two sisters" without talking about legendary and eerie series like "Twin Peaks", "X Files" or "Millenium". But the Scream trilogy is amongst the worst stuff I have ever seen. Even other overrated and popular stuff like "I know what you did last summer", "Final destination" or "Resident Evil" is fairly better executed. I really don't know why this fairly overrated American slasher crap and fast food cinema is actually so popular. Even the parodies of this movie in the "Scary Movie" series are more intriguing than the original.Well, the movie is at least very entertaining and you tend to watch it until the end to know who is the murderer. I must admit that I bet on the wrong guy and that the ending quite surprised me but when I thought that I finally found a positive point, the final conclusion is so superficial and ridiculous that the surprise factor is already erased once again. This movie is simply made to entertain and switch your brain off and from that point of view, you get an average junk food flick but I really ask myself why there are already three follow ups of this mediocre movie until now.I know that the movie itself parodies some horror movie flicks and doesn't take itself too serious and I really laughed a few times but the path between humour and ridiculous dumbness is very small in this movie. The dialogues are horrible, the acting is mostly wooden and distant, the scarface killer rushes into every opened door like a retarded fool and is simply embarrassing, the killing scenes are quite predictable and as soon as an intriguing and suspenseful atmosphere is established, a stupid comedy scene scraps it all. The movie doesn't seem to know if it rather tends to be a parody, a suspense or a horror flick and tries desperately to be all of this at the same time. That creates a potpourri that seems at least interesting and fresh for the first third of the movie but the originality factor is simply used after a while and neither the characters nor the scenario nor the overall atmosphere are able to grip me and keep me hanging on for the last two thirds.This movie is simply made to be watched as a teenager with a couple of friends and some beers. It's a fast food party movie but for any horror movie or suspense flick maniac, this movie may be of a very low interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By now, you've probably heard what "Scream" is about (or seen it). So, I'll just discuss a few aspects of it. It was filmed partly in Santa Rosa, California. Another movie filmed there was Alfred Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt", and "Peanuts" creator Charles Schulz lived there. What a trio! Also, who would have predicted that we'd see Fonzie get butchered?! Yep, Henry Winkler appears as the principal. But probably the best scene has the characters discussing the rules for surviving a slasher movie: 1) you can never have sex; 2) you can never drink or use drugs (an extension of #1); 3) the most important is that you can never say "I'll be right back." Overall, this is one cool movie. Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette and the rest of the cast have a great time with the material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like scary movies, then you'll love this homage to them from director Wes Craven (The Hills Have Eyes (original), A Nightmare on Elm Street). It begins with the great opening with Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) having a phone call from an unknown caller (voiced by Roger Jackson) that grips you with the words "What's your favourite scary movie", and of course "I wanna know who I'm looking at", and ends with her being gutted from the tree swing. Then it moves to the key story in the town of Woodsboro where young Sidney Precott (Neve Campbell) is. A year ago, in a day's time, her mother Maureen was raped and murdered, and after getting a call from the killer herself she is under close watch by her suspicious boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan), news reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) and young police Deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette). It soon turns into a curfew as the cops search for the killer, "Ghostface", and the final scenes take place at a house party with more victims taken out, and deadly revelations. Also starring the humorous Jamie Kennedy as Randy, Liev Schreiber as a brief Cotton Weary, Henry Winkler as Principal Arthur Himbry and look out for The Exorcist's Linda Blair and Craven himself. What makes this a great horror film is not only the comedy elements, but the inter-textual references, i.e. the characters talking about horror films, and they are in one. To be honest, I only knew of and wanted to see it because I saw the spoof in Scary Movie before it, and turned out to be a brilliant horror comedy. It was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersThe secret of "Scream" is that its characters know they are in a horror movie. "Life is just one big movie," one character says, right before a masked figure walks into the room and slashes him to pieces.I like movies that spoof the film industry. But I like films that spoof the notion of awareness even more. The characters in "Scream" are not making fun of horror movies, but rather they are aware that they are in one. And that's what makes it tick. Because if it took itself seriously, it would just be another stupid horror movie. It starts with a young girl (Drew Barrymore) alone, inside a house, when the phone rings. She picks it up and on the other end is a voice that strangely resembles Kiefer Sutherland in "Phone Booth."Then we arrive in Woodsboro, a small, peaceful little town in the middle of nowhere. I am reminded of the town slogan in "Back to the Future": "A nice place to live." Woodsboro seems like a nice place to live, one of those, "If you lived here, you'd be home already!" places. Sidney (Neve Campbell) lives in Woodsboro. Today is the one-year anniversary of her mother's death, so she decides to go to a party with a bunch of drunken teens to celebrate - out of remorse, of course. At the party are a bunch of stoned idiots, but amongst them is Randy (Jamie Kennedy), a kid who knows everything about horror movies. "There are certain rules one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie!" he says. "You can never have sex. You can't drink or do drugs. Never say, 'I'll be right back,' because you'll never come back." He knows all the tricks of a horror movie and how it works. He even knows when the apparently dead killer is going to come back for one last scare.Meanwhile, a cloaked killer starts to kill off the teens at the party. Now he's coming after Sidney. The deputy of the town, Dewey (David Arquette), stumbles around tracing down various clues while the party goes on. A news reporter, Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox [Arquette]) joins him and they fall into a ditch and kiss. Aw, how sweet. However, as a character from "The Terminator" once said, "Nice night for a walk, eh?" Probably not."Scream" is revolutionary in more than a few ways. This is one of the only films I've ever seen where the characters in the movie actually speak of other movies, and the actors from the movies. Now people have gone to see movies in movies before, they've even discussed false movies, but in "Scream" they talk about *real* movies. For example, Randy is watching "Halloween" on TV and even starts talking about the first time Jamie Lee Curtis appeared nude in "Trading Places" (1983). His assumption is that she did not die in "Halloween" because by the rules of horror films, virgins do not die.There's even references to Norman Bates and Hannibal Lector at the end of the film. One character, in a crazed stupor, turns around and says, "'We all go a little crazy sometimes.' Anthony Perkins, 'Psycho.'"There's a lot of blood in this movie. I liked it. It kind of adds a diabolical side to the film. People even stab each other to make it look like they've been attacked by a killer. I can't really say why or how this happens as it will ruin the movie, but let me just say when it happens, and the people are stabbing each other, the way and manner in which they do so is startling and quite sickening. It added a nice balance of darkness and humor to the movie. Bleeding and dying, a killer asks another character, "Did you really call the police? My parents are gonna be so mad at me."I like movies that do this. I like movies where characters are aware of things. But "Scream" pushes past all boundaries and makes its characters so aware it's almost like watching real footage of real people. I really liked this. It would have been great to give Randy his own film where he could state all the different rules and cliches of horror films. But, if you've seen the second film, then I guess you know that it's too late to do that.4/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Craven's "A Nightmare on Elm Street" series had run its course by 1996 and he needed some new material. While horror films rarely become creative, Craven decided to poke fun at the genre that he helped to make famous by the mid-1980s with "Scream". This is a silly slasher flick, but it knows what it is and does not try to get cute with crazed gimmicks. A town falls under siege as the teens start to be murdered by a person dressed in what is little more than a Halloween costume. Naturally the cops are no help (most notably David Arquette) and the media turns the whole thing into a gigantic circus (with Courtney Cox leading the way). Teens Neve Campbell, Drew Barrymore, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard all try to figure out who the bad guy might be, but in the end twists and turns will occur that will surprise some and leave others feeling a bit empty. "Scream" is not a bad film for the genre. In fact it is a near masterpiece compared to the "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th" series of films. Craven, who struck gold with the original "A Nightmare on Elm Street", nearly accomplishes what he did some 12 years earlier when he revolutionized a sub-par cinematic group of films. "Scream" works better as a parody than an actual horror flick and its influence would lead to lesser films by other film-makers. 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never understood why this movie got such great reviews...it was a ok horror spoof, but not a great horror movie. In fact, in my opinion this made a mockery of the horror genre. Because of this movie, a ton of horrible 'teen horror' movies hit the scene. Those awful "I Know What You Did Last Summer" movies come to mind. Yes, many horror movies in the '80s &amp; '90s were basically the same, which was good. That was what the viewer wanted, so why change? Apparently genre great Wes Craven felt the need to attract a younger audience...so he got rid of teh horror &amp; threw in pretty faces with humor. I'd write a review of this movie, but it's just a spoof of horror flicks, with so-so humor thrown in. I didn't care for this movie too much; but it was better than the two sequels. Hopefully Wes Craven will go back to the horror movies that he is used to making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is it trying to be?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After everybody else on the planet had seen this movie, I felt I should give it a try too. My decision came too late and I had to rent it on tape.Well the experience at the theaters would probably have been the same. There were a few parts where I jumped but aside from that, nothing really stood out about this movie.Scream tried to be a mystery in a way since the villain was never revealed to the audience until the very end. In most horror movies, the audience gets a third person perspective that's privy to almost everything. So Scream doesn't do that and therefore, it's a bit like a mystery. But the storyline never gave the audience enough information. When the movie finally reveals the killer, I got the feeling I was cheated since I probably would have been able to figure it out had the movie given more info. The motive the killer gave really sounded tacked on too.Scream also tried to be a horror movie but it got its' thrills through cheap ways (like loud and sudden noises). Nothing about the movie itself was really scary. There was gore, but that's not scary. Scream's stuff doesn't make you spooked from bumps in the night.So Scream isn't a horror movie, and it's not a mystery movie. I think it's more a drama but the vague character development (everything we learned about the main character's past was pretty much from the last 15 mins of the movie in the killer's big ending speech) doesn't qualify it for that. This movie gets low marks in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think slashers are boring. They are neither funny, nor frightening, but this one is almost an exception to this rule. Why "almost"? Because its not frightening. It's funny, mainly because of Randy. Randy and Dewey are the only characters that I didn't hate in this movie. Randy is funny and Dewey is pretty friendly. The others are all jerks that you hope will get killed in the most horrible way and never be heard of anymore, and that INCLUDES Neve Campbell. I have to admit it's hard to like a movie when you hate the hero. But the most annoying character is the one played by Rose McGowan. She is incredibly stupid. A real walking stereotype. The kind of character I absolutely hate. So, it's even harder to love a movie when you hate both the hero and her best friend... Annoying characters are bad in slasher, since you are supposed to like the characters being hunted down and fear for them, not hope they get killed, chopped down in pieces and die in the most horrible way you can imagine. Well, that is the way I felt during the whole movie, except when Dewey and Randy were in trouble. Some jokes about the "rules" when you are in a slasher are funny(and pretty realistic). But, I never screamed... It's not frightening! THIS IS NOT AN HORROR MOVIE!!! THIS IS A SLASHER!!! Horror movies leave a strange feeling, gives you the creep, have a lasting effect. Slashers go for cheap surprises(killer coming out of the closet, jumping from the roof, etc...). Maybe Scream is, in a way, an horror comedy, since it makes fun of slashers. But if it is, then it could never compete with the kings of horror comedies: Dead Alive(a.k.a. Braindead) and Evil Dead 2. So let's just say it is the king of cheap teen slashers. It is the best of the collection of bad movies that can be found in this category, but that doesn't make it a good movie. It's also better than the horrible sequels that followed, or any of the movies that where "inspired" by its success. If you love slashers, you will probably love this movie. One last thing: I guessed who the killer was in no time.5 out of 10. A good slasher, but that doesn't make it a good movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor excuse for a horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an attempt to both entertain the viewer and pay tongue in cheek tribute to other films of this genre, this movie spills its own blood. A dismal failure to entertain on any level. While viewing this film, when the chick got trapped in the garage door, I could only laugh, as it was more a scene from a Chaplin silent than a modern day horror film. That this film appealed so much to the 20-30 year old crowd reveals a sad commentary on a generation which seems to have no sense of film appreciation. Where's Vincent Price when you need him? At least that generation knew how to camp it up and play with its audience. There's absolutely nothing new here, and how it spawned sequels is beyond comprehension.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the mysterious assassination of a young lady in a small town rumours circulate between Sidney Prescott and her friends. At this time Gale Weathers a local TV reporter enters to do some research. Sidney receives strange phone calls and get's pushed further into the plot of murders while her friends start to get less and less. Scream is best described as "could have t this been but is not". The plot is mediocre and very predictable. The acting was really bad and the cast was too. The ending of the movie was very disappointing and rather dull. If the ending would have been clever the movie wouldn't be that bad but this major mistake ruined it all. 3 of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unintelligent, lacking innovation...but watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its hard to understand why everyone considers this movie to be so ground-breaking. It is not being creative and original to use a tired, cliched plot and garnish the script with 'ironic' self awareness. You could achieve the same effect by sitting through a regular slasher movie with a group of friends discussing and laughing at its cliches with them. Theres no real innovation here, same old characters, same old twists, and despite Craven's attempts to achieve an ultra modern feel, it will seem as dated as the camp slasher horror movies of the 70s in 20 years time. So many movies in the horror genre fall in to the trap of being too 'of the time', and this is no exception.You almost get the feeling that the jokes about genre cliches and the intertextual references are there simply to cover Craven's back from criticism - as if he wanted to make a slasher movie but didn't want to face the film being denounced as an unoriginal piece of trash, so acknowledged how bad it is within the script. While it is likely that Craven's motives were probably less simplistic than this, it certainly seems that this is the majority of fans reason for liking it - they want to watch a slasher movie and feel smart doing it. Which doesn't seem likely.On the plus side (i hate reading one sided reviews criticising movies i like, so i better be fair writing this) the film is fairly well directed and acted throughout, and manages to capture the atmosphere of the films it was inspired by. The tension is well established, and its good for the odd scare. It's certainly watchable, its just a shame that a director so clearly aware of how stagnant the horror genre has become can only point and laugh at the existing cliches rather than try to come up with something ground-breaking to revitalize the genre.If you want to see a good horror comedy, steer clear of this and go for Evil Dead 1 or 2, both of which are funny and scary through their innovation and spectacular visual techniques rather than through pretentious self mockery (who'd have thought self mockery could ever be pretentious?! and yet Craven managed with this!). While neither are intelligent films, they dont aim to be, merely to entertain, amuse and terrify - which they achieve, and this is a real rarity.I give this movie a 2/5, simply because to give it a 1 would be to say it was as awful as its sequels, or even the dire 'Scary Movie', and it deserves (a little) more respect than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither scary nor funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I should say up-front that I'm not a horror movie fan. Horror movies have never appealed to me much, and I find most of them rather boring. There are a few horror movies which I do think are excellent, for instance Poltergeist, The Exorcist, and Silence of the Lambs. In general, however, the appeal of the horror genre is a puzzle to me.With this in mind, I rented Scream with an open mind. I knew nothing about the movie itself, except that it had gathered good reviews. I wanted to be scared and entertained. As it turned out, neither wish came true.Scream is a movie ABOUT movies and the people who watch them. Specifically, Scream is a movie about horror movies and the people who watch horror movies. I didn't know this beforehand, although it became clear soon itself. A killer is on the loose, and Neve Campbell appears to be the primary target. Of course, this isn't what the movie is all about. The plot is merely a vehicle for the main characters, who all seem to be extremely knowledgeable horror movie fans. Throughout the film, they endlessly discuss and remark about horror movies, making references to famous films and well-known devices in the horror genre.The satire didn't work for me. I'm sure this has something to do with the fact I'm not a horror fan. Or perhaps the satire worked too well. Within minutes of the first scene, I was certain I was watching a "movie within a movie". When the credits never rolled and the lights never rose on a sea of teenage moviegoers, I realized this was satire. I sulked and hoped for the best.Unfortunately, even the humor which I understood well seemed heavy-handed and spoon-fed. Then again, some of the cliches and devices of the horror genre are so glaringly obvious that it might be difficult to satirize them at all, without appearing heavy-handed in the process.The main characters painstakingly point out all the "mistakes" which the characters in horror movies typically make. Then, they go on and make the same mistakes themselves. I suppose this is in keeping in line with the rest of the satire, but it doesn't make for a very entertaining story. When Neve Campbell undresses for her boyfriend, she fails to reveal her top to the camera, and this exception only serves to highlight the rule of how closely the main characters mimic the characters they see. After all, as is pointed out, "there's always a *** shot".Many people describe this as a "scary" movie. To be honest, I've been more frightened at the thought of an upcoming topology midterm than I was frightened by this movie. It was anything but scary. In order for a movie to be scary, anticipation must be built up. As Hitchcock said, (modulo a slight paraphrase), "Terror is achieved by anticipation of the event, NOT the event itself." Scream is all event and no anticipation. There's nothing scary about watching teenagers get chased around and hacked to bits.This is just my opinion, of course. You should take into account my lack of interest and knowledge in the horror genre in general. If you're a great horror fan, and you know a lot about horror movies, you may very well like this movie. Myself, I'm not a horror fan, and I found it quite boring and tedious. If you're interested in a movie ABOUT the movies, I would recommend The Player, which was far more clever. If you're interested in being scared out of your wits, watch the original Dutch version of The Vanishing. Now THAT'S a scary movie.-- 4 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just say that if you liked this movie, good for you, I am just expressing my thoughts about how amateur this movie is. My opinion is that true horror films do not use blood and guts alone to make it a block-buster. Take an old Alfred Hitchcock movie, lets say Psycho for an example. Sleek, thrilling, magnificently creepy, a huge twist at the end, and totally controversial for it's time (Even though it spawned a whole bunch of crappy sequels, but hey, what horror movie doesn't?). To me, this was not a true horror film, but a bucket of meaningless blood and gore passing itself off to be horror. But again, this movie might be or some of you fans of "new age" horror flicks, but for us fans of the old Hitchcock classics like the Birds and Psycho this movie is not our style.</fullReview>

This movie is so awesome I love Kevin Williamson for writing such a great film. Also I love Wes Craven for directing it . I love his movies. This movie has the best cast of all time.Like Neve Cambell Mathew Lillard Jamie Kennedy Skeet Ulrich Rose Magowen Henry Winkler Courtney Cox Arquette and David Arquette and more.........This movie is so scary my favorite scene is the opening seen. This movie is so good I Bought the box set and everything.There is a lot of hints in this movie that is similar to Halloween.......like go to the Makenzies is in both Halloween and scream. I also like how all the screams tie together to create the trilogy ... like roman causing it all and how him and Sidney share a moment at the end of scream 3. I also enjoy how old cast members appear in the other screams like Stu Macher(Mathew Lillard walks by in scream 2 when he is supposed to be dead and randy (Jamie Kennedy appears in scream 3 in the video to explain the rules to Sidney and Dewey..Once again I really love this movie and I hope everyone else does too</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I was seriously underwhelmed by this movie, though possibly more than I would otherwise have been had there not been so much hype about how wonderful it was. The first sequence with Drew Barrymore was very well done, and would have made a good short film, but the whole "aren't I cool having all the characters in my 'horror' movie talking about horror movies" thing got very old very fast; it was a good idea, but overused to extremes.However, I was more put off by the "we're making a movie for teenagers so we must make sure we explain everything VERY CLEARLY so everyone knows exactly what's going on" approach to the script: for the first half hour or so it seemed like we'd get a couple of minutes of plot, then an Exposition Break as some character had to explain to some other character exactly why they disliked them, or what their personal problems were, or whatever. Dull, dull, dull.In the end I gave up and watched the last half on fast forward. Ah, so that's who did it. Well, ho hum.Shame, I really liked Wes Craven's first 'Nightmare on Elm St' movie and the last half of 'Last House On The Left' is pretty much unforgettable (then again, so is the appalling dialog in the first half!); I think I'll have to watch both of them again to remind myself that he could make good movies once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange parody/horror mix with obnoxious characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1996, Wes Craven's "Scream" chronicles the murders of various people linked to a high school in a California town by someone dressed in a ghost-face Halloween costume. Neve Campbell plays the protagonist, Rose McGowan her best friend, Skeet Ulrich her boyfriend, Matthew Lillard his best friend, David Arquette the deputy, Courteney Cox an annoying reporter, Joseph Whipp the sheriff and Jamie Kennedy a dude that works at a video store.People keep hailing "Scream" as some kind of stand-out slasher flick, but it's not IMHO. It tries to walk the balance beam between serious slasher and amusing parody, which creates an odd vibe throughout. At no time was I able to buy what was going on as reality. The camp and contrivances kept screaming "This is all a joke," like Henry Winkler's weird principal. As such, the movie's never scary despite some shocking elements and gore.Another negative is the host of unlikable, obnoxious or annoying characters. Campbell is serviceable as the heroine and McGowan is awesome just because she's so alluring. Drew Barrymore is also good, but her presence is limited to a glorified cameo in the prologue. I realize that the rest of the characters are so distasteful because this is a whodunit and most of them are potential suspects, but this doesn't take away from the fact that they make for an unpleasant viewing experience. Before you say, "But this is a horror flick and therefore it's supposed to be unpleasant," I get that; I'm talking about how most of the main characters are so repugnant it's impossible to care about them. Let 'em all get slashed to death for all I care, lol. Then there's the ridiculously over-the-top last act, which is so contrived, cartoony and drenched in fake blood you'll just roll your eyes in disbelief. All this is compounded by the clumsy and weak killer, which I suppose makes sense when you later discover who the killer is.Thankfully, there's some good beyond the three girls noted above (especially McGowan, who's a pleasure to watch), like the numerous references to horror flick lore and the whodunit factor, but none of these redeem it from being a joke of a slasher. It's worth seeing if you like slasher movies, if for no other reason than to see if it matches the over-hype, but you'll probably be disappointed because of the disagreeable characters and the odd horror/parody fusion, not to mention the cartooniness and contrivances.The film runs 111 minutes and was shot in Santa Rosa, Tomales, Glen Ellen, Healdsburg and Sonoma, California.GRADE: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why am I even watching this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That was what I kept asking myself for the entire duration. My motives were weaker than those of the killer? I had a couple hours to kill, I didn't feel like thinking, the cat was in my lap, those are my only excuses.I've heard a lot about how great this movie is but I honestly didn't see any indication of it. I was interested in the references to other horror movies, most of which I had seen and many of which I had enjoyed enough to see them multiple times, but that wasn't enough to keep me interested. The one thing in the movie that I thought was sincerely funny was the scene where Henry Winkler (Fonzie, what are YOU doing here??!) as the school principal goes out into the hall muttering some obscenity, and the nearby janitor who's dressed in a green-and-red striped sweater wearing a cruddy brown hat says "what did you call me?", and Winkler replies "sorry, Fred". Now, THAT was FUNNY. One of the two stars I'm giving this movie is for that scene.Eventually the film turns into a total bloodbath and you lose track of who's dead, who's dying, who's still upstairs, who got out of the house? it just all happens so fast it's utterly ridiculous and you stop caring about the whole deal. At least I did. Oh? and Matthew Lillard is possibly the most annoying young actor working today. I couldn't wait for him to get murdered and it took way too long.Disappointing.</fullReview>

All the Girls in the Movie are Drop Dead Gorgeous and all the Dudes are Ugly, Irritating, or both.Pointing out two from each Gender should make the Point and You can Discover the others on Your own.

Well, there is Cute as a paper cut, Neve Campbell with those Freckles and whispery, Sexy Voice and Rose Mcgowan, Wow. Then there's the Boys. Stu, who Contorts His face, sticks out His tongue, and way Overacts in every scene to the point of "Fingernails On the Blackboard" Overacting. The Geeky Guy who is the "Expert", tries to out Mug Stu by doing a Jerry Lewis imitation, but no need, He Mugs just fine on His own.But Enough of that. The Film is Highly Overrated. It is Shot with a pristine Fondness and Looks Great, but the Script, what a Letdown. One could guess that about half of the Fanboys who watch this type of Stuff could have come up with so much Better. But Their too Content to lap this up and give it a "He's talking to Me", as Craven and Company Stroke Their Egos.Overall, it is a Very Good Movie, but Hardly Great Cinema. It is more Mad Magazine than National Lampoon. No need to point out that Mad outsold Lampoon by about a Trillion to One.</fullReview>

This movie can be a bit of a comic relief though. The stupidity of the teens, not to mention the police, is beyond belief. This in turn, actually makes it a little funny. The counterpart Scary Movie, is very similar and just as "scary". This is not scary, just rather telling of the "airhead teen cast". It is however, predictable and hollow. Every step can be foreseen. Good horror needs a hint of truth, even in movies dealing with the supernatural etc. This does not even manage this feat.Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Realizing they're being targeted by a vicious killer that seems to know the rules and conventions of Horror films, a teen and her friends try to stay one-step-ahead of the masked psychopath that seems to have ulterior motives for the rampage.This here is a pretty overrated but still enjoyable enough entry. One of the biggest issues here is the fact that, despite initially being targeted to be a commentary on the clichéd nature of horror, Slasher films in general, it seems to be more about offering a chance to utilize those clichés rather than poke fun at them. Far too often it expends a great deal of time to warn about a particular situation familiar in horror, such as running up the stairs to escape the killer or that he's not dead at all and comes back for one more scare despite being the subject of inhuman torture, then decides to play off a sequence that allows for such a moment to transpire. As well, many of the claims about this being funny are incredibly inaccurate as there's absolutely nothing in here that's really funny material, and the stuff that's here which is being called funny is reprehensible, deplorable and quite a stretch for anyone to call funny stuff. As such, it's the shining example that a reputation is far more damaging to a film than anything. That said, it does have some good stuff in some particularly chilling chases and stalking scenes including the rousing opening, some incredibly brutal, gory deaths and some fine moments of real suspense that are far more developed than expected. Overall, though, it's a victim of it's false-reputation and can't overcome that.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, underage drug use and drinking and continuous sexual dialog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the case of Scream my review should be taken with a grain of salt as I'm not really into these slasher flicks. But for its kind and the fact that it was directed by Wes Craven who does get the best out of them, it's as good as it will get.The film opens up with Drew Barrymore and her boyfriend being sliced and diced by some guy in a black cape and ghost mask. That's just to get the audience in the mood. It seems as though this slashing is connected to a case a year ago when Neve Campbell's mother was killed in the same grisly manner. This gives Neve a rooting interest to find out who is doing these killings.Two other people are interested in the story, TV reporter Courtney Cox and her then husband David Arquette playing a sheriff's deputy on the cases. But the killings go on and someone is after a lot of the town's teen population.Wes Craven borrowed a gambit from Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None for his story involving the real killer. If you know that film or the book Ten Little Indians from whence it comes, then you might just figure out who's doing all the slashing.Scream and its successors aren't exactly my cup of tea, but you might like this if that is your taste.</fullReview>

But the story way just bad, it was original at least.Anyway the plot was funny in a way. When the victims hitting the killer and beating them, it was like watching Home Alone. It was like the killers were the victims.At the beginning scene, it's scary and i did feel scared but then i got bored, it was just wrong, the killer were not really scary. If I see Ghost Face i will not feel scared.This movie starts good but ends bad. You'll like it if you're into Slasher Films, i mean all kinds of slasher films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tame, by the numbers slasher film still manages to earn some big scares and features an appealing cast. A group of teenagers shortly after graduation accidentally kill someone. Fearing police charges the kids take matters into their own hands by getting rid of the body. Flash forward one year, now the kids begin to receive threatening letters and are starting to disappear cause of a person who Screams. Rated R; Violence, Profanity, Mild Sexual Situations.The biggest failing of the film is the performances. The murderer is not as effective as ones like Ghostface or Freddy - partly because he lacks screen presence but also because we all feel sorry for him - after all he's not crazy, he's only taking revenge. The teens in question make it worse - with the exception of Love Hewitt and maybe Prinze they are pretty unpleasant people - spoilt brats mainly. From the start onwards you want them to be killed - it makes it even harder to care about what's going on when you don't care if the characters live or die.Overall this is a rather tame horror movie - low on bodycount and gore, only some action scenes are tense and exciting but most things you can see coming a mile away. The red-herrings are left unexplained at the end (why is Ray the only one not targeted?) and the end is both lazy and insulting - and of course leaves it open for a sequel. Great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone obviously loves this movie, everyone who has taken the time to write comments, the critics and my friends. I must say that I was utterly disappointed.I like Alfred Hitchcock's movies (such as Vertigo) but this was nothing like it. This is merely a meaningless, pointless slaughter-movie. No originality, no interesting characters and no plot. Just a lot of people killing each other.But as most seem to like it, there's a good chance that you'll do so too. But I sure didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as great as it thinks it is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So it's not a bad film, its just not a great one and I've no idea why critics and cinemagoers alike have lapped up this self conscious and forgettable slice of "irony". The first 10 minutes were very good and they almost actually frightened you - sadly the same can't be said of the rest of the film which gradually descended into more unfunny "in-jokes", ridiculous plot developments, criminally bad acting (almost saved by David Arquette) and non-scary scary scenes. Okay so maybe I'm missing the point, maybe that is the attraction of it all but surely if it was so good I would have enjoyed it just a little and I can't be the only one who thought the ending was one of the worst ever in a movie. I admit it did have some funny lines, some moderately scary patches and enjoyable scenes but does this warrant the scores of glowing reviews everywhere?The real irony is that it's a movie that thinks it's great attempting to send up other slasher pics that think they were great but weren't. What I'm saying is do see the film but don't believe the hype or you'll be genuinely disappointed. Watch with an open mind, suspend disbelief and you may just like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...as desperate a film as it was a franchise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scream", yes. The film released in 1996, and the abomination to the entire genre! Yes, a real attention getter and a real creep of a film! Full of suspense and stupidity! The absolute definition of wretched impact on society, with good characters to follow in a homage for obsessive freaks! Screenwriter Kevin Williamson almost had a terrific idea about a gruesome killer stalking the teens of a sleepy California town. Wes Craven is a genius of this certain genre, and to have him direct this film was a lucky break for the fledging writer. The concept was fine. Teens in a small town are being offed one by one in some of the most gory turn-outs. Soon, the police are baffled, and the teens are doing nothing but relating the vicious natured killings to pop-culture horror films. When situations grow from bad to worse-a town curfew is set, and a party is held. It is during this final party that all is revealed.First, we shall go over the concept. It has a strong presence, very strong, and very predictable. How many people do you know, actually saw the film, and could not see the next part coming? Yes, as scary as it might be, it is just as predictable as well. Williamson tries to put forth new ideas and interesting killings, but alas, it does not work, especially when the apparently innovative death scenes are more like puns. It does, however, have many good moments in which dialog is spoken, or imagery is shown that will send chills up your skin. The film seems to try too hard at getting a scare, as though it is afraid to be original, so it relies on the success of other films for reference scares. The concept is overblown by unrealistic scenes of shock value and character analysis details that need not apply. Over all, it was good, but it was also bad.The acting and character placement was fair and easy. Neve Campbell was very popular on the FOX drama "Party Of Five", and furthermore, she had completed "The Craft" just months before. Therefor, she definitely had the victim act down after playing the villain. Rose McGowan, Jaime Kennedy, and Matthew Lillard all had good shots at success as newer faces in the crowd. They in turn, had nothing to worry about. All three gave credible performances. Courtney Cox and David Arquette have certainly won the award for most spirited cast members to this day, just look at their position now. Skeet Ulrich is so irritating, he actually comes off well in his part. The rest of the cast features good supporting performances and cameos all around.Now, about the writing, Kevin Williamson is either smug and obviously desperate, or rather way too obsessed with the genre that his extreme passion clouds the writing and brings out the hackneyed atmosphere that films of this type should have been trying to ride themselves of. Even more annoying, is that obvious way Williamson is trying to give every single teen a sort of modern lingo about "the werewolf movie with "ET"'s mom in it, or 'Wes Carpenter', or even "Tits Lagites" thing." Worst of all, the rather convenient way the everyone is an expert on horror films. Randy must be shooting for Leonard Maltin or Rex Reed status. The film has a little too many crinkles in it. Still, those flaws will fade when the moments of madness take tole.The directing is...well, Wes Craven did the deed, need I say more? All in all, the film was a nice little piece of scare fare, but it ruined the genre by giving away movie secrets and supposed methods that make the film formulas work. Nice try Williamson, but no horror film has been very enjoyable since your little stab film was released. Stop trying so hard, it's pathetic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people of my generation label this movie as a classic. I consider it a typical teen movie at heart where the characters deal with murder instead of getting laid or being the most popular kid in school. Neve Campbell delivers a consistent performance and by consistent I mean boring and predictable. Jamie Kennedy hits us over the head with the reminder that we are watching a "horror" movie. Rule #1 of a good movie: Don't take the audience out of the experience. Make them believe it is real. Overall: No real terror or dread is conveyed. Some OK scenes of the killer chasing people and losing but then winning the upper hand. A few scenes designed to make the viewer jump. OK twist and revelation at the end. It was paced pretty well and it didn't feel long. I give it a 5 and that is being generous. Not as good as everybody says.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, I loved it. But over the past 3 years I've become a more respectable horror fan, and I look at this movie as an extremely overrated horror flick, that has spawned silly rip-offs, including a Scream take on the Halloween franchise. Which I liked it first, with the return of Michael Myers, but it was one of the silly rip-offs of Scream, that should've gone it's own way. The Halloween series had a great image. But now it's looked at as Scream-like entity by many who love it. I respect Scream for it's reigniting the series. It's just unfortunate, filmmakers like Moustapha Akkad aren't taking advantage of the reignition, in their own highly respectable styles. Instead, their drowning the horror genre with the Scream-likeness. God give gifts to Chucky creator, Don Mancini for taking " Bride Of Chucky " in it's respectable style. Hopefully, the Scream followers will end soon, so we can have our Freddy, Jason and others back! Perhaps, Halloween : H2K will deliver a more respectable return for Michael Myers. We really need Michael back, the way he was!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lame. That's how I sum this up. Facile, dumbed-down to the nth degree. First of all, this isn't a horror movie and neither are the 'classic' 'horror' movies it thinks it's taking the p*** out of. They're teenagers' date movies and with one or two exceptions they aren't scary at all. None of this film's supposedly original spin seemed at all new to me. Why? Because these films have been taking the p*** out of themselves (and their audiences) for decades. 'Scream' is like a slasher-movie version of Trivial Pursuit captured on film. This is the sort of movie applauded by people who think that horror films are beneath them, who couldn't possibly enjoy something that wasn't sufficiently 'postmodern.' They watch films like 'Scream' because critics who should know better called it 'clever,' 'intelligent,' 'witty.' These critics don't get out enough do they? Personally I'd rather watch the decidedly un-postmodern 'Anaconda' fifty times than sit through a trailer for this thing again. And for those of you who think that Wes Craven is suddenly 'postmodern' and sophisticated enough for you to claim to like his movies, remember this is the man who made 'Shocker.'

		<fullReview>SCREAM demonstrates beyond a doubt that self-awareness is not always a good thing.Here, the film's awareness of genre conventions and clichés serves merely to point up the fact that the filmmakers are unable to transcend those clichés, and end up making a movie that is neither a frightening horror film, nor a funny spoof. Instead, it's just one more utterly typical example of that most worthless of genres, the teen slasher flick.The only things that redeem this film from complete turkeydom are Henry Winkler's performance and the relatively effective opening scene.

		<fullReview>No matter what critics or anyone else say, I think that this film is not good at all. The scary part about this film and the series is that it has probably made more money at box office then the unholy trinity of Italian Horror(Dario Argento, Mario Bava, &amp; Lucio Fulci) has ever made in their life. One problem is its poor attempt at being humorous. Scream(1996) is a popular film because many people are desperate to see a well made horror film. The acting is below average and technically, the movie is unimpressive and uninspired.Its a shame that Wes Craven sold himself out to do this overbearing "horror" film. This was made for a generation of people who have no idea of what a great horror film is or what makes them scary. The whole thing is formulatic and genetic when it comes to the movie itself. I prefer the slasher flicks of the early 80's to this movie and its clones because they were filled with better murder scenes, more gore, and a lot more evil villains. Scream(1996) is the film that will bring the near death experience of the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Success commercially, failure film-wise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading a few reviews, I decided to register just to able to write my own. I cannot believe that such a dumb movie can get so much praise. I don't even know where to start. Firstly, if you haven't seen this movie and if you're older than 14 - avoid it! The cast is filled with the so-called upcoming stars, which do a pretty average job. The scenario is full of "holes" and barely holds itself together. You'll be wondering why the action took place or why the phrase was said and it won't be clear even after the movie is over. It is very sad to see that Wes Craven, the maker of the first "A Nightmare on Elm Street," a truly original and superbly made horror movie, is involved in this pathetic show whose only aim is to gain as much commercial success as possible. The following sequels serve as an undeniable proves for this. One of the amazing things I found is that one version of the slip-sleeve packages says "starring Drew Barrymore." (I am not saying that she's an awful actress, but to me saying that she "stars" is great exaggeration.) In this movie she hardly "plays," as she appears doing nothing but screaming and saying only a few words, and this lasts less than ten minutes. But this, most likely, was another commercial trick. So my advice would be - unless you have free tickets, do not waste your money and time. (With the free tickets you may go ahead and check it out - just to know what this "commercial" fuss is all about.)</fullReview>

The true horror was yet to come.The movie really goes down in quality once the bodies start to pile up as it becomes a mass murdering picture.No one is really exempt from this including the school principal Henry Winkler. Imagine, Henry Winkler as a school principal. He still uses a 4 letter word before he falls victim to the murderer as well.This film was supposed to be clever. The killer(s) are worse than out of their minds. Everyone seems to be in the act and that's the trouble with this.When the killers are revealed, there is a logical explanation for what sent one of them off. However, to continue like this, goes beyond the realm of understanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This isn't a movie. This is life." Really? You wouldn't know it by the script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tell me, if you're a writer who writes a cliché, predictable story, can you excuse your bad writing by having your characters state, within the movie, that they know it is cliché and predictable? This is my problem with Kevin Williamson's script, and this movie in general. You can't excuse a tired plot by having your "hipster" characters acknowledge every cliché from previous movies in the genre. It really is for five year-olds, there's nothing subtle about it at all. The viewer is beaten over the head in this film with constant references to other films in the genre. This self-awareness has been called new and edgy, instead of what it really is: a total cop-out. Why write characters so self-aware of all the genre pitfalls, only to have them execute the same bad decisions in their own reality? Such a waste."Scream" was heralded for being different from the pack because it was the first mainstream horror movie to parody the characters' situations and point out the flaws in the genre, but really, the idea was very simplistic. "Scream" differs from other genre films only in the fact the characters talk as if they're in a horror movie, while the rest of the film is just as predictable as any other movie in the genre. Changing one small ingredient in the recipe doesn't affect the end result that much. A child could have conceived the idea.The characters exist in a world where horror movies can happen just like in the fantasy of motion pictures--the killer can seemingly be everywhere at once, the heroine can elude her pursuer until the film's finale, and other characters conveniently find themselves in situations where they are far too easy for the killer to pick off. Of course, real life is a bit different, which ironically the main character says at one point in the film, right before we get treated to every horror cliché in the book before the grand "finale", which plays out just like a movie. Such a shame more of an effort wasn't made to create a better movie that sent a more believable message about the genre as a whole: that the killers aren't superhuman, not everything will go according to plan, the heroine will not always survive, and not everything plays out like a scene from a movie. That would have been a far better message than what we ultimately get here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great opening . . . then I fell asleep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing. I honestly don't know how Wes Craven does it. He takes another genuinely interesting premise and absolutely slaughters it on screen - and I'm not referring to the body count here.The opening ten minutes are admittedly great. Drew Barrymore reaching for the phone, only to find herself in conversation with a stalker is inspired. What a pity then about the rest of the film.Back in the mists of time when horror movies used to scare people - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Omen, Psycho - Scream would probably have passed without notice. But since The Evil Dead, it seems you don't have to scare people anymore, you simply have to amuse them.Quite honestly, I don't care about Jason's mum, nor about Jason, nor about who was hiding behind the curtain with a machete in their hand and wearing a stocking over their head halfway through Prom Night III.The genre of horror lost its teeth some time ago. Just occasionally a modern day classic will rear its head. If you want to see real true horror, watch Wolf Creek from about 2005.For those of a less demanding taste watch this drivel, masquerading as a horror film and stuffed full of characters straight out of any number of American sitcoms. Which brings me back to my earlier point: how does Wes Craven manage to slaughter so many genuinely good ideas?I recently saw his New Nightmare aka Nightmare On Elm Street Part 7, and it was virtually identical to Scream. The same sets, the same characters, the same supposed shocks you can see coming from a mile off. The only difference of course was in place of the tiresome Freddy, we have some tiresome bloke in a mask waving a fake knife.Fake just about sums it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Because references are hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well maybe it was 20 years ago. If anything "Scream" could be seen as a prime example of how references can age your movie terribly. I know there are plenty of other movies that have references in them, but then there's "Scream". The difference between "Scream" and say "Beerfest" is that even though "Beerfest" has references to movies like "Predator" and "Das Boot", the comedy is not solely based around those references. While "Scream" might not be a comedy like "Beerfest" is, it's certainly self-aware. In fact, if the Evil Dead series didn't start the "Self-aware horror" genre, then "Scream" kick-started it. I know it's directed by Wes Craven who did self-aware horror movies like "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" but this was just overkill. There's references to every type of slasher movie imaginable, like the writer was thinking they were the next big thing in terms of self-aware comedy. The problem, he was right. After "Scream", every single horror parody had references galore. And look how that ended up, terrible parody after terrible parody that pretty much killed itself with it's own stupidity. No I'm not judging "Scream" based on those bad movies, but it has the same style to it. Oh look, a reference to "Basic Instinct". Oh look, a reference to "Halloween". Oh look, a reference to "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (real subtle there Craven). It just goes on and on and on to the point of "We get it! These movies exist! Stop having references be the entire plot of your movie!" I'm not saying it has to be original, but doesn't making countless references sound kind of lazy? I mean, if all the horror parodies got destroyed for doing the same thing, why not "Scream"? Answer: Because it was new. It was something a lot of people hadn't seen before, and thus became a double-edged sword in terms of it's writing. The writing is the weakest part of the story, and it's all the story is. Literally half of this movie's dialog is movie references. This then makes the movie into a comedy, and not scary. Yet the movie then goes into straight horror territory with people getting butchered. There's no balance! I remember liking this movie a lot more when I was younger, but I really don't think it's aged well. Much like with "Super Troopers", I think the reason I liked it back then was because I was easier to entertain. The only part that I still liked was the climax and it was mostly due to Matthew Lillard and Skeet Ulrich being so crazy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the opening scene causing more questions than answers, especially for a NON-comedy, I come into the movie not really understanding the tone, the atmosphere, or the plot. The first death is very interesting, because they actually take into consideration the physicality of death, albeit very briefly when Barrymore can't speak because her lung is punctured. However, it quickly fades into 'Really?' for me, from the parents being able to hear their daughters moans when the phone is held in an outstretched arm, to the rest of the entire film being completely slapstick and silly.For those who call this move original, it DOES do something most horror movies try to NOT do, which is be fairly fake, flat, and uninteresting. I guess not having watched this in my teen years but really WANTING to have watched it when my older sister saw it with her friends, this movie was hyped up to me, with mental images of red filtered scenes of people falling to their deaths, screaming as they did so, to a much more artful process (must like Kill Bill, actually) than this was.It is mildly entertaining, but not what I generally look for with a movie that is SUPPOSED to be scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Scream' hit theatres in the mid 90's, and alongside 'Clerks' and 'Pulp Fiction', quickly became a shrine for smug Generation X teens to gather around and worship as visionary new icons of cinema. Of course the irony was that all of said films simply thrived on stealing scenes and ideas from older films the creators had dug up on VHS. The difference is that whilst Tarantino and Smith crafted their films as loving tributes to what had been, 'Scream' is content to just pretend to be clever.The set-up is the typical slasher fair, teenagers are getting knocked off one by one and there is a very vague plot about one of them being the killer. What stood out at the time was that occasionally, one of the characters would reference a classic slasher movie, stopping just short of staring into the camera and winking. It's a lousy attempt at being self aware, and does little more than con the audience into believing that what their seeing is a satire rather than a rip off.Our actors are a typical mix of unlikable, drop dead gorgeous teens who make it absolutely impossible to see them as anything other than victims in waiting. There's few with any personality or emotional impact, and shamefully most don't even die in interesting ways.Production wise it's all well and good. Wes Craven knows how to direct a film and there was clearly a budget to this. The problem is that the world feels far too glossy. Even the worst slasher films that crawled out from beneath the 80's felt raw and intense. This film with it's hyper clean look and flawless inhabitants is too fantastical to take as horror. Even the gore is lit in just the right way to show off the actors.Overall it's really just boring. Now that the self aware horror film has been beaten to death, resurrected, and beaten some more the whole fascination with 'Scream' is gone. If you were a teen in the 90's you might find it a bit of gleeful nostalgia, but for Generation Y it's a stale formula with a head-scratchingly large following.</fullReview>

This movie is rated R. There are a few F bombs and other language that children don't need to hear. There is bloody and gory violence throughout the film. A girl does take off her clothes as she gets in the shower, no nudity is shown. Some mild terror when Ghostface appears. Probably suitable for 13+.

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven's magnum opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Scream", Wes Craven who before this had left a chain of horror flicks gave to the horror genre one of its proudest kingpins and a valuable reference which gave a new lease of life to the slasher genre which thrived in the eighties. But also a film which involuntarily became an accursed one since it prompted many fragile teenagers to kill their families or friends dressed in the killer's outfit.Wes Craven exploits the indispensable ingredients pertaining to the serial killer story like a female teenager all alone in her house who is about to watch a horror flick and receives ominous phone calls or teenagers all gathered in a house watching horror flicks and they're all killed one after the other and the filmmaker follows the rules of the game while poring over them. During 110 minutes, Craven mixes the slasher movie and a studied reflection about the genre and its premises. Hence its indisputable strength. Flicks like the "Freddy" or "Friday the 13th" endless saga contributed to the fame of the genre and were based on rules that the viewer knows very well. Craven takes them again for himself to reveal the tricks of the trade and to dynamite the clichés. Thus it gives both a highly terrific and terrifying piece of work in which Craven involves the viewer at all levels. One should note down all the witty lines the film shelters and the black humor of a formidable efficiency which lacked in so called gore masterworks like John Carpenter's "Halloween" (1978). I dig the "test" in the first sequence the killer asks to Drew Barrymore about horror flicks. Painstakingly built, full of ideas, nods or allusions to gore films which secured the popularity and the trademark of the slasher genre. Craven's film has also the ability to make us shiver and to be jubilant thanks to what has been said before and also thanks to a taut scenario in which the murders aren't only the worthwhile moments as it's often the case in many mediocre horror films. Craven also doesn't fear to delay sequences as much as he can to stretch terror and treat, notably the first one and all that happens in the big isolated house where the students party while very bad things occur near them.This is a film to cherish and to ponder about provided you have nerves of steel and if you keep in mind that it's just pure cinema. And one of the characters says: "there has to be one or several sequels to a film of this kind". It was judicious from Craven to have included this cue for there will be two sequels. But the pernicious charm that wraps "Scream" will be absent in its two heirs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genre defining movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scream" came in 1996 when "teen flicks" were the most popular movies and raised millions of dollars. Wes Craven thought it was time to bring back the Slasher genre and adapt it with the mid 90's craziness. His winning formula was mixing 90's teen "idols" and situations taken from "teen" flicks with 80's Slasher movie elements. "Scream" is a combination of "Beverly Hills 90210" and "Friday the 13th".Most of this movie's fans didn't even watch ANY Slasher movie before watching "Scream" from the 80's and that's the reason why "Scream" became a tremendous hit. Those teens watched something that worked in the 80's for the first time in a mid 90's movie, I'm talking about the Slasher genre.On the other hand, die hard fans of the genre were insulted with Craven's movie. Craven is responsible for Horror defining movies like "A Nightmare On Elm Street", "Last House On The Left", and "The Hills Have Eyes"; movies that somehow changed the genre. "Scream" doesn't offer anything new and it's filled with every 80's horror clichés (characters, killings, music, make up, etc.). Of course anyone that didn't watch a Slasher movie before would be "impressed" by this movie!What's so good about "Scream"?. In my opinion, adapting the Slasher clichés with the 90's clichés. Compare "Scream" with "Friday the 13th", "Black Christmas", "When A Stranger Calls", "Happy Birthday To Me", etc. and you will feel cheated. "Scream" made millions of dollars for copying 80's horror movies' elements.Don't give credit to this movie because it doesn't deserves it.At least Drew Barrymore, Neve Campbell, and Courteney Cox are beautiful and can act. The goofy Ghostface "killer" is dull, but it managed to generate a huge cult. Recommended for slasher lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like this film a lot. It didn't scare me AT ALL, and the thing that first put me off was when at the very beginning either the killer or Drew Barrymore says that Michael Myers, the killer from Halloween, kills babysisters! GRRRRRRRRRR! Being the HUGE fan of Halloween that I am, I was annoyed at this comment.The whole 'who's the killer' thing was good to begin with, but then it got really boring. The best thing about Scream was Jamie Kennedy, who played Randy the horror buff. The whole 'rules' thing was very good and I liked it, but that was about all. I give this movie about 5 out of ten.Despite this, I saw the two sequels. I thought Scream 2 was marginally better than the first, and Scream 3 was the best out of the three, because (a) of Jamie Kennedy's neat appearance, which was very clever, and (b) it tied the films together, and had new plot developments, something that horror movies alot of the time forget. If you're gonna watch Scream, WATCH ALL THREE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love scream, and the rest of the scream movies, this one is my favorite though, I am a huge fan of the horror genre, I guess what attracted me to this movie was the simplicity of it, plus the characters and the actors who played them. also the gore was a plus, and the mind games between the killer and the victims that first 12 minutes is the best part of the movie. Also it pays to tribute to several awesome horror movies, such as Halloween, Carrie, and Psycho. Overall this is a great movie and I urge everyone to go and see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only your average slasher movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Scream only because I had to analyse it for an essay. I had avoided it up 'till then because I had thought it would be just your average slasher movie. I was wrong. It was a failed attempt to parody a slasher movie.Firstly, it didn't frighten me at all. Maybe it's not my kind of horror, but I still jumped in Halloween. There was just no atmosphere in the film, and the attempts at parodying the genre only served to lessen the impact of the film. Not that the jokes were all that funny, unless you were actually paying attention to any of it.The whole motive thing was a severe let-down. I ended up having to ask my friends why they did it because I thought I missed it in all the talking. When they told me I thought 'Wasn't that just an excuse to go around killing some teenagers with no real plot in mind?'I never rate a film awful because they all have something to offer, and Scream does. There are some good moments in it and some smart directing in it, yet its best attribute is probably giving Scary Movie something to make fun out of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a scary movie at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched it late at night alone. I didn't get scared at all. To me, this movie is such a joke, it is a bad joke. It tries to be scary, but those scary things only make me want to laugh. Yet I can't laugh, because those are not funny enough. Everything is so predictable. The only thing that I was not able to predict was that the real suspect is actually acted out by two person. One of the guy just has that face and act which I can tell from the very beginning.This movie has so many flaws. For example, why did the girl has to go through a cat exit on a garage door when the garage door can be opened by herself? What kind of idiot would try to go through a cat exit on a garage door? It is SUCH a common sense what the exit is for, and why it is only that big. I can't see a particular reason to kill her. There is no reason to kill her, because she is a girlfriend of one of the psychos. There are so many things in the garage that she can grab to defend herself.Another example, at the very beginning of the movie, how did the killer cut out the girl's boyfriend's gut remotely? What is the reason of killing the school principal? And how did the killer get in and get out? How did the killer hide his costumes? How did the killer kidnap the father, etc, etc.This movie is neither scary, nor sophisticated.I am surprised that there are actually two sequels to this simple movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream and scream again and again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been more than a decade since I last watched "Scream" ? probably right after it got released in theaters or something ? and honestly have to admit I never was a big fan of this much-hyped blockbuster. To me personally (admittedly I was just an over-enthusiast horror fanatic who just started to find his way around the genre) it was simply a mockery against really unsettling movies and the one film that suddenly turned everyone into a horror buff overnight. Also, and maybe even most importantly, "Scream" was single-handedly responsible for a massive overload of inferior and sometimes even downright retarded knock-offs, imitations, zero-budgeted amateur trash slasher flicks. Suddenly and thanks to the simplistic concept of this movie, everyone considered him/herself capable of making a horror movie and sadly enough most of them even found ways of distribution as well. This was my personal blunt opinion on "Scream" more than ten years ago. By now, I still think it's a vastly overrated movie and definitely not the best horror film of the nineties (my vote for that either goes to "Braindead" or "Candyman"), but my opinions regarding the actual film's quality surely have changed. "Scream", and particularly Kevin Williamson's screenplay, is very clever and witty in its observations on the contemporary teen pop culture and it covers a pretty impressive range of old horror trivia. Wes Craven, who in his career alternatively tackled some hits ("The Hills have Eyes", "Deadly Blessing", "Nightmare on Elm Streeet") and some misses ("Shocker", "Vampire in Brooklyn") was the ideal choice of director for a film that simultaneously spoofs and pays tribute to a popular film genre that thrives on clichés, stereotypes and gratuitous scares. Last but certainly not least, the actual story offers a handful of genuinely uncanny moments as well as some neat unpredictable twists. Simply the opening sequence starring Drew Barrymore already ? which I suppose everybody knows about by now ? is enough indication that anything can happen to any disposable character in this film. The premise is rudimentary and ancient, with a spooky masked killer terrorizing a small high school and particularly one girl whose mum got massacred one year earlier, but that's all there is necessary. Good performances, tight direction, classy photography, dazzling soundtrack and a truckload of nauseating murder set pieces do the rest. Recommended for all type of horror-appreciating audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Quentin Tarantino before him, Kevin Williamson has become one of the most revered/reviled writers of our generation. I don't revere him(I hated I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and while DAWSON'S CREEK started off good, it got mediocre, except for Katie Holmes(*sigh*)), but I don't revile him, as this movie was good. You don't have to be a big fan of the horror genre to even appreciate it(though it does help, which I found out after watching HALLOWEEN and then watching this again). It does share a problem that every Wes Craven movie has had since NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET - an overlong climax - but it's funny and scary, it takes some well-deserved shots at both the horror genre and how our culture reacts to death, and it doesn't look down on its characters or its audience. Still, I am looking forward to SCREAM IF YOU KNOW WHAT I DID LAST SUMMER(or is it HALLOWEEN?), as this does need a spoof around now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The slasher reborn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's quite amazing how this one movie marked the rebirth of the slasher genre and how it redefined it and set the standards for basically all later genre movies.Foremost thing "Scream" does extremely well is that it's actually sort of making fun of its own genre and acknowledges all of its genre rules and clichés but yet the movie really is not a parody of the genre. You could even call it an homage to the golden era of the slasher genre, during the beginning of the '80's. But actually the movie is also being still much more than that. It's a really good genre movie on its own, that plays by the rules and does everything absolutely right. No big surprises, since it had genre expert Wes Craven at the helm, even though he in the last years probably had more misses than hits during his career. But he still is someone that is really at home within the genre and understand what's needed to make a great movie. He already did this lots of times successfully in the past, of which the first and original "A Nightmare on Elm Street" is the best and also best known example.It already gets obvious from the opening sequence on that this is going to be a great genre movie. Also everything that comes after that does not disappointed and "Scream" manages to be a great genre movie throughout, from start to finish. It constantly build up some good tension and the movie actually does also still surprises a lot. You really never know who will get killed next or how and the movie also is being a whodunit, which also really adds to the mystery and tension of the movie. The movie constantly drops hints throughout the movie and manages to make lots of the characters seem out as potential suspects. It makes the surprises of the movie also really stand out but even when you have already seen this movie a couple of times and know who the killer(s) is, this still remains such a great movie to watch. Out of all the classic genre movies, this is the one that I know by heart, so that also should say something about the quality of it and its re-watchable value.You also just know that this movie is a classic when the look of its killer has already become an horror icon, in such a short period. Every knows Jason's hockey-mask and Michael Myers his white mask but everybody also knows Ghostface, from the Scream movies. It's the mark of not just a great killer and villain but also that of a great movie. The mask (obviously based on Edvard Munch's painting 'the scream') actually a really popular object and got sold all over the world. And yes, even I still own one.But also all of the other characters are really good ones and cast extremely well. Normally teenagers in an horror and slasher film in particular are being extremely annoying and perfect looking sexy characters, you just never really feel for. But most characters in this movie are really been given some depth and are being made very distinctive with all of their various personalities. It makes them interesting and someone you can easily relate with and feel for. And like I said, everyone also got casted really well and everyone within this movie seems to suit their role, as if it got written just for them, so this also obviously helps the movie. The actors also really seem to feel this way, since they keep popping up in all of its sequels, while in other genre sequels you often see most big name and semi big name actors drop out after one sequel already. Even Liev Schreiber, who has like a 5 seconds role in this movie.If you have to say something negative about this movie it would be that it made the slasher genre and also just horror genre in particular extremely popular again, with as a result lots of bad and mediocre. new slashers and remakes of classics got made but till this date still none of them ever in any way comes remotely close to the level of excellence of this movie. After the huge success of this movie they of course quickly made some cash-in sequels. But this year part 4 of the series gets released, 11 years after the previous entry. It means that they really took their time this time to come up with something good and original again and it actually seems "Scream 4", also directed by Wes Craven again, as all sequels were, will be a good movie, since it's already getting some real positive buzz and reviews.We'll see how it turns out but for now "Scream" still remains the best slasher since the first and original John Carpenter movie "Halloween".9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: The following is slippery with dripping sarcasm and MAY contain spoilers:Thriller Movies 101:Rule 1. If a major movie actor is listed following `and ?' you can be  pretty confident she WON'T be in the sequels. Rule 2. If someone in the top three billings is the second person to be attacked, you can be pretty certain that person will get away and WILL be in the sequels. Rule 3. If the person getting top billing plays a peripheral character, you can be pretty confident he will figure prominently in the climax. Rule 4. If you are going to kill someone in an especially gruesome way, make sure it looks real. The disembowelment of Drew Barrymore's boyfriend looks especially phony (guts are blue and don't appear attached to the OUTSIDE skin); and, although Drew's corpse looks real, she does NOT appear to have been eviscerated, though the dialogue tells us she was. Drew's sweater would have been shredded and soaked with blood and body fluid.. NOTE TO WES CRAVEN: Play your movie side by side with any of  the especially `juicy' `X Files' episodes, preferably one involving autopsies or chest popping aliens. THAT'S how to do it RIGHT, Mr. Craven.A few points to ponder:1. People who live in isolated areas generally have guns and know how to use them, unlike spoiled, snotty, Hollywood actors who can afford bodyguards and abusive boyfriends.2. Would ANYONE, even one with the IQ of a Hollywood actor, race out on a front porch to challenge a threatening stranger without some kind of weapon, ESPECIALLY after two acquaintances have been killed horribly?3. These days people generally have screened-in windows, even on the second floor, ESPECIALLY fathers with nubile teenage daughters.4. A smart person who manages to get an armed assailant to the ground will kick him in the HEAD (preferably the BACK of the head) as well as in the groin. Just about anybody kicked ANYWHERE in the head more than once is not likely to get up. Of course, had our intrepid actors done that, we wouldn't have a movie; and in SCREAM, everyone behaves just as stupidly as he or she would in any other dumb "splatter" movie.NOTE TO DREW BARRYMORE: In "Scream," for once, your hair looks great; you should return to that color, style AND hairdresser. Just as important, you were BORN to wear tight sweaters. Please do it more often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I expected more . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream had an amazing point behind it, and I am glad that it was one of the first films to deliberately stand up for originality. With that said, ironically, the reason I didn't like it was because it was just a typical slasher with something to say instead of something to rip-off.The kill scenes were all well done and some of them were downright iconic. But they were few and far between, with way too much bloated dead space between them. I'll never understand why action movies and horror movies?two genres that are meant to thrill you?always seem to think they have to throw in yet another overdone woman's channel drama, and that is one cliché Scream doesn't break out of, sadly. The drama takes up way too much screen time and dulled the amazing intro and secondary kill scenes. This would have been a near perfect movie if they would have just stuck to the horror.The blood is pretty minimal, and not really even up to the bar set by the older slashers mentioned in the movie. However, some of the kills were more intense than normal slashers.As all of you should already know, the main point to have made Scream is to show that movies were cliché and predictable without turning into one of those movies itself. I think it does that wonderfully, but a little bit more on the subject would have made it more solid, because some people didn't even catch that was the point of the movie.In the end, Scream is just another typical slasher played out on a anti-cliché soapbox. I expected a lot more from it, and I still see no reason for the boring drama scenes that played out through most of the middle. It's a must view for any serious horror fans, but don't expect to be amazed like I was.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"So, how does it feel to be almost brutally butchered?" A classic already.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream starts with Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) receiving a phone call which she puts down to a wrong number, however the caller keeps ringing her back each time becoming increasingly hostile &amp; threatening. It's not long before Casey finds out that her boyfriend Steven Orth (Kevin Patrick Walls) has been gutted &amp; she is next... The news of the double murder quickly spreads through the small American town of Woodsboro as Sheriff Burke (Joseph Whipp) concentrates his investigations at the local high school questioning all the pupils, including Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) whose Mother was brutally raped &amp; murdered a year earlier. Later that night as Sidney waits for her friend Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan) to pick her up she too receives a phone call from the ghost masked killer &amp; is attacked but her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) conveniently shows up just in time. Reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) sense a big story &amp; starts to hassle Sidney while Tatum's Brother Deputy 'Dewey' (David Arquette) takes it upon himself to look out for Sidney. As the mystery deepens with Sidney's Father going missing &amp; Sidney unsure of who to trust Tatum's boyfriend Stuart Macher (Matthew Lillard) organises a party with lots of potential teenage victims for the serial killer...Directed by Wes Craven who also has a small cameo as the Freddy Krueger inspired janitor, Scream is the horror film that made the genre popular again, the film which so many have tried to copy since. A fine film it is too. The script by Kevin Williamson plays around with all the slasher film clichés in a witty self referential sort of way. Scream is bursting at the seams with all the horror film in-jokes &amp; homages, most people could probably watch Scream two or three times &amp; still not spot them all. Like the horror film lover character Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) who knows all the traditional slasher rules &amp; plays them to the hilt like if your a virgin in a horror film you die. The dialogue also pokes fun at the genre in an affectionate way like when the killer mentions going outside by oneself to investigate a strange noise as being stupid! It's great fun for horror fans, like myself, to try &amp; spot all the references &amp; mentions other classic horrors get. I thought the mystery element was great, Scream has plenty of red herrings &amp; I was never sure who the killer was right up until the final effective reveal which is quite clever although the motive behind the murders is somewhat shallow &amp; hardly surprising. I thought Scream dragged a little from after Casey was murdered for the next 40 odd minutes as no one dies at all, this witty &amp; hip dialogue is all well &amp; good to entertain up to a point but I would have liked a little more action as well. Technically Scream is as good as one could hope for on a relatively small $15,000,000 budget, director Craven creates some good set pieces &amp; effective sequences especially the opening, the cinematography is very good, the music incorporates horror themes into itself particularly Halloween (1978) &amp; as a whole Scream has that Hollywood polish about it. The violence &amp; gore is restrained, a few stabbings &amp; shootings plus Steven's guts spilling out at the start is about it, a little disappointing actually. The young attractive cast do a good job, Campbell makes for a likable enough 'scream queen' for the 90's &amp; Ulrich is great &amp; has a cold emotionless look on occasion that coupled with is boyish good looks you are never quite sure if he's telling the truth or not, Arquette makes for a suitably goofy deputy &amp; Cox is perfectly cast as the bitchy reporter, in reality after meeting each other on Scream Arquette &amp; Cox later married. The sequel Sream 2 (1997) reunites all the surviving cast members &amp; is also well worth watching if you enjoyed this. Overall Scream is a great horror film that has to some extent reinvented the genre &amp; just about deserves it's already classic status although I have slight reservations about it's slow pace at times which is my only complaint with it as a whole. An absolute must for horror fans &amp; definitely worth a watch for more general audiences too although some of the horror film humour may pass you by. Still, highly recommend!</fullReview>

The catch is that SCREAM in itself is not an awful film, it is actually quite good. The problem is not the film itself it is the way that people have embraced it. Jaded horror fans who have OD'd on lousy horror movies have been so refreshed and blinded by this movie that they have proclaimed it as the new king, the greatest Horror movie ever. In a word - bull****. Anyone who says this needs shooting, SCREAM is not even in the Top 100 Greatest Horror Movies. Even the director, Wes Craven has made several superior movies. In my view a good comic-horror should not attain glory by ridiculing REAL horror classics like this film ends up doing. Now all Horror Movies are just blatant imitations of this. Parodies of a Parody, no thanks. On its own merits SCREAM is a good film but in terms of the effect it has had it is the worst thing ever to have happened to Horror. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, DAWN OF THE DEAD and the Italian shockers of Directors such as Fulci and Argento are classic horror movies, SCREAM should never be included in the same league.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One That Started It All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scream (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Say what you will about the actual film but there's no denying that this Craven film put the horror genre back on the map. It's been nearly a decade since I last watched this film and on this newest viewing I was rather shocked to see how much more impressed I was with it. The story is pretty simple as a killer wearing a ghost face mask stalks teens in a small community and he might have some sort of connection to one (Neve Campbell) whose mother was butchered a year earlier. This killer, however, has his own set of rules that those he stalks must play by. SCREAM was a massive hit back in the day and it saved the genre from its own self destruction and nearly fifteen years later the film rightfully deserves the label of being a classic. While it's far from a masterpiece it at least manages not to lose any of its impact that made it so special when it was first released. I'm not going to sit here and say that SCREAM broke and created all the rules because there were horror-comedies long before this one and there were horror movies that references other horror movies so that there wasn't anything new either. What made the film work so well is that director Craven was at the top of his game and one might say that he did the best work of his career by making this material work so well. Yes, there's quite a bit of humor here but it works because fans of the genre will get a kick out of seeing "rules" that they know carried out. The various references to other horror movies makes for a lot of fun and we even get a couple nice cameos from previous horror stars. Craven puts his mark all over the film in terms of suspense and this famously starts with the Drew Barrymore sequence that starts the movie. I remember not being overly impressed with this sequence when I first saw it but viewing it today makes quite an impression because of how much suspense there is and how the director manages to slowly build it up. Seeing this sequence today also makes you see how violent it actually was and the death scene is quite effective and chilling considering the events that are going on around it. Craven also keeps things moving perfectly well with the ending because not only does he keep the tension going he also manages to keep the mystery up in the air as well. There are many suspects from start to finish but we're always guessing and even when you think you have it figured out something else will happen to throw you off track again. Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Rose McGowan, Jamie Kennedy and Matthew Lillard all fit their roles nicely and it was fun seeing the likes of Henry Winkler and Linda Blair. Even at 110-minutes the film never wears out its welcome as it moves at a very quick pace and whatever elements it's going for are always working. A lot of times horror films wear down with age but that's not the case here as the movie is just as strong and perhaps even stronger than when it was originally released. Each generation has films that built the horror genre and SCREAM certain did that and you really can't take away from it simply because of future rips that would eventually help kill the genre.

It is unbearable to see.Wes Craven has made much better horror-movies than Scream. He has made: Summer Of Fear, A Nightmare On Elm Street, The Hills Have Eyes(1977) etc.I cannot recommended Scream for Horror-fans!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is done by a 'once was a good director', Wes Craven. This film is what I classify as a 'Jack in the box' film,eg: Some jumps from behind a couch and everyone in the cinema jumps. You people call this horror? Have you gone mad? This film is thriller with a overdose of the 'teenybopper' essence, you know what I'm talking about, whose going out with who, he dumped her rubbish.This type of film, and others like it (IKWYDLS, Urban Legend) are defeating the real horror genre.I hope somebody, somewhere understands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally predictable and a step backwards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first sat down to watch this movie I was told that, even though I had become so jaded with horror movies, I would never guess who the killer was or see the end coming. That was something that I had learned to enjoy because of a classic like SE7EN andTHE USUAL SUSPECTSand thought that MAYBE a horror master like Wes Craven could pull it off (and save his own career in the process)...but when I saw "Sidney's" (Neve Campbell) boyfriend (Skeet Ulrich) come through the window looking like he'd just gone through Hell, that was the dead giveaway to me as to who the killer was. I will admit that it took me a little hwile to realize Matt Lillard was the accomplice, but with the way he was always bashing the 'rules' it became obvious he was in on it as well.A total and complete failure in horror, and a complete let down for suspense films. I suggest going elsewhere for your horror/suspense fix.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fifth-rate screenplay about teenagers terrorized by an all-too-clever serial killer is rampant with unpleasantness and TV-movie styled craftsmanship. It is one of director Wes Craven's worst efforts, but of course he's laughing all the way to the bank at critics who fail to chuckle at such nihilistic and exploitive aspects (such as Drew Barrymore happily gutted like a fish and left hanging for all to see). Most of the acting is vacuous, and the cruddy color and clanging technical set-ups just reek of bad taste. It shows the filmmaker to be without much talent or joy for making movies, and yet it's all so smug and 'unreal'. * from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had 'Scream' not come along, we might never have learned the formula to slasher flicks like 'Friday the 13th'. Other newsflashes include: the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' sequels weren't very good, Jamie Lee Curtis made quite a few horror movies, and if people wander outside in these sort of films they usually don't come back. It is, in short, an irritating and self-congratulatory film, lacking the smarts and creativity to subvert the clichés it feeds upon; they're talked about but nothing clever is done with them. This is no 'Cabin in the Woods' and Kevin Williamson is no Joss Whedon. Williamson's reign of ironic smuggery began with, and is summed up by, this tedious slasher, and I don't know what Wes Craven's so pleased about, as he covered similar ground with his 'New Nightmare'. Undeniably influential ? but not in a good way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first when I saw scream ( when I was younger) I thought it was kinda scary but now it is lame. The story, it has no story it is just about a group of teens who are getting murdered by a guy in a stupid costume. The Music, it wasn't that good but it was OK with speakers. The Special Effects It didn't have any or if it did there weren't many and they weren't that good. And a thing I hate and most horror movies have is the Killer never dies the first or disappears specially the 3rd one the killer gets shot about 5 times and then you find out he was wearing bullet proof vest. The sequels are just as bad the 2nd one is about the killer from the first mum is angry and wants and has revenge. I don't recommended this film especially for the kids because it is violent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the most harmful and irresponsible movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is hands-down the worst movie I have ever seen. I only sat all the way through it because I kept hoping that there would be something redeeming at the end. Something to justify the intense violence and sick "humor". There was nothing. The ending left me cold and feeling sick. Perhaps that's what Wes Craven wanted. To all the people that "loved" this movie: you really need to ask yourselves what you loved about it. You need to think about it very carefully and do some serious soul-searching. Personally, I actually felt violated after watching it. One of the few movies I've actually regretted watching. There was simply nothing positive to be gained from it. Moreover, I honestly believe that this is one of the most dangerous and irresponsible movies ever made. The studio never should have released it. How anyone could ever voluntarily sit through it more than once will be an eternal mystery to me. The most frightening thing about it was that it was a big hit.I know people will accuse me of "misunderstanding it" or other such crap, but let's examine the facts: what this movie is really about is greed, abo ve all else. Wes Craven's sick and horrific fascination with intensely graphic images of human guttings and dismemberment is truly shocking. He tries to sugar-coat it's stench with a little humor mixed it. He knows that makes it more palatable. He markets this dangerous mixture to impressionable youth, not caring about the consequences. Not caring that the human mind (especially a young mind) becomes desensitized to violence the more it's exposed to it. He wants this movie to be "cool" and seen over an over. He know he can achieve this by making it extremely violent and horrific. Rebellious youth will flock to it. They do, and he succeeds, not caring who he's harming, as long as he's getting rich. That's practically the definition of evil, if you ask me. To Wes Craven: shame on you!Maybe I'm just some old-fashioned, backwoods moron who's really uncool and beyond all hope... but will somebody please explain to me what's so entertaining about watching young people getting graphically hacked to pieces by a knife-wielding maniac? Why is this supposed to be funny? Why is this considered by so many people to be "cool"? This attitude embodies everything that is wrong with our society. I'm not a fascist, nor a religious right-wing republican in favor of censorship, but this type of garbage just should NOT be made. It's as simple as that. No good can possibly come from it.I would never recommend this movie to anyone - even to a mature adult with a strong stomach. Truly horrible!</fullReview>

Possibly the only thing worse is scream 2 where the killers are unrealistic. especially the male who has absolutely no good motive at all he is just put in so you cant guess who it will be. did wes make this film to try and make a mockery out of this genre to make it harder for the future generation as wes has moved on from horrors now. This film annoys me so much because i had so much respect for wes with such classics as,hills have eyes,last house on the left and of course nightmare on elm street.this is my opinion and I'm sure a lot of people will disagree but I'm also sure a lot of old school horror fans will see where I'm coming from.anyway i still have a lot of respect for wes but i am extremely disappointed with these films and its a pity they didn't flop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typical plot for a horror film. A group of teenagers are being murdered by someone who dresses in funny costume/masks. The deaths are pretty horrific, with plenty of heart-racing chase scenes and gory, creative deaths. This film seems to have gathered a cult following, probably because most people did find this film to be horrific. However, when I saw the film, I just laughed at the antics and the character dramas unfolding. It is suspenseful, and it is gory, and most people did consider this frightening. However, if you do not like this type of film or are looking for something a little more than a cliché, then do not bother with this one.

		<fullReview>I guess you could say that this is well done for what it is. The problem is that what it is, is disgusting garbage.Maybe that's a bit harsh. It has some redeeming qualities. There are, for instance, some wisecracks expressive of keen wit. "Jesus, bring the camera!" "My name isn't Jesus." (The old ones are the best, even if they creak a little at the joints.) Also, the pretty Neve Campbell gets to have sex and lose her virginity and yet she still survives the movie. This is an improvement over those slasher flicks in which only the whores gets disarticulated.Also, we can't NOT mention the parody of Edvard Munch's "The Scream," which, for Munch, meant something other than laughs. In this movie, one or more maniacs rush around town "gutting people" and draping their bodies across various facilities. There are a lot of sexual jokes but no nudity. We can't have the teen-aged audience looking at bare bodies, although no one objects to watching them slaughter each other while bathed in blood.It's a self-conscious slasher movie, meaning that Kevin Williamson, the writer, had the bright idea of building a slasher movie filled with clichés around a group of school kids who know that they're in a slasher movie filled with clichés. Whether or not it was intended as self parody, that's how it turns out.The ending involves a couple of maniacs who have decided to follow the dictates of the typical slasher movie, and a hand full of relatively normal people. Every tactic that generates suspense is put to use. A woman gets her hands on a pistol, for instance, but when she tries to shoot the lunatics it doesn't work because the safety is on. The gun is whipped out of her hand and she is belted into unconsciousness, only to rise later, bloodier but smarter.You have never seen so much blood, so many murders, or heard so many screams. There's so much of it that it becomes desemanticized and after a while your involvement becomes more mechanical than emotional. You can't help hoping that Neve Campbell doesn't get the knife stuck through her neck, and that the deranged duo get their just desserts, but it doesn't go beyond wishing for a happy ending. Or any kind of ending at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I landed on this little piece of obliviousness on a lazy summer night several years ago while I was flipping by the usual crap-show TV networks dump on us on an daily basis. I'm a very restless kind of guy by nature and virtue of my sign (not that I believe in astrology, but Sagittariuses never believe it) and couldn't go through the whole movie uninterrupted by a snack, a beer and an occasional pee. So I decided to watch it thoroughly not long ago and make up my mind what all the hype was about. I got seriously disappointed. Having enjoyed some of Wes Craven's works, including the original Nightmare on Elm Street(and the only one of the sequels worth watching twice), I expected the 'this movie resuscitated the dying horror genre' marketing strategy to live up to the hype. But to no avail. First off, let me get this straight: the 'horror genre' never died or has been sent to the ICU. Not since Halloween and Alien gave it a definitive boost, drove a spike into the heart of the 'B Movie' stigma and catapulted sci-fi and horror to their rightful heights. So I never bought the flat out lie that sells this mediocre movie and franchise as 'new flesh in the dark heart of cinema'. There's nothing new, nothing original, nothing worth wasting 1 hour and a half and the only heritage this movie may have spawned was a hundred miles of expensive film rolls in the form of 'I know what you did last summer' and a dumbing down of horror movie standards proudly carried over by the cult followers of bad taste. 2/10 for the effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a return to the slasher genre after it got somewhat "asleep" for some years. And it "woke up" again with this scary, scream of a film.The movie is scary from the start. What begins as a flirtatious but apparently harmless phone call from some guy turns out to be frightening. The guy begins to make strange questions and calls back whenever the girls hangs up the phone and makes serious threats. Soon very disturbing and gruesome things happen.More of these nightmarish events happen through the movie. The phone caller is disguised with a ghost mask on his face. The most unexpected surprise is that there are actually 2 "Ghostface" assassins. The movie is a nail-biter until the end as many terrifying events continue to happen until then.A dull terror/horror movie, but probably a landmark for those who appreciate the genre because it meant a return to the genre, particularly teens.None of the actors are great, although Drew Barrymore has probably her best acting in this small role. Neve Campbell is okay but I appreciated more her prettiness than her acting skills.</fullReview>
