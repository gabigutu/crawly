		<shortDescription>Things to learn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is only one other review on this page currently (dated 7 Aug 2016) but I think it sums things up nicely, and I find myself almost completely in agreement with it. There are, however, a few things I would like to add.I don't feel like I have wasted my time if the film has managed to maintain a smile on my face, and I can learn a few things along the way. In this case, the film definitely informs the viewer of several interesting things regarding the modern sex industry, while at the same time making a study of the struggling middle class and its increasing crossover into taking more desperate measures in order to get by.If I had to point out faults it would be that there are a few issues/sub plots the director raises but then doesn't fully address, and in fact just completely brushes them aside in order to provide the film with the desired ending.But to sum up, as long as you watch this film in a situation where sex topics are not going to cause embarrassment, I regard it as worth watching and a bit of fun.Oh, and I'll disagree with the other reviewer and say that Ashley Tisdale would by my pick. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MIssed the fundamental point of a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole point of a comedy is to make you laugh. This film doesn't. Instead they have created a nasty, cynical timid teenage boy's wet dream of movie.A distinct lack of charm, warmth or likability in the characters. Lazy, sloppy writing acted out by people who really should know better, even if they do have less than stellar careers, awful direction, desperate editing. God knows what those responsible thought they were making, although my guess is they didn't care. One of the few films I couldn't sit the whole way through and gave up around after about an hour.The one star goes to the editor of the trailer btw</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lifeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the plot - Unemployeed architect's wife finds a job for her husband online as a delivery driver, but the product to deliver turns out to be three exotic female sex performers. Oops! That wasn't explained in the ad online.Surely something funny is about to happen. Jason Biggs plays the sweet innocent husband that just wants his 9 to 5 job. He stumbles into a job in which he is 'on call' all night for the sexy hard nosed girls. There's horny students having a party, thugs, car chases, lots of action that is suppose to be funny. But funny never arrives here in this flick! Biggs looks like he's doing this role for the money and everybody else looks unrehearsed.It's too bad Directors: Lisa Addario, Joe Syracuse couldn't pull it together because I'm sure 'on paper' this story looked fun and funny. This flick is more funny to talk about with your friends than it is to watch; but you have to watch it to talk about it.Ugh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More akin to a male fetish submission porno than a comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't normally write reviews on IMDb but this movie was so painfully awful that I wanted to spare others from wasting their time and money.The characters are 2 dimensional, the plot is almost non existent and 90% of the movie consists of 3 women treating a desperate guy like he is nothing, which i'm sure would delight most feminists and a few men that are into that sort of thing, but any normal human being would be bored to death.I walked out of the movie half way in because there is nothing there to hold your interest either than some vague, poorly written plot. The movie really had no point or reason to exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfectly forgettable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film wasn't terrible. Not at all. But it wasn't anything special either. I had a decent enough story (apparently based on a true one), and was executed well enough (though I really don't think a smart guy like Guy would have made the bad decision he did at the end).Jason Biggs was the only reason I watched this movie, and he was the best part of it, playing basically the same character as American Pie. The only parts that made me laugh (2 or 3 times) were from him. Otherwise, the film was basically forgettable. I didn't regret watching it, but I could just as well have watched something else and not regretted missing this either.This doesn't have a rating listed, but for those wondering it would pretty much be rated R because of language and sexual content (though I don't really remember anything above PG-13 nudity).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Biggs is back! AMATEUR NIGHT is hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really diggin' this new little film, #AmateurNight starring #JasonBiggs, it's like the "Risky Business" for our generation. It's sexy, it's wild. I don't want to say that Biggs completely brings back his Jim persona from "American Pie" for his AMATEUR NIGHT character, Guy Carter, but there's definitely traces of Jim in that Guy Carter also has to confront certain sexual objects or sexual references and acts that he may not be familiar with and so that gives grounds for many of this comedy's hilarious moments.Guy Carter is an unemployed architecture graduate, he and his wife are expecting a baby and Guy is freakin' out because he has no means in which to provide and support his family. His wife, Anne, then finds him a job as a driver on Craigslist. Guy thinks it's some kind of pizza delivery job, turns out, it's a job where he has to drive sex workers around town from one clientele to another. That's where he meets the unapologetic Nikki (Janet Montgomery) and her two equally foul-mouthed cohorts, Jaxi (Ashley Tisdale) and Fallon (Bria Murphy). Guy's job is initially just their driver but as the night progresses, Guy also becomes sort of like their faux pimp, at the end, he proves to the girls and to himself that he has what it takes to be a responsible father.AMATEUR NIGHT essentially is a party movie, much of the pivotal moments in terms of the characters' growth takes place in this long wild bachelor's party scene and I have to give mad props to Janet Montgomery, Bria Murphy and Ashley Tisdale for their courage to wear those risqué costumes. They even nailed down the physically-demanding dances too. Which is why I have a lot of respect for the girls out there who are actually in this profession, I know the public often see them through judgmental eyes, but let's face it, this is not the kind of job anybody can just do.The dynamics between the three actresses and Jason Biggs is so fluid, they get each other's timing. And you see their characters' relationship evolve from them teaching this rookie, so to speak, to them sympathizing and wanting to help him. Biggs' character, Guy Carter, also goes from being reluctant to being glad that he doesn't miss out on this one crazy night. Obviously this is a very very low budget indie film, it doesn't hide it, it doesn't deny it, every shot of it shows, but it's so well done where at the end it, you feel for the characters, you care about them and you want them to be OK. Those who come in to watch this film with some kind of preconceived judgement, I think they'll come out of the theaters realizing that all of us, one way or another, are just doing what we can, whatever work we can get, in order to survive each day, to get by and to provide for ourselves and our families.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was very mediocre, but I like it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a bad movie at all but nothing to get excited over. It's very bland in it's implantation of the plot.I've seen this before. The economy is bad and Jason Biggs plays a highly college educated man who can't get a job in his field. He can't wait any longer, because his out of work wife is having a baby, and they have no insurance for it, so he takes the first job that's offered to him: A job as a driver for a group of strippers.Jason Biggs was right for the role as the main protagonist. He brings a sweetness to the whole movie. His innocence is believable without being too melodramatic.I thought it was interesting that they did not bring up the strippers dark side to why they became strippers. Early on the movie explains it's about the money and it's good money and it's a job and nothing else, which is pretty much the prime basis of the movie is that everyone needs a job. It's not that the dark side of stripper would have added anything to the light comedy, it's just one cliché they seem to have left out.I did like how the strippers were portrayed in the film. It's very new era, showing just how in control they are of the situation, which is how it should be and hope that the film statement of being semi-true is getting that accurate.Plus all the girls were sexy, especially Bria Murphy. can't help to cross my mind what Papa Eddie thinks of the film.Anyway, the story has the potential to leave a mark, but it's not a decent enough comedy. You'll watch it, have fun, and a minute later forget all about it.http://cinemagardens.com</fullReview>
