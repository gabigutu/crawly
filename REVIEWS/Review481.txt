		<shortDescription>Utterly delightful and a must-see!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is sooo much I like with this movie. It has imagination, a sense of wonder and characters you either love or hate. And the blend of live action and stop-motion animation is a delight. The songs incorporated in this story is not very memorable but sweet and fit their purpose. And you simply have to love to hate Margoyles and Lumley in their parts as the aunts from hell. They treat poor James so horribly that I thought that "Cinderella had it easy"! Compared to "nightmare before Christmas" I actually liked this movie better. It has more of a heart even if the story itself may be just a bit less interesting and inventive. There are so many good scenes but among the highlights is the arctic adventure and the New York sequence. But, mind you, the opening is very deceptive and might scare younger parts of the audience. Otherwise, a must-see!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Peach of a Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James and the Giant Peach may not have the cult status of Nightmare Before Christmas, but, aside from mixing live-action bookends with the all-animated center of the film (not a great idea; should have been all-animation), it's a faithful and wonderful adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic dream-like story. The animation is superb, the voice talent wonderful (Susan Sarandon's sexy Eastern European Miss Spider takes the cake), and, as Time Magazine said, the film in many ways surpasses the book. Though there are flaws in the screen story by Karey Kirkpatrick, their effect on the overall emotional ride of the film is negligible. After seeing it again recently (first time in several years), I was amazed at what an incredibly beautiful film it is, beautiful colors and design and effects like teacup clouds and the cloud rhino. I especially loved the mechanical shark and the ships' arctic graveyard sequence where Centipede redeems himself by diving into the water to find a compass to get the peach back on course. Overall, a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And Now The Weather Forecast: Rhino Has A Giant Cold...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a pleasant feel good film this little gem is !After the sugar and sweet opening, including a hair raising song in the very worst Disney Style, Burton and Dahl break in and off we go, on an adventure that is fun and cheeky and in which not all the sharp edges have been blunted, thank Goodness.Before we can go on a journey with the Giant Peach however, first Little James have to be orphaned. And he is, in a matter of fact voice-over that makes for a surprise element here. A bold way to get the plot in motion, and it works ! Many keep on wandering what or who that rhino was, that took the life of the parents just like that, on a whim. Well, anybody can be swept away by the rhino in the sky, or so the nasty aunties will have you believe anyway...The visuals are stunning, the dialogues are bubbling fizzing electrical fun and brought wonderfully and lovingly by a great cast, and direction is clear cut, sharp and focused.A lovely film, that makes you wonder what is Selnick &amp; Burton and what's genuine Roald Dahl.A splendid film that makes you go out and want to read a great book (again). What more can we possibly ask of a peach?Hmmm, well ... about that Rhino in the stormy clouds ... Maybe ... If it's based in Britain, couldn't we tempt it to take a holiday somewhere in, say, Bora Bora or the Halls of Montezuma ? The English are quite accustomed to their climate, but their rhino gives us, here in the Lowlands, more than our share of rain and sleet too !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised that people thought this film was average, or so-so. I found it to me a movie that was so much fun to watch.Starts out live-action, than it seagues into stop-motion animation. Some of the scenes are very memorable (the pirate attack) and the voices are delightful. Not as good as Nightmare Before Christmas, but every bit as imaginative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The book is better, but a nice adaption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a child James and the Giant Peach was one of my favorite books, so it was interesting to see how it would be formatted into a film. They actually did a pretty good job, although the book is much better. The animation was nicely done, and I liked the way the characters changed from life form to animated form- it gave the film a real surreal type of film. The songs were quite poor, and were obviously aimed at the kids to 'liven' things up a bit, after all some may say the story ventures on the dark side of things. It's nice to see a film aimed at children that can also appeal to adults as well, although it does help that many of us are very familiar with Roald Dahl's stories. In summary quite a good effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colorful, Inventive Dahl Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's another inventive film, based on a book by the famous author of child books, Roald Dahl, who wrote "Charlie And The Chocolate Factory."The animation, featuring stop-action stick figures, is outstanding, as are the colors. Each character is unique, like none I've seen before in other animated flicks. Not only the characters, but how they are dressed. (i.e. long gloves and stockings on a spider). The aunts in here are a real hoot to look at, particularly the one with the pronounced teeth.The storyline is simple and there is absolutely nothing offensive including no typical Disney New Age baloney. The only warning I would give is there is a bit too much violence for very small kids and the ending is a bit silly for adults.This is a musical, which I did not expect, and the songs are nothing special. There are not a lot of them: five to be exact. In all, good entertainment and a good visual and audio film for a nice DVD system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic in my home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed it, and so did my 3- and 5-year-old (and yes, we read the book). The animation and live-action scenes showed a lot of love. Though elements of the story seemed a bit hurried or neglected, they weren't anything a fairy-tale fantasy couldn't absorb in stride. The music works well enough for this non-fan of musicals, and I prefer serviceable and inoffensive tunes to the treacly jingles and melodramatic scores of the usual Disney classics.My only real complaint would be with the ending, as it really is unclear how the aunts drove across the ocean (did they obtain their own crocodile tongues?), and the slice of NY upon landing has a grim, Munchkin-town quality. Still, everything up to that point has left you with lots of goodwill towards the movie's makers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"One of the greatest movies based on Roald Dahl's books"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was an enormous fan of Roald Dahl's books when I was kid. I think of him as the Hands Christian Anderson of the 20th century. I didn't read all of Dahl's books but I read most of them. I've also seen most of the movies based on his books. Out of all the Roald Dahl books I read as child I would say that 'Charlie And The Chocolate Factory' is my favorite but 'James And The Giant Peach' is my second favorite. The reason why I would say these two books are my favorites is because they're both about children who live miserable lives until a magical experience changes their lives forever and both end up becoming the luckiest kids in the world. For Charlie, his life changes with a tour of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, but for James it's with a magical giant peach and group very friendly creatures.I first remember hearing about this movie back in late 1996 when it was released in America during the Christmas holidays and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I had to wait until the Easter Holidays before this movie arrived in Australia. I certainly loved it. James's two horrible aunt's who are nothing except cruel and nasty. Are as horrible in the movie as they are in the book.I really loved the creatures from the peach which I remember (from the book) James describing them as "The friendliest creatures in the world". These creatures include Grasshopper, Earthworm, Centipede, Ladybug, Spider and Glowworm. My two favorite character's are Spider because her French accent made her a very smooth character and Centipede because of his sense of humor. I also liked the songs. My favorite was "We're Family" which the creatures use to express how much they love James. I certainly believe these creatures are the best family any child could have. So for anyone who loved Roald Dahl's books as a child, you must...must see this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James and the Giant Peach was for me one of the most magical animation movie i have ever seen. I enjoyed every part of this film, the music the dancing and most of all the unique voice of Ms. Ladybug she was the best. Most of the times when i get sad i just play that first song that James sang it truly lifts my spirit, even though it made me cry. I also must say that James two aunts acted well in this movie even though they where monsters i enjoyed them. overall this is a great movie for anyone who likes adventure a family movie that brings sadness and joy altogether. James and the Giant Peach i give it a 9/10 for its well casted and well acted which for me made this movie a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, mediocre adaptation of a great book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James and the Giant Peach is a beloved book by Roald Dahl, and unfortunately, the love was not mutual for the movie. Henry Selick, director of the "Nightmare Before Christmas", did some good things and some bad things with the story, luckily most were good.James is an orphan, after his parents were killed by an escaped rhino from the zoo. He lives with his awful Aunts Spiker and Sponge. One night, a strange man gives James some magic worm-looking things (He says what they are, but it's a long list), which escape and end up going into the peach tree. A giant peach is grown, which gives his aunts the idea to charge people to see it. One night James goes into the giant peach, becomes clay animated, and meets some big bugs who have also become clay animated, and the adventure begins.Many translations from the book don't make sense. The rhino is in the sky, and the climax of the movie has James fighting the sky rhino, which was ridiculous. The mechanical shark is also quite bizarre. The plot bounces around, never really going anywhere that's important. But with the negatives, comes the positives. This movie looks really great. The whole film is very stylish, from the dark beginning to the lively animated middle to the special effect heavy ending. James is also a likable kid, as are the bugs, so the characters are pretty good.Overall, this is a pretty good movie, that could've been a masterpiece.My rating: *** out of ****. 77 mins. PG for mild language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to watch this movie for a while. There are not many around animated this way and I did love The Nightmare before Christmas and Coraline. So, I finally gave it a try. I was not particularly impressed. I found the story somehow bland and uninspiring. Also, any little moral message in it is basically lost in a number of events that I presume are supposed to be exciting but are rather dull. The songs are not really bad, although they don't save the film. Perhaps I'm just too old for this, although I still love other family films like the ones mentioned at the beginning. I find this film just OK, I wouldn't watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it ain't broke, don't fix it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(A word of WARNING: Unless you've already seen this movie or have read the book, I highly do not recommend reading this review unless you want those dreaded SPOILERS!)'James and the Giant Peach' by Roald Dahl is one of my favorite books. And I'm glad I got to read it before I watched the movie, because it's many times better. The movie's animation, character design, and visual effects are wonderful, but it pretty much stops there. Secondly, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." I could say that about so many movie adaptations of books, and this is one of them. I wonder if the screenwriters even READ the book before they wrote this? So many parts of the book were missing, and sorely missed. I was distraught that the Cloud Men (who appear during the best part of the book) were replaced by ghost pirates. Ghost pirates have been done too many times, but how many times have you seen Cloud Men? And what was with that mechanical shark, and the rhino in the clouds? In the book, the rhino (which killed James' parents) escaped from the zoo, but in the movie it just appears out of nowhere. And then we have Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker, who were done away with early on in the book, somehow went across the Atlantic ocean in an old car. All I have to say is, "What?"Randy Newman music is good in stuff like Toy Story movies, but here it'll make you be thankful for the fast forward button. The songs really have no reason for being there, and you won't miss a thing when you skip them.Aside from that, this was a pretty fine film, but why did the writers stray so much from the book? True, a movie adaptation doesn't have to follow everything in the book it's based on (like 'Willy Wonka'), but it needs to follow just enough. But I did like the Centipede. Just as nasty as he was when I read about him!6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre and Annoying (May contain some spoilers!!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What could be a very beautiful and captivating story was a wasted unusually long 79 minutes of time. The human characters were very annoying. The music (sorry Randy Newman)was terrible. The score was not bad, but the songs simply reeked.As far as the story, I confess that I've never read the book that it's based on, but I found parts of it charming, and other parts a bit strange. Ok, the abused orphan boy, and magical giant peach, leading to boy's escape to NY is very nice. The fantasy elements are introduced by these glowing green seeds which produce the peach.. and therefore everything inside is fantasy. But what about these other absurities? What's with the mechanical shark? What's this rhinocerous that comes from a storm cloud and kills James' parents?Don't get me wrong, I love absurdities. But I also like consistency and this movie just seems to have no guidelines of what should be fantasy and what should be reality.Sad but true, the most entertaining aspect of this film was the amusement I received from James' speech impediment, ("I'm not afwaid of you!"). On a side note, just like "Nightmare before Christmas", the animation is great! But this movie sadly needed some Burton and Elfman touches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully creative and imaginative film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a creative and imaginative film, though it's really weird, so prepare yourself if you watch this. I was surprised by how much I actually liked this movie. I mean, I expected it to be good, maybe around a 6/10, but after watching it I'd probably give it a 8/10. The stop motion animation looks really awesome, especially for the time. What I think really makes it stand out though is just how wacky and creative it gets. It serves as an outlet for anything absurd and over the top, while being grounded by a simple story and simple, relatable characters. It does have issues though. There's this song at the beginning of the movie sung by the main kid actor, and I'm not going to lie, it sucked really bad. The kid just couldn't sing and I certainly could have gone without it. Also I don't like the ending. The way it ended left me believing that magic actually did exist in the movie's universe and I thought it would have been a better film if the kid had made it up all in his head to cope with the loss of his parents. Maybe that's a little dark, but it would have been really interesting for a kid's movie to have that underlying tone. Still, it's a pretty great film and it's perfect for the family (except my family, as they all hated it, yet they'll watch The Nut Job and laugh all the way through. Why?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I remembered, though not quite as good as Coraline or The Nightmare Before Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this soon after it first came out, when I was about 11 or 12. I was really disappointed in it then - I couldn't get over all the changes from the book.Fifteen or so years later, I've rewatched it, having become familiar with Henry Selick's other work. And this time I really enjoyed it.The animation is high quality, despite being less ambitious than Selick's two other major films (the animated parts of James and the Giant Peach make up a film only about half the length of Coraline, and there aren't any of the huge crowds of characters that filled The Nightmare Before Christmas).The songs, however, are nowhere near as good as those of The Nightmare Before Christmas. The less said about James' solo song at the start of the film the better. The only really good song in the movie also happens to be the only one that takes its lyrics from a rhyme in Dahl's book.Now that this film has surprised me by being better than I remembered, despite its big changes from the book, perhaps I should give Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory another chance to do the same...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless stop-motion/live action entertainment although not a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James and the Giant Peach is a stop motion/live action adaptation of the late Roald Dahl's book in the early 60s when being transitioned into film (like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The BFG, The Witches, Matilda, and The Fantastic Mr. Fox) about a young boy named James, who climbs into the peach and meets anthropomorphic stop-motion insects and stumbles upon an adventure of a lifetime. Many critics and fans of Roald Dahl alike were amazed about how faithful this movie was to the book, but there are two problems that I do have with this adaptation.1) The beginning was quite dark and might frighten younger kids along with other scenes.2) The rhino in the sky and the scene where James battles it wasn't explained enough. That's it for the criticism.The positive aspects of this movie were excellent. The live action sets and the stop-motion animation have an astounding charm to the book. The character designs are pretty unique and the Jack Skellington cameo as the captain of the skeletons was amazing. The acting is very superb. The stop-motion insects were good, the two mean aunts named Spike and Sponge were tolerable, and the main character James is very likable. Even the action is very good. Music/songs written by Randy Newman (The Toy Story trilogy, The Princess and the Frog) were surprising good. Although not a masterpiece, James and the Giant Peach is an enjoyable family entertainment that stays faithful to the story from a great author.8/10</fullReview>

What Dahl needs is someone who can appreciate the dark and morbid humor to be found in his stories -- they DON'T need to be given the sanitized Disney treatment.Still, this is only a so-so version of the book, one of my absolute favorites when I was a child. The animation is cool, but there was no way the filmmakers were going to be able to compete with my childhood memories of reading this book over and over again.It's probably not even fair for me to review the movie for that very reason.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peachy, Just Like The Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1996 Disney filmization of Roald Dahl's first book for children, 1961's "James and the Giant Peach," is a delightful confection that, like its original, should prove as much fun for the adults as the kiddies. The film hews fairly closely to its source material, with some important differences, and really is quite the exemplar of modern-day animation arts. In it, we are introduced to James Henry Trotter, an orphaned boy whose miserable existence with his two witchlike aunts takes a decided turn for the better when a mysterious old man gives him a bagful of magical green crystals. These crystals cause the previously barren peach tree in his front yard to grow the titular giant fruit, and James soon meets, inside the stone of the fruit, six new friends, giants all: a grasshopper, a spider, an earthworm, a glowworm, a ladybug and a centipede (the book's silkworm character, for some reason, has been omitted). The seven make a hazardous trans-Atlantic journey to NYC aboard the peach, a journey that tests the mettle of each of the team indeed. The film differs from Dahl's book in that the journey to NYC is a goal, rather than a happy accident. The film also tones down the book's violence (James' aunts are not killed in the film), turns the shark into some kind of killer robot, and, most unwisely, drops the entire sequence with the Cloud Men in favor of a haunted pirate ship not at all present in Dahl's text. The nature of the rhino that ate James' parents is also, strangely, much altered. The filmmakers have added some musical numbers to the mix, and although Randy Newman's charms are usually lost on me, I found his five contributions here to be quite entertaining. The picture blends live action, stop-motion animation and what looks to be (in James' dream) animated collages seamlessly and effectively, and the whole production really is something of a technical marvel. Despite the changes, this is one very winning entertainment indeed.</fullReview>

The boy actor is fine here as is Joanna Lumley OBE and Miriam Margolyes OBE as his despicable aunts, Spiker and Sponge, who get custody of him as a child. They really are deliciously evil in their roles and they look like they are having a ball at it too. I thought the story was quite interesting with the animation and live action. The film is good for both adults and children as well as family can view it together. I thought the costumes of Spike and Sponge were hilarious. You could not tell that Spiker also plays half of Absolutely fabulous from this role. The make-up, the costumes, and visual effects are worth watching and it's good to watch this film.</fullReview>

Everything else is done poorly, especially the songs and the acting from Paul Terry (James).This film has so much set up with no pay off and leaves things that are crucial parts of the story unexplained or illogical. For instance, what was that giant rhino and if it was just smoke and noise how did it eat the parents? What was the mechanical shark? Where did Pete Postlethwaite's character come from? See what I mean?In all honesty, the animation was fantastic and the sets did have a Tim Burton-esque feel to them, but that is about it. If you are looking for a clumsy, unorganized and not too thought out movie, than look no further than "James and the Giant Peach".</fullReview>

The look of the film is splendid, with bright colours in most scenes and some very memorable scenes such as the killer sharks, and the peach was stupendous. The script is very clever and funny, especially with Centipede, who has some truly hilarious lines. The performances are exceptional, Paul Terry is very appealing as James and Pete Postelthwaite delights as the mysterious man, who is responsible for changing James's life forever. There is also a terrific voice cast, including Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon and David Thewlis who breathe fresh air into the screenplay, but it is certainly Miriam Margoyles and Joanna Lumley as the ghastly aunts who steal the show. I do however have two complaints of the film. I did find Randy Newman's songs forgettable, and they occasionally mar the film's pacing, and Paul Terry's singing voice just was a bit weak. Other than that, it is a delightful film, with an 8/10. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James and the Giant Peach a classic on dvd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i just watched a quality film named "james and the giant peach", i have to say i was very impressed on all levels of the film: the acting was good, the soundtrack was awesome by a couple of good medleys by randy newman, the story was quite interesting, but above what intrigued is that the character of james is a character many people cant identify with. now some idiot might say what identify with a kid who gets converted to small size and spends his adventures inside a giant peach with insects at his friends? lol it's that kind of narrow thinking by a narrow critic that tries to subdue the great qualities and messages the film has, and i will explain them all and you will see this film is not just a film for kinds to enjoy but adults too, adults who don't have any inspiration to follow their dreams like james does.story:james (paul terry) is a nice and quite moral little boy who has two loving parents. while near the beach, he and his mom get killed (although this is not shown since it's a pg film) by a rhinoceros. yes this is a fantasy film in part and there are many magical elements in the film. james custody then is then taken over by two ugly aunts: aunt spiker (joanna lumley from "absolutely fabulous" fame) and aunt sponge (miriam margolyes) who are classic examples of adults who abuse their children. they are the classic example of the trash and evil nature that exist in all wretched adults who seek exploit others for their wealth. in fact, james's aunts use him as basically a slave to work around the house. they starve him and feed the breadcrumbs that are in the trash. they yell at him when james wants to make new friends and talk to kids who he can't relate to. nah it doesn't get much lower than quality of life aunt sponge and aunt spiker have on james. one day a mysterious man gives james a mysterious bag full of crocodile tongues I believe, which he says are magic and can make James dreams come true. In this case, James dream was to go to New York City and see Empire State Building. It was actually both James parent's dreams and James dream. However, even though James parent's are long gone, James still wants to go to New York an accomplish the dream he and his parents set out to do. This is one impressive kid, he has a big heart and the kind of determination that almost no adults have nowadays. That's one lesson of the film right there , which is not to give up on one's dream, it's literally embodied in this great kid.So this special bag of magic combines with a small peach to grow into a gigantic peach which Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker capitalize for their own selfish profits!!!! Now if you think this made James's life any easier youd be wrong. Nope James's life continues as before, even worse as his rich selfish Aunt have become greedier and more manipulative and more vindictive. It's hard to believe that these "aunts" are the blood relative of James. Now before I go on, I couldn't help but think of James and Harry Potter. Sure Harry Potter was an orphan, but he and James are taken in by their slimy relatives who basically want to exploit and abuse them without any rights whatsover. Potter eventually escapes his vile relatives and so does James. Potter becomes one of the most loved characters at Hogwarts and James also near the end (without revealing too much) becomes one of the most loved kids in the world. Anyhow James interests in the peach grows huge to the point with the aid of the magic bad of tongues , James becomes magically converted to small size and invades the beach. Inside the beach, James discovers a group of zany characters all symbolizing common day insects who have now made James the center of attention. James meeting the characters of Mr. Grasshopper (Simon Callow), Mr. Centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), Ms. Ladybug (Jane Leeves from Frasier), Ms. Spider (Susan Sarandon), learns that they have been watching him as he is mistreated by his aunts and know that James dreams of going to New York City. Eventually James learns that the characters not only want to go with him but they are going to help him on his journey as well. This is a great movie about friendship as well. Let's face facts it's not likely James would have gone to New York on his own, but these group of wonderful friends give the help and encouragement to do it, when he needs it.When James and the group decide on a plan to go to New York City, they're journey is stalled by several dangerous adventures which include a metallic shark, dead caribbean pirates, and the hazardous condition which threaten to end their journey. However that isn't stopping anyone and James and his friends, as a group are determined to make it New York and James is determined to make his and his parents dream come true....As you can see you can describe the movie any better than better, and the movie itself is loaded with amazing special effects that elevate this entertaining fantasy world that James has now come into contact with. In fact when I first looked at the effects, I thought I was watching another classic fantasy film like in "The Nightmare Before Christmas", and guess what both films were directed by the same great director, Henry Selick. I was success and an eye for greatness embodied in fantasy is a signature for Selick. He really outdoes himself here.Sony Imageworks and a trio of great animators provide the stop motion technology and animation that make the world of James and The Giant Peach so fantastic. Speaking of fantastic the voice talents in this film are all great with Sarandon, Dreyfuss , Leeves, and David Thewlis as Mr. Earthworm are great, you can tell that they captured the characters really well, but the person who outshines them is Paul Terry as James, he give's quite a performance and I couldn't think anyone better to do the role he did.So as you can see James and The Giant Peach is far from being just a kids flick, it's that kind of stupid attitude that shows the true ignorance of so called critics who we'll miss out on the many meanings of films like "James and The Giant Peach". In fact one critic even mentioned that the film brings up ideas by Karl Marx for example the relationship of the slave, and master which are true in some regard, but above this a film that really does capture the spirit of having a dream and not quitting until he or she achieves that dream, because as you watch the ending, you can see in the ending, that James's dream really affects many people, not just himself.I could go and on about how great "James and The Giant Peach" but I think I've nailed everything good about it, all that's left now is to recommend the film to those who haven't seen it.DVD Details:Ah, the DVD is excellent coming up with several extra features:*Commentary*Behind the scenes on the making of the movie* A special music video by Randy Newman who wrote several songs for the movie* A beautiful transfer of the movie shown in letterbox format.*Theatrical trailer* About 13 character sketches on the characters themselves giving a glimpseinto the artistic process of the film* Dolby Digital Surround sound.As you can see a good DVD definitely worth checking out especially if you want more details about the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget all the other stupid children's films, trying to be "cute", and only succeeding in being boring and tame. You know, typical Disney stuff, with incompetent acting and no imagination at all. Well, this film has it all: more imagination than you can think of(with animation that finally serves the purpose of the film, which is very very rare), voices of Susan Sarandon, Simon Callow and Richard Dreyfuss (which are at least "inspired")and beautiful production design. Did I mention the memorable score? Just listen when the actors sing "Family" ! (kudos to Randy Newman, who also wrote the score for TOY STORY 2, another great kids' film, that can be enjoyed by adults too) The young boy(Terry)is also pretty good, instead of being annoying, like so many others and the aunts(Lumley and Margoyles with heavy make-up!)are...well, cruel. Imaginatively directed by Selick. If only there were more like him. In a way, this film reminded me of another imaginative (though more adult)tale, THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN. The heart is also in the right place here and I think that should make up for the few frightening scenes: they are never mean-spirited and so kids shouldn't be frightened by them.SEE IT, SEE IT, SEE IT! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as trying to translate the magical world that Dahl creates in this and his other novels, this movie is on point. It shows James magical journey and helps to capture the childhood innocence that James embodies throughout the movie. Visually the movie is stunning using both computers and stop motion animation to create something that couldn't be done in real life. But the fact that this is a Disney picture really surprises me, the subtle reference to psychotropic drugs, the gift of the old man, and the somewhat darker theme of the death of James' parents along with the truly wicked aunts. It strays away from what they typically do there at Disney, make movies to make money, and makes a movie which is both engrossing and rather good artistic vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know. This movie could have used a lot of work. It just wasn't good to me. I thought the storyline was a little out of date. For example, in the book, James' parents got killed by a rhino that ran away from the zoo. In this movie, it was a big rhino that literally came from the sky, and it symbolized something like James overcoming his fears. At the end of the movie, you were left asking yourself, "Huh?"I guess the animation was cool, but the music was annoying. Let's be honest, Disney hasn't made any memorable songs since The Lion King. The music in this basically sucked. The song, "My Name Is James," was annoying. It just kept saying "James, James, James . . ." to the point where you would just want to put your fist through the movie screen. This movie could have been a lot better, and I guess it should have lived more up to the book. I don't know. It's just my opinion. I could be wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roald Dahl, Disney-style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH is a good watch if you like seeing classic works of children's fiction being given the commercial, Walt Disney treatment: i.e. the shoehorning-in of random American characters and an incessant, action-focused narrative that barely gives you a moment to draw breath.This film was made by The Nightmare Before Christmas's Henry Selick, still riding high on the coat-tails of his successful cult feature. It's that film's inferior cousin in every respect, feeling cheap and uninteresting throughout; the characters are poorly drawn and the protagonist unsympathetic, so it's very hard to like the film at all. It might look like Dahl's original book, but it has none of the magic or atmosphere.I always enjoy seeing stop motion animation wherever it appears, but it does look very cheap here - among the cheapest I've seen. It's no surprise that half the film takes place (boringly) in live action, as they ran out of budget for the animation. On the plus side we get a Pete Postlethwaite cameo, but on the minus side we get Joanna Lumley and Miriam Margoyles hamming it up in the worst pantomime tradition. The worst voice actor of the plot? Richard Dreyfuss, who wouldn't understand restraint if it bit him on the backside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun family movie although some ideas it has are odd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays, the concept of stop-motion animation is quite unpopular. Thankfully it hasn't died but it is unfortunately not resorted to that often anymore. During the early 1990s, this classic and unique animation technique began getting dropped from film projects because of its "next best" replacement - CGI. With the demonstration of Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), that CGI could be controlled and used correctly, many movie studios want it to be in their upcoming projects. For that reason alone, stop-motion animation was left behind when it came to live-action films. But there were others who thought differently. Also in the early 1990s The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) was released to the public and became one of the greatest holiday films of its decade. Behind the wheel of this vehicle was a small time filmmaker named Henry Selick. Since then his filmography has been quite small but to this day has made sure his films contained stop-motion in it. His second feature would be just as memorable to kids who grew up during this time and that was this.Based on a children's book by Roald Dahl, the story is about a English youth named James (Paul Terry) who looks to visit New York City but lives under the strict rule of his aunts Sponge and Spiker (Miriam Margolyes &amp; Joanna Lumley) after the death of his parents. Then, unbeknownst to him, a stranger (Pete Postlethwaite) appears and gives him magical trinkets that'll help make his dreams come true. This arrives in the form of a giant peach that harbors future insect friends. These characters are Mr. Grasshopper (Simon Callow), Mr. Centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), Mrs. Ladybug (Jane Leeves), Ms. Spider (Susan Sarandon) and Mr. Worm (David Thewlis). The adaptation of Dahl's book was written by Karey Kirkpatrick (Chicken Run (2000)), Jonathan Roberts (The Lion King (1994)) and Steve Bloom (Jack Frost (1998)) and for the majority of the film, it's practically the same. Plus, the character development and overall message of the story is well thought out and optimistic.The character development focuses on learning to accept one's differences and understand how each individual brings unique benefits to certain situations. The overall message in the story is to never stop believing and always look on the positive side of things. These are life lessons that everyone needs to know about no matter how old you are when viewing this film. For acting, although Paul Terry quit the profession not long after this film, for a child actor he's not bad (or annoying). His appearance is innocent and feels genuine in physical form and voice work. Miriam Margolyes and Joanna Lumley as James' aunts are quite the opposite and they do it well. Being gross and greedy is their shtick. The supporting cast of voice actors who bring James' bug friends to life are enjoyable too. Simon Callow as Mr. Grasshopper plays quite the upperclassmen that isn't snooty enough to talk to someone below his level. Richard Dreyfuss as the wisecracking centipede has a number of funny lines either when it comes to himself or certain situations he's in.Jane Leeves as Mrs. Ladybug is sweet and also shows feminine strength when called for. David Thewlis as Mr. Worm plays with a Scottish accent and sometimes fears the worst but too learns to cope. Lastly Susan Sarandon as Ms. Spider uses a Russian accent and although she's a bit colder than her counterparts, she too has a charming attitude. However even with these positives the writing isn't perfect. One of the screenplays biggest blunders is its continuity. There were moments where claims are made about certain dangers and yet a minute later, the labeled danger will no longer be a threat for unexplained reasons. Another example is how James and co. weren't able to find their way to NYC without a compass, yet a map that James has clearly shows them which direction they are traveling as they move. Seems a little pointless to go find something that'll help you when you already have what you need. The other problem is that the way this story was written is the strange reality that James' lives in feels illogical.For this, there are certain things that should have an expected facial reaction but the exact opposite is portrayed. It just doesn't look right. For animation, as mentioned before stop-motion was used and it looks great. The jagged and tangible like edges to the characters give them a likable visual appeal. The live-action is also well done too. This also goes hand-in-hand with both live-action and animated cinematography provided by Hiro Narita and Pete Kozachik respectively. Narita's work efficiently shows the contrast between James' past and current life and how all the fun was sucked out of it. Kozachik on the other hand effectively conceals the illusion of various matte painting backdrops to help make the animated world feel bigger than life. Lastly Randy Newman composed the film score a year after the massive success of his work on Disney's Toy Story (1995). Here Newman's music feels like his, but also has bits that sound like Danny Elfman got in on a few areas too. Either way it is fun to listen to and with its catchy songs.The script has decent character development and has important life lessons for people to reacquaint themselves with despite it having some noticeable continuity errors. Also some characters react oddly to certain implausible situations as if they were entirely acceptable. This aside, the characters are charming, the music is enjoyable and the visuals are delightfully engaging with the help of stop-motion animation.</fullReview>

We get another taste of that here. Selick directs, Burton produced... it may be a bit less Burtonesque because it is based on a Roald Dahl book, but I feel like some of their sensibility still got in there, especially with the aunts.Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a positive review, praising the animated part, but calling the live-action segments "crude." I would have to agree with that. I liked the live-action bits, but they seemed out of place and it might have been best to go full-animation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for adults or children of any age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic from the classic 1961 children's novel by Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) was created and directed by Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas) in 1995, five years after Dahl's death. Dahl had refused numerous film proposals for the book, but his widow approved this one. Selick's plan was to make either the insect companions or the entire film stop-motion animation, but due to budgetary concerns, the film is approximately 1/3 live action time-wise, and completely stop-motion animation during the peach journey adventure, which works just fine. Newcomer Paul Terry does a fine job as James, both in the live acting and the voice-work. However Joanna Lumley should definitely be indicted for and convicted of scene theft, if not film theft, as one of James's two vicious aunts. The stop-motion insects are voiced by Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, Jane Leeves, David Thewlis, and (my favorite) Susan Sarandon as a mysterious Spider. In the live-action part, Pete Postlethwaithe has an important role. I have not read the original much-loved and much-revered (especially in the UK) novel, so I cannot comment on the film's faithfulness. However, as an adult I found the film cute, interesting, enjoyable, and entertaining -- and at 79 minutes it never palls. It's a film that can and will be enjoyed by viewers of all ages, so it's excellent for multiple generations and thus, for instance, holiday and other family gatherings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James had a happy life in the English seaside about to travel to NYC. His parents are killed by an imagined rhinoceros and he has to live with his evil Aunt Spiker and Aunt Sponge. He saves a spider from Spiker. A mysterious man (Pete Postlethwaite) gives him a bag of magic which holds the possibility of going to NYC. James trips and drops the magic in the garden. A peach starts to grow on a barren tree. Spiker and Sponge sell tickets to see the giant peach. That night, James takes a bit of the peach and climbs into it. As he climbs inside, it turns into stop motion animation.I really dislike the live action start or ending of the movie. It's not only ugly but it's also tiresome. It's meant to be magical but it reminds me of the badly made Popeye. There is no arguing that the stop motion animation is something amazing. It is imaginative and filled with fun characters. It's also great to see Jack again. The movie could probably use some good catchy pop songs. The reliance on Randy Newman is something done back then and there is no breakout song from this movie. It's an obvious deficiency to do all those talky Broadway songs. It would be better to push more towards action adventures with a consistent villain chasing them. It should have kept up with the rhinoceros as a constant threat. James should have done several hand-to-hand combat with the rino more than that one magical confrontation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very carefree and sweet (like peaches) live action/computer animated movie based on Roald Dahl children's novel, James and the Giant Beach.In the movie, James has to go live with his two horrible aunts, Aunt Spiker and Aunt Sponge, after the death of his parents. After saving a spider, he obtains crocodile tongues in his garden and an enormous peach grows from it. In the peach, he meets animated versions of the spider he saved earlier and a host of other multi-legged animals including the Centipede, Ladybug and Grasshopper. They help James escape his unhappy home and journey to the City of New York.In this movie, you get some nice memorable characters, interesting stop-motion animation, clever imagination and a catchy song to sing-along with called "We're Family." The rest of the songs and music score were sub-par. The song Paul Terry (James) sings called "My Name is James" is too melancholy and dreary for me, no harmony or melodies, and the actor himself didn't seem fit for the role - lack of emotion and interest.The overall movie did not have the captivating adventures, magic and fun I enjoy from many other animated films; therefore, I've only found the film to be average as far as entertainment is concerned. However, since this film does have the elements of a child's innocence and imagination, this would be a fine film to show to little kids, but not one to sit together to watch with the entire family.Grade C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "Peach" may be implausible, but it's inspired nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be a split reaction from critics and audiences alike when talking about Henry Selick's 1996 stop-motion animated feature "James and the Giant Peach". While the critics (particularly Gene Siskel) highly praise this picture and call it a wonderful children's fantasy, the audiences don't seem to care much for it. Maybe it's because this picture may be too weird for them like many of the films made by Tim Burton, who's one of the film's producers. Personally, I don't know what to make of this film even after seeing it plenty of times except that I can see where both sides are coming from. We follow a young British boy named James (Paul Terry) whose parents were killed by a rhinoceros (don't ask how or why since the picture never explains that). He's forced to live with his two despicable aunts (Miriam Margolyes, Joanna Lumley) where he has to do all kinds of chores (he practically does more work than those two ever seem to do in five seconds), and be humiliated in more ways than one. One day, a mysterious man (Pete Postlethwaite) who "knows more than just his name" gives James a bag of magical "crocodile tongues", which he claims will help put some happiness into his sad life. But when James accidentally lets these magical tongues loose, James and his aunts soon discover a peach on a dead tree that grows so gigantic that it's even bigger than the tree from which it grew on. The aunts plan on using their giant peach as a tourist attraction so they can make good profits off of their discovery, while James still has to continue doing chores. One night, James crawls inside a large hole in the peach and discovers a group of human-sized bugs including a grasshopper (Simon Callow), a centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), an earthworm (David Thewlis), a spider (Susan Sarandon), a ladybug (Jane Leeves), and a glowworm (Miriam Margolyes). Like James, they dream of getting out of his aunt's place in England and heading to New York City where his parents always dreamed of going. And that's exactly what they do through a series of elaborate, fanciful scenarios such as rolling away into the Atlantic Ocean, using Miss Spider's silk to capture and tie a hundred seagulls to the peach stem so the peach can fly, and battling a mechanical shark and skeleton pirates under the icy seas of the Arctic Ocean. Whether you like this children's fantasy or not, there are certain things about the film that you got to give it credit for. For one thing, regardless of how implausible the story can be most of the time, I do respect the creativity and the imagination that was incorporated into this story. I admire how this film had the courage to simply let its imagination run wild regardless of our skepticism and our knowledge that no such scenarios could take place in real life. The stop-motion animation is impressive in its own right particularly with the highly detailed and imaginative character designs. The voice-over work from the likes of Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, and Susan Sarandon are very well done and truly bring these characters to life. The songs by Randy Newman, with the exception of "My Name is James" which I thought had embarrassing lyrics, are pretty solid with the standouts being "Family" and "Good News". Like much of the best films made by the Disney Company, the strength of the film lies in the visuals and the audio. Now, I will say that the storytelling in this film isn't very consistent and is filled with major plot flaws that can't be glossed over. For example, I think that the film's writers made the aunt characters way too evil. If any parents of a child knew they had relatives who treated children the way these two aunts did, they shouldn't have even allowed custody of the child to these people in the first place. Let me put this in another way. Anyone who has relatives who taunt a child over the death of their parents or starve the child to death by feeding them non-food shouldn't just simply pretend they don't exist. They need to have an intervention with them immediately for the benefit of the child. There are also some scenes that don't really go anywhere story wise. For example, the dream sequence with James as a caterpillar being chased by his aunts and the rhino that killed his parents is pretty pointless. To be fair though, there have been dream sequences in other films that are much worse than this, and they at least prepare us ahead of time for that type of scene. While the battles between the shark as well as the underwater skeleton pirates are decent, they both go by a little too quickly and don't leave much of an impact. As long as you leave your common sense and logic out the door, "James and the Giant Peach" will fill the bill just fine as far as family entertainment goes. Kids and adults can admire the creativity of the story, the unique animation in the vein of "The Nightmare Before Christmas" (1993), the colorful characters including the centipede and the grasshopper, and maybe find one or two good tunes out of it as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tremendously Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After The Nightmare Before Christmas, both Henry Selick and Tim Burton began work on another stop motion animated film, a film based on an acclaimed children's novel by British author Roald Dahl. James and The Giant Peach brings in a lot of the same elements as Nightmare, but also brings in many trademarks of it's own. This film brews live action scenes into the pot and is overall more brightly colored and sunny than Nightmare, whose scenes were mostly dark and night like. In my opinion, James and the Giant Peach is one of those films that constantly gets overlooked. While Nightmate gets a lot of recognition and fanatics, this film has a small cult following and when it comes to ranking the world's best stop motion classics, this one usually ranks low on the list or doesn't rank at all. It's a pity, because I think this is one of Selick and Burton's best accomplishments. As Roald Dahl hated the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory from 1971, I think he would have been quite proud of this picture, for it's one of those films that truly represents the mood, the look, and the imagination of the original novel. This film has some of Hollywood's finest either playing live action characters or stop motion characters. We have Miriam Margoyles and Joanna Lumley playing James' dreadful aunts, who are just as hilarious and silly looking as they are intimidating. Lumley's Aunt Spiker character can't go one scene without having her mouth hang wide open or giving off a evil smile, revealing her crooked, filthy teeth. Then there is Pete Postlewaite as the Magic Man who gives James a bag of crocodile tongues. He can have his creepy moments as well, but he overall plays the character as a mysterious figure. He's like the tinkerer from Willy Wonka. You just want to know more about him, but you can't because he's gone before you can wink. Playing James is Paul Terry, who's not known that much nowadays, but has appeared on CBBC's Microsoap series. He's a triumphant young man and his little singing number towards the beginning of the film really highlights his hopes and ambitions and desire to leave his nasty aunts.Playing the stop motion characters are a wide array of actors, actors like Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, even David Thewlis of Harry Potter fame. I think my favorite has got to be Dreyfuss' Centipede character, for he plays him as a slick, snarky, defiant Han Solo like character...with a cigar of course. My favorite scene out of the entire film is the scene depicting James and Centipede's adventure on a pirate ship under the sea. Many Nightmare Before Christmas fans know that this is the scene where the Jack Skellington puppet makes a cameo as the ship's deceased captain, and I think Selick and Burton did a fantastic job making him still retain his trademarks, but also look very different than the way him did in Nightmare.If I had to some up this film in one word, it's look. This film has a look unlike any other film. I said The Nightmare Before Christmas was like a mix between Rankin Bass' Rudolph and the works of Edward Gory, but I think this film combines the looks of Dr. Seuss with Nancy Ekholm Burkert, who illustrated Dahl's original book. Like in Nightmare, many things are rugged, crooked and crude, even the gleaming, sky scraping buildings of New York City. I also think the peach has quite an appeal to it. In several scenes, I just want to reach my hand into the screen and take a huge bite out of it. There is even a song about eating the peach present in the film, and Randy Newman must be praised for his excellent songwriting. James and the Giant Peach is a film that deserves a little more than what it gets. Sure, it's not my all time favorite, but I still hold it very close and love it, love it, love it, love it to pieces. If you want a film that combines stylized live action with fantastic stop motion sequences and odd, yet thrilling wizardry, this is your pot of tea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good adaptation from a classic children's book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I was a kid and would slip in my Nightmare Before Christmas VHS tape, one of the trailers that was on it was James and the Giant Peach. I always wanted to see it, but my parents didn't buy the movie. I think because the film at the time had gotten Luke warm reviews, but over the years it seems like James and the Giant Peach got a cult following and an audience to boot. After all, we don't really get some of these great animated films that were from the 90's. Plus whenever there's a dark family film, a lot of parents tend to look down on it. I think today's parents have become a little too protective in my opinion. However, I had the opportunity to see the film yesterday and gladly watched it. I admit, my hopes were maybe a bit high, but I can see why the reviews were mixed on this one.James Henry Trotter is a young boy who lives with his parents by the sea. On James's birthday, they plan to go to New York City. However, his parents are later killed by a ghostly rhinoceros from the sky and finds himself living with his two cruel aunts, Spiker and Sponge. He is forced to work all day and they threaten him with beatings to keep him in line and taunt him about the mysterious rhino and other hazards if he tries to leave. While rescuing a spider from being squashed by his aunts, James meets a mysterious man with a bag of magic greens, which he gives to James to make his life better When James is returning to the house, he trips and the green beans escape into the ground. One peach is soon found on a withered old tree, and it grows. The aunts use the giant peach as an attraction, making lots of money as James watches from the house, not allowed to leave. That night, James is sent to pick up the garbage. While doing so, he grabs a chunk of the peach to eat. A large hole appears inside the peach and James ventures inside, were he finds and befriends a group of life-size anthropomorphic bugs who also dream of an ideal home and decide to travel to New York.I think if I saw this as a kid, I would've adored it. As an adult, I see that there scenes that lead to no where and there are some things that are not explained in the film that are explained in the book. I remember reading the book in elementary school and if you didn't read the book, I think you would be totally lost with the whole killer rhino ordeal. Also the aunts are so one note, first off, how is it this kid has the kindest parents in the world with the nastiest sisters who are extremely ugly and obviously hate kids? Yeah, I'm sure when the parents were writing their wills they said "Now, if something happens to us, who will take care of James"?"How about your parents who call and write letters daily and adore him?"?"No, I don't think they'll like him living with them"?"True, how about your 2 evil ugly sisters who hate him and love to beat him?"?"Perfect!". However, the animation is absolutely wonderful and really takes you back into Nightmare Before Christmas, in fact, there is even a cameo appearance by Jack Skeleton. The songs are charming and all of the characters are great too, even if not consistent. Like I don't get how the spider says she doesn't like socializing with anyone, but is clearly singing and dancing with them in the next scene without complaint. But for the kids, this is a great film that gives them hope to dream. I wish I would've seen it as a kid. But I still like it despite the flaws, considering that I think I'm just nitpicking at this point. I can understand why James and the Giant Peach found it's audience and where it will end up in the classics one day.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The true success of this film is not due to the combination of live action and animation, but to the combination of Roald Dahl's novel and Henry Selick's adaptation. After The Nightmare Before Christmas, comes the story of James, who, after losing his parents to a rhinoceros (In the book, the animal escaped from the zoo and charged and ran them over, in the film, it's depicted as a silhouette of smoke that "gobbled up his poor mother and father") he's forced to live with his sadistic aunts who get off on torturing him and make him do all the work. Then, a mysterious man appears to him with a bag full of magical crocodile tongues to drive him out of his misery once and for all. The first thing they touch is peach tree which then grows a gigantic peach and is something James's aunts see as nothing more than a money making machine. Sneaking out one night, he takes a bite of the giant peach, with a crocodile tongue inside, and a whole new world opens its doors to him. This is basically where the stop motion animation comes in, as James is adopted by giant bugs and travels to New York, the city of dreams and all his wishes come true. The bugs in question are a grasshopper (Simon Callow), a centipede (voiced brilliantly by Richard Dreyfuss) a black and white spider (Susan Sarandon), a ladybird (Jane Leeves), an earthworm (David Thewlis) and a glowworm. It's these characters who grow on you like the peach on the tree that I really adore this movie. "Love is the sweetest thing."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A generally pleasing adaptation of an imaginative children's novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several movie adaptations of books written by acclaimed children's author Roald Dahl were made during his life, the most famous one being the 1971 adaptation of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", entitled "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory". However, no adaptations of his 1961 story, "James and the Giant Peach", were made before this one, which was made several years after Dahl's death in 1990. I first saw this movie shortly after it came out on video, when I was ten years old and only familiar with the first little bit of the book. That was a good first viewing. Just last month, I finally read the entire book for the first time, with the intention of watching the movie again afterwards, which is just what I have done after all these years. Now that I'm completely familiar with the source material, I still think this is a good adaptation.James Henry Trotter is a young boy who lives happily with his loving parents in England by the sea. Unfortunately, his life changes significantly for the worse when his parents are killed by a rhinoceros, and his new guardians are his horrible, abusive Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker! Now living a miserable life, he dreams of a better life in New York City, a place his parents told him about before they died. Early one morning, after saving a spider from his bug-hating aunts, he meets a mysterious man outside, who gives him a bag of magical crocodile tongues, and tells him they will make his life better! Sadly, James accidentally trips and spills them, and they go into the ground. However, after that, these magic tongues cause a giant peach to grow on a dead peach tree in the garden! Sponge and Spiker claim it to be their own and use it to make money. At night, James crawls through a hole in the peach, and in the centre, he finds a bunch of human-sized insects (Old Green Grasshopper, Miss Spider, Ladybug, Centipede, Earthworm, and Glowworm). Like James, these creatures long for a better place, so they roll the peach off the hill with James and the creatures inside! They start out on a journey across the Atlantic Ocean to New York, but many dangers await them along the way! This successful 1996 family adventure follows the general idea of the book well, but there are quite a few differences, such as what happens to Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker when the giant peach starts rolling off their property. Some things that aren't in the book (not necessarily bad things) were added here, and some memorable parts of the original story were skipped. It would have been nice if they had included the "Cloud Men" part. Still, most of the film is entertaining, with some impressive special effects, a good combination of live action and stop-motion (with some CGI), some humour, and a rather exciting fantasy adventure for both kids and adults. Paul Terry, who plays James, didn't end up with a long film career after this movie, but was still a decent child actor. Some of the characters could have been better crafted to make them really stand out, especially some of the giant insects, though some of them provide a lot of the good humour in the film, especially the arrogant Centipede, and the Earthworm with his pessimism. One part of the film I certainly didn't care much for was the rhinoceros in the sky, but most of the scenes, whether live action or animated, are at least pretty good. With all its merits, I still can't say I agree with Siskel &amp; Ebert's "Two thumbs up! Way up!" comment, but it is a reasonable family fantasy film, worth checking out if you're into this genre, regardless of your age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember that I first learned of Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach" when I saw a stage production of it, shortly after which I read the book. I liked both very much. The movie version isn't any kind of masterpiece, but still worth seeing as a way to pass time. I always find it interesting when years later I see who all does the voices: Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon and David Thewlis, to name a few (Miriam Margoyles also stars).So, I would say that this movie does have a Tim Burton feeling (Roald Dahl plus Tim Burton; imagine that!). As long as we understand that this is pretty much intended as a children's movie, it's quite enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delightful Film for the Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James' happy life at the English seaside is rudely ended when his parents are killed by a rhinoceros and he goes to live with his two horrid aunts. Daringly saving the life of a spider he comes into possession of magic boiled crocodile tongues, after which an enormous peach starts to grow in the garden. Venturing inside he meets not only the spider but a number of new friends including a ladybug and a centipede who help him with his plan to try and get to New York.This film is truly delightful for the whole family. It's sweet, funny, and has a great musical score. I liked the stop-motion animation, which was fantastic in this film. It really had a lot of imagination to it, too.There are even some great action scenes, although some might scare little children. The characters are lovable in the film. This isn't a masterpiece, but it sure is just a film to watch with the family if you have nothing else better to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A giant peach's journey to the Big Apple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been an enormous fan of Roald Dahl since childhood. His gleeful sense of dark humour made for a refreshing change from the sugar and spice and all things nice of other children's books. But even I didn't get around to reading all of them, and I've recently started discovering books Dahl wrote for the first time, such as The BFG, The Twits, and James and the Giant Peach.James and the Giant Peach was Dahl's very first book for children, and even at this stage, he demonstrated his penchant for the gleefully twisted world of the bizarre. Our hero, James, is left orphaned after his parents are eaten up by a rhino. He then goes to live with his wicked aunts, Sponge and Spiker.They treat him like a slave, feed him fish-heads, and often beat him. One day, he meets an old man (a memorable Pete Postlethwaite) who offers James a bag of crocodile tongues. When he accidentally spills them beneath a tree in the garden, it suddenly sprouts a peach, and keeps on growing.It becomes enormous, and when James goes inside, the peach rolls off by itself and falls into the sea. James meets the insects who live in the peach, including a centipede, an earthworm, a ladybird, a spider, a grasshopper, etc. After tethering the peach to a flock of seagulls, our heroes fly to New York City to start a new life.I saw the film before I read the book and initially I found it diverting, but not much else. After reading the book, I decided to give the film another chance. And I loved it. Granted it takes a few liberties and changes a few of the events, but the film really is a treat.Directed by Henry Selick and produced by Tim Burton, they seem to be a fine match, because together they created the stop-motion animated masterpiece The Nightmare Before Christmas. James and the Giant Peach is not on the same level, and it doesn't enjoy the same fanbase TNBC does, but nonetheless it is a finely crafted adventure with a lot of endearing characters.James is a likable hero, but to me it's the insects that are marvellous. Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, Jane Leeves (Daphne from my favourite sitcom Frasier) all lend their voices, and do a fine job. They make quite a motley crew, and their exploits are very compelling.The sight of the peach being lifted into the air by seagulls is breathtaking. There's a wonderfully animated sequence with a metallic shark that becomes like a miniature action film. A gripping scene with Centipede searching for a compass in a haunted ghost ship (look out for a cameo from Jack Skellington). There's even a deliriously surreal Burtonesque dream sequence that looks like it wandered in from Pee-wee's Big Adventure.The songs in the film are provided by Randy Newman, and while I feel it should have been Danny Elfman instead, Newman isn't such a bad substitute. They're not as memorable as the songs in TNBC, but have their own charm. And the animation really brings them to life.What keeps the film from achieving the dizzy heights of TNBC is that it should have been made completely in stop-motion. Instead, it is bookended by live-action sequences that slow the film right down. Selick is clearly out of his depth in this area. Although the climax does have a delightful bit of ingenuity with the peach impaled on the spire of the Empire State Building (King Kong anyone?). But the way it tries to merge live-action with stop-motion is admittedly a little disconcerting.I still feel the film version of James and the Giant Peach is respectful. The set designs are dazzling, the animation is superb (I'm a big fan of stop-motion) and for the most part, it moves along at a fair lick. I wish Sponge and Spiker had been killed like they were in the book, but Roald Dahl's sensibilities never translate easily to the screen.Another underrated gem from Henry Selick. That man really deserves more respect than he gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From all the movies made for children I've seen in the last years, "James and The Giant Peach" seems to be the weakest of them all. You know, from the get go the characters proved to be very formulaic, and so did the story, given that the "mad uncles" versus "innocent nephew" has been already used a thousand times before. Not only that, but the "trip" inside the peach has nothing interesting to offer, besides a bad animation with non-sense characters. I know it was made in 1995, but we had great animations in the nineties, and such low quality doesn't have an excuse to be that way. The whole thing felt so boring and shiftless that I turned it off before the movie completed one hour, and it's a very hard thing for me to do. All in all, "James and the Giant Peach" is just a clumsy film out there, and no wonder why it has basically no recognition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a must-see. Once again, director and producer team up to create something so marvelously beautiful that it's hard to find even one thing that I might not have liked about the movie. Although the mise-en-scene is generally very colourful and bright, there is still that creepiness and ugliness about the movie which loudly yells Tim Burton's name. The story is simple and not as well figured-out and inventive as The Nightmare before Christmas, however, this makes the movie a lot more accessible for kids and it certainly matches all the intentions that Roald Dahl had when he first wrote the book. Isn't it delightful and lovely that there are still some stop motion films around? Somehow they are just better...</fullReview>

The story is what immediately grabs you, and you find yourself completely immersed in a really amazing story about a sad young boy who makes some great new friends under a set of very strange circumstances. I'm almost twenty years old and even I could not resist the magical charm and innocent youthful appeal of this film. The animated characters are funny, loveable and endearing, without being the typical schmaltzy Disney creations that usually lack personality. The obligatory musical numbers are fun and very catchy! Best of all, this film sends a very positive message about friendship and determination, even in the face of great adversity. This is definitely one of the better Disney films, and in fact, one of the best family films you could see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Idea!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Roald Dahl's famous book is now a movie! It features young James Henry Trotter living with his parents by the sea. Everything is peaceful and happy, until a rhinoceros appears and eats his parents. Now that sounds pretty far fetched, but it was even more far fetched in the book, because there it escaped from the zoo. Here, it appeared out of nowhere. But no matter, it still happened and poor James was sent to live with his horrible aunts, Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker, who work him like a dog. One night, James meets a spider on his window. And the next morning when he saved it from being swatted, he met a man who gave him a bag full of little green things. They were made out of things you'd rather not know about. James drops the bag and the green things escape. Next thing they all knew, the old peach tree in the yard began to grow an enormous peach. The aunts began making money off it. But that night, James went out to get a better look and actually crawled inside it. Once inside, he transformed into a little wooden puppet. In the pit, he met giant bugs: a grasshopper, a centipede, ladybug, spider, earthworm, and glowworm. They escape when Centipede chops through the stem. The aunts were right there when it started rolling. Instead of crushing them, it crushed their car. The friends end up at sea. They quickly use string from Miss Spider and the Earthworm to catch seagulls and fly away before a huge mechanical shark get's them. Centipede becomes the navigatorand before long he get's them lost in the middle of the Arctic.Jack Skellington from The Nightmare Before Christmas makes an appearence in this scene. But before long, they arrive in New York City. But a storm nearly ruins the whole trip. And as if that wasn't bad enough, Aunt Sponge and Spiker followed them! How, I don't know. But they're soon taught the error of their ways. And they all live happily ever after. This was such a clever idea. I saw it about 4 times in the theater. I'm sure if Roald Dahl had been alive to see this movie, he would've liked it. So, I recommend this movie to everyone. You won't be disappointed.-</fullReview>

James is orphaned and is sent to live with his abusive aunts Spiker and Sponge who used him as their slave and made him sleep in the attic. This is a little similar to Dave Peltzer's mother in his autobiography "A Child Called 'it'" (although I don't believe Sponge and Spiker would burn James's arm on a stove burner like Mrs. Peltzer did to Dave). Then a man comes by and gives James his sack in which he drew the city of NY on filled with magical crocodile tongues. They break away and cause a peach on a tree to grow larger. James meets several bugs and goes to N.Y. with them. I liked the ladybug and the grasshopper out of all the six bugs (the gloworm, centipede, spider, ladybug, grasshopper,&amp; earthworm)the best. This is a must see for people ages 9 and up. I think Roald Dahl would be very proud that one of his books was made into a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roald Dahl's weakest to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A British orphan's, James Henry Trotter, dreams of emigrating to New York City are scuppered when his parents are killed surprisingly by a rhinoceros who appears 'from nowhere'. As a result, he is forced to live with his two spiteful aunts, Spiker &amp; Sponge, who treat him like a labourer and feed him very bad food. One day, James receives a peach from a mysterious stranger. He explores the inside and enters in a strange world, which may lead to his dreams coming true again. James &amp; The Giant Peach is based on Roald Dahl's weakest novel. Tim Burton and Henry Sellick's film adaption is a larger disappointment compared to the book. I, of course, mean no offence to them as their other films, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline prove a lot better than this garbage. Here are the reasons why James &amp; The Giant Peach is toxic. What you, as a viewer, are analysing as you watch the film is a synopsis which is exactly the same as in the novel; completely random, lost and quite frankly, dumb. There is no reason why a rhino would eat a human being (or two as shown in the film), and in England as well. I'd probably understand if it was from a zoo, but that's where the characters belong. This brings me onto the next bad point; the acting. It is abysmal. There are too many repeated lines i.e. the aunts stating, 'Work, work, work' and lines such as 'How dare you disagree' said over and over again. Anybody who writes a screenplay needs to think carefully about the dialogue you use. Joanna Lumley was so much better as Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous and Victoria's mother in The Corpse Bride. But it's Paul Terry who makes a huge mess of the film. He overacts and quotes some of the worst lines in cinematic history. Even the songs cannot grow any excitement. Instead they include the most overrated melodies and over-repeated songs. That's The Life? It'll tire anybody sitting on a seat in a cinema and cause butt-ache. The songs are absolutely abysmal and the film is simply the worst to have been associated with Walt Disney Pictures (distributor), the second being the equally toxic Pocahontas, whose songs ain't as bad as on this. Good animation work though.</fullReview>

I don't like one thing, though. Roald Dahl always has everything start out so depressing. I mean, in this James has a horrible life (well, he lives with a Mommie Dearest lookalike, maybe that's it). His characters always have to overcome massive odds that are always against them. When they overcome them, you'll feel as happy as they do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this 12 years ago when it was new. I was profoundly disappointed. The pieces just don't hang together. And most of the pieces by themselves are unengaging. But a friendly reader reminded me to go back for another look. It exploits redheads (not young women). It has folding in the ordinary nesting sense: it has a real life frame, a stop motion magical internal section, and a cartoonish dream within, each the same apparent distance from the other.But most wonderfully, it has at about the 57 minute mark, a wonderful orrery. This is a sort of totem for me, in my study of narrative folding techniques. An orrery is named after an early sponsor. Its a model of the solar system in its simplest form, but has a special if rarely used cinematic presence. Here its rendered as a model of the inner stop-motion world. That's not exactly right. Its the musical number variant of that world, where normal conversation among the characters stops and entertainment for us begins. Within that we have this orrery. Its the best I know.You see the group singing on top of the peach. Then you see appear behind them a ring orrery. This is the kind that instead of planets with less obvious machinery, you have rings that show the orbits and they are pivoting within each other. Then we zoom back and see that this is a planet on another orrery, with the peach as its sun. This is a mobile sort of orrery. Then a giant James picks the peach out of its center (with now tiny set of characters including himself) and we see he is on a larger peach.Its wonderful, especially since that same peach elsewhere appears in such suggestive sexuality that I am amazed it was allowed a PG, and that only for "frightening images."Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James and the Giant Peach (1996): Dir: Henry Selick / Voices: Joanna Lumley, Mariam Margolyes, Pete Postlethwaite, Steven Culp, Paul Terry: Ridiculous yet creative family film that should fancy young viewers. The giant peach symbolizes challenge and responsibility. James lost his parents to the cloud rhino and is left to slave for two nasty aunts. One day he is given a glowing substance from a stranger, which he spills. A plant grows producing a single peach, which grows to an unbelievable size. Used for publicity by the aunts, James crawls inside and is befriended by insects. The peach rolls off and the adventure begins. They encounter a shark via water, then spider webs are attached to seagulls for air flight. They are heading to New York where his parents claimed to be going. Unnecessary skeleton pirates subplot and an ending that goes into overkill. Directed with imagination by Henry Selick who previously made A Nightmare Before Christmas. Joanna Lumley and Mariam Margolyes ham it up as the aunts out for profit and greed but their defeat is somewhat embarrassing. Pete Postlethwaite is not seen long enough outside of selling the glowing substance. Steven Culp has the idiotic chance to be a cloud rhino victim. Paul Terry plays James who evidently goes on this overwhelming trip that even marijuana couldn't conjure up. Exquisite visual effects full of spirit and imagination. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's weird. Maybe the "metaphors" are great to some people, but for me it's just weird.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I registered this account just want to say something about this film.I know it's stupid to concentrate on logic in a fantasy movie, especially when it's a kid's movie, but it just seem to be odd for me. Does the RHINO actually mean anything? Rhinos definitely do not eat meat in reality, then how could a rhino be able to eat this child's parents? If the rhino is just a symbol of devil or nightmare, then the animal must be supposed to be dangerous and aggressive. Imagine elephants as villains in the movie (no, not Dumbo!)... Maybe a dragon or a snake will make more sense. I'm going to consider it's just a bad excuse to "dump your Disney parent", XD. The peach is kind of confusing too. I mean, in a fantasy movie, it's not quite impossible to make a peach big enough and strong enough to travel around world, like UP. However, in the part when they try to eat the peach, I just find it very gross. That color looks like only the rotten fruit has. Does that mean the peach is a metaphor of APPLE OF SODOM?The man who sell green magic powder seems not very positive... Something that can realize all your dream... Just my opinion.All the things in arctic are just misleading. If all of that take place in Amazon, it can be so much funnier and reasonable! The way that two bad aunts end is scary... Maybe young kids won't realize how much pain there is to suffocate. Since the boy just like Cinderella, why can't the story ends like forgiving? The original versions of this fairytale are cruel too, but in a kid's movie it should ends more warm and spiring.The songs didn't have much to show. Therefore maybe a few songs would be better?In a word, this film has it's own adventures and... It has great idea, amazing creation and good animation. Ignoring these logical problems, this film is very funny. It may not be an amazing kid's movie, but it's a regular movie. The details just need to get better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Tim Burton Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie last night and I absolutely loved it. It is a delightfully original movie, and Roald Dahl and Tim Burton are a match made in heaven. Tim Burton is perfect filmmaker to capture the amazing imagination of the great author on screen. The film's amazing combination of original animation and live action is also really interesting, and the actors in the live action sequences are quite good, I thought the little boy who played James was adorable, and the musical numbers add a really nice touch. The actors who provided voices for the insects were also really talented. I especially liked Susan Sarandon as the lonely spider, and David Thewlis as the Earthworm. Kids will love the imaginative flair of this movie, and parents will appreciate it too, because it is well-made and fun. It's a wonderful movie for all to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>above average kids movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On revisiting James and his giant peach after almost 8 years I was wondering whether my take on it changed. It did not. I still rate it as an above average kids movie. Transporting a book to film is always a daunting task and even more so if it is a Roald Dahl book. While it succeeds at times you have to put the book aside and see this as independent work and as such it is lacking.Sometimes the pace seems stretched, the songs seem out of place and all in all we are not really all that interested in what James will be up to next, mainly because he himself doesn't know either and all he really wants is to stop feeling miserable. In order to achieve this he escapes from his evil aunts and makes a journey in a giant peach to the big city across the ocean with his new friends, a centipede, a ladybug, a spider, a grasshopper, a glowworm and an earthworm, fending off pirates and an iron shark and that's the heart of the movie. The beginning and the end (being a mixture of real live and stop motion) unfortunately do have the look and feel of "tacked on" to it.The stop motion work is spot on and at times you begin to wonder how they did it since the movements are so fluid you hardly notice any stop motion jerkiness. The voices are all fantastically cast except for James. It seemed as if the actor did not grasp the concept of his character nor the motivation or mood and hence the performance is stale and monotonous at times.(PG) 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was OK, but "Nightmare" was better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the only reason why I liked "James" is because I greatly enjoyed "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas." Since "Nightmare," I've had a liking to stop-motion animated features (with the exception of "Chicken Run" which sucked.) I notice that everyone here has noticed Jack Skellington's cameo appearance.I liked the animation and detail put into this movie, but the script needed some work. I mean, the best parts were a few wisecracks from the Centipede, and occasionally James and Miss Spider. I think Caroline Thompson would have made a BIG difference. There are some parts that were better than the book, like how the pirate scene replaced the cloudmen (thank goodness), but the beginning and ending of the book was better.Danny Elfman, "Nightmare's" music man, should have done the music. I'm saying I hate Randy Newman, but his songs are better for "Bug's Life" and "Toy Story 1 and 2." I mean, in "My Name is James," the tune is lovely, but the lyrics need work. Every other phrase is "James, James, James." OK, so it isn't anything like "Kidnap the Sandy Claws," "This is Halloween," or "Making Christmas" (Some of "Nightmare's" hits), but they really some work.But to make up for its lousy songs, "James and the Giant Peach" brings to the screen an interesting and bizarre story, with lots of detail and emotion. I think it is a movie that should be viewed at least twice: once just to get the story down and the second time to go back and pick up the detail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>( Warning, I will describe some facts from the movie. ) I thought the film was satisfactory. It certainly is not a good comparison to "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas". I am one for claymation, so I did get some enjoyment from the film. The film does differ from the book. There was a scene in the book in which James and his friends encountered some cloud people who threw lightning bolts at them, or something like that. That scene is not in the movie, and instead they have the scene where James and his friends encounter the sunken pirate ship and the dead pirates. The pirate scene is not in the book. In the pirate encounter, did anyone notice that Jack Skellington is the pirate captain? There is also a skeleton of Donald Duck. This is probably because the movie was made by Disney. OK movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Roald Dahl Story Hindered a Little By Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "Willy Wonka &amp; The Chocolate Factory" came out nearly 40 years ago (as of the date this review is being written), Roald Dahl, who wrote the classic book "Charlie &amp; The Chocolate Factory" upon which the film is based, reportedly hated it. Although the film was a minor hit, Dahl refused to sell the movie rights to "Charlie &amp; The Great Glass Elevator" and any other book he wrote. Since his death in 1990, "James &amp; The Giant Peach" is one of Dahl's many books to be adapted into a movie, and you have to wonder whether Dahl would have approved of the final product."James &amp; The Giant Peach" is a memorable film, and its animation is quite excellent. However, I feel as though the "Disneyfication" of it brought it from a potentially great film to a mediocre one, even to Disney's standards."Disneyfication" is a word I made up. It basically means that the Disney company takes an already great and original story, like this one, and tries to fit it in with its other children's films by adding songs and making anthropomorphic characters a little too in-your-face.The original book, written by Dahl in 1961, was essentially a cooler Cinderella story that boys could enjoy and buy into. The novel has random plot points, but you accept them while reading the book because that was what Roald Dahl was known for. Every child should read Dahl's books. Whether or not that would be detrimental to their enjoyment of this film remains to be seen.If you haven't read the book, you'll wonder why and how James' parents were killed by a rhinoceros in the sky (it was a real rhinoceros that escaped from the zoo in the book), how on Earth James was sent to live with abusive aunts, and who the mysterious man that gave James magic pills was and why he didn't just take them for himself if they were so magical. Plus, having a boy take pills from a stranger should not be in a children's film. Too many questions.Well, James spills these magic pills (or beans, or worms, or whatever they are), resulting in a dead peach tree on his aunts' property bearing fruit for the first time in years. Not only that, but the one peach that grows instantly balloons to 100 times the size of a normal peach. Once James ventures inside the peach, he goes from being human to being a stop-motion animated human. He makes friends with the giant bugs that grew inside the peach, they cut the peach free from its tree, and roll into the ocean. Their quest is to go from London to New York City.It's random, of course, but it's vintage Roald Dahl. It's pure fantasy, and there's a fun kind of magic. The story appeals to kids who want to escape their humdrum life, as well as those who don't have many friends. The solution to all James' problems comes in this unexpected way, and it's fun to watch James and his insect friends on their journey.In fact, all the scenes that were animated were nearly perfect, and contributed greatly to the story. I thought the character of Centipede (voiced by Richard Dreyfuss) came off as slightly too desperate an attempt to be the comic relief of the movie, as if he was trying to be the Genie from "Aladdin" (1992). The rest of the characters were great, though. My favorites were Miss Spider (Susan Sarandon) and Grasshopper (Simon Callow). I even liked the cameo by Jack Skelington from "The Nightmare Before Christmas" (1993), also directed by Henry Selick.I thought the unexplained plot holes and inconsistencies (outlined earlier) derailed the real- life parts of the movie. I also thought James' horrible aunts Sponge (Miriam Margoyles) and Spiker (Joanna Lumley) could have been more over the top, and far less likable. It seems as though Disney made them too safe, worried that they would scare kids. These characters should scare kids, but Disney made them too tacky and goofy (no pun intended). I especially hated how they occasionally spoke in rhyme, as if they were "Sesame Street" villains.I also didn't like the songs in the movie. Yes, Randy Newman is a great composer, and he wrote great songs for "Toy Story" (1995) and (later) "The Princess &amp; The Frog" (2009). Here, his writing and composing style are out of place. The score is great, mind you, as he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Score. The songs, however, felt contrived and unoriginal, with "Good News", the song during the end credits, being the exception.I hated the song "My Name is James", for instance. It felt like a cheap knockoff of "Part of Your World" from "The Little Mermaid" (1989), and the lyrics were uninspired and highly repetitive ("There's a city that I dreamed of, very far from here, very very far away from here, very far away"). If they had just cut out all the songs in the movie (except "Good News"), the movie would have benefited greatly.As far as Roald Dahl adaptations go, this movie was more faithful than others. As a kid's movie, it's pretty good. As a Disney movie, it's second rate. The animation is strong, but the real life segments and the songs are the true brown spots in this film. Had they been cut out, this story would have been a lot sweeter and juicier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps kids won't be so embarrassed by it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A major disappointment. After Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas", whose marvellously entertaining blend of stop-motion animation and catchy music was let down only by a rather amateurish screenplay, it must have made sense to turn to Roald Dahl's much-loved, typically dark and intolerant novel as source material for a follow-up from the same producers and director.Bizarrely, the resulting script this time round is far, far weaker than 'Nightmare', and the music is downright appalling - the songs might just have passed muster in a student musical, but are simply unacceptable in a major movie, and underscore how desperately weak the industry's pool of talent is these days except in the acting and visual technology departments. Character design is also weaker than in 'Nightmare', so that all the hard work of a talented vocal cast can't stop them being a bit bland. And Paul Terry as James confirms my personal theory that British children simply can't act (compare French, or even many American child performers). I think it's because too many of them are from our stage schools, whose products don't develop the techniques for the kind of naturalistic, subtle performing that tv and film require, but are resolutely stagy and singsong because they're taught to project and enunciate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is rotten like a spoiled peach. This pile of rotten apples was based on the book written by the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda, Roald Dahl. It is also directed by Henry Selick. So, why should I throw rotten peaches at the schmoes who made this crap? Read on and find out...The very first problem begins in the very first few minutes of the movie: the death of James' parents. According to the narrator, James' parents were eaten alive by a rhinoceros. Uh.... WHAT?!!! How do rhinos eat people?! Rhinoceri are herbivores not carnivores! I'm not kidding you, I didn't make this up! This is exactly what the narrator said about the death of James' parents. And afterwords, James becomes a ward for his two evil aunts. Call me crazy, but here's what really happened to James' parents: My guess is that James' evil aunts sneaked into the bedroom of James' parents and stabbed them to death out of extreme rage that James' parents are better than them. This is more realistic than "a rhino eating James' parents". Then, there's the songs. Listen how horrible the lyrics are! Randy Newman, you ought to be ashamed of yourself! You were one of my favorite composers! You composed the songs for the Toy Story movies, for god's sake! What was the matter with you?! This movie is so bad, the Nostalgia Critic was forced against his will making a "positive" review for this piece of crap.Pros: The artwork Cons: The songs, the CGI cloud effects, and the ridiculous explanation of how James' parents died.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James is happy with his parents, who tell him tales of New York - a magical city where they will one day go. This happiness ends when his parents are killed by a rhinoceros and James is left in the care of his cruel aunts. After much misery and hard work, James gets some magic crocodile teeth from a mysterious old man. These cause a peach to grow large in the back garden along with some big bugs. The aunts use the peach to sell tickets but James gets inside and uses it to make a break for New York along with the other inhabitants of the peach.Based on a great little book by Roald Dahl, this film does a good job or harnessing the imagination of that work and putting it into a dark twisted reality that would have made him proud. The animation is pretty good - not the computer generated stuff of Pixar but models that actually help to make the bugs feel realer! The basic plot is very simple but spiced up by several imaginative little adventures and some colourful little musical numbers, which although not very catchy certainly have the usual charm of Randy Newman's stuff.The jokes are not very adult orientated but they are not so childish that adults will be turned off the film. It pitches it just about right - with some nice dialogue and nothing too reliant on slapstick over gentle charm that is amusing and enjoyable if never really laugh out loud funny.The cast are OK, while Terry is quite bland as James his support cast is fine. Lumley is good as one of the monstrous aunts and the bugs in the peach are all strong with work from Callow, Dreyfuss, Thewlis and Sarandon. A New York cameo from Mike Starr is a nice surprise at the end as well.Overall this is not a great film but it is light and amusing. It is very short and the adventure over the sea seems too brief compared to the longer build up before the animation but it still works reasonably well. The balanced pitch helps it be light and enjoyable for both kids and adults even if it doesn't excel for either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Colorful mixture of live-action and stop-motion animation from the Disney Studios is an enjoyable if slight-seeming family film about James, an orphaned boy escaping his evil guardian by way of a magical peach filled with enchanting insects (Susan Sarandon's Miss Spider is the most fetching). The animated moments are imaginative and Randy Newman's song score is lively, though not terribly catchy. However, the transitions from animation to live-action are jarring, and the human actors overdo it. Still, older children should certainly enjoy it, and the film's bouncy midsection is aided tremendously by the colorful voice-overs. Based on Roald Dahl's book, with Tim Burton serving as a co-producer (his askewed vision and crazed spirit is evident throughout). ** from ****</fullReview>

A giant, evil rhino in the sky eats a little boy's parents. He finds a giant peach (which was created by crocodile tongues by the way) and climbs in it, finding some really weird giant bugs. The peach falls in the ocean and they encounter a shark made out of metal. Then they end up in Antarctica and meet undead skeleton pirates. I mean, the whole thing is so weird you just want to shoot yourself to make it stop.And then they try to teach a valuable lesson about heroism. Same old clichs you see in all the other family movies.I don't have anything against weird movies. But this one was trying to be weird and that was the problem.I suggest you stay away from this one and see Alice in Wonderland or Beetlejuice instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a Roald Dahl book based film, this is not a bad attempt to bring a popular story to life. James Henry Trotter (Paul Terry) is a lonely boy who lost his parents who were eaten by a rhino. He is now living with his horrible guardians Aunt Sponge (Miriam Margoyles) and Aunt Spiker (Joanna Lumley). He dreams of getting away and going to New York, then one day an Old Man (Pete Postlethwaite) gives him a bag of magic "crocodile tongues". He unfortunately loses these tongues, but they go into the nearby tree and make a giant peach! Later, James goes inside this peach and meets insect friends, Centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), Grasshopper (Simon Callow), Miss Spider (Susan Sarandon), Miss Ladybug (Jane Leeves), Earthworm (David Thewlis) and Glowworm (Margoyles again). They begin the epic adventure journey to New York with the help of seagulls, and along the way encounter mechanical sharks, a northern ice place, skeleton pirates, and the rhino, but they do get there eventually. Tim Burton produced this film, with the same stop-motion animation as The Nightmare Before Christmas. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Randy Newman. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not nearly as memorable - to be blunt, not as good - as "The Nightmare Before Christmas". One thing that kills the film is the strange mix of different styles. It opens in live action, but as James enters the Giant Peach he suddenly becomes a creature of stop-motion. Well, not THAT suddenly. There's a fine looking transition sequence that uses a mixture of hand-drawn animation and computer animation - a strange mix of different styles, indeed.Sorry: changing horses in mid-stream just doesn't work. Either Selick is trying to tell us that James is transformed into an animated figurine by some kind of magic spell - a ridiculous supposition - OR it's an admission of defeat, a way of saying, "We just couldn't fit the first few scenes into our stop-motion style, so we filmed them live action - pretend you didn't notice." In either case it makes the film a much smaller creation.(By the way, there's also a nice looking dream sequence that has been animated in the Monty Python collage style. This does NOT clash with either the stop motion or the live action, partly because a fellow is free to dream in whatever fashion he chooses to. Dreams are dramatically irrelevant.)The stop-motion is technically perfect, and the set designs make a meal, so to speak, out of the interior of a giant peach. It's a pity the opening live action scenes have such an inhibiting effect on Selick's attempt to create an autonomous world. A pity, also, that it's just a kid-meets-zany-characters kind of story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a passable film, passable as in it was overall a beautiful film with impressive stop motion animation and incredible voice talents. There are some things, though, that make me disappointed and a little angry about this film. Henry Selick is NOT my favourite director, for me Monkeybone and Moongirl sucked out loud and were very pointless, BUT he did do a great job on The Nightmare Before Christmas, he helped craft one of the greatest Tim Burton films of all time. Tim Burton helped produce this film but didn't do much, Burton should have made some changes to the production staff. Randy Newman is an AWFUL composer and did a TERRIBLE job with the songs about love and sunshine and crap. This is NOT A BURTON FILM, and this is not better or compared to THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas, because that was a lot better. And Disney? What the hell? If your making a Disney film you're basically going to have a happy ending and way to perky and positive characters throughout, of course, there is nothing wrong with positive characters, but I'm talking about the politically 'correct' characters. Tim Burton is sworn enemies with Disney and he has every right to be, I BLOODY HATE Disney!!! And don't know WHY Touchstone didn't distribute this film, even though they are 'Part-Disney' or whatever the hell that means... But Overall, closing the peach, this is a beautiful film, okay, well not really.</fullReview>
