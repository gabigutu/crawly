		<shortDescription>The downfall of America as described by a world renowned philosopher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the bad review found here from the person from London. This is the real reason for the downfall of America and it has everything to do with the moneyed class wresting control of our government from the hands of the average citizen. Noam Chomsky is a world renowned American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, logician, social critic, and political activist who details the collapse of a once great country step by step. He makes it easy to understand and provides very specific examples of his elucidation of the hijacking of our economy and country. I find the perspective of a professor emeritus at MIT much more edifying than the simple minded who dismiss him as an extreme leftist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relevant in this Election</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow, conservatives have awoke from their slumber and become aware that we have severe economic problems in this country and the American middle class has seen their economic power erode while the "masters of the universe" just become richer and richer and exert more power and money to ensure that legislation is written that will continue to benefit the 1%. Donald Trump acknowledges this in his stump speeches while Bernie Sanders has made it a cornerstone of his campaign. Clinton tries to avoid the subject lest her opponents bring up Goldman Sach's yet again. Choamsky puts the intellectual underpinnings on why the American Dream is fast becoming a nightmare. His ten principles are pretty easy to understand as he invokes the Founding Fathers and Adam Smith to buttress his intellectual arguments that income inequality in the U.S. is not only a problem but a huge problem that not only affects us in the pocketbook but undermines our democratic processes that have stood us so well over the last 200+ years. We have a professional class in the U.S. that has become immune to the globalization issues facing blue collar workers and both political parties have turned a blind eye to helping American's who have borne the brunt of trade policies that benefit corporate America at the expense of working people. Also the constant drumbeat of the elites against labor unions in our country, an organizing group that once had immense power to protect American wages. In the new "sharing" economy there are vicious fights to keep the sharing workforce from unionizing. Also massive attacks mounted against public sector workers including teachers because they belong to a union. These attacks are not random events but carefully orchestrated events with an end in mind: the continued growth of the 1% that even Adam Smith warned us about. The big fear among the enormously wealthy is that the majority of American's will get too much democracy and start pushing for rights that have long been denied them. They rely on law enforcement and even the military if necessary to protect their property rights and right to govern or manipulate the legislators who supposedly represent their constituents but in reality only represent the interests of the !%. Chomsky lays this all out in his documentary. You may not agree with everything he lays out, but he makes an awful lot of common sense. Many American's are finally waking up to this reality. Watch this documentary and it will provide a good insight into how this country arrived at this economic state.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must See for anyone interested in why the US is having so many problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with another reviewer who said that if you've followed Noam over the years, you won't be learning anything new. That's true, I've heard most of these topics being discussed in previous books and talks that he has given but, having the focus of the entire movie on one topic was a treat and personally, I feel much better informed for having seen the movie. Also, Since Noam has so much information it's nice to have it edited so all the information is concise. People love or hate Noam Chomsky, I fall in the love category. I just feel that whenever I hear him speak he is saying what I sense but I am unable to put into words. I've worked hard all my life but, never manage to get much accomplished so, his words are kinda soothing to my soul. I just got finished watching it and already I am planning on when I can watch it again. I'm sure I missed a few points. I just love intelligent people and Noam is one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Final Film of Noam Chomsky? Not Likely...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The definitive discourse with Noam Chomsky, widely regarded as the most important intellectual alive, on the defining characteristic of our time - the deliberate concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a select few.This film is being touted as the "final" film of Noam Chomsky. I don't buy that. He's not dead, for one thing. But also, the amount of footage out there is pretty daunting... people could be making films of Chomsky's speeches for years to come.There isn't all that much here that you won't hear elsewhere if you're familiar with Chomsky's work. It's a standard denouncement of various systems and how Americans interact with their government. For those who aren't fans, it may also be really, really dry. Chomsky packs a lot of information into his words and is not the most exciting speaker. It is more accessible, though, than some of his broader work... unlike his views on foreign policy, he does not dig into decades of obscure history to support his theories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear and Catastrophe if your god is money.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Noam Chomsky preaches doom and gloom over the current (and potential future) of the US economy. Vicious cycles, corporate tyranny, too big to fail, Goldman Sachs, Wall Street, blah blah blah all amount to this movie being just another standard diatribe about how "the rich have all the $$$ money $$$ and the poor are suffering :( If your god is money, and C-notes make you sweat, this movie can be difficult for you to watch. If you're one of us who realize wealth can be measured in ways that don't require dollar signs, and experienced in a color other than green, you'll find it as entertaining and humorous as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>democracy working</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie misses the point. Talks about consequence not cause. As my father would say, "Who told you live is fair?" Democracy is about majority rule. Over 40% of the voting public makes a conscious choice not to vote. Not voting is a choice to support the status quo. We have only ourselves to blame. The American public loves to point to someone else as the problem. Movie should be a real hit. This looks like the typical propaganda to misdirect the public from the true nature and solution of the problem. The public has the right to change any part of the Constitution to make our Republic fairer but again chooses not to act. It has been changed 27 times in the past. We could change it to Supreme court judges to be elected by the people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Consciously Slanted Criticism of Contemporary American Cultures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marketed as a definitive statement of Chomsky's view of contemporary America, REQUIEM FOR THE American DREAM offers an eight-part deconstruction of a country where rampant capitalism and unrestricted practices have led to a society even more unequal than it has ever been in its two hundred-plus year history.Through a series of interviews Chomsky traces this development back to the time when America was established, when the Constitution allowed for the freedom of individuals to practice anything they wished, including unrestrained capitalism. He argues that until the Seventies there were a series of checks and balances in places so as to ensure that all the people were well looked after; but things started to change, as successive presidents decided that the country had gone too far in the direction of freedom in the past decades, and needed to be reined in.Gains obtained in the Sixties and early Seventies, such as the acquisition of civil rights, women's liberation and a relaxing of sexual mores were followed by a tightening of the political structure, a deliberate manipulation of public opinion by capitalist interests and a concession to the moneymakers to pursue whatever policies they wished. Now it is commonplace for governments to bail them out whenever they over-spend; if they didn't, then the governments would not be elected.Chomsky paints an overwhelmingly negative picture of contemporary America, while suggesting that the only solution is for individuals to band together and create resistance movements similar to those formulated during the Sixties. Some of his historical claims are just plain bunkum: while middle-class white Americans enjoyed unrivaled prosperity in the Fifties, this was certainly not the case for most African Americans deprived of civil rights. Likewise the troops returning from World War II did have the chance to benefit from a university education, but little was done to alleviate the trauma of the previous six years. Hence America was hardly that edenic world as Chomsky claims - before the capitalists had their way.Nonetheless, we should understand that this documentary does not pretend to be objective. It is the views of an aging leftist with a passionate concern for his country's future; on those terms REQUIEM FOR THE American DREAM is a compelling watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>leftist propaganda all the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't get past the first ten minutes. the same tired left wing "i can't get ahead" garbage. Why believe this man when his own story is about going from nothing to something, ironic huh? So the hundreds of dot com millionaires, tech millionaires are examples of how only the rich get richer? they created something, worked hard and are now successful. I came from a single parent family with 3 brothers, my mom went to college part time to get a better job, we didn't get squat for handouts, we learned to work hard, and we did every summer with odd jobs. so what happened, 1 brother graduate from top 10 law firm, big fat salary, 1 brother started and sold 2 different companies, big home in OC and working on his 3rd venture, me, I just became a cop, but guess what, I work and make plenty of money, have a house with a pool, and huge putting green in my backyard, so quit your whining. there is no country on earth where you can go to college, work hard get a good job and WORK to make money!!! If you aren't doing that you are LAZY or dumb, and we can't help that. hey liberals, OBAMA came from nothing, turned out alright huh? because he got good grades and worked hard. learn something from that.</fullReview>
