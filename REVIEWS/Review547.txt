		<shortDescription>About as good as remakes get</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently subjected "The Magnificent Seven" to just about the toughest test imaginable--I watched it just a few days after "Seven Samurai." And while I'm not going to pretend it's on par with Kurosawa's astounding masterpiece, I have to tip my hat to Hollywood on this one: it's good, DAMN good, among the best American Westerns.The focus of the screenplay is more on post-Bogart-pre-Eastwood cool banter than the gradual, taciturn character development of "Seven Samurai," but that doesn't mean that the film doesn't have a heart. Considering it clocks in at barely over two hours (compared to the marathonic three and a half of "Samurai"), it actually does a fantastic and very economical job of fleshing out its memorable cast of characters.One particularly wonderful scene that stuck in my memory from the first time I saw the film ten years ago is the one where Lee (Robert Vaughn), drunk in the middle of the night, confesses his frailties and fear to two of the farmers. The scene (along with the general story of these down-and-out heroes) was groundbreaking in that it began the deconstruction and deromanticization of the Western hero which would be brought to fruition in Sergio Leone's unparalleled spaghetti Westerns.The star-studded cast wouldn't hold up doing Shakespeare, but they're ideal in this gunslinging, cool-talking tough-guy adventure. As if a lineup of heroes that included Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn wasn't enough, Eli Wallach steals the show as the Mexican bandit chief, a worthy precursor to his classic role "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly." If the screenplay has a major flaw, it's that his character isn't featured more.The score is, of course, one of the all-time classics. And while not as alive visually as the Japanese film that inspired it or the Italian Westerns it influenced, it's still mighty fine to look at, and the gunfights don't disappoint.The pieces add up to one of the great entertaining films of all time, which still manages to be moving and morally aware despite its Hollywoodization of Kurosawa's vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What could have been a fairly routine western is lifted into the realm of classic thanks to some smart casting, sturdy direction and a rousing music score. A reworking of Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai", the story concerns a Mexican village which is constantly pillaged by bandit Wallach and his small army of followers. Three of the villagers hire a mix of gunslingers to come back to protect and defend the town and rid it of the oppressors. Brynner leads the group (seven in total, hence the title) as they teach the farmers how to use a gun and prepare the town for the eventual onslaught from Wallach. The already tough odds are lengthened when some of the villagers begin to lose faith in the power of the seven. Brynner is solid in the lead role (though, unfortunately, his later role in "Westworld" adds an odd shading to his character here.) He, McQueen and Coburn define the word cool as they go about their various exploits before and after they join forces. McQueen and Coburn are men of few words, but of fierce actions when necessary. Bronson (rather young and handsome, though still a little craggy looking) does his best with a pretty mushy storyline involving the youth of the village. Buchholz overacts feverishly as a determined, but inexperienced youth. Vaughn seems a tad out of place and has one major ham moment during a nightmare. Dexter (easily the most often forgotten member of the group) has a few moments, but his character is not particularly defined. Wallach excels in the showy role of the chief bandit. His brash performance is a great counterpoint to the more steely and solemn title gunmen. The villagers come off as hapless and pitiful, for the most part. Along the way, there are several memorable vignettes that showcase the charm of the actors involved. The casting director did an almost miraculous job of using known stars and picking supporting actors who would soon be just as big so that the film now has virtually an all-star cast. The biggest shot in the arm of all is the monumental score by Elmer Bernstein. The instantly recognizable title music is just one of the many great pieces he created for the film. The sometimes laconic story is carried a long way by his score. The concept of disparate characters being brought together for a common cause has been done many times, but rarely with this level of quality. It's sometimes hard to believe that the film was made in 1960 as its look, content and cast make it seem like a later film. It was definitely a touchstone in the development of the western film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is considered one of the all-time great westerns: a real classic, and I can't argue. I've seen a number of faster-moving and better westerns but few with a cast this good that's still entertaining. I never get tired of seeing the stars in this movie. How often are actors like Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Eli Wallach boring.....or all in the same movie? Not too often. Throw in Robert Vaughn and Horst Buchholz and you have a memorable cast.As "cool" as McQueen was in his day, in this film Brynner was the "coolest" guy. Just the intense look on his face with those piercing eyes and deep voice command attention whenever he's on screen. Meanwhile, nobody but nobody played a Mexican villain better than Wallach.The "good guys" in this classic movie are all professional killers and show their human side by admitting their weaknesses and the emptiness of their profession. No one says it better here than Bronson, who gives a couple of very powerful "sermons" to some young boys.A solid western and a pretty famous theme song, too! It's also another good example of showing some real tough guys who can be convincing without profanity. Can you imagine the dialog if this film was re-made today?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Sturges acquires a reputation as a solid director of superior Westerns filled with tense action scenes such as: "Escape From Fort Bravo," "Bad Day at Black Rock," "Backlash," "Gunfight At The O.K. Corral," "The Law and Jack Wade," "The Last Train From Gun Hill," "Sergeant Three," "The Hallelujah Trail," and one of the best of all Wyatt Earp movies, "Hour of the Gun." He succeeds in one of the most exhilarating opening sequences of all Western movies, when he had McQueen and Brynner riding a hearse up legendary Boot Hill creating a mood and peril that never allow the slightest degree of viewer confusion or ennui... For Sturges, the West is a man's world, and his cool, hard, detached style, emphasizing action, excitement and the rugged environment of the frontier, endorses the point..."The Magnificent Seven" is derived from Kurosawa's superb "The Seven Samurai," a compelling tale of intimidated and impoverished medieval villagers hiring mercenary warriors to repel bandit ravages... The villagers in this case are Mexicans, plagued beyond all bearing by the activities of bandit Calavera, who always leaves them on tortillas and few beans... Three of them cross the border to offer meager pay and sustenance for any professionally skilled fighting men who will aid them...Yul Brynner is the man, dressed in black, with the luminous dome and the hypnotic Mongolian eyes who portrays the distinctive Chris Adams leader of the seven hired gunmen hired to chase some 'flies from a little Mexican village.' Eli Wallach is memorable as Calvera, chief of the ruthless outlaws... He is greedy and merciless terrorizing without pity the poor peasants...Steve McQueen gives a standout performance as the sardonic gunman ('We deal in lead, friend'), carrying appealing ease and sense of humor to his role as Vin, Brynner's first recruit and second-in-command...Charles Bronson portrays Bernardo O'Reilly, who explains his curious name to Chris, with 'Mexican on one side, Irish on the other?and me in the middle!' Bronson, the strongest face in Western, and with a bit of Mexican in him?cunning face, steady eyes, revealing voice?the character of Bernardo O'Reilly suits him perfectly... This half-breed gunfighter becomes the conscience of the team... Because of his tender paternal instincts, he is adopted by three children who promise him, in case he falls, to bring him, every day, fresh flowers...Robert Vaughn?who was to do nicely on TV in "The Man from Uncle" spy spoof? plays Lee, the 'good gun' with black gloves and nightmares, living in style with no enemies alive...Brad Dexter plays Harry Luck, Brynner's happy friend who returns to join the team convinced of the existence of a large amount of hidden gold...James Coburn makes a big impression as Britt, the expert gunman who can out-draw a gun with his knife-throwing... His looks and vague figure of violence are quite a response for his few talks...Horst Bucholz represents youth, eagerness, and the urge to be proved and sorted out from the boys... He was caught on the road by Rosenda Monteros...Robert J. Wilke is Britt's insisting challenger who swells the ranks of the villains in many Westerns like "High Noon," "The Far Country," and "Man of the West." The Magnificent Seven's success spawned three sequels: "Return of the Seven" (again starring Yul Brynner), "Guns of the Magnificent Seven" and, last and least of all, "The Magnificent Seven Ride." With a terrific Oscar-Nominated Musical Score by Elmer Bernstein, "The Magnificent Seven" remains a richly enjoyable Western, shot on location in Morelos state, Mexico...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A relic of a bygone era, and a good one at that...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based somewhat faithfully on the Akira Kurosawa classic Shichinin no samurai, The Magnificent Seven could be mistaken for just another of the many Westerns that were turned out in Hollywood during this era. But there is a certain something that keeps The Magnificent Seven unique. Part of it is the concept borrowed from the earlier Japanese film, but some of it lies in the attitude of the seven mercenaries referred to in the title.Much is made here of the difference between fighting for money, fighting for justice, or fighting for a future. While this version of Kurosawa's epic contains all the philosophical leanings of the original, it isn't nearly as long-winded or languid. The downside to this is that it isn't nearly as moody or powerful. In fact, one can easily see the difference between American and foreign cinema simply by comparing Shichinin no samurai with The Magnificent Seven. One is incredibly dark and downbeat most of the time. The other mostly has a score that is so major it wouldn't sound out of place in Seven Brides For Seven Brothers.Differences in feeling aside, the ultimate question is whether this version of the story manages to entertain. The hardest challenge any film faces is keeping the audience amused while all the exposition is laid out. Here, the exposition is kept to a minimum while carefully inserted between some fast-paced, albeit very mild action sequences.Sometimes, the dialogue ("We deal in lead, friend.") gets incredibly stilted. Sometimes, it seems incredibly wise. Well, since we have examples of films where it's all stilted, all the time, we can forgive this one. The film also includes several textbook examples of how to include a sudden plot element without seeming contrived. When we learn why Calvera's men just won't go away, it needs no setup simply because it is consistent with their behaviour throughout the rest of the film.In the end, The Magnificent Seven comes off as an excellent remake of a masterpiece. There are better Westerns out there, and there are better action films, but there aren't many. I gave it a nine out of ten. Go in expecting to be entertained, but little more, and you cannot go wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting differences from the Japanese version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen both the American and Japanese versions many times, and while everyone agrees about which one is better, the American version has some virtues: 1) Our heroes are selected by the farmers when they defend a dead Indian's right to be buried in the same place as white people; therefore they are seen as champions of social and racial equality by the farmers. 2) A magnificent villain played by Eli Wallach. 3) Charlie Bronson's relationship with the village boys. And some tremendous faults: 1) Combining the Young Student and Crazy Fool characters; some of the most poignant scenes in the Japanese version involved the interaction between these two. 2) Not filming the final battle in the rain. And of course many more of each. It's an interesting discussion. Both are great movies that shouldn't be missed. Remember that Kurosawa gave John Sturges a sword in appreciation after seeing his film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done remake of Kurosawa's classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SEVEN is one of the better Westerns to come out for the aging genre. Also, for any genre, it has much better characterization; from the cowboys, to the farmers, and even the outlaws themselves, everyone gets their own fair share of camera time to make MAGNIFICENT SEVEN a classic in its own right.Outlaws steal from a small Mexican farming town every once in awhile. Since the authorities do nothing, the farmers enlist the aid of seven gunmen to solve their problem.Compared to THE SEVEN SAMURAI, I would have to say MAGNIFICENT is less dark and reflective. An outlaw such as Calvera is hard to hate seeing him as a character on screen. Also, a better motive to explain why the outlaws continue their attack on the village is shown here, as opposed to Kurosawa's classic, where the raiders relentlessly never gave up, not once thinking (or admitting) the village is well fortified and they were not going to win. The scene and spirit of the old west, combined with the philosophies of the far east, have made a fine movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Western!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film about 20 years ago as a teenager and I still find it as enjoyable now as I did then. It is the tale of seven gunfighters who are hired by a poor Mexican farming community to help drive off the bandits who periodically show up and steal the communities food and goods. Of the Magnificent Seven most of the screen time is given to Chris (Brynner), Vin (McQueen) and Chico (Bucholz). While no details are given about the individual pasts of the Magnificent Seven it is fairly clear what there pasts may have been.1. Chris: A leader, perhaps a former soldier, who has encountered danger before and gained a degree of mastery over his emotions in dangerous situation.2. Vin: A capable man with a gun, perhaps a one time cowboy. He seems to be comfortable working as a loner but clearly would like to one day settle down.3. Chico: The youngest of the Seven and most inexperienced. He wants to shed his farming past and attempts through acts of bravado to persuade others and himself that he is a gunfighter at heart.4. Bernardo (Bronson): A strong solitary man that in many ways resembles Chris although not displaying the desire to lead. In many ways he is the most interesting character. He has made quite a bit of money in the past even though he is now broke. The attention he gives to the local village children and the gift he gives a village girl hint at the idea that while he is good at gunfighting he knows that it is a good family life that is important.5. Lee (Vaughn): The most difficult character to relate to. He appears to be a gunman who in the past was cocky, arrogant and self assured but now after experiencing life on the run now doubts himself. He wants to do the right thing but finds it difficult to step up to the plate when it's his turn.6. Britt (Coburn): A loner who is unequaled in a gun or knife fight. A man whose motives remain his own.7. Harry (Dexter): A good man to have in a fight but one who lets greed cloud his every decision. It would seem that Harry is one of those individuals who is always one step away from gaining riches but somehow never gains them.The leader of the bandits is Calvera (Walsh) who is not an unlikeable fellow. He appears to believe that it is his job to steal so that he can support himself and his men. For him it is only a job, not unlike the farmers who work the land to provide for their families. He has what can almost be describes as a code of ethics for those who make their living with guns. This code of ethics is evident in the way he treats the Magnificent Seven towards the end of the film. However, given the films ending, this code does not seem to be shared by the Magnificent SevenLastly, while many people may view this film as a western action film I think there is quite a bit of underlying humanity and character depth woven into the story. It is these underlying characteristics that distinguish it from the average western action flick and have helped to make this film as popular as it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant classic, beautifully scored, shot and acted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful classic beautifully scored and shot.There are so many moody looks between characters, and little movements or idiosyncrasies that just make each of the gunmen seem so real. Apparently, there were big egos behind the camera that caused these acts of showmanship, but unlike most films where the egos clash, here they just build the characters up without harming them.Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen are just wonderful, and James Coburn and Charles Bronson both put in equal performances. There's just nothing about this film that you can fault, the script is kept light when required and the stunning score lifts up and the acting is huge but never too much. This is a must see?again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic all right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Re-make are seldom as good as the original, but here Hollywood or rather John Sturges managed to capture some of the spirit of Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' which itself owes something to the 'Three Musketeers' and which Sturges duly acknowledged in the credits. Partly this is due to some inspired casting. With the exception of Yul Brynner, none of the actors was particularly well known at the time. Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, Eli Wallach and Horst Buchholz (an unlikely Mexican) all went on to successful acting careers. The format of this film was replicated in many later films. The plot couldn't be simpler. Desperate Mexican villagers, bled white by local bandits, retain a group of almost equally desperate gunslingers from the other side of the Rio Grand to deal with the bandits. A lot of the fun arises early on as leader Cajun Chris seeks out half a dozen suitably deranged but deadly types for the job. Ostensibly they are doing it for the money but it becomes apparent early on that they are really on the team just for the hell of it. Once they are together things don't quite go to plan, but the camaraderie holds up, and their mission is accomplished, though at considerable cost.Despite all the action it is a character-driven piece in some ways. Eli Wallach's Calvera the bandit leader is more than a cardboard cut-out villain and Yul Brynner's enigmatic Chris keeps us guessing. The villagers, despite their matching white smocks, are not all lily-white and each of the Seven has at least one interesting weakness.A strong feature of the film is the music, penned by the ubiquitous Elmer Bernstein, and entirely appropriate, with a main theme which seems to be permanently welded into my brain.'The Magnificent Seven' was made at a time when the appetite for westerns was going into decline. Whereas westerns were staple film and TV fare in the 50's, the sixties saw a sharp decline, as spy dramas and sex farces burgeoned. One interesting theory I've heard about this is that it's not so much that the audience tired of westerns, but that TV executives discovered that they were being watched by the people too poor to buy their sponsor's fine products. Anyway this film holds up very well after 45 years, a true classic and satisfying to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Beloved, Starting With The Title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Magnificent Seven. So descriptive of what we are about to see; so much honor, dignity and anticipation in those three words. I remember the first time vividly, though some forty-five years ago. I'd come in at the end of it, and the final battle was underway. There was Brynner, trapped against doors that would not give way for his retreat, and here comes a shouting, hard-riding comrade to his rescue - doomed to be the first who would fall. Astonishing intensity of gunfire and a limping Steve McQueen thrusts himself into the fray. Next, a vested, gloved gunman rounds a corner, stops, spies movement inside a house, coolly holsters his gun, kicks open the door and engages three men in a swift, deadly gunfight. Ten minutes later it was all over but my passion had been stoked. It would be a long, long time before I would again miss an airing of The Mag 7 from it's beginning.Chris, the leader: Of course it's easy to see now that the King and Chris were the two roles Yul Brynner was born to play. They belong to him alone (so far no actor has been able to improve them). As the first of the seven he brought the aura of absolute authority needed for the role of a man who would be universally respected and obeyed by other men who were his martial equal. Though at times he is typically stiff and larger than life in this performance, he does come across at other moments as relaxed and dry-humoured.Calvera, the adversary: Eli Wallach gives a wonderful performance as the menacing, yet wise-cracking bandit boss with a delightfully cynical view of life. Though he is appropriately menacing, you just can't keep from smiling as he expounds his experience of robbing "one little bank" in Texas.Vin, the cowboy-come-gunfighter: Steve McQueen gives the most natural performance of them all. He truly never seems to be acting; rather, he seems to actually be the character. His every movement, gesture and facial expression look uncannily genuine. A very, very cool screen persona.O'Reilly, the professional: Though the odds are stacked against, this is nothing new for him. He has faced and won against even more intimidating odds. Several times. Charles Bronson plays the part as ... well, as Charles Bronson. Plain and simply, you don't fool with this guy. To say O'Reilly is a loner is a massive understatement. Who better to play him than the "friendless" Bronson?Lee, the hider: Revealed as having 'lost his nerve' I related to Lee in a truthful way as I could not really relate to the other heroes (except in my fantasies). On the commentary track of the DVD James Coburn advises that when actors invariably discuss who would play what part in a remake, most choose the role of Lee for themselves. Reviewers have noted that the brooding and darkness evident in Seven Samurai is largely absent from this adaptation but it is Lee who brings a little of it to this film. In his introductory scene the music takes an ominous tone. It signals clearly that there is something a little "off" about this character. South-eastern accented - Georgia or the Carolinas, he is educated, stylish and a very fast gun, probably arrogantly so in his past. The character is perhaps stylistically modeled on the real-life Doc Holiday. Fascinatingly different, he remains ever in the background, has little contact with the rest. There are two small instances that reveal the depth of his desperation late in the film: A villager says 'only the dead are without fear'. At that moment there comes into his eyes a look of profound realization as the answer in those words dawns on him. Later, as he quietly prepares to leave the village, he rifles his pocket to find nothing there. You can see in him that he knows too well the emptiness of his chosen life. Robert Vaughn was an adroit casting choice.Britt, the perfectionist: Terrific part for James Coburn and he acknowledges that he wanted this one badly. He also relates in the commentary that the part was given to him in a last-minute decision. How significant was Britt of the seven? As Coburn says "everyone remembers the guy with the knife". He was so right for the part - lanky, stern faced and growl-voiced. There's nothing very mysterious about Britt. He simply loves the challenge of the fight and revels in his own prowessHarry Luck, the scoundrel: The least interesting of the seven and I also sense that he would lose in a gunfight against any of the others. Brad Dexter does his best with the part, and he's good, but the depth of character just wasn't there to elevate him to the stardom the others came to enjoy.Chico, the rookie: Despising his origins he dresses like a quintessential gringo gunfighter. He is determined to live what he believes to be the romantic life of the fast gun. Horst Bucholtz, new to American audiences, really runs with the part. He does an outstanding job at bringing a frenetic energy to the role of the youngest of the seven who wants badly to prove himself to them. In the final battle he is tireless - racing, leaping, killing with abandon. Bucholtz never really topped this role in his career.The movie has a lot going for it, not the least of which is Elmer Bernstein's scoring of every scene, some superb cinematography (the crossing of the stream by the seven, the ride of the bandits through the village - really beautiful stuff), and the adept staging of some key scenes - for example, the first face off between Chris and Calvera. Absolutely gripping.As a film it's far from perfect but I'm giving it a 10 anyway. How can I not? I watched it twenty seven times and that was before I got the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Price Of Corn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up in the 1970s, "The Magnificent Seven" was the kind of movie you respected even without seeing it. "I'll be Vin!" "I'll be Chris!" "I'll be the guy Charles Bronson plays!" You weren't quick, and you'd be stuck with Harry Luck.So speaking as the Harry Luck guy, I can't see what the fuss was about.The film introduces us to a Mexican village being robbed of its corn by the cruel bandito Calvera (Eli Wallach). A trio of villagers reach out out to gunslinger Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) for help. He assembles six like-minded killers for hire, and the seven put themselves on the line to protect the village."I promise you we'll all teach him something about the price of corn," Chris vows.Because "The Magnificent Seven" joins Brynner with such 1960s luminaries as Steve McQueen (Vin), Charles Bronson (Bernardo), James Coburn (Britt), and Robert Vaughn (Lee), I think "The Magnificent Seven" is given more credit than it deserves. For one thing, director John Sturges ignores all of them in favor of Horst Buchholz as an impetuous Mexican who overplays every scene he's in. For another, the film never realistically offers reasons for why its characters lay their lives on the line.The idea of these gunmen joining forces to protect a village is a good set-up. I never saw "The Seven Samurai" and can't complain about a rip-off like other user reviews here. "Star Wars" and "A Fistful Of Dollars" are great movies that took their plots from the same Japanese director, so the idea isn't wrong on its own. I just wish "The Magnificent Seven" did more with the material.Spatial reality goes by the boards every time there's a gunfight, people shooting and being killed completely independent of one another. Sturges in combat scenes played to what his audience wanted (stars shooting guns and bad guys falling, until the end when it's the other way around) regardless of what made sense.McQueen sticks out for his laconic dialogue and his willingness to wear a pink shirt. He and Coburn are big film heroes of mine, and both are well presented. "You lose", Coburn says at one point, his lean frame all the authority he needs to sell the idea that it really does make sense bringing a knife to a gunfight. Bronson likewise shines in a more challenging role, having to nursemaid three badly-dubbed Mexican boys.Sturges needed more time than he used to develop Vaughn's less steady character, as well as Brad Dexter's role of Harry Luck, a golddigger who never fits into the narrative. Like Glenn Erickson, a.k.a. "DVD Savant", said in his otherwise admiring review of the film, it's like he plays a 1940s character in a 1960 film. Most fatally, too much time is spent on Buchholz's Chico character, annoying not because of Buchholz's weakness as an actor but because of the way the character is written. When he confronts Chris and the gang in a bar, you just know he's going to knock over a row of whiskey jiggers before he does, because of the obvious way the scene is set up.SPOILERS - Why Calvera lets the Magnificent Seven ride off with their guns is one of those questions that makes clear this is a film focused on star-making over common sense. Also, as Damarates noted in his March 2007 review, why do Chris and the rest of the Seven put themselves out for a village that obviously betrayed them? When you think of it, Calvera is the only halfway decent character in the movie, giving his opponents the (unmerited) benefit of the doubt - SPOILERS ENDNot a good movie, except for those with memories of how it was when you were kids, this movie was fresh in your hearts, and you weren't stuck playing Harry Luck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-rated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For such a well-respected classic I was quite miffed by the last twenty minutes or so. Firstly, Calvera had the Seven exactly where he wanted them but didn't even harm them, even after they had killed 10 of his men. What did he think they we're going to do after he gave them back their guns? The Seven then abuse Calvera's good will and sneakily wage another attack - a rather cowardly approach!There are the terrible death scenes throughout this film. I never knew what a terrible actor Robert Vaughn was until I watched this and his death is so cheesy I cringed. Bronson's death is equally ridiculous as he actually poses before he gets shot. Yul Brynners God-like ability to dodge bullets without even moving is unexplainable, particularly when Brad Dexter storms in for a pointless heroic 'rescue' and is shot immediately.Other blunders are blood stains on the backs of characters who were actually shot in the chest and axes and knives that were not only obviously stuck to the actors already and kept out of shot, but also wobbled like rubber when the actors fell down dead!When the final battle ends the original two - Brynner and McQueen - ride away, in a worse position than what they started in. It's quite a depressing ending, despite the contradictory upbeat music.I greatly enjoyed the early scenes where Brynner and McQueen ride the hearse through town, and the recruitment process. Unfortunately after that my interest dwindled. I guess I can see why people like this, but its reputation is far greater than the film itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Samurai, this film is not...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a hard order to fill if you want to revision Akira Kurosawa set within an American western using a hodgepodge of ethnic actors. Not only are you attempting to recreate the same symbolic references and deep moral elements of an already established cult classic, but there are so many other outside elements that may be harder to control than simply samurai's saving a small village. None the less, director John Sturges tried, and the final result was the abysmal "The Magnificent Seven". Not to plot my course to early, but being a large fan of Kurosawa's masterpiece, I had to put that aside and see this film for what it was ? what Sturges envisioned ? instead of just making comparison after comparison. With sloppy characters, lacking detail, American-ized natives, and a grossly unoriginal villain ? this 1960 classic is only memorable for a couple of key performances and an energetic score. Outside of that, Sturges uttered blasphemy on Kurosawa's work.Again, I said I wouldn't compare the two works ? so every attempt will be made not to. There were high hopes for "The Magnificent Seven", a family favorite film that has somehow slipped through my viewing time, but the moment this film began my attention began to fade. With a weak opening, and a lackluster retrieval of heroes to protect the village, "The Magnificent Seven" came out of the gates with a mere gallop, and eventually didn't even finish the race. As mentioned, our villain has these long monologues of corruption and greed, but when it comes down to it, Calvera didn't have the true evil gene. He was corrupt, but it was only skin deep. Outside of the typical ransacking of small villages, his character demonstrated no true evil ? albeit with a PG rating, what could he do ? but I don't believe Calvera could strike fear in any child today. Eli Wallach is to blame for this. Yet, he wasn't the only one dragging his feet. This film was bombarded by lackluster acting. Yul Brynner, the obvious lead, seemed to sputter his lines without a moment of emotion or spirit. His pathetic portrayal of Chris Adams, the main cowboy hired to protect, fell flat and was boring to the average viewer. That same description could also be used for most of those that he recruited (what is the saying, flies attract flies?), sans Steve McQueen. As a fan of McQueen's work, I was impressed by the way he picked up the lacking flag of the others. While he didn't provide much to each scene, he was interesting to watch, obviously caring more about the overall performance than Brynner did. Unlike Kurosawa's epic, this didn't focus as much on the men of the mission, just that they could be there to attack whoever descended onto the village. There was no individual character development, and when there was (see: Robert Vaughn's nightmare) it was rushed and ill-focused. Whereas in "Samurai" we felt something for each of the heroes, in this ? nobody seemed to have the courage to stand forward and introduce themselves to us.I must admit ? this film was boring. From the introduction, to the recruiting, all the way to the repeat battle ? "The Magnificent Seven" provided little-to-no entertainment. With no character to stand behind, it was left up to the action to drive the focus, but alas, this seemed to fall short as well. I can agree that there were some decent moments that spoke for the western genre, but nothing challenging. Evil riders would ride in, gunshots would smoke, people would fall, and finally there would be celebration. Thinking about it now, it felt as if Sturges was providing us a cheapened Cliff-Notes version of the original tale. With a running time of a mere 128 minutes, there is no way you could capture the intensity and drama behind Kurosawa's original 203 minute epic. Again, not to compare side by side ? but what made the original work was the characters, the story, the intensity that Kurosawa was able to push through your television set. "The Magnificent Seven" felt like a rushed Hollywood project that had big stars, but no heart.Overall, I really wanted to like this film. The cast itself sells this movie, but as a viewer of cinema, it just seemed like a poorly constructed feature. Hollywood was attempting to make a dime on Kurosawa's original idea, and it failed. I cannot watch this movie again, nor would I. The acting is atrocious, the story is choppy, and there was no real threat. The idea that these villagers could survive year after year of this attack forced me to believe that perhaps Calvera wasn't robbing them blind. We weren't given enough history of the violence prior to the introduction of our heroes. This just felt rushed from the beginning, but remained dull after seeing the sheer brilliance of "Seven Samurai". Watch this, if you must, for the music and McQueen, everything else is pure rubbish.Grade: * ? out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mexican peasants hire an American gunslinger to organize the defense their village against brutal bandit Calvera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the original from known series formed by four "Magnificent Seven" movies . This classic ¨Magnificent seven¨ is well played Yul Brynner as a tough gunslinger named Chris who along with Steve McQueen , and their group set off in rescue some Mexican villagers . One day a bandit called Calvera (Elli Wallach) comes and takes most of crops and foods from a Mexican village , then the oppressed Mexican peasant villagers assemble seven gunfighters to help defend their homes . They set out to look for Chris, the leader of The Seven for help . Chris is decided to take a group and strike a blow against the Mexican bandits . Chris also meets Vin (Steve McQueen) and both of whom reunite a motley group . They find four other men (Robert Vaughn , Brad Dexter , James Coburn , Charles Bronson) and along with the young unexperienced Chico (Horst Buchhold) set out to carry out their mission . As Chris and his buddies , each of whom comes for a different reason , must free a Mexican village attacked by nasty outlaws who are devastating the small location . All of them get a chance to redeem themselves . Later on , the group develops a plan to secure the villagers defend it against enemy attack .Chris character was compellingly played by Yul Brynner in two occasions and one performed by Lee Van Cleef and George Kennedy . Brynner as a two-fisted pistolero is very good ; in fact , it was Yul Brynner who approached producer Walter Mirisch with the idea of doing a Western adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's classic, The seven Samurais. However , in the sequel ¨The Return of the Magnificent Seven¨ Yul insisted he would only make this film if Steve McQueen was not involved , McQueen felt the plot was too absurd and for this, and other reasons, was not interested anyway . The story is classic and traditional , following its interesting premise in subsequent sequels , including customary misfit band formed by an eclectic gang with diverse characters as well as speciality . The film gets action Western , exciting riding, shootouts , it's fun and entertaining , although nothing new , being a remake from a famous Japanese picture , but displays a slight style . The movie contains some moment of violence and even touching on the relationships between the villagers and the Magnificent . Walter Bernstein did the original adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's film , The seven Samurais , but it wasn't used ; Walter Newman wrote the screenplay that is substantially what you see on screen. Very good support cast, including notorious actors playing The Magnificent , as Robert Vaughn recommended his old schoolmate and friend James Coburn for the role. Although George Peppard was first considered for the role of Vin and Gene Wilder also auditioned. Sterling Hayden and John Ireland were originally supposed to play the knife expert, Britt. There appears several Mexican actors such as Rosenda Monteros , Enrique Lucero , Jorge Martinez Hoyos , Alex Montoya and usual Western players , such as Robert J. Wilke , Val Avery and Whit Bissell . Breathtaking and memorable musical score by Elmer Berstein ; Elmer , whose score for this movie is one of the best-known ever composed, also wrote the soundtrack for the parody of this film, 'Three amigos'. Even the great composer John Williams was a member of the orchestra that recorded Elmer Bernstein's score; he played the piano . Appropriate as well as glowing cinematography by expert cameraman Charles Lang . Being filmed on location in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Tepoztlan , Durango, Churubusco , Mexico . However , the sequel was shot in Almeria , Spain ; is among the many reasons were the difficulties that occurred between the American filmmakers and the Mexican crew and government censors during the shooting of the first film ; even Mexican censors required the peasants to always be wearing clean clothes.This is a superior and enduringly popular film , this ¨The magnificent seven¨( John Sturges,1960) is equally remake of ¨The seven samurais¨ (Akira Kurosawa) . After that , followed ¨The return of the seven¨(Burt Kennedy,1966), again with Yul Brynner with other surviving members of The Seven as Jordan Christopher , Claude Akins , Robert Fuller , Julian Mateos , Emilio Fernandez , Rodolfo Acosta . It was followed by ¨Guns of the magnificent seven¨ (Paul Wendkos,1969) with George Kennedy as Chris , James Whitmore , Monte Markham , Reni Santoni , Bernie Casey and Joe Don Baker and finally ¨The Magnificent seven ride¨ by George McCowan with Lee Van Cleef as Chris , James B. Sikking , Ralph Waite , William Lucking , and continued with a TV series and a Television movie realized in 1998 , being also produced by Walter Mirish , as usual . The motion picture was stunningly directed directed by John Sturges . This good Western is a Yul Brynner vehicle , if you like his particular performance ,you'll enjoy this one .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A vile bandit constantly raids a small Mexican village and pilfers what he so wants. Finally having enough, and not wanting to relocate, the villagers set about recruiting some hired guns to finally rid themselves of the dastardly Calvera.As most people now know, The Magnificent Seven is of course a remake of Akira Kurosawa's immense and hugely influential picture, Shichinin no samurai. Adhering closely to Kurosawa's themes, director John Sturges has crafted a classic in its own right, one that has become something of a Bank Holiday staple for TV schedulers. When you break it down for scrutiny, the story is purely a very ordinary one, but as each archetype character and set up arrives, it becomes evident that it's a story rich in texture, framed marvellously in a Western setting.Sturges for sure knew how to direct ensemble casts, he would after all go on to direct the fantastic 1963, ultimate holiday movie, The Great Escape. Here he is excellently served by a faultless cast, tho Yul Brynner was the only major name of note, the likes of Steve McQueen {owning the movie}, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn and James Coburn would go on to become part of cinematic macho culture, with each actor vying for the right to own the movie proving to be a bonus trump card for this rousing and much loved picture. Even the score has slipped nicely into popular culture, Elmer Bernstein's music having now become recognisable to even the most youthful of movie fans ears.Unashamedly macho, but certainly delightful for the female viewers, The Magnificent Seven is an across the board delight for almost everyone who enjoys the escapism of film. Perhaps the last word should rest with Kurosawa himself, who after viewing John Sturges' picture was moved to present him with a Samurai Sword in recognition of the great film he had crafted, enough said there I feel. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Film Is Great, What a Cast, the last of the great American westerns,Before Clint Eastwood Reprised them in the spaghetti Westerns.The Magnificent Seven, taken off the Japanese Film "The Seven Samurai" However There was a lot more fighting off Camera than On.Yul Brynner who arranged to Purchase the Japanese Film Rights to remake the film in partnership with Anthony Quinn, had a fall out with Quinn who sued in A Los Angeles Court over the producer credits, amongst scriptwriter Walter Newman,During the time of filming this motion Picture there was an Actors Strike threatening to close Hollywood, over blacklisting communist witch-hunters, However due to the Actors already Signing a deal before the strike deadline, the film was commissioned and filmed in Mexico away from USA Strikers.A Mexican Female Censor was brought in as not to denegrate the Mexican actors, one instance was The Mexican Cast were to have Clean Shirts and not to appear as peasants with grey torn pathetic costumes as portrayed in most westerns.Actor Steve McQueen also had numerous clashes with Producer and Lead Actor Yul Brynner over stealing the scenes, If one watches the film you can see Actor Steve McQueen Occasionally take his hat off and play with it while Yul Says His Lines, This was Mcqueens way of distracting the audience off Yul while the cameras Rolled, Apparently Yul Did Not Realize this was going on until half the film was shot, and warned Mcqueen not to ad-lib his movements again or he was Out of the Picture,This warning came directly after the last scenes were shot which appeared very early in the Picture where both Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen appear side by side in the Coral Apprehensive of the Funeral Wagon, you will see Steve Mqueen Play And Move With his Hat, Make Unscripted facial movements and stretch and fidget and so on Behind YUL.This was one of the Last Times Mqueen Did this, However you Will See Yul Brynner Turn To Steve Mcqueen as he catches McQueen from the corner of his eye, during the Funeral Wagon scenes, this was left in the Picture, amongst other scenes of McQueen Doing The same Thing.Steve McQueen also shot a live round towards a stagehand in the second floor window who was moving the Curtains, unbeknowns to anybody on set, this almost stopped the Picture, McQueen was also quoted by fellow actor Robert Vaughan " McQueen constantly raved and whined about Yul Brynner having a bigger Horse, and a Bigger Gun, and made many attempts to Take the action and lead role off Yul Brynner, saying that a Mongolian Born bald Brooklyn man trying to play cowboy would look silly and the Picture would be a flop" nonetheless too much film had already been shot and only Days remained to complete The Picture.Yul Brynner also Announced his Marriage on set and the Crew and Film Company threw a Mexican Fiesta for The Couple which was used and edited into the Film portraying The Arrival to The Magnificent Seven into The Mexican Town In The Picture.It Was Reported Actor Steve Mcqueen did not want anything to do with Yul's Wedding Party and Resented the attention Yul Brynner was getting over the Celebration and Hung Out In One Of The Saloon Sets On The Picture and was not seen again until casting call returned.Also Actor Eli Wallach Was Repeatedly asked to put his gun in his holster without looking at his gun by the director, after numerous tries failing to do so, it was left in the film that Eli Wallach as the Bandido Gang Leader would place his gun while looking for the holster on his hip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential Viewing For McQueen, Western Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Possible Spoilers** There's something romantic, even heroic, in the notion of taking a stand against overwhelming odds for the sake of an ideal, or a principle; in `The Magnificent Seven,' directed by John Sturges, it's to save a poor Mexican village from a small army of bandits. Every year, as soon as the crops are in, Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his men raid the village for the food that will sustain them as they winter in the mountains. And every year they take a little more, leaving the villagers near to starvation. They want to fight back, but they are simple farmers; no match for the likes of Calvera. When they fear they cannot survive another winter on the pittance he leaves them, they decide to take action. If they are unable to defend themselves, they will hire men to do it for them. Men with guns. And toward that end, everything of value in the village is collected (not much more than a watch and some trinkets) to be offered as payment to anyone who will champion their cause. Three men from the village set out to find the men they need, and after witnessing an altercation in a small Texas border town, they think they have the man they want. Chris (Yul Brynner) is a drifter, a man who lives by his wits. And by his gun. They approach him, and when he hears what they have to offer, he accepts. `I've been paid a lot for my work,' he tells them, `But never everything.' Now he must find other men, like himself, to stand with him against Calvera. The first is Vin (Steve McQueen), also a drifter, and looking for work. Chris knows what he can do, how he handles a gun; Vin sided with him during the incident in town. Bernardo (Charles Bronson), is good with a rifle. Fallen on hard times, the pay offered (the cost of bullets, and meals) `Right now, sounds like a lot.' The dapper Lee (Robert Vaughn), is a fast gun, and currently on the run; Britt (James Coburn), the best anywhere with a gun or a knife; Harry (Brad Dexter), a good man, but always looking for an angle. He knows Chris, and takes the job convinced that there's more in it for them than he's letting on, probably gold; finally, there's Chico (Horst Buchholz), a young wanna-be gunslinger who refuses to leave Chris alone until he agrees to take him along. The all-star cast and outstanding performances highlight this film, most notably the iconoclastic McQueen, Wallach, Vaughn and especially Coburn, who brings a commanding presence to the screen with the cool, laconic Britt. One of the most memorable scenes involves Britt, when he is challenged to a mock duel (with targets) by a cowboy named Wallace (Robert J. Wilke); Wallace's gun against Britt's knife. When Wallace thinks he's won, Britt simply says, `You lost.' And they do it again; this time, for real. The supporting cast includes Jorge Martinez de Hoyos (Hilario), Vladimir Sokoloff (Old Man), Rosenda Monteros (Petra) and Rico Alaniz (Sotero). An updated version of `The Seven Samurai,' `The Magnificent Seven' has all the elements of the traditional western, but it is so much more. It's a character study of men as individuals; not outlaws, but hard men, drawn together by a common bond, and who live by a variation of the same code. Their first loyalty is to themselves, and to their word; and to the autonomy that ensures they will live, and die, on their own terms. This movie may lack the gritty realism of some of the more recent films, but with it's stellar cast, the instantly recognizable Elmer Bernstein theme, and the way it was packaged and delivered by Sturges, it will forever hold a place at the top in the history of the Western Film. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with high noon, this must rate as possibly one of the great westerns of time. Against the odds, the heroes (each of whom have inner demons to contend with)produce the goods. The samurai code of honour may not be quite so prevalent, but all recognise that they are from the same(and dying) breed. Sterling performances from all characters, mainly in postural and facial acting, as speaking is never the way of the warrior. Expressions abound in this movie, none more so than Calveras face of disbelief when confronted by people who in his reckoning should be on his side. Many memorable scenes to revel in, the boot hill journey or the initial knife sequence are there to be savoured for all time. Always an enjoyable watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forty-five years old and Still Entertaining and Moving!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes you just want to read a review by a regular guy who is not pretending to be a professional movie critic. Forget about comparisons of this movie to its story-line inspirational predecessor. (Aren't most movies a reinterpretation of some story already told before?)At first, "The Magnificent Seven" seems to be simple: good guys versus bad guys. As the story unfolds, the audience learns that not all good guys are good all the time, and that not all bad guys are bad all the time. There are many references to the duplicity of all men--how the "good" guys and "bad" guys are similar in many ways. It is the complicated human condition that makes the viewer empathize with both sides. In the end, each character gets what they deserve--in the big scheme of things. This is very satisfying viewing for the audience.Watch this movie for still being entertaining and moving after forty-five years; for its strong individual characters by "tough guy" actors when they were young; for the AMAZING iconic score which captures the once free-spirit of the American West; for just being a good and satisfying movie.</fullReview>

The Magnificent seven is a spectacular remake of The Seven Samurai, and is a classic of American movies. I would have to say that in my opinion it is the greatest western of all time. Not only does this movie have excellent characters it also has great lines and action. Yul Bryner and Steve Mcqueen are superb together, and Charles Bronson and James Coburn play excellent roles. If you are a great movie lover or you just like plain westerns than i urge you to see this movie. I guarantee that you will enjoy it as much as I have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two faced in the best possible way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Magnificent Seven" does indeed show its age in its classic score and stunt choreography. What stands the test of time, and beats out most other films of its genre, is the inherent wit and skill in the script, and the charisma of the cast, and the direction each were given. Said cast, though large, manages to develop each character with gravity. Even characters with generally few lines, like Bronson's Bernardo and Vaughn's Lee, are given purpose and emotional clout within the film as a whole. To top that sentiment off, each character fills a larger than life "Dude, you are awesome" cowboy ideal that has made this a testosterone legacy, but not one character is impervious to the dangers of plot, morals, and life in general; A common failing in action films.Being a fan of the Japanese original, I can say that the contrast between the two is not merely a cultural one. One difference from the start is the Seven Samurai's setting allowed for an exploration of guns vs. swords as a metaphor for the changing times in Japan. Magnificent Seven's setting had the trick of guns being common in the time period of America, and so the focus is shifted on why those guns are used, and by whom. My father told me seeing this as a kid was the first time he ever saw his gunfighter idols discuss, with varying degrees of levity, why they are who they are, and what kind of life it really would be. That's another example of this movie having just that little bit extra: It simultaneously tears down the cowboy ideal, while still providing the western with some of the best characters to ever ride out on it.When I want to listen to great dialogue, in softer speeches or sharper spitfire banter, I can watch Magnificent Seven. When I want good old fashioned good guys vs. bad action? Magnificent Seven. When I want to laugh at a goober like Chico? Yeah, you guessed it. It's good for careful consideration of implications, as well as simply basking in old school macho cool. Take it for what you will, but it can be taken as quite a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is constantly on the local schedule in the Philadelphia market. And, no wonder. Who wouldn't want to work for the Yul Brynner character and participate in such an exciting, rewarding adventure? Yul treated everyone in the bunch differently yet was fair. Each man had a reason to ride on the mission to Mexico even though it was dangerous. Each was changed by their experiences in the village before the climactic last scene. My favorite scene was where handsome Horst Bucholz one-upped Charles Bronson and Charles Coburn by revealing that he had taken a chance again - by infiltrating the Mexican bandit camp. A simple toss of the Mexican hat onto the table in front of these cynical men explained it all. I agree that Brad Dexter's contribution was underrated. I found him to be the experienced, masculine presence of the cast. He was more than just a friend to Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe - a great actor and film presence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first of all let's get to Horst Buchholz, he was a young German actor who John Sturges thought'd be a star. Because of that he got a lot of choice lines. Two, each character gets his own moment in the sun, with a speech. Vaughn, about his fears, Bronson, about the weight of responsibility, Coburn, about his code of honor and what he will tolerate, McQueen, about a hope and a dream, Buchholz, his own frustration and self hatred, Brynner, his knowing it's not the amount being paid but the value put on it. Last but not least, my favorite character, Harry Luck, as played by Brad Dexter. Harry's the one looking for an angle. His part although small is interesting for the many facets of his character. His practicality is measured by the fact he wants to split when he feels the odds are too steep. His sense of loyalty which is a contrast illustrated by his final scenes. For Harry it's a constant battle, he's a mercenary but there's a knight wanting to come out, as evidenced by his death scene. As for Wallach, his fatal mistake is attaching his own values to the seven, which is in a way combining his intelligence and ego.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywoodization marred the impact for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Magnificent Seven', directed by John Sturges is a remake of Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai', only the venue has been changed to the Old West, and the seven samurai are now seven gunslingers. Bandits who come for their crops every season are tormenting Mexican villagers, and since they are left with barely enough to live on, they decide to seek protection from these attacks.Three of the villagers go into the nearest town to try to purchase guns, but instead end up hiring a drifting gunslinger instead (Yul Brunner) who ends up recruiting six others to help defend the village.The cast is pretty much a who's who of badass male actors from the time; Yul Brunner, Steve McQueen and James Coburn lead the 'good guys' and the always great Eli Wallach plays (surprise) the villain. The story is certainly entertaining, and I definitely enjoyed myself, but I unfortunately watched the original, 'Seven Samurai' after it, so my opinion changed a bit. As a stand-alone film, 'The Magnificent Seven' is pretty harmless fluff; as corny at times as most other films of the era. In terms of the western genre, it was pretty typical; Sergio Leone still hadn't made his mark with his intensity-driven westerns. Unfortunately, though one should judge a film on its own merits, even a remake, it is hard to not compare the two. Where 'Seven Samurai' is dramatic, beautiful and was pervasive in its intelligent comedic elements, 'The Magnificent Seven' was a typical Hollywood offering that often dumbed-down what made 'Seven Samurai' so striking and groundbreaking. I found 'The Magnificent Seven', while a decent film, to be so white bread that I was actually shocked that the 'good guys' didn't all wear white hats.'The Magnificent Seven' is not a bad film, and it is certainly entertaining at times, but it is a pale comparison to its predecessor. This doesn't entirely surprise me, but that doesn't make that fact any less disappointing. Like other remakes, most recently 'The Manchurian Candidate', the risk one runs in remaking a classic, even if it was just originally done six years earlier as in the case of 'Seven Samurai', is that there are going to be inevitable comparisons. In the case of 'The Magnificent Seven', if the film were just a little less decent, it would have been vaguely insulting. But this was a pretty entertaining film that deserves a look; just watch 'Seven Samurai' at your own risk because you may seem short-comings, as I did.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent characters!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a cast like Yul Brynner as Chris Adams, Eli Wallach as the bandito Calvera, Steve McQueen as Vin, and Charles Bronson as Bernardo O'Reilly, this movie is guaranteed to please the audience. Directed by John Sturges, it is, I believe, the only American Western that paved the way for the Spaghetti genre. The intense violence, the macho presence of the 7, the quasi absence of any female lead, and especially the setting (a Mexican pueblo!) were definitely not ingredients of the romantic American Western.And for this alone the film deserves some recognition, for being ahead of its time, so to speak. The basic plot is not particularly intense: a Mexican town is constantly being robbed of its crop by 40 banditos, led by Calvera. When 3 of the inhabitants decide to rebel, they head to an American town, initially to buy guns. They end up hiring 7 men who decide to support their cause for various individual reasons, but definitely not for the low pay!This Western is not a classic because of the action scenes (which were not that spectacular) but because it focuses on the characters. Each man learns something of value from this mission, and each of them has a haunting past, though we are never told the details. Chris and Vin are lonely drifters and invincible gunmen with moral principles and a dash of compassion. For instance, in the beginning of the film, they team up to give a Native American a decent burial in a little town's cemetery, despite the locals' strong opposition. Chris, after siding with the 3 Mexicans's cause, takes the initiative of finding the right men for the job. Bernardo O'Reilly is half-Mexican half-Irish, and he's the one who has a special relationship with the kids of the Mexican village. He is good with the rifle, but doesn't fail to give the children a good lecture on the responsibilities of their fathers. Lee (Robert Vaughn), is a fugitive and is always dressed elegantly, even during combat. I liked Britt's character's best. Played by James Coburn, he is really fast both with a gun and with a knife. Look out for the first scene when we're introduced to his character, where an insisting gunman keeps on provoking him until he gets what he asked for. Never in that scene does Britt lose his cool, taking small ?naps' in between provocations. It's a real laugh, that scene! Actually, the first part of the movie, where we are gradually introduced to each of the 7 men, is the best part. Harry (Brad Dexter), is a strange character; the only reason he goes for the job is that he is convinced, for some reason, that there is gold mine near the Mexican village. Throughout his conversations with the villagers, he keeps on referring to the mine, much to their perplexity and much to Chris' amusement. Then there is Chico (Horst Buchholz), a young, persistent, and proud gunslinger wannabe. He is the only one of the 7 to ?win' in the end, as he decides to settle down with a woman in the village. Other interesting characters were that of Calvera and of the village's Old Man (played by Vladimir Sokoloff). Calvera is a proud bandito who keeps his word (surprisingly!), and the Old Man is a wise, courageous, and respected figure in the village. `You hear that, Sotero? Do you hear what he said?..Ride on!..To ME!' (Calvera) `Only the farmers have won. They are like the land itself; you helped rid them of Calvera the way a strong wind help rid them of locusts. You're like the wind blowing over the land and passing on?Vayan con Dios!' (Old Man) Another feature that makes this a memorable movie is of course Elmer Bernstein's score, which was used for many years in TV cigarette ads.The best line, which poignantly illustrates the drifter's eternal loneliness, comes at the end of the movie when Chris tells Vin that "The Old Man was right. Only the farmers have won. We lost. We always lose..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Reboot on a Kurosawa Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Magnificent Seven" under the careful direction of John Sturges is a different concept of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 classic "The Seven Samurai" in which a posse of seven established gunslingers hired for meagre pay from a poor Mexican village to take down bandits led by Calvera (Eli Wallach) who are sabotaging a Mexican village leaving the poor inhabitants are destitute and famished. This film is a quick reminder of the golden years of cinema when filmmakers were creating cinematic pieces taken from heart and dedication contrary to the pointless sequels and money-picking blockbusters the film community has been feeding us. There are still films being made through care over cash, but the'ye very scarce. It also reminds us of a time where performers were classified as heroes rather than money-spoiled pretty-boys just getting their big break and their big bonus. "The Magnificent Seven" is a fascinating remake of Kurosawa's "The Seven Samurai" emanating from the old west and is comprised of seven eclectic hot stars of that era. This film was what eternally plastered Steve McQueen as "The King of Cool". He's also joined by other hot commodities like Yul Brynner, Charles Brosnan, Eli Wallach among others. It's a nostalgic journey to yesteryear that's worth savoring every minute. It also stands the test of time situated between the symbolic white hat Westerns and the spaghetti Westerns made famous by Sergio Leone. The real centerpiece isn't really focused on the action, though it is exciting and never holds back, the real meal ticket is the development in the characters and what drove them on this dangerous initiative. There are myriads of reasons why why they got into the business of becoming gunslingers even though death is the most obvious. The good thing was the focus wasn't primarily on one character but the whole posse and that the character description is not undertaken into long intervals. Every time I watch this film, I find it hard to decide who's my favorite character because they're all very believable. I guess the one who stands outs is James Coburn as the laid back knife expert Britt. Outside of the posse was Wallach showing extreme supremacy as the evil and menacing Calvera. With an ensemble of top talented movie stars that Hollywood churned out here, these guys can spin circles around the performers of today. Not only was this movie performed to near perfection, the atmosphere and the musical background was outstanding. The score by legendary composer Elmer Bernstein has great music that is easy to hum to. As I mentioned before the action was exciting and the stunts were very well orchestrated it could make today's stunt people green with envy. It's not as gratuitously violent like "The Wild Bunch", but it still has a strong level of rawness to keep Western action aficionados enthralled. The film itself will make you want to watch this one again, especially if you're a fan of Steve McQueen and would want you to see more of his films. And for those who have never seen the movie, it's never too late to miss out on one of the most exciting star-studded ensemble Westerns of its era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"They fought like 700" and they really did, John Sturges' The Magnificent Seven was one of the greatest westerns that I have ever watched with a lot of A-list actors giving great performances such as Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Eli Wallach. About these 7 cowboys who are hired to protect a village from desperadoes, John Sturges' direction for this film is like the direction of John Ford and Howard Hawks combined. This is on a par with some of the best adventure and western films ever done. Elmer Bernstein's score for this is simply amazing, and so are the costumes, and the scenery. and of which is simply great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magnificent Seven: A good remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I watched "The Magnificent Seven" with just one eye, I thought it was a boring remake, but when I really watched it seriously I enjoyed almost everything in it. It is not as good as the fantastic Kurosawa-original, but who cares? 'The Magnificent Seven' is good entertainment with several cool actors.Chris Adams is the perfect role for Yul Brunner even if it seems like John Sturges have problems to use his whole potential. Eli Wallach is made for the role as Calvera (he copied that role in Sergio Leone's last dollar-movie), in a sense a smart bandit with some sort of understanding for others. Steve McQueen is bigger than life as Vin! It was the most suitable role he ever played. Horst Buchholz is the biggest disappointment. He is not good as Chico, and Chico is not an interesting character either. Chico has also too much screentime. Charles Bronson is not bad as Bernando O'Reilly, but Sturges hardly uses his full potential as Sergio Leone later would do in 'C'era una volta il West'. Robert Vaughn is simply powerful as Lee, but maybe he should have carried two guns! Brad Dexter is tough enough, even if he isn't the hardest of the seven. My favorite James Coburn is Britt, not the best character-name (Not a male name here in Sweden ...) but he is a solid cowboy. Maybe Sturges should have let him be more like Sean in 'Gi? la testa' (Note: Fact is that Yul Brunner would have matched in the role as Britt).'The Magnificent Seven' should be seen in it's original format: panavision. I have a copy in TV-format (Terrible).Elmer Bernsteins score is a piece of music that makes you smile and feel good!'The Magnificent Seven' is the Western that inspired Sergio Leone's dollar-movies the most. He got the idea to base a Western on a Kurosawa-film, and he saw that he had the possibility to make a Western in similar environments as "The Magnificent Seven". He also used several actors from 'The Magnificent Seven' (He wanted Bronson for 'Per un pugno di dollari' when he didn't get Henry Fonda, later he worked with booth Bronson, Eli Wallach and James Coburn).'The Magnificent Seven' is an American Western, nothing else. Therefore it shouldn't be called a 'spaghetti-western' even if it is similar to Leone's dollar-movies.Rating: 7+ of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original is such a Masterpiece that even the Remake is a Classic ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The startling opening of a triumphing fanfare, thrilling percussions following a mesmerizingly inspirational violins melody, all leading up to one of the most heart-pounding orchestral movement of cinema's history, that only one word can describe besides iconic ? Magnificent!As far back as I can remember, this melody was stuck in my mind. It was the music for an ad, that would be unauthorized now, the one with the legendary cowboy riding toward the sunset with Monument Valley as the John Ford-like background. And only later, I knew the theme was of "The Magnificent Seven" ? one of the most emblematic westerns of Hollywood's Silver Age.I know the word "iconic" is hackneyed but there's no way it doesn't apply to Elmer Bernstein's score, voted #8 in the American Film Institute Top 25 scores, one that elevated the overall experience a few notches higher. Indeed, the movie is more restrained than what the score suggests, but it's this complementarity in pace and emotion that transcends the conventionality of the film, the last film leaving me with the same impression was "Love Story". What the mind doesn't get, the heart does, beating with the same musical rhythm.And this is why "The Magnificent Seven", although not the greatest Western ever, nor the most influential, is still a classic. But it takes more than musicality to make you forget the improbabilities of having a German kid playing a Mexican, a Mongol playing a badass gunslinger, a newcomer trying to steal his thunder with the most childish acting moves. It takes two things to be precise: a story -a script- and a casting. Eventually you close your eyes on some aspects when it's Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen leading the show.But let's start with the story and gives the original writer the credit he fully deserves, and it says a lot about Master Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" when its own remake is a classic. The original was first modern movie, a multi-layered story whose epic feel was only the backdrop of a collective characters' study and an insightful commentary on the way classes and backgrounds condition people's behaviors and attitudes. More than that, served by an irresistible casting, with an unforgettable Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune, was the first film to combine the thrills (men hired for a mission) with a humanistic and universal message."Seven Samurai" was a story of people working and fighting together, uniting their forces, and teaching that everyone is worthy of respect. And consequently, it was obvious that the film would make a perfect Western, since Kurosaws was influenced by John Ford's style, the loop was looped and explains why the film could be judged more positively than a rip-off of a Japanese movie. Only the location changed, the oppressed people are Mexican peasants and the villain is given a more colorful presence through Eli Wallach who plays Calvera. The remake shows signs of cinematic maturity by keeping attentive not to offend Mexican audience, after the dreadful "Vera Cruz". The script was written in order to portray Mexican in a positive light. Samurai belonged to a higher cast and could patronize peasants, but Americans couldn't. The Mexicans' initial intents became buying guns, but they finally hired men because they were cheaper. The men were paid for that, and this is why, less romantic of course, the French title is still explicit: "The Seven Mercenaries" And speaking of the mercenaries' casting, the film is a showcase of all the alpha male actors whose careers were about to start with the decade.Brynner, the lead, was the most experienced, while McQueen was the more-or-less sidekick, Bronson was the woodcutter and goodhearted O'Reilly, Vaughn as the man with a past, Coburn as the fast, lean and lanky knife thrower, and Brad Dexter is Curly, who'd believe that there would be more at stakes than protecting a village, and Bucholz as Montgomery Clift lookalike, the rookie. The correspondences with their Japanese alter-egos are uneven, Brynner was perfect, so was Coburn who was glad to play his favorite counterpart, but Mifune was such a larger-than-life character and the young Keiko Tsushima such a crucial one, they didn't deserve to be combined in one character. Still, the testosterone-laden cast is part of Hollywood's legend, as well as what went behind the scenes. The rivalries between Brynner and McQuee, and the other actors, the clanning that went during the shooting, Brynner's marriage, Eli Wallach getting adopted by his gang, everything contributed to cement the film's legend. It was a man's film with men playing cowboys, but the script managed to go beyond its usual material and be more than a classic Western, quite an underrated script, minimalist but with no wasted line, like when Yul Brynner points his finger to the direction he takes, would talking change anything? No, but we wouldn't remember it. Some of the Seven have no more than 20 lines but we never feel one presence surpassing the other.Half the length of its glorious ancestor, the script told the story with a sense of self- awareness, conveying the same noble values and reflecting on the gunslinger's condition. This self-questioning aspect leaves a bitter taste to this victory, and while the film feels like the last hurrah of the classic Western movie, there are some clues of maturity, when the last line is "we always lose", it makes you think about the future of these men: no land, no wives, no families, and maybe these cowardly peasants are not the most to pity, as Bronson would say.To a certain extent, the film is, after "Rio Bravo", one of the last classic Western and one that would pave the way to the new revisionist Westerns, but while I used to think it was Leone who started it, there is some credit to address to Sturges, after all, his film was also adapted from a Kurosawa movie, a magnificent one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sturdy western with magnificent Bernstein score...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is the story of Mexican peasants who hire expert gunmen when their village is overtaken by a gang of bandits. But the story outline is more or less background for a character study of the kind of gunslingers willing to spend six weeks ridding the town of the vandals for a paltry $20 total fee. The standout acting job in the cast of really cool actors is, nevertheless, the swarthy villain of the piece played to perfection by a leering ELI WALLACH. He provides the kind of grinning villain John Huston used for the chilling climax of TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE.The film is only semi-successful in exploring these characters, but they are all vividly acted by STEVE McQUEEN, YUL BRYNNER, CHARLES BRONSON, LEE MARVIN, HORST BUCHOLTZ, BRAD DEXTER and ROBERT VAUGHN. I got a kick watching the tug-of-war scene stealing going on between McQueen and Brynner, each attempting to outdo the other.Based on THE SEVEN SAMURAI, it has been turned very effectively into a western saga morality tale and benefits enormously from the location photography and a sometimes bombastic score by Elmer Bernstein that gives the whole story an edginess it might otherwise have lacked.Well worth watching but don't expect anything deep from the characterizations, vivid as they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great American Style Entertainment; Superb Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Magnificent Seven is one of my favorite movies. Nevertheless, it is flawed. But, as in a love affair, the flaws are not only tolerated, but embraced.The movie is labeled "Western/Adventure/Drama." However, it would more properly be labeled "Fantasy," in addition; although, that appellation might fit a great number of "Westerns." The story contains much that is highly improbable in human behavior, and blends contemporary sensibilities with 19th century settings. But, this is entertainment. Furthermore, it is a uniquely American genre; and, we should expect no more realism than was found in ancient Greek, Roman, or 16th century British drama. Or mid-twentieth century Japanese movies.The story is based loosely on "The Seven Samurai," A mid-1950's film from Akira Kurosowa of Japan. Not having studied film at a university, I hold Kurusowa in a little lower esteem than do some folks; nevertheless, I have enjoyed his movies. He, of course was a fan of American westerns. Unlike "Samurai," the "Seven" is faster moving, was edited more tightly, and never leaves you wondering when it will end. It has American pacing; and, good editing means never having to say you're sorry for snipping extraneous footage. Perhaps Japanese courtesy prevented editors from cutting the redundancy out of "Samurai," to the point where it would be only two and a half hours long. Alas, it is a half-day in length. On the other hand, there are many points where us old Geezers can hit the head, without missing anything of significance. Not so the "Seven." It is, so to say, bang, bang bang.Part of the enjoyment is the inclusion of so many of our favorite actors; Charles Bronson (Bernardo O'Reilly?), Yul Brynner (Chris, a typical 19th century caballero?), Steve McQueen (Vin, facing possible death without a care), James Coburn (Britt, whose voice alone was enough to intimidate the bad guys; and who was the fastest knife in the west), Robert Vaughn (Lee, whose performance convinced all of us so inclined not to become gunslingers for hire), and Eli Wallach (Calvera, the head bandido!) So, editing and cinematography and sound are outstanding. The direction and script, as noted, often bear faint resemblance to reality; but, that is a fact rather than a criticism. And then we come to the music: It does not entice me to light up, even though it was the theme music for cigarette ads, Marlboro, I think. The movie is worth watching just for Elmer Bernstein's music, as is the case with his score in "The Great Escape." I have let this movie play when I was too busy to watch; because, not only is the music excellent, it tells the story melodically.If you are a young whippersnapper whose only movie experiences involve films with numerous explosions, car chases, drug use, profanity, gratuitous sex, and violence, you do not know what you are missing. Give it a try; you'll like it.Now, I would imagine there are ladies who would not find this movie highly entertaining, especially on the 37th viewing. Well, perhaps there are innate differences between the sexes. D'ya think?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film but ending could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is undoubtedely a legendary western - classic dialogue, an irresistible story and a memorable score. My favourite character is James Coburn's Britt, the lean and lazy gunslinger who prides himself on perfection. His 1st scene with the knife vs gun contest is brilliant and its he who is the 1st to say he will return to the village for the final battle because basically to him the bandits have dented his pride. I think too much time was spent on Horst Buckholz's character and certainly not enough on Robert Vaughn's who essentially has just the one decent scene to himself - if Coburn's character is fearless and competitive then Vaughn's is haunted and only along for the ride because there's no where else for him to go. Brynner and McQueen have the obvious showier roles whilst Bronson does OK as the hard man with a warm heart. Poor old Brad Dexter doesn't do much but golddig.The action sequences, particularly the ending, are OK but disappointing for me as its only really McQueen, Brynner and Buckholz that are involved too much. The deaths of Coburn, Vaughn and Bronson are disappointing as all three of them are killed by people off screen. Up there with Butch Cassidy and The Long Riders as my favourite westerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd heard about "The Magnificent Seven" for years, but only recently watched it on DVD along with its interesting "Making Of" documentary. I'm one of those who never saw the original "Seven Samurai", so I won't be comparing the two. Naturally I loved the music from TMS! It was interesting to hear what the documentary had to say about how competitive the "seven" were about getting noticed on-screen, especially Steve McQueen. I did wonder why he was always putting his hat on and off, for no obvious reason! Apparently, Yul Brynner told him that if he didn't stop it, he (Brynner) would remove his own hat, and that would be the end of it! ;-)Another interesting story was the one about the censors. Apparently, Mexicans were so insulted by the way they were portrayed in a previous Hollywood film shot in their country, that the Mexican government sent along minders on this one to see that Mexicans were shown in a more favorable light. IMO, the villagers in this film were still shown as fearful, helpless, brown-skinned people, looking to the brave, strong, benevolent white Americans to solve their problems, but it *was* an improvement over previous Hollywood offerings. At least the smaller roles were played by actual Hispanics, though the main "Mexican" roles were played by white actors, including a Russian and a German(!). Actually, I didn't even realize Horst Buchholz was supposed to be Mexican, despite his brown eyes and hair, until I watched the documentary! I can't complain too much about Eli Wallach, because he did such a good job, but these days the non-Mexican-ness of Chico and the Old Man are glaringly obvious. I did notice a sign of early-sixties liberalism when Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen's characters offered to see to the transport of a dead man who was being denied burial simply because he was Indian. As per usual for the era, the actresses had little to do except show fear and weep over their fallen husbands' bodies, with one as the rather boring love interest (though at least the actress who played her was Mexican). I liked Yul Brynner, the good guy dressed all in black, and quite sexy at 45 (or 40, depending on what source you go to). He did a good line in inscrutable and mysterious, as did James Coburn, though it got to be a bit much in the end. Everybody was so terminally cool (with one exception) that it started to feel a little two-dimensional. Just once I would have liked to see Brynner's character relax and let out a real laugh, even if he went straight back to being inscrutable and mysterious a minute later. Somebody mentioned the economy of the script - it's true, it conveys a lot with few words. The plot of the movie seems rather predictable now, but that may be because it's been copied so many times since! I appreciated the fact that the opening credits admitted straight out that this film was based on "The Seven Samurai". I wish this rule were enforced for all remakes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the Great Escape is my favorite McQueen flick, "7" is clearly his best overall performance.Much has already been said by others about how McQueen actually stole the spotlight from the film's designated star, Yul Brynner. But what impressed me most (after watching all his movies many times over) is his outstanding performance due to his total lack of appearing to "act" in this epic. McQueen comes off as if he was Vin in real life. He never mugs or hops around. Even flipping his neckerchief in time to watching the women of the village wash clothes comes off showing us a man who badly needs and wants a woman, but knows his commitment to the cause means he must remain celibate.His facial expressions during the first scenes of "riding shotgun on a hearse" to his spoken lines when praising the villagers' courage or telling Chris Adams that "he wasn't the only sucker in town" are delivered with timely sincerity and honest believability.This movie ranks with "High Noon, "Shane" &amp; "The Searchers" in setting the standards for American Western films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie now for at least the 20th or more time and it still pleases me. I have seen it on TV, first time in German (I am dutch), on video, on Laser Disc (packed with the follow up) and I have it now on DVD. You could say I'm a fan.This film must have been made in the prime of John Sturges, who in this period also directed another one of my favorites "the great escape" with a similar cast (Bronson, Coburn and of course McQueen). Why does this film stand out from so many others?I have no clue, but whatever it is, it works. Yul Brynner is the ultimate cool customer. He doesn't talk much, seems to think a lot, and despite the going ons behind the scenes of young guns wanting to steal the show he is the leader of the pack on screen. McQueen is laconic, smart and charming. The kind of guy you want to back you up when guns go off in your direction. Coburn and Bronson do what they do best. Buchholtz is a strangely apt Mexican (for a german) and Vaughn never gets on your nerves though he plays the gunfighter who has lost his nerve.There are so many things you can mention or write about this film but the only way to appreciate it's true brilliance is to watch it over and over again.My advise: See it, at least once a year, like I do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do "The Magnificent Seven," "The Sons of Kate Elder," "True Grit," "The Great Escape," "The Ten Commandments" and over 200 other movies and TV projects have in common?Elmer Bernstein's music.Along with Jerome Moross's "The Big Country" theme, "The Magnificent Seven" has got to be one of the most memorable scores of all time. Helped by the extensive play as the Marlboro theme (before cigarette ads were banned from TV), Bernstein's music makes a decent western truly unforgettable.Evident in Bernstein's music is the "big" dramatic sound influenced by American composer, Aaron Copeland ("Appalachian Spring," "Fanfare For The Common Man"). Even Bernstein's theme to "Animal House" (no doubt, meant to be a parody as much as the movie, itself) has a feel of something beyond the expected.Yeah, "The Magnificent Seven" was a rehash of "The Seven Samuri" and is less than inspiring in spots, illustrating, all the more, just what music can do for a movie. Bernstein sits alone atop the list of cinematic composers.</fullReview>

Each of the Seven is well-drawn, and given enough character time that you care for those who live and those who die. The concept of a "team" of specialists has contributed to dozens of movies since M7's release: there are any number of western TV shows (Wildside, Outlaws, Brisco County, and the eventual TV series M7 itself) who owe their existence to the concepts introduced here. Although Yul Brynner is the "star," it is also an interesting predecessor of the "ensemble" movies of later years, and lays the groundwork for much of those as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Shanes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure that Asian Yul Brynner must have been intrigued at the prospect of doing an American western, maybe it was the oriental origin of the story of The Magnificent Seven that intrigued him.The title refers to seven gunfighters who hire out to a Mexican village which is being systematically looted by a bandit named Calverra, played by Eli Wallach in his career film role. The film really ought to be called Shane Times Seven because each one of the seven is an aspect of Shane, the wandering knight who comes to the area, rights the wrongs in the place and moves on. Of course in this case a few of the seven stay.The seven are Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Brad Dexter, Robert Vaughn, and Horst Bucholtz. What I like about the Magnificent Seven and it's the mark of a great film is that each of the seven establishes his own personality in the film. Of course these are seven great film actors and are given a great script to work with. It's in contrast to the bandits where they are led by an admittedly charismatic leader in Wallach, but if he's killed they all cease to function. The seven also function well as a team because they are professionals. They're in Mexico for a variety of individual reasons, but all of them realizes they are in a dying profession in America. Very little call for their services, so $20.00 for six weeks work in Mexico has a lot of appeal. It's better than clerking in a grocery store for men of action.There's so much I love about The Magnificent Seven, it has two finely choreographed gunfights with Wallach's bandits, it has characters with style and grace. Most of all it has Elmer Bernstein's best musical score and that's saying something because Bernstein wrote so many great ones. But that infectious theme set a standard for the writing of western film music, in fact film music in general. If you've never seen The Magnificent Seven, that theme once heard is never forgotten.Sam Peckinpah's films clearly show the influence that John Sturges's The Magnificent Seven had. But this one establishes the mold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Sunday School Lesson, if Preachy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the best Western I've ever seen, 'Magnificent Seven' is an analogy for living the brave life. Had this been filmed in 1940, I would have accused it of being a propaganda film to bring our isolationist citizens into WWII. The theme has to do with deciding when it's time to fight, to throw off the oppressor, to quit being 'nice' or defeatist. "When good men do nothing, evil will reign." It could even be inspiration for throwing out a corrupt Congress that refuses to reform an evil electoral process that favors the rich and punishes the poor working class.  Watching the young Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughn and Yul Bryner at his height, you are amazed at the quality of acting from this bunch of stars. I never realized before how short Bryner was, but his acting as the leader of this brave bunch (the non-military 'Dirty Dozen') makes you forget this. John Sturges is to be commended for pulling an excellent acting job from each of them. Elia Kazan was quite believable as the evil Mexican bandit chief, and makes the swinging plot seem rational. Of course he would give these gun slingers their guns back, after defeating their attempts to save the town. NOT!!!!The little boys relationship with quiet Charles Bronson, the equally understated role playing of James Coburn was quite impressive. Heroism is represented in different ways by each of the Magnificent Seven, and is a wonderful morality lesson to those of us in these affluent but morally corrupt times. When is the last time you stood up to a bullying boss; when is the last time you defended a weaker co-worker in the shark pit of corporate America? After seeing this movie, you might be inspired to develop a backbone.Another subtle lesson was the "He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day" portion of the movie. Watching the leader of this gang of seemingly amoral cut-throats develop and exert his leadership was a management lesson for anyone who wishes to be a strong compassionate Program Manager. He didn't do it by force, but by patience and low-key demonstrations of his own prowess and bravery. Watching Bryner and McQueen drive the hearse of the Indian to the burial place against the wishes of the townspeople (who fought the integration of Boot Hill) was yet another example of moral bravery against all odds. That this whole bunch were marksmen who used their skill at shooting to enforce their goodness is the only troubling aspect--in a day when guns are available to anyone, and, just as in the Wild Wild West, their use is ubiquitous. Any time Yul Bryner is on screen, you will be haunted by Bryner's taped voice on that TV spot: "By the time you see this, I will be dead from the effects of smoking." Yet another lesson.Show this one to your kids' Sunday School class. They won't be bored, and they will learn about applied, practising Christianity (or any other religion whose objective is celebrating the dignity and nobility of man).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite possibly the most overrated movie of all time. It has a very recognizable cast and a great theme song, but placing this movie in a league with the all time greats is a joke. The acting and the script are suspect. Try watching this movie after the "Seven Samurai," "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly," or "High Noon" and you will see exactly how much less compelling and exciting this movie is. It is entertaining, but so was the "Three Amigos."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Disclaimer: I saw this quite a while ago, writing now because I just registered). If you want to enjoy this movie, don't watch Kurosawa's original. I like the idea of adapting stories into a different context (Apocalypse Now from Heart of Darkness for one), but the execution here is poor. Besides just plain bad writing and directing, the creators were faced with the inherent difficulty of translating the samurai with his strict code of conduct and highly evolved honor into the wandering selfish outlaw cowboy. Also, choices like joining the youngster and the clown into one character confuse. In the original, the clown is an oddball, but is also wise in a Shakespearian court jester kind of way. The young naive samurai was a separate character: innocent, eager to prove his worth, quick to fall in love, in need of a mentor, but full of talent. In the western update, the roles are merged, and therefore destroyed. That's just one detail I can remember. Overall, I was simply shocked at how bad it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe for laughs, but fails horribly as a Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't remember what I thought of this movie back in 1960. Whatever, it failed to register a positive enough memory to entice me into a second viewing....until this week when I saw the dvd version at our library. A Hollywood rip from the excellent Japanese movie, The Seven Samurai, fails horribly as a copy or as a Western.The film has a number of actors I've always enjoyed watching. The failure, as I see it, must sit with the script and direction. It is full of Hollywood style, social commentary, that borders on the ridiculous, at least for a Western.Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen team up early on to help transport a coffin to boot hill. Seems some of the town folk are preventing the burial because they don't want an Indian buried with the whites. Sure, and this Indian was lying dead in the street before some benevolent traveling salesman gave the undertaker $20 for a proper burial. This is a border town where temperatures do get into the hundreds. Bodies aren't left out in the noonday sun, like road kill, regardless of their racial makeup. Our two heroes volunteer to take the hearse up to boot hill. McQueen is given a "scatter gun" and rides shotgun on the hearse. Along the way (two blocks) he shoots someone (we guess) from a distance that a sawed-off shotgun wouldn't have been effective. We don't see who gets shot, but Brynner points out the window, which is open, thus making it suspicious. I could see the open window being suspicious in 1960, with the air-conditioning running, not during the movies period. They arrive at boot hill and the road block dissolves with one bigot being shot in the hand, another in the arm. The movie goes downhill from there.I do enjoy good Westerns. I didn't enjoy this film at all. Expect it could be rented more for laughs, which wasn't my purpose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not really understand the hype about this remake film of an outstanding original Japanese movie. I looked it once. It has to be admitted that the actors, a whole bunch of stars, make a good job. But the story which might be suitable and a little realistic in the original Japanese "The Seven Samurai" is not at all fitting in the Wild West. Perhaps the US audience liked this film for these reasons: 1. Americans like to believe that they are the heroic saviors of the suppressed peoples all over the world. The characters of the film embody this idea. It must be a slap in the face of Mexicans that in the film the Mexican village people are saved by the white US-boys (although not all of them are white), in spite of the US stealing half of the American West from the Mexicans 2. America had never real heroes so they have to create some in their movies, even the Wild West produced almost only doubtful heroes ? a Buffalo Bill who slaughtered bisons in the thousands and (mis-) used the injuns in his varieté shows in a neither realistic nor honorable way. With a Wyatt Earp who was allowed to falsify facts into movies, since he lived long enough to influence film making by his twisted biography. With Jesse James and Billy the Kid who were Outlaws etc. The seven magnificent are typical stereotype heroes. The US-Americans were with the exception of some independence war battles always victorious whenever they went into war ? except they had not the preponderance in armed forces. They defeated the natives, the Mexicans and others to come in their way always by the force of their outnumbering the opponent or by technical superiority. It is interesting to see that in patriotic styled Hollywood movies there is always a small number of good US boys fighting and defeating a superior enemy. It is in war films as well as in Westerns. Even Superman is a typical US-American invention. Therefore the trauma of Vietnam where this tradition was violated. 3. The Vietnam war was still to come, but many who appreciate the film, have the Vietnam war somewhere in their mind. And it also comes to the mind, that this ? the magnificent are the US army boys in Vietnam fighting the ugly communists there to free the South Vietnam village people who want freedom and later Coca Cola. The USA was a melting pot of all European characters and deserves to be portrayed more realistic. If you want to see honest western movies try the Naked Spur or the Wild Bunch or The Searchers. Too much patriotism in films is always ridiculous. The characters of the seven are not at all convincing (no matter of what nationality they were). The shooting scenes are an insult (which is mostly so in Westerns, if you want to see realistic shoot-out of the 19th century type watch "Bad Company" (1972). This film is for me nothing than a big kitsch. Campy, florid, puffed-up, swaggered, over-loaded, slobbery, infantile. The genre has dozens of great Westerns which are not only fun to watch but also have something deep going to transport in a sophisticated and honest manner. The message of this film is you have to stand for the (American) ideals to fight against the powers of evil, even if you have to sacrifice yourself. Fine! This is also the issue of 55% of the Western movies. Nothing new. This alone does not justify to give this film more than 1 star. I give another for the 7 stars. Does anybody know if this was the film that was most often shown to US soldiers in Vietnam?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's original Seven Samurai is infinitely better in all aspects. The Magnificent seven is a typical stereotypical Hollywood western which does not captivate at all and lacks character development. I have seen this movie once or twice and have no desire at all to ever see it again. The seven samurai i can watch over and over again without ever getting bored. Don't waste time on The magnificent seven, even though i am a great fan of Steve McQueen this is not one of his better movies. One thing that specifically irritated was the fact the boy stays with the girl. It is just too 'sweet' as if to compensate for the deaths of some of the seven. The Seven Samurai 'feels' more 'real' for me in a sense because there is no padding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The magnificent seven is honestly one of my favourite films. The movie has fantastic villains, brilliant heroes , amazing action , ground- breaking suspense. The pacing is a tad slow but if you cant appreciate an classic due to pacing , you shouldn't watch older movies. Nothing can hold back the enjoyment of the signature music with fantastic action and great gun props. If you haven't watched this movie. WATCH IT! Its a joy to watch as they team up against Eli Whallach and his army. Spoiler alert! when some of the characters died It is truly sad as it doesn't focus on a few members of the seven , It focuses on all of them. Yul Brynner is a fantastic lead and is a fantastic action herocowboy, as does for all members. I recommend everyone watch this masterpiece that will be remembered for all time.I don't see how the reboot in 2016 could beat this incredible western that is one of the best movies of all time!(in my opinion).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I would like to say I'm not a fan of westerns in any way shape or form, in fact I've spent many a Sunday afternoon catching up on my sleep in front of them!... BUT! The magnificent seven was indeed everything all the hype said it would be.In Hollywood it's extremely rare to have so many A list actors on one set with the notable exception of oceans 11 for example. Astronomic egos aside the chemistry between notably McQueen and Brynner was superb, in fact there was almost no room on the screen for the other 5 guys, Bronson, Wallach, Coburn, Vaughn and Dexter.This film had me gripped for the full 2 hours, with all its early 60s shine and in your face "gonna beat you up and laugh" machismo.Of course it helps if you didn't watch the "three amigos" before hand because unfortunately I kept thinking dusty, Ned and lucky may also turn up for a fight, the music and the stereotyped Mexicans were pretty much the same, so for goodness sake stay away from "the three amigos" before watching this classic!In summary I recommend "the magnificent seven", I was skeptical because I loath most westerns, this however is one you will not take your self off the sofa for so put the kettle on load yourself up with snacks and enjoy this classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a cool trip down memory lane in more ways than one. Not only do you have all those great Sixties actors - Brynner, McQueen, Wallach, Bronson and Coburn all in one picture, but for anyone who was around prior to the banning of cigarette commercials on TV in 1970, the memorable Marlboro theme song provides a good share of the background score in more than one spot. In a way, I feel bad that modern day viewers don't have the same perspective for having missed the experience.With my most recent viewing of the film, I was paying attention to things I'd just recently read in the Marshall Terrill biography, "Steve McQueen, The Life and Legend of a Hollywood Icon". McQueen, who had been released from his Four Star TV contract filming the hit series "Wanted: Dead or Alive", was extremely competitive and did anything he could to draw viewer attention from the movie's principal star Yul Brynner. If you'll notice, he did things like shake his shotgun shells, flip a coin, fuss with his Stetson, tug his bandana and whistle through his teeth, all seemingly natural as part of his character, but manufactured on the set to upstage Brynner, who got very agitated over it. McQueen's goal, which he eventually achieved, was to become as big or even bigger movie star than Brynner or anyone else for that matter.The best part of the movie for me is in the early going when Chris (Brynner) and Vin (McQueen) are putting the band of seven together to go up against Mexican bandit Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his outlaw bunch. Especially cool was the knife challenge called by cowboy Wallace (Robert J. Wilke) against the laid back Britt (James Coburn). A classic example of someone pushing too hard and just too long before he gets his comeuppance. Sometimes the result is more final than one would expect.Based on Akira Kurosawa's "The Seven Samurai", the movie clocks in at an economical two hours and change against the three and a half hour Japanese epic. Granting the earlier film's vaunted status, this Western reworking stands on it's own two feet as a classic Western that holds up well more than fifty years since it's original release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Evidently, plans area afoot to remake "The Magnificent Seven", but I don't see how they can top this movie. That's not closed-minded, just speaking to the resonance of the original 1960 classic (itself a remake, a point not lost on me).Regardless, I can't think of a more accessible Western than this film right here. It's got everything: good (though well-trod) story, great script, atmospheric locales and a highly charismatic cast. Not to mention an unshakable sense of adventure and a great study of real bravery thrown in for good measure. This is a fun ride from start to finish, and it's a pleasure getting to spend some time with such layered characters. This is the total package.9/10 On the matter of Yul Brynner: this is my first exposure to the man (aside from his robot part in "Westworld"), and you couldn't ask for a better intro. He possess a nobility, even as a hired gunfighter. Not only that, but it's the way he carries himself; upright, determined swagger, but all kinds of likable. His reputation is beyond question.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the time of its theatrical release, "The Magnificent Seven" didn't exactly endear itself to American audiences or American movie critics. I suspect that may be because many people thought the idea of remaking Kurosawa's classic samurai film came across as blasphemy. Seen today, the movie looks a lot better. It's fun to see a number of its actors before they were famous, and Elmer Bernstein's music has become a classic. Also, the movie puts some interesting spins on Kurosawa's basic story; for instance, the chief bad guy in this remake gets some substantial dialogue, and the movie puts in an unexpected plot twist just before the action-packed climax.While I'm on the topic of action, I'll bring up the reason I think that a number of modern viewers (including some here in these user comments) don't like the movie. There isn't a huge amount of action in this movie; in fact, the first half is almost action free. The movie takes its time instead to set the plot and characters up, and puts in a lot of work afterwards to maintain this. Some impatient modern viewers will probably find much of the movie slow. Personally, I didn't, though I'm more accustomed to older movies than many modern day viewers. So the more you like older (and more leisurely paced) movies, the stars in the cast, and westerns in general will probably tell you whether you'll like this movie or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every bit as enjoyable as the 1954 Japanese original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the Seven Samurai a few years ago which is the 1954 original classic film which this remake is based on. I'll admit to enjoying the original film, but if I'm being honest I did feel that at nearly 3 and a half hours it ran on for much longer than necessary. I decided to give this film a try as it does have a reasonably good IMDb rating and I also wanted to see how it stacked up against the much loved original film.The good news is that this film is very good and it's certainly one of the better remakes that I've come across in my time. I think one major thing that runs in the Magnificent Seven's favour is that it is much better paced than the original - we get to the action and 'meat of the plot' fairly quickly and there was never a dull moment in this remake. I did feel that in the original film there was far too much time spent on finding the Samurai to defend against the village and there were moments where it did get a bit boring, but the faster pacing of the remake does make it a slightly more enjoyable experience on the whole.Next we come to the cast and I must say that Yul Brynner was exceptional as the leader of the Magnificent Seven. His deep voice and cool and calm demeanour made him an ideal choice for this role and he doesn't disappoint. Of course, one good actor can't make a film great on their own and Brynner gets lots of support from the likes of Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and Robert Vaughan to name a few. Eli Wallach was also excellent in the role of Calvera who is the leader of the bandits. Whilst he is portrayed as a 'bad guy' in some ways I found him more to be a 'likeable rogue'. Wallach is a fantastic actor and for me he was probably the strongest actor in this film (although I'll admit that Brynner comes in a close second). The Oscar nominated score by Elmer Bernstein was also great and fitted well with the tone of the film. The Magnificent Seven also has a humorous tone running through it and this made it all the more enjoyable. There are a couple of scenes where some kids are following Charles Bronson's character around (much to his annoyance) which did make me laugh.The only minor negatives I can thing of with this film is that I didn't think the finale of the Magnificent Seven was anywhere near as exciting as the finale of the Seven Samurai. In some ways the Seven Samurai was like a Firework with a very long fuse - you'll wait ages and ages and then BANG. The finale of the Seven Samurai is one of the most exciting finales that I've ever seen. Magnificent Seven differed in that there were lots of fireworks going BANG, BANG, BANG, but then when they came to the last firework there was just a slight puff of smoke, but no BANG. The ending of the Magnificent was by no means bad, but it was disappointing in comparison to the original.One thing I will say is that if you watched the Magnificent Seven and enjoyed it then I would definitely recommend watching the original film Seven Samurai. It is quite a lot longer than the Magnificent Seven, but if you're patient then you'll find that film just as rewarding as this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep," says the chief villain of the piece, a bandido leader played by Eli Wallach, native New Yorker who had trouble staying on his horse.Let's see. Japanese director Akira Kurosawa admired the Westerns of John Ford, so in the early 50s he made "The Seven Samurai." It was a cracking good movie, full of character and action, and it introduced slow-motion violence to modern audiences. It was a big critical hit internationally too, although mostly shown in art houses, and inspired a whole Japanese genre of samurai movies.Hollywood, with its eyes on the yen, copied it in this highly successful remake, which transposed the story from the samurai period of Japan to America's West. It too was a big hit and inspired a string of sequels including "The Magnificent Seven Ride", "Return of the Seven," and "The Magnificent Seven Conquer Santa Claus." Sergio Leone, ever alert, modeled some of his spaghetti Westerns such as "A Fistful of Dollars" after the "Seven" movies. This generated a string of inexpensive Italian Westerns.So "Sabata" and "A Man Called Sledge" are Italian imitations of an Italian imitation of a Hollywood imitation of a Japanese imitation of Hollywood Westerns. The lenticular theory of cultural diffusion applies."The Magnificent Seven", despite its exotic inspiration, adheres to all the conventions of the stereotypical Western. You have to be fast on the draw to be a professional gunfighter. They have no wives or children, no homes, no place to settle down, and they miss those things, but they just can't accept the drudgery of a farmer's existence or the dreaded "grocer's store." You drift from place to place, hoping to find some "action", and that's life.Down on their luck, seven fast guns are drawn by the promise of twenty dollars to defend a Mexican village from the two-hundred bandits who periodically raid it and leave the residents only enough to survive until the next raid. The villagers are willing but inept, so the Americans teach them defensive tactics. They supply the farmers with arms and teach them how to use them.Released in 1960, the movie was probably shot in 1959. Mexico, as usual, serves as a stand-in for any foreign country -- it's "across the border." Globally, at the time, the US and its allies were doing their best to contain communism, which seemed to be gobbling up whole territories. Nineteen fifty-six saw a brutal squashing of an anti-communist movement in Hungary, and 1959 saw Fidel Castro absorb Cuba. The bandits -- I mean the communists -- were infiltrating much of the world, including Latin America. And the USA was about to send professional advisers to a place in Southeast Asia called Vietnam. We'd whip those peasant into shape and give them modern weapons.However, "The Magnificent Seven" is almost prescient in depicting the Mexican villagers as divided in their opinion. Their first engagement with the enemy is successful, but the enemy has withdrawn to regroup. Some want to go on fighting after that first successful brush with Wallach and his gang. Others prefer a peaceful accommodation to the siren song of the Vietcong -- I mean the Mexican bandits. The men of the village argue about which is the better course. The "wise old man" -- a Jungian archetype if there ever was one -- counsels patience and peace.It's that conflict of opinion that makes this Western more than just another dumb movie about hired mercenaries saving a bunch of helpless men, women, and children. The villagers' conflict puts the Seven in conflict too. They're not wanted anymore, so how can they stay? Yet if they leave, it will be at the expense of their honor because they know another encounter is coming.And what a gang these seven are -- derived as closely as possible from Kurosawa's originals. Horst Buchholz is in the Toshiro Mifune role of the eager but clumsy amateur, Chico with a German accent. In the original, the leader was an old man. No room for aged leaders yet in Hollywood movies. That would come later with "The Wild Bunch." No -- the leader is Yul Brynner, Chris with a Russian accent. He strides when he walks. He speaks slowly and clearly and reasonably. When a drunken Buchholz shoots two bullets past his nose, Brynner calmly smokes a cigar and stares at the wall. He's like the man who once had an awkward moment just to see what it felt like. The part played by James Coburn -- silent, moody, proud, precise, expert -- comes closest to Kurosawa's original. Robert Vaughan is the Southern gentleman gun slinger, a stock character. But they all have their quirks, and none is given to talking' things out in words. They point instead, or they nod to each other or signal with their eyes, except the clumsy and boastful Buchholz, the disturbed adolescent of so many 1950s films.I hadn't seen it in almost twenty years and kind of enjoyed it as a fairy tale, a little more complex than most. The kids will enjoy the mass slaughters and won't understand why Vaughan is plagued with nightmares. Four of the seven are lost heroically but the villagers are at peace and able to defend themselves against depredations by anybody else. In Vietnam, of course, we had to call in Rambo to save the village.</fullReview>

In view of the low pay, come the end only seven men, determined to free the people from this scourge."The Magnificent Seven" is a people western by John Sturges ("Conspiracy of Silence", 1955). Its screenplay is of William Roberts, Walter Bernstein and Walter Newman, its script western is an adaptations of "Seven Samurai", (Kurosawa, 1954). The main melody of the soundtrack, was composed by Elmer Bernstein. It has been a hallmark of the film, and was imitated by many later westerns. This film is considered a genre classic western. It was nominated for an Oscar for best soundtrack.The film was shot on location in Morelos (Mexico) and on the sets of Churubusco Studios (Mexico DF).This western has adventure, action and drama. Many people believe that it begins the western twilight, after the stage of classic western (1930-1960). The setting puts the facts in the penultimate decade of the century, in imposing the rule of law in the West and emerging major economic, social and public order. The former hero of the West gives way to the decadent figure of displaced persons in distress, without a present and future. The 7 gunmen have no jobs, no prospects. They struggle and suffer economic fear and anxiety disorders. Some seek paid work as simple and underpaid, like chopping wood, cowboy or work as a clerk in a grocery store.The film has a splendid photography and an exceptional cast that completes this myth western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. If you really want to know about it, watch "The Seven Samurai". This movie was based off of it. Yes, the acting is cheesy, but it was released in 1960...to them, that was the best acting around. It has a great plot, and extremely similar to "The Seven Samurai", but more modernized. You'll have to watch both tho know what I mean. If you want to watch "The Seven Samurai" for free, here is the link: http://tesla.liketelevision.com/liketelevision/search/movies.php? q=Movies&amp;theme=guide I warn you, it's in black and white, and the captions are white so it's somewhat difficult to read at times. It's also about a 3 1/2 hour movie, so have patience. Unlike the 1960 movie, this takes a little more time to get into all the action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent Indeed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fifty years later, it's hard to imagine a time when this wasn't considered an "all-star" picture. The Magnificent Seven stands as one of those rare flukes of casting, where a bunch of really great actors of various degrees of success are pulled together and launched to greater stardom, effectively putting Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Eli Wallach, and Robert Vaughn on the map and (as far as the stars of such films go) changing the face of action/adventure movies for the next twenty years.If there were an award for great foresight in film casting, then whoever cast this picture should get the gold!Likewise, composer Elmer Bernstein should have been given an Academy Award for his infinitely memorable film score.During a recent television interview, Robert Vaughn dropped an interesting anecdote about Steve McQueen on the set of the movie, describing him as "paranoid" and making a nervous remark about the size of Yul Brynner's gun! I think maybe that's why McQueen felt the need to try and upstage him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Worth Its Fame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The strength of the very good script and Japanese movie are obvious throughout this American remake. As form, it's a western; as content, it's an action drama. Melodramatic and exaggerated, yet interesting and well?made.Sensational cast, and very delectable movie. History was fair to these actors. In The Magnificent Seven (1960), Steve McQueen was 30; Charles Bronson was 39; while Robert Vaughn was 28. They made suited careers. Bronson played in The Magnificent Seven (1960), The Great Escape (1963), The Dirty Dozen (1967), managing to have a part in these three action films.The leads are quite impressing?Brynner, who is the best; and also McQueen, Bronson, Coburn . Wallach does a very good role. Vaughn is stilted (his character is a very stilted hired gun, and Vaughn overplays it, so the effect is at least doubled), but interesting. Brynner, who was so fine in this first American Magnificents movie, will be quite banal in the next installment of the franchise. As far as acting is concerned, Brynner, McQueen, Coburn, Bronson and Wallach are matchless and constitute the core of the film. The comic touches are effective. The action is intelligently managed; Wallach's character is very finely written?he's not a hellish villain, but a man who understands courage and chivalrous merits. He gives the Seven the permission to go and gives them back their guns not because he is stupid or arrogant or because he undervalues them?but because he appreciates their qualities. This has to be one of Wallach's best creations; because it's so well written, I have liked it better than his Tuco. And if one is interested in the artistic range of these actors, I would say that Brynner, Wallach and Coburn are the best.McQueen tells a very good joke about "so far so good".The Magnificent Seven (1960) is well crafted. The pace is deftly maintained.The music is deservedly legendary; Bernstein will score also the two sequels of TMS.The oriental wisdom about the qualities of the peons, as opposed to the values and merits of the errant gunmen, might be not very convincing in the American setting; it worked certainly better in the Japanese original?where it belonged to a larger set of values. In the American remake there is nothing very impressing about the virtues of simple humble life as opposed to the wandering life of a hired gun. Yet it's nonetheless true that even the American remake has a certain sobriety and good?sense that you could gain a new appreciation of by seeing the two sequels?where everything is reversed and where the revolutionary virtues of the peons are exalted, by means of a vague leftist propaganda. Fortunately McQueen, Coburn and Bronson will star together in the famous WW 2 action film.The Magnificents franchise consists of this Brynner/McQueen/Wallach film, and of its sequels.I know two sequels of this film; they are both phony, but likable in a campy way. They're both slapdash, extremely uninspired. The one with G. Kennedy is silly, but funny (in a weird and wholly unintentional way). The Oates film tried to be funny?it is lugubrious and ugly; the G. Kennedy one tried to be cool?it is funny.The Magnificent Seven (1960) is an action drama in western form; the two sequels are commando films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mexican bandits terrorize a town, but are challenged to a climactic battle, mentally, emotionally, and physically,with THE SEVEN, to the death!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both the Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven were the defining films of their time and their subjects, but in my book, they both get a 10. Vin, Chico, Britt, Chris, and Bernardo are the most adept with a gun from what the audience can see. My all-time favorite scenes in this movie are of course, the knife throwing scene and the journey up boot hill, but also, any scene that contains that purely awesome score by, definitely, one of the greatest movie scorers of all time- Elmer Bernstein. In several other films that he scored, I have noticed that he uses music very similar to the score from this outstanding movie, that has no flaws whatsoever. MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!! Lee and Harry are cowards in their own right, only in on the deal for their own rewards and interests. It has often been debated why Britt throws down his knife when he dies, and I do not exactly know why he threw it down, but no matter- it was one of the best scenes of the film. The romance between Petra and Chico was simply great, at times it was comical, at times it was dramatic, at times it was touching, and at other times, it was totally unexpected. The only characters that really voice their feelings and emotions for the village and its people are Chico, Bernardo, and Chris. Harry and Lee do not talk about such things- but they do interact with the villagers. Lee in his scene about fear. Harry in his few scenes about gold and why Calvera keeps terrorizing the villagers. In Lee's scene about fear, one of the villagers says that for a man who has fought so many times, Lee must have great courage. Lee replies, with a voice not his own, by saying "until you lose your nerve". In other words, Lee was once a gunman, just like the others, until one day, it just came to him that he was scared, and had been scared for a while. I imagine that whenever he realized this, he was in a gunfight, and he ran away like a scared rabbit. As for Harry, he wonders why Calvera keeps coming to the village. Harry thinks its because of gold. He is wrong. Calvera keeps coming to the village because of what he wants from the villagers. But Calvera could have all these things, and more, if he fixed up his life, stopped being lazy, and actually went out and did something for a change, instead of stealing it from innocent people who work hard for it, unlike he does. He actually does not work for anything; he is just good at what he does- stealing and killing. Britt and Vin do care about the village, and the people in it, but Britt is not a person who talks about things like that, because he does not do anything he does not want to do, such as getting into it with Wallace back at the border town, or talking about his emotional feelings for the village. Britt is a character who does not much care about anything, no matter what people think or say. When he competes with Wallace in the "contest", he could have killed him the first time, but he didn't. He did not want to kill him. But when Wallace starts irritating him, and insisting that they do it for real, then Britt kills him, probably to shut him up. That is not exactly said, but it is implied, and I believe it. I am not surprised, because around this time, that was the kind of character James Coburn played, and good. You notice that he is the only one of the seven that does not interact with the villagers, or speak very much. Very aloof and definitely not sensitive. Vin does talk about his feelings for the village, but only in a couple of scenes. Otherwise, he is not the same as Britt, but he is his own character- Vin. Supposedly, a lot of McQueen's acting in this was ad-libbed. That is because that is not acting or the character Vin, that is just Steve McQueen: all out. HE HAD A TOWN AT HIS MERCY, AND THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN AT HIS THROAT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding western!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wanna watch a western? This is about as good as it gets. As the opening credits roll and the Mexican bandits ride into the village, Elmer Bernstein's remarkable musical score (remember the Marlboro theme?) sets the stage for an exciting series of events. The music keeps the movie at an upbeat pace from beginning to end.Yes, it's a remake of The Seven Samarai. But who cares. That one was a classic. But it didn't involve gunfighters and Mexican bandits. Which makes Magnificent Seven different enough to stand as a classic in its own right.Yul Brynner was a huge star in 1960. Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn were not. Robert Vaughn was not yet known as Napoleon Solo. German actor Horst Buchholz made an unlikely Mexican but was charismatic nonetheless. And Eli Wallach was outstanding as the Mexican bandit leader. Only Brad Dexter fails to impress among the Seven.The story is well known. Seven gunfighters accept a job defending a Mexican village against a band of roughly 40 Mexican bandits. As Bronson says upon being recruited by Brynner, "I admire your notion of fair odds." The gunfighters have various motives for taking the assignment. Brynner and McQueen are desperate gunfighters with nothing else to do in a changing west. Dexter is an old friend of Brynner's and assumes Brynner wouldn't take such a job unless the village had hidden treasure. Coburn is aces with a knife or gun and looks for a challenge. Bronson is a penniless mercenary and needs what little money the job pays. Vaughn is a gunslinger on the lam and sees the job as a chance to hide out from his enemies. Buchholz is a rebellious Mexican farmer looking to trade his farming skills for the life of a gunslinger.There are numerous unforgettable scenes in the film: Brynner and McQueen defy bullets as they ride a hearse to Boot Hill to bury a body no one wants buried there. Coburn accepts a challenge to duel with his knife against a gun. McQueen gets overcome with adrenaline as he hops on his horse and singlehandedly pursues 20-30 Mexican bandits after a battle. When faced with insurmountable odds and given the chance by the bandits to leave with their lives, Coburn is the first of the seven to announce he won't run ("Nobody hands me my guns and tells me to go"). Without knowing what the other six will do, it's a suicide mission for the man still seeking the ultimate challenge. But McQueen (who previously had second thoughts about staying) promptly steps up to join him. As do Brynner, Bronson and Buchholz. Dexter tells them they are crazy and prepares to leave with Vaughn. Until Vaughn, heretofore too afraid to draw his gun against the Mexicans, decides it's time to ante up.Very subtly, this is one of the major moments of the film. Vaughn's character had been using the village as a hideout from those who would kill him back in the States. His only instinct was for his own survival and he was yet to draw his gun against the Mexican bandits. But faced with the decision to stay or run, "Lee" decides it's time to fight. And for the first time, the Mexicans are about to see just what a killer Lee can be. As the gunfighters counter attack, things are going badly for them until Robert Vaughn's "Lee" smoothly dispatches three bandits guarding the villagers. With the villagers thus free to aid the gunfighters, the battle turns in favor of the Seven.Most of the seven don't make it through the final battle, which makes their decision to fight all the more valiant. The gunfighters are admirably portrayed with emotions ranging from steadfast duty (Brynner) to uncertainty (McQueen) to compassion (Bronson) to cowardice (Vaughn). The bandits are portrayed as desperate men with needs of their own. The villagers are portrayed as men caught between caring for the welfare of their families, their desire to fight their enemies and their fear of fighting as farmers against bloodthirsty bandits.Magnificent Seven is a classic western. Great story, great cast, great music. If it's not the greatest western ever made, it sure isn't far from the top of the list. It's one hell of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw The 7 at the theaters in 1960, I have since watched it 100+ times and still enjoy watching it today. The banding together of unique individuals for a desperate mission is no new story. But these characters and the men that portray them (most of whom when on to wonderful careers in movies) are excellent. The music is legendary and still stirs a heart. The story line of bad men doing good things or good men doing bad things is what makes the world go around. Each of the characters could have a full story behind them but you get the feeling of their pasts without ever REALLY knowing what it was. I will continue to watch it and enjoy it every single time. It may not contain the graphic violence of today or depict the sex angle but it is definite a definitive western. truly - The 7 is Magnificent!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A major theme of the film is loss and that's what makes it a truly great film. None of the seven are heroes because their motives are so mixed. Yet they become united in common purpose thanks to the three village interviewees, the youngest of the seven and their treatment by Calvera. We do not see this common purpose as mawkish or contrived because Chris is such a credible figure whose bearing is noble and ennobling. Yet we are always brought back to the sense of loss. The old ways of the gunfighter are going, capitalism is rearing its head and one cannot simply take anymore without consequences. The old man sums it up beautifully at the end...truly one of the great westerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not one for typically watching westerns and finding them entertaining unless they are exceptional and unique, this applies. The lines used with humor, the exceptional cast; any clichéd lines work, even when they sound hokey. Most, however, are not. It's all in the details. Although Yul Brynner seems to be the dominant character, Steve McQueen catches the viewer's eye with his humorous comments and jokes, spare as they may be. This is one of those movies that uses each and every character, famous or not. Each actor seems to lend himself to the film as if without him, it would be less of a movie. The seven are tough but valiant, brave but human. The ending just seems heroic.</fullReview>

They will use their skills to combat evil even against impossible odds. They are joined by a seventh--a callow youth who at first idolizes them and their life of the gun and the saloon but in the end realizes that the future will belong to those who set down roots and live quietly.Only a couple of the original six will live to "ride on" but the others have chosen a noble death over life without meaning. It is these "Japanese" aspects to the story that make this picture unique among westerns and worth seeing even fifty years after it was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For my money, the best Western EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Magnificent Seven to me stands alone above any other Western, and there are a great many other contenders, the John Ford/John Wayne cavalry trilogy, How the West Was Won, the 1939 Stagecoach and even Little Big Man to name a few. Excellent cast of actors all ascending to the peak of their careers, all the names would go on to more good roles. Not enough can be said about the fantastic Elmer Bernstein score. The main theme is as familiar as just about anything ever written for a film, and the secondary themes are just as memorable. Particularly, the fanfare that plays after Vin and Chris deliver their "cargo" to the cemetery and turn the hearse around is joyful and triumphant, perfect for the scene. Yul Brynner (Chris) is, of course, most remembered as the king of Siam, but brings a combination of world weariness, sympathy and idealism that's hard to match. Steve McQueen (Vin)tries constantly to steal the picture with his bits in the background of seemingly every shot, so much so that Yul threatened to quit if Steve didn't stop upstaging him. Yul was after all the first billed star and believed it was his picture, at least when he was on screen. They patched things up, thankfully. Charles Bronson (Bernardo) played the muscular gunman who befriends the kids to perfection. James Coburn (Britt)is the knife fighter who seldom talks, but gets his point across one way or another; see his first scene. His friend, Robert Vaughn (by the way, the only living member of the Seven currently) plays a gun fighter, Lee, who has lost his nerve and reflexes. Horst Bucholz, an international star from Germany, plays the hero-worshipping Chico who won't take no for an answer and tags along for the adventure after Chris humiliates him and advises him not to be a gunman. Last, but not least, Brad Dexter plays Harry, a cynic who can't believe Chris has recruited the men for an altruistic purpose. The chief villain, Calvera is played with relish by Eli Wallach. When we first meet him, he shoots a villager and has to look at his holster when he returns the pistol to it, no villain has ever done that or is likely to again. The Mexican government wouldn't allow the peasant to be seen in dirty clothes, so after a day of digging in the dirt or tending the hogs, they're positively sparkling. The battles for the village are spectacular, filled with action and stunts. After Calvera returns and captures the seven, then releases them, saying, "A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for a thousand years", they come back again to help the villagers who betrayed them, angry that they've been ordered out by Calvera. Harry opts out, but comes back during the final battle and asks Chris why they were really there, he can't believe it was only to help the town rid itself of the outlaws. Chris tells him because of gold, and Harry dies saying, "I knew it!" Four of the seven die in the climactic shootout, one decides to stay in the village and marry a local girl, two ride off and say the memorable exit line; I won't repeat it, watch the movie, it's a fitting finish to the film and a way of life (the traveling gunfighter). The extras on the DVD are well worth watching. There's a super documentary,audio commentary by Eli Wallach, James Coburn and executive producer, Walter Mirisch. For an American Western remake of a Japanese Samurai movie, this is an incredibly brilliant and entertaining movie. 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having grown up during the spaghetti western era and being a huge fan of the old classic western movies, The Magnificent Seven rates among my top 5 of all time. These types of westerns - like Last Train to Gun Hill starring Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn, and Shane starring Alan Ladd, Hombre starring Paul Newman, can never be replaced or replicated due to the nature of our world and the current views of the general public. It was OK to shoot guns, to be a good guy, to fight for a cause, to take the law into your own hands for the sake of what needed to be done. I have 3 brothers in my family who grew up fairly close in age and each of us grew up with holster sets and guns and shoot em up, bang, bang, mentality - yet we never really thought of it as being violent. My baby brother was nicknamed Cheyenne and he is so-called to this day. It was more like Three Stooge fun, hiding behind furniture,holding up stages, being shot, wounded and dead. I would show this western to my grandchildren in a heart beat because of the heart that went into it. When I think of it, I instantly hear the background music and I want to see it again. Each of these greats tells a story about what's important and worth fighting for - they are patriotic and as American as apple pie. I have always wished that I could find a time machine and visit the old west - my gun - my horse - my way - or get out of town! A good story, plenty of action, where humanity is explored and found to be in good health. I had a double holster set because no good cowpoke should ever run out of bullets and some of those six shooters never ran out of lead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie was released, Steve McQueen was still on TV making "Wanted - Dead or Alive". He was an emerging star but Yul Brenner was the primary draw. Looking back, the majority of the Magnificent Seven plus Eli Wallach as the villain went on to become successful actors. McQueen, as well as James Colburn and Charles Bronson became headliners, and Robert Vaughan had a very successful run as "The Man from Uncle" on TV. When you think about it, there have probably not been too many other movies that have a cast that includes so many future stars early in their careers. While the plot of this movie is predictable, the real treat here is the interaction between the seven gunfighters, as well as their confrontation with the evil villain as portrayed by Eli Wallach. (Of course, I will never understand why he decided to give their guns back to them.) And, finally, Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack is truly "Magnificent".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even McQueen could not save the film from being average in my eyes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two of John Sturges' most famous films came in the 1960s. They were The Great Escape (1963) and The Magnificent Seven. Both starred Steve McQueen, one of the most popular stars of the rolling sixties. An icon of popular culture, McQueen symbolized the hip and cool male who broke no sweat under intense pressure. In The Magnificent Seven, he plays Vin, a gunfighter who possesses a deadly shot, starring alongside Yul Brynner, who plays Chris, a leader of sorts who gathers five more gunfighters to help to protect some poor farmers in a small Mexican village from marauding bandits.Sturges' film is a simple story of good versus evil, of gunslingers versus bandits. If it seems familiar, it is because it has been made before. Six years prior to the release of this film to be specific. The Magnificent Seven owes a huge debt to Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954), a masterpiece of action spectacle and drama, of which Sturges' film is very heavily based on. Essentially an American remake of Kurosawa's film, The Magnificent Seven is known to be a classic in the Western genre, but in my opinion, it is an uninspired effort that falls flat on many occasions.The main problem with Sturges' film is that the characters are not very well developed. With the exception of the Charles Bronson character, who has some tender moments with a trio of kids, nearly everyone else seem like they are part of a staged set-up. There is a lack of spontaneity in the acting, and the lines of dialogue merely serve to push the narrative forward instead of fleshing out the characters. Mind you, there are seven roles (eight, if you count the main villain) here. Kurosawa understood this and spent more than an hour to develop his characters prior to the action.Speaking of action, when it comes to crunch time, The Magnificent Seven delivers the kind of stuff that audiences would expect, but not necessarily admire. Shootouts are quite standard for the genre, but it is Sturges' execution that leaves audiences expecting more because it is not done well enough. Perhaps the best part of the film is Elmer Bernstein's music, which is readily identifiable and easy to hum along to. For a Western of considerable reputation, I feel that The Magnificent Seven feels quite outdated. It is more forgettable than not. Even McQueen could not save the film from being average in my eyes.GRADE: C+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not `Magnificent' either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I have seen THE SEVEN SAMURAI numerous times, I never had the chance to see this film until fairly recently. I imagine with most Americans it's probably the other way around.Anyway, I was expecting a story that was similar to the original film, but that diverged from the source material in most key areas. To my surprise, this was a nearly scene-by-scene remake, with only the setting changing.It's no surprise that the film works so well in a western setting. Kurosawa was influenced by American westerns, and saw a lot of parallels between samurai and the gunslingers of the Old West. If I didn't know any better, I could have sworn that the storyline was originally written to take place in a Mexican village.The film is weakest when it strays from the original. For example, the villagers in this film are portrayed as saints and victims throughout, whereas in Kurasawa's film they have a darker side. More importantly, the character of Chico is diluted greatly in comparison to Toshiro Mifune's character in the Japanese film. Horst Buchholz isn't a bad actor, but he doesn't even come close to Mifune's nuanced breakout performance. It was also a big mistake to portray the character as the `young lover.' A better choice would have been to case Eli Wallach here (instead of as the leader of the bandits).The acting is pretty good, especially Wallach and Yul Brynner?however it doesn't come close to matching the original. Steve McQueen seems to be `phoning it in,' he's capable of much better. Charles Bronson is wasted. It doesn't help that the characters don't feel all that well-developed.Overall, I enjoyed the film. The action is well-staged and everything is crisply paced. However, I will admit that my experience was tainted by my love for THE SEVEN SAMURAI, which is the far superior film. I do recommend it, but please?see the original first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this is meant to be an inferior re-make of `Seven Samurai' but having not seen that picture, I won't be measuring it against it. Here we have a simple story - seven men hired to defend a village against marauders. Fair enough. And, as you would expect, the men are quite eclectic, as such motley crews are. There's the old and wise one. There's the young risk-taker. There's the shady-past one and so forth. Thankfully the characterisation here actually succeeds. This is because we spend time building up the crew, and getting to know the characters, before we embark into the action-fest. This is hardly new - `Ocean's 11' recently did the same idea - but `The Magnificent Seven' does it better than most. Not all the characters are well drawn, but there's enough there to distinguish each one, which means its already ahead of a lot of similarly themed movies.Do the actors lend credibility to their roles? Yeah, they do. Yul Brunner gets the most screen-time and his face and mannerisms are perfectly suited to the stoic, wise one. The others all seem to fit their roles - the young one is sprightly and good looking for example while the gambler is suitably more rotund. No one steals the limelight from anyone else. but they do their job with some competence.The film melds together well. Director John Sturges balanced the character development, with the acting. The action scenes, including the battles, are staged with enough finesse that they don't become confusing, despite the number of protagonists involved. That's a good thing. There's also a nice sense of the west here, without resorting to clichés. The sets look like actually buildings, rather than planks of wood. There's dust in the air, but not an over abundance. It lends a grittier, realistic edge to the proceedings. In particular the village itself is well designed, obviously catered to allow a decent battle towards the movies end with the viewer actually gaining a proper sense of the layout. It all lends to giving the movie a more polished feel.I can't say the movie is perfect. Certainly some of the character is slow, and, while they're developed, they're not always sufficiently developed for us to care about them. There could perhaps be a bit more action, although the final few minutes make this somewhat of a poor complaint. It's engaging, well done, but ultimately not extremely rewarding on an emotional level. Above average, but not brilliant. 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this is far from a terrible movie, I can't say that it's all that magnificent either. I watched this mainly to see how an American remake of The Seven Samurai would turn out. I have to say that Seven Samurai was a lot better. Normally, I'd say ripping off stuff is bad, but the Magnificent Seven would have been a whole lot better if it had stuck more closely to the original.As long as the movie is faithful to the original, all is (mostly) well. But when it starts to deviate, things go horrible wrong. Logic is thrown out of the window and the second half of the movie is very unbelievable to a fault. First of all, both the Seven and the bandits allow themselves to constantly surprised by the other. Next, the super-evil bandit leader catches the Seven off-guard, but instead of simply killing them he lets them go and even gives them their guns back? Yeah right. The story sacrifices all plausibility just to get a rather clichéd and moralistic message across, and it hurts.Apart from the weak plot, the rest of the movie feels rushed too. The cast is all-star, but several members seem to be phoning in their performances, and several others give simply horrible performances. Which is a shame, because most of the characters are really interesting and should have really been fleshed out a bit better.Still, "The magnificent seven" is far from a horrible movie. The action sequences are fairly good, the score is great, and Eli Wallach is simply brilliant. But is not enough to really leverage this movie above anything more than "average". The weak plot in the second half really hurts it, as do the less-than-convincing performances. It's not nearly as good as the original, and a mere shadow of the truly great Sergi Leone westerns that would be made a little later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a classic but fun nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small Mexican village is being forced to the edge of survival by bandit Calvera. They decide to hire 7 gunslingers to drive him off. The group is put together and drive off Calvera, however when they fail to kill him, they know it is a matter of time before he returns.It seems to be on TV every 10 months but I still watch it when I can. Why? Because it's fun. This western falls between the styles of Ford and Leone in terms of set up ? it has a mix of the serious but also the trashy, comedy feel of the latter. The story is a lift of The Seven Samurai and in many regards performs almost as well. However what it does best is to be a good western and a good film ? mixing action with comedy and great lines from a well developed script that is very efficient with the use of words.It also has a gritty edge ? the gunfighters talk of how they aren't heroes, how their life leaves them with no family and no children and how they never win ? even if they do, because someone else benefits, they never do. This was quite daring for 1960 ? to have the 'good' guys talk themselves down.They got lucky in terms of cast ? Yul Brynner was the only established star, the rest were on their way up and the timing was just right. McQueen, Bronson, Vaughn, Coburn are all household names and Dexter is a producer. The film's weakness is the fact that Sturges focuses too much on the kid because he felt he was going to be the audience's favourite. Maybe he was then but now it feels like real stars like Coburn, McQueen et al are being ignored or underused.However this is a minor complaint. Is it a classic? Probably. Is it the best western ever made? No. Is it anywhere near as good as the source? No. However it has a great cast and is a good fun western that has other levels too. That's why I watch it no matter how many times they show it on channel 4!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But this movie just does not hold a candle to the Japanese original in any capacity. I found the script to be tremendously void of emotional attachment. You learn very little about the characters, which leave the viewer to his own devices to explain away why seven random mercenaries would suddenly want to risk life and limb to save a handful of farmers for no reward or glory. At no point of time during the film did I believe that these characters would do what they ultimately would for these peasants were it not written down on a piece of paper.Yul Brenner, while a great King of Siam, is perhaps the worst cowboy ever to don a stetson. He's as stiff on the screen as the leather on his saddle. While some see this as stoicism, I interpret it as skin-deep acting. The rest of the seven protagonists aside from perhaps Charles Bronson are given no personal history at all, so you're not even quite sure what kind of qualities these particular gunmen bring to the table. James Coburn's character is a mere shadow of his Japanese counterpart, the only thing we ever come to know about him is that he throws a knife well and he dies without ever doing anything really significant or awe-inspiring.All-in-all, I would say that this was a poor adaptation of a marvelously nuanced original story that not necessarily can't be duplicated, nor would I say that the characters and themes do not translate well. What I would say is that this version is a mere husk of what it could have, and when one considers the immense talent involved, SHOULD have been in every imaginable way. A giant let down after seeing all of the good things said, but I think my opinion is unsurprising to anyone who has seen Kurosawa's original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent waste of my time?..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would be one of the few exceptions who don't keep Magnificent 7 in high esteem. Though it's a technically brilliant movie yet I have my justifiable reasons to give it 4 stars. The main reason I watched this movie is because the greatest Indian movie made "Sholay" is inspired by Magnificent Seven. So I was expecting a lot from this but sadly it didn't live up to my expectations.The story is very simple. A distant Mexican village is continually haunted by a Rouge Bandit and his 40 men. They take most of their hard earned crops/money and leave them with just bare minimum to survive. When enough goes enough the villagers hires 7 gunmen to chase the gangsters away and restore peace in the village. And the rest of the movie is about the action and dramatic run of one side out-smarting another in series of skirmishes.Before elucidating my grievances I want to shower praises on the breathtaking cinematography and art design of the movie which has created captivating scenery of Mexican village and its rural life. But other than this the movie doesn't deem to be uphold-ed in high esteem. Western movies are known for their haunting music and stylish action sequences. Magnificent 7 lacks in both. It's emotionally barren and dramatically shallow in its treatment. The major weaknesses of the movie are..1.The movie is quite shallow and at no point in time you feel attached to any situation of character. Even the innocence of little village children fail to melt my heart. Instead they were an unnecessary aberration in flow of the movie.2.The love story is too shallow and even fails the attempt to showcase the carnal desires of the protagonists.3.The acting of the side casts (villagers, bandits, children etc.) is horrendous. Most of the times, they were looking in some other direction and speaking in another. Seems they were only interested in their payment not in acting. Surprisingly our bollywood side staff acts better than this.4.Other than Steve Mcqueen , Yul Brynner and the young lad. The rest 4 magnificent were continuously absent from script writers mind to an extent that they didn't even get deferential dying scenes in movie.5.Magnificent 7 protagonists dying scenes were absolutely weird and all were killed for no reason. It seems that during the film the director forgets that script demands to kill heroes and when he realizes this in the end, he haphazardly kills them without putting any creativity and drama into it.6.The music is a big letdown keeping in mind the memorable music of westerners which keeps playing in your mind months after the movie.7.The movie is too long 2 hours 15 minutes.Bollywood filmmakers and Fans should be proud of the creation of SHOLAY which is emotionally deep and technically so strong that Magnificent 7 seems like a B Grade (read C Grade) copy of it. Looking forward to see 7 Samurai and expecting a better show from it .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasn't Expecting "Seven Samurai," But Still Expected Better Than I Got</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was mighty disappointed in this film, a pale imitation of "Seven Samurai," the Kurosawa masterpiece on which it's based.I had no expectation that this would be as good as Kurosawa's original, because come on...few films are. But with the cast they assembled for this and such good base material, they certainly could have done better. Instead, the film is slow when it should be zipping along. The characters are interchangeable and develop no personalities; therefore, we don't feel invested in their stories and don't feel much when they all start dying. Yes, Yul Bryner and Steve McQueen have a tremendous amount of screen presence and don't need to do much to make a film watchable, but even at that, they need better than what this film gives them.The whole thing reminded me more of "The Dirty Dozen" than "Seven Samurai," which is still a shame because that film is also much better than this one.Elmer Bernstein was Oscar-nominated for his rousing and instantly recognizable score, the film's primary asset. One of the greatest travesties of Academy Award history is that Bernstein, who created one memorable score after another, won his Oscar for, of all things, "Thoroughly Modern Millie." Who remembers the music to that? Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's usually pretty difficult for these ensemble films to divide the screen time evenly among its cast, and that can be said about The Magnificent Seven. Although, its main problem is not with its cast, but with the lack luster script and so-so pacing.Starring some of the biggest stars of their time, Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Charles Bronson, and Steve McQueen, The Magnificent Seven boasts one of the best ensemble casts to date. To that point, the performances all around are great, but I don't think they are used to their full potential (even early in some of their careers). Wallach and Brynner are the clear standouts, however, doing the best they can with a generic script at best.It's famously based on the all-time classic, Seven Samurai, and it lacks the unique identity that Samurai had. It's not as gritty or as thought provoking, but it has its entertaining moments. With the exception of some pretty awful death scenes, the action is solid. I just wish the action was more frequent and had the emotional punch that its predecessor did.Along with the great cast, the score by Elmer Bernstein is iconic and adds to the fun tone and atmosphere of the film. Speaking of fun, Wallach's Calvera character pretty much makes the film much more watchable than it should be with the bland dialogue. Overall, it has great singular moments but it lacks the gut punching story and execution that Seven Samurai provided a few years earlier.+Great score+Cast is iconic+Fun action-Story drags a bit-Lacks identity-Weak dialogue6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genre benchmark, and a remake that really works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is there to say about this film that hasn't already been said? It's a classic western remake of Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI, featuring iconic turns from an ensemble cast, an interesting story, stylish direction, and an often epic feel to the film's visual style. Okay, so it's slightly overlong and padded by today's standards, but that doesn't make it any the less of an entertaining movie. My favourite scenes are the individual ones that introduce each of the 'seven' and of course the climactic moments in which our heroes stand together against overwhelming numbers of the enemy. It's a film that delves into heroism and sacrifice in a mature way, never pandering to its audience or presenting folk who are perfect?just characters who do the right thing when the time comes.Who's my favourite in this? I'd say Yul Brynner, purely because this is his iconic performance and because I saw and loved WESTWORLD as a kid, in which he plays a variant of his character here. Of the rest, Steve McQueen lends solid support, Robert Vaughn has the most interesting back story, James Coburn is effortlessly cool, Brad Dexter is unremarkable, Horst Buchholz is full of energy, and Charles Bronson is the archetypal tough guy, although why he didn't make it really big until a decade later I'll never know. I did find Eli Wallach's bad guy a bit of a softie, but that comes from watching THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY and having his performance in that burned into my memory. Anyway, this is a decent film and a benchmark of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small Mexican village of farmers is plagued by bandits led by Calvera(Wallach, like a snake - calm and congenial, yet with a volatile temper, determined to feed his 30 men, and reminiscing better days, larger scale, with bank hold-ups), so they find some help. It comes in the form of seven hired guns. Chico(Buchholz, with a charming innocence) is the only rookie among them - the rest are battle-hardened. Lee(Vaughn, portraying it as someone who understandably suffers from PTSD), Harry(Dexter, with a clear eye for rewards), Bernardo(Bronson, who accepts the measly pay because he's broke), Britt(Coburn, a cool head and a quick hand), Vin(McQueen, bringing his charm as well as his sheer intensity - he takes the job over a steady clerk job) and finally Chris(Brynner, who makes it abundantly clear to his employers that once they start, they will have to see it through).To get the obvious out of the way - yes, even back then, America couldn't watch an overseas success without having to remake it(don't get me started on the franchising). From samurai to cowboys? Had it not been for the stellar cast(who all do great work, and several members of the supporting cast also really deliver), I honestly would not have given this a chance. I did not expect it to capture so much of the weight, the pondering nature and the credibility of its inspiration. Rather than the ensemble tripping over each other, all have something to do, from start to finish their roles have a goal or focus of their own.The dialog is short, smooth, and laden with meaning. Much is said with few words and subtle intonation(that goes for the characterization, too). The years of experience of these revolver-wielders is clear in their faces and movements. Music is sweeping and effective. There are numerous details that help give you an idea of what life was like back then. The action is exciting, quick and engaging. This is realistic until the third act, which gives in to crowd-pleasing and becomes a Spaghetti-Western(and aspects of it are surprisingly anti-climactic). The 123 minute running time is put to solid use, with every scene serving a purpose, and a satisfying ending. This has a dry, stinging wit - gallows humor, necessary to take the worst anxiety away from the lethal reality surrounding them.There is some bloody violence, disturbing content and moderate swearing in this. The DVD comes with an interesting(if portions of it are silent), funny(even nostalgic for the golden days of cinema) and informational audio commentary by James Coburn, Eli Wallach, executive producer Walter Mirisch and assistant director Robert Relyea, the 45 minute documentary Guns For Hire: The Making of The Magnificent Seven which I will review on its own page here on the site, 2 trailers for this and one for each of the 3 sequels and an extensive still gallery. I recommend this to any fan of the genre and/or the talents involved in making it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>commentary on villain Calvera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took the pain of making this small commentary so that to remember, maybe the future generations, how a classic western is made and if at all this genre should survive. Now first thing first, I put this movie in the list of 10 best movies of all times - I don't care what other people think or say.Second, I want to make an estimate on the artists casting in that movie. If you gather together only the films made by 4 of the participants (Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn) you should see that they made more history in Hollywood than anywhere else on the screen. I lived in a poor European country as a youth (which Bulgaria still is) - but no matter what the standard was, good action cinema was always welcome. So even if the younger generation didn't perceive me well I should reiterate again, I have watched this movie more than 10 times and didn't get bored. It has nothing to do with the several sequels on the same theme but having different actors cast. "Magnificent Seven" - 1 is simply the best because of its stars that play excellent (and its music and directorship): - Yul Brynner, his quickest turnabout that kills Calvera; - Steve McQueen, get wounded but didn't get killed and also a womanizer; - Charles Bronson, big chopper who loved the kids but get killed; - James Coburn, master knife and gun artist but get killed. OK, that's enough.Third, I want to speak about the villain Calvera played by Eli Wallach (a much remembered role in western, maybe only second good after Colorado (Omar Sharif) in "Mackenna's Gold"). Here we see again little man playing big - not because he is like another villain from the story of "Ali Baba and the 40 thieves". In real life Calvera / Wallach outlived all his adversaries (i.e., look at the stars enumerated above) although he was the oldest in age at the feature film. Put this together with another brilliant character in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (where Clint Eastwood was catapulted to stardom) and we have ourselves a man-of-unity. Good for You, Eli!! I wish you good health and to become centeniary. God bless you!P.S. I forgot to mention the several phrases from Calvera's role that impressed me most and I still remember it:- Calvera: Generosity... that was my first mistake. I leave these people a little bit extra, and then they hire these men to make trouble. It shows you, sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.- Calvera: (dying, to Chris) You came back - for a place like this. Why? A man like you. Why?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun And Straightforward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Hollywood re-imagining of The Seven Samurai comes in a form of a western, sounds pretty good to me. The Magnificent Seven is a fun western flick about protecting a helpless community from bad people. The film is fantastic and deserves to be watched by any western or even an action fan.The film is about a Mexican village hiring seven gunmen to protect them from the bandits who steals their food and crops. The script balances out the action and the character development moments very well. The film fleshes out it's characters and allows us to identify them, I feel this is effective in films with big cast as it makes us care for these people. The film's plot is simple and I think that's what made the film fun as it doesn't try to make you think about anything rather than what is shown in front of you, I know for some people that may be a bad thing but that's just you going in with the wrong mind set.This is the only film so far I have seen from John Sturges, so I didn't really expect anything mindblowing. The film won't be regarded as the best film in the genre but it is definitely a exhilarating ride. It's packed with action and not to the point where it feels repetitive or unnecessary. Sturges has made something accessible and entertaining without sacrificing story and emotion. My expectations for his other films have been raised, "The Great Escape" in particular.The cinematography by Charles Lang, was at times spectacular and sometimes feeling a little generic and typical. It's probably due to the fact that some scenes were limited as the it's shot in a small set or that the film's script doesn't involve a lot of these characters traveling. Sometimes when there are traveling scenes, this is usually a time where they can show off with beautiful cinematography. I did not hate the film's cinematography but I felt it was limited.Elmer Bernstein is a real highlight in this film, it's so memorable and catchy. I have a smile on my face when the theme comes on because I know the seven are gonna do something exciting or important. His score feels like an action film and it helps drive the film along, which is why along with quick editing makes this film feel very fast in it's pace. Bernstein's score is magnificent.The film is not going to be remembered for it's acting but the seven actors are different enough for me to tell which one is which. Yul Brenner was great as this leader and at times is challenged on screen by Steve McQueen. Both McQueen and Brenner work great together, as there is this sense of comradery between them. I love seeing Eli Wallach in films, especially his work on "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly". Wallach plays villains very well as he has this slimy quality to him and at the same time not being over the top with it. The rest of the cast weren't as iconic but they did their parts fine. Like I said, this film isn't known for it's acting so don't try to look for some award winning acting here.Overall the film is fun and entertaining. It does what it does and doesn't try to become deep or anything. An exciting story and wonderful direction makes this an essential western film. If you expect this to be like Sergio Leone where it takes it's time then this may not be what you are looking for but it is damn fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A peace-loving community of Mexican farmers is repeatedly pillaged by dastardly Eli Wallach (as Calvera) and his bandits. The town decides to hire gunslingers to eliminate Mr. Wallach and his gang. Led by brave black-clad Yul Brynner (as Chris Adams), they become known to film viewers as "The Magnificent Seven". Early in the running time, Mr. Brynner picks up super-cool scene-stealer Steve McQueen (as Vin Tanner). The two drifters, from Dodge and Tombstone (wink, nod), attract younger hot-shot Horst Buchholz (as Chico). He gets the girl and most of the remaining screen action...Filling up the seven are Irish-Mexican father figure Charles Bronson (as Bernardo O'Reilly), edgy fugitive Robert Vaughn (as Lee), fortune seeking Brad Dexter (as Harry Luck) and knife wielder James Coburn (as Britt). Producer-director John Sturges looks up at his cast and locks up the landscape remarkably well, although this is obviously not as artful as Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954). The music by Elmer Bernstein is excellent to the point of becoming occasionally distracting. While sometimes lacking, "The Magnificent Seven" is enjoyable as an addendum to the earlier classic.******* The Magnificent Seven (10/23/60) John Sturges ~ Yul Brynner, Horst Buchholz, Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every year a Mexican bandit and his large gang of forty thieves harass and plunder a poor farming village south of the American border. They take what they need in provisions from the increasingly impoverished inhabitants. Deciding that enough means ENOUGH (and the wise old man in the village advises that it is DO or DIE), the village elders recruit gunmen from the US to defend them. The actual recruiting of six of the motley crew of gunslingers is done by top American gunman, the grim Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), dressed in black. The wages are only twenty dollars but chow is included, and it is good Mexican food (as the Americans discover). Each one of the defenders has his own reasons for volunteering, and not necessarily as a sense of doing the right thing (one of the men is a soldier of fortune). The men have various talents. For instance, one is a sharpshooter; another is handy with a knife. Much of the film is obviously a build-up to the final confrontation between the "good guys" and the banditos.Outside of the rousing action-packed sequences, this movie has four merits: the actors, the cinematography, Elmer Bernstein's Oscar-nominated music score, and the on-location filming in Mexico. Stars and future stars like Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson, Steve Mc Queen, Robert Vaughn, and James Coburn do not disappoint. Eli Wallach, the future "Tuco," stars as an appropriate pitiless Mexican leader Calvera, who is not without his own concerns. Of course, with so many personalities, actors "battle" for screen time. There is an underlying message in this movie (and in subsequent remakes) that is overlooked: Mexico was a place of anarchy where the federal government could not always keep law and order.John Sturges' western was lifted from Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954), perhaps the greatest movie ever filmed in Japan. In this original version, seven unemployed samurai swordsmen are also hired to fight bandits who terrorize a village. But Kurosawa made a superior film showing the importance of the code of honor of the defenders along with their three-dimensional character development (the film's length was much longer). He even showed a sketch of the Japanese village and the name (or symbols) of each of the bad guys. So when one of them was bumped off, one of the samurai would cross off his name from the bandit list. This helps the audience understand the defensive strategy and what was happening in the battles as the number of the bandits diminished.Nevertheless, "The Magnificent Seven" does stand on its own merits in the heyday of American westerns as a very good movie to enjoy. Even though the pacing is slow, it remains worthwhile watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine western with a blistering soundtrack - 82%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a screenwriter of sorts (i.e. someone who's never sold a screenplay), I've felt a western brewing in my excessively fertile mind. Trouble is, the closest to the Old West I've ever been was a day-trip to the Grand Canyon and while the memory of that trip will last a lifetime, it's not much to base an entire screenplay on. Figuring that a little cinematic research never did anyone a bit of harm (indeed, Quentin Tarantino has made a career of it), I went back to basics with this classic entry into the genre. It may be based on the classic Japanese film "Seven Samurai" but this has all the western clichés that fans of the genre will appreciate.A Mexican village is at the mercy of local bandito Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his vicious gang, who ride into town and help themselves to the crops the villagers grow for themselves. After deciding that enough is enough, three of them head into America to buy guns in which to defend themselves. Instead, they meet up with Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) who agrees to help them defend the village instead. Realising that his guns alone won't do, he gradually assembles a posse including knife-man Britt (James Coburn), sharp-shooter Vin (Steve McQueen), sharp-suited Lee (Robert Vaughn) and baby-faced hot-head Chico (Horst Buchholz) among others. The seven of them ride back to the village and prepare them all for the inevitable showdown, each with their own reasons for helping them.Anyone expecting the spit-and-polish of today's movies should probably look elsewhere because "The Magnificent Seven" is chock-full of the sort of over-the-top death staggers involving agonised clutches to the bright red patch on the stomach - you know, the sort of stuff that made westerns old-fashioned in the first place. What it has in reserve is atmosphere and authenticity - the gun battles are remarkably thrilling and exciting as characters dive for whatever cover they can find and stunt-work is impeccable. Performances are also very good - Brynner leads a great cast but weirdly, I never felt that all of the Seven were that well explained. The script doesn't allow the members equal footing and leaves Brynner and McQueen the majority of the lines. But I don't remember any of them having a back story to give themselves depth while Calvera is actually the most understood character on screen, leering and sneering as any baddie in a western should. The other thing a good western needs is a blazing score and Elmer Bernstein's classic theme really is one for the ages, stirring the blood and rousing the spirit in a way that modern films are rarely able to do.This is a film with real energy and a sense of occasion to it, belying its relatively simple story. But with a great cast and direction, it becomes more than a humble western - remember how the "Ocean's Eleven" remake became more than a simple heist flick when you first saw that unbelievable cast list? This is an adventure, a tale of bad men trying to redeem themselves and who can't fall for a story like that? It may stick rigidly to the genre stereotype but "The Magnificent Seven" is still a highly enjoyable film although I cannot compare to the original "Seven Samurai" because I've not seen that. And while westerns remain a niche area of cinema for me, they are inspiring enough to tempt me to have a go at writing one. Just need to remember not to have seven heroes in it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for this movie. When it shows up on the screen, I'm hooked to the end. Can't add much to others' praise and faults but have noticed two flaws. After the first fight, snipers terrorize the village until nightfall. Brynner and McQueen go looking for them. Later they return triumphant but nothing was shown. Doesn't it seem like a scene's missing? Maybe the film was ruined? At the end of the big climatic scene, Buchholz unhorsing a fleeing bandit to pursue his comrades but there's no follow up there either.Minor matters in an engrossing film. If it's campy now (and must have been a little in 1960, too), it's a feel-good bit of escapism. And the music's perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the rest in the west</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be easy to dismiss this remake of "The Seven Samurai" as Hollywood's dumbed-down version for the masses, taking a noble picture and turning it into a shoot 'em up affair, and there is evidence of that intent, but it must be said, this is one of the best remakes you could imagine concerning a rampaging bandit (Wallach) and his posse, ransacking peasant farmers until they hire seven "magnificent" gunslingers to defend their property and re-empower them to recover their dignity.Brynner and McQueen are superb (it's Brynner by a length in my opinion), while the supporting galaxy of stars (and I include forgotten man Brad Dexter in that catalogue) are well assisted by the familiar faces of Vladimir Sokoloff as the wise owl who challenges the pastoralists to defend themselves or perish, future Oscar nominated cinematographer John A. Alonzo, Enrique Lucero, Whit Bissell, Bob Wilke and Val Avery among other notables.There's a line in the movie where Brynner and McQueen are pondering walking out on the deal, and Brynner says words to the effect "we had an agreement" to which McQueen replies philosophically "not any agreement a court would enforce" and Brynner's response "that's just the kind of promise you've got to keep". I first heard that line when I was young seeing this film for the first time, and it's virtue has resonated with me ever since. Words on paper delivered with Brynner's trademark, authoritative timbre of the voice make it, for me, unforgettable and just what this narrative is all about.While it occasionally labours the point (take Bronson admonishing the children for bad-mouthing their parents), it's moments like the aforementioned where director Sturges manages to elevate above mere Hollywood fodder, and successfully convey the essence of "The Seven Samurai" into the living rooms of Western audiences who won't venture into foreign language films. Spurs, holsters and six-shooters translate a very rewarding tale into something we can all appreciate and so I think this remake, more than most of its ilk, is very worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Better Than The Average Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen "The Seven Samurai", so I cannot compare that movie with this. But on its own, I find it quite the satisfactory Western.The premise is quite realistic: a Mexican village is robbed of most of its food annually by bandits who don't eschew killing the occasional dissenting villager. Using their very limited wealth, several villagers go to the US to buy guns, to find out that it would be cheaper and easier to hire gunmen. So seven of them take the job and go to the village, and when the bandits return, desperate for food, the gunmen fend them off. But the presence of the gunmen eventually cause division among the villagers, who betray them to the bandits, who spare them with the idea that the gunmen might have friends to avenge them.The performances are credible, and most of all are the lines and attitudes of the characters. For instance, when several village children tell one gunman that their parents are cowards, the gunman rebukes them, saying that the villagers are brave just to work hard to grow food, with no guarantee that they will get to be able to eat it. Also the part where the bandit leader orders the gunmen to leave, but tells them before they go, "Take what you want!" as an implied rebuke to the villagers.If this movie is but a remake of "The Seven Samurai", this is one that was well done.</fullReview>

Brynner: "Ride On". Worst moments: Robert Vaughn sleeping with his gunslinger gloves on and having a nightmare (pitiful acting) and MIguel's rifle technique when they were being taught how to shoot.

		<shortDescription>Good Remake of the Kurosawa Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Magnificent Seven (1960) *** (out of 4) American remake of Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI features Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Brad Dexter, Horst Bucholtz and Robert Vaughn playing seven gunfighters who are hired by a small Mexican village to protect them from a group of thieves (led by Eli Wallach) who are constantly robbing them. THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is a fun little movie but I really don't think it lives up to some of the hype it's been given over the years. It's certainly not in the same league as the Kurosawa film and I'd say that the majority of the cast members made better movies but with that said there's no question that the terrific cast really makes the film what it is. With the story being less than original, director John Sturges at least keeps everything moving at a very good pace and he also manages to build up some nice drama throughout the film. I think his direction is best witnessed during the terrific action scenes because there's usually so much going on during them but we never lose focus of what's going on and he gives each of the seven men enough screen time that we feel as if we get to know them. The cinematography is also top-notch as is the wonderful music score, which really makes you want to stand up and join the fighting. Of course, the main enjoyment I get from the film are the terrific performances from the cast with Brynner and McQueen leading the way. The two tough guys are perfect with one another but Bronson, Coburn and Vaughn also fit their roles very nicely. As great as the good guys are, I think it's Wallach who really steals the film with his performance as the bad guy who you just love to hate. THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN might lack some in the story but it's still a film worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This still gets frequent showings on regular TV after all these years ? could it be because it has lots of decent things thrown in: good story, solid acting, fine production, stirring music, and nice colour. And no sex, little violence, er no subtitles ensures it's usually still shown at prime times.Seven disparate self-styled losers good at killing are enrolled by village of timid farmers to rid them permanently of marauding enormous gang of unofficial taxmen. It's fascinating watching the enrolment process and its results: cool smoker Brynner being offered everything for his help, McQueen looking for crackerjack kicks, Bronson caught swinging his chopper, Coburn calmly murdering a bragging twit, Dexter drooling over imaginary gold, Vaughn trying to run away from his sweaty self, Buchholz as an impetuous immature. As with Seven Samurai it's relentlessly corny, full of stilted dialogue, simply marvellous to watch, but an hour shorter. The members of the 7 who survived the carnage not surprisingly were the most intelligent ones with the least mental problems - however by the end of the '60's even that type got killed in The Wild Bunch.Of course I would have to state Kurosawa's film is a world classic and is much better overall, but watching this is still rather a magnificent - and easier - way to spend 2 hours. What a treat for (most) people coming across it for the first time!</fullReview>

A number of years ago I met the composer Elmer Bernstein in Oakland, California when he was there as part of a movie-music seminar at the Oakland Museum. He actually also considered the film to be slow paced, saying that after an initial viewing, he found it so slow that he composed the music the way he did to speed up many of the scenes. In my opinion, he was quite right.The score he wrote has moved into the pantheon of great film music, up there with the giants. The way the music punches you the moment the film opens is absolutely unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It'll be deja vu for anyone born after 1960</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were born any time after the initial release of The Magnificent Seven, you probably wound up seeing it several times before you finally saw it. That's because this isn't just one of the greatest Westerns ever made. It's also the template for generations of ensemble adventure films that followed it. This movie has been copied, lifted from and made homage to so many times that you can practically make a drinking game out of all the genre conventions and clichés that originated here. Just about any motion picture made since 1960 where a bunch of guys are recruited for some mission will include one or more allusions to or imitations of The Magnificent Seven. There are better Westerns but few that have been as influential.A small Mexican farming village is sick and tired of giving up their crops to the bandit gang led by Calvera (Eli Wallach), perhaps the least ruthless Wild West outlaw in cinema history. The village sends three men north to buys guns so they can defend their land. When they ask the coolly collected and defiant Chris (Yul Brenner) to help them buy weapons, he suggests they hire themselves some gunfighters because men are cheaper than guns. With only $20 to offer in pay, Chris manages to assemble the sardonic Vin (Steve McQueen), the avaricious Harry (Brad Dexter), the stoic O'Reilly (Charles Bronson), the laconically deadly Britt (James Coburn), the haunted Lee (Robert Vaugh) and a desperate young man named Chico (Horst Buchholz).The seven head south to train the villagers for the showdown with Calvera and wind up facing their own fears of loneliness and isolation. When Calvera and his men arrive, the battle turns into a much more difficult and extended conflict that sees the Americans forced to decide if they're willing to die for the freedom of a little Mexican village?or maybe for the sake of their own souls.Now, while a lot of The Magnificent Seven will seem familiar to many viewers, you should know that the elements here which have been mimicked in so many other films have been streamlined, stripped down, truncated and abbreviated over time. Those flicks gave you the Cliff Notes. This is the original and its got a much more sprawling narrative than you might expect because this is a story that's about more than action scenes and clever quips. The dilemma of the Mexican villagers and how they react to it takes up a surprisingly large part of the film and a budding love affair between Chico and a village girl (Rosenda Monteros) is one of the biggest subplots of the production. You likely will find yourself wondering why young European actor Horst Buchholz gets so much screen time when there's a cast full of superstars and future Hollywood legends. Well, in fairness, Buchholz does a pretty good job here and it's not like the others get short shrift. Brenner, McQueen, Bronson, Vaughn, Coburn and even Dexter all get their moments in the sun, but director John Sturges clearly thought Buchholz was going to be the star of the production, right after Brenner. I'm sure Sturges kicked himself for that after seeing the final cut, but I'm not sure he could have more successfully balanced all these outstanding actors and their performances in any other way.I could go on and on about what's good in The Magnificent Seven, but?c'mon. Brenner. McQueen. Bronson. Coburn. Vaughn. Eli Wallach, for good measure. You could have a chimp write the script and a zebra direct it and it would still kick massive ass with that crew of actors. Which isn't to slight Sturges or credited writer William Roberts. This film looks and feels and sounds remarkably modern for something now over half a century old. Sturges fight scenes still hold up against today's unlimitedly complicated visual effects and Roberts wrote some lines that are still unsurpassed.And in addition to being tremendously entertaining and widely influential, The Magnificent Seven was also prescient about the coming deconstruction of the Western that, along with overexposure on television, would nearly kill the genre. It's not a major theme, but this movie repeatedly pokes holes in some of the standard tropes of the classic Western. Sturges and Roberts, however, made sure that such moments stood on their own as bits of dialog or story and don't rely exclusively on their trangressive nature.The Magnificent Seven is an absolute must-see, no matter how many times you've unknowingly watched it before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My two favorite film quotes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The number of reviews is indicative of how entertaining and thought-provoking this film is. I only want to add that amongst the raft of memorable quotes The Magnificent Seven contains two that live on for me. The first is when Yul Bryner as Chris is so moved by the fact that the three Mexican peasants offer him everything of value to buy his services as a gunman to drive away the bandits. They ask him if it will be enough and Chris replies: "I have been offered a lot for my work - but never everything."The second quote is delivered by one of films most ubiquitous bit part actors - Whit Bissel. He, as usual, hits a home run with ease. Two good Samaritan easterners have paid Whit as the local undertaker enough to bury a man who has fallen dead in front of them on the sidewalk. Whit informs them that it is not going to be possible because the locals object to having an Indian buried in Boot Hill to the point that they might shoot anyone who dares try. Even Whit's driver has quit. "He's prejudiced too, huh?" asks one of the easterners. "Well, when it comes to a chance of getting his head blown off, he's downright bigoted" replies Whit with a matter-of-factness that wrings out every ounce of wry humour possible. There are plenty more quotes that jump out of the film and into your memory. Steve McQueen gets some ironic gems and Bronson's eccentric millionaire crack as he chops wood in return for his breakfast is another good one. It is to be remembered that it is the actors who makes the lines really pay in The Magnificent Seven. The voices and timing of Whit Bissel, Yul Bryner, Steve McQueen and the rest of the crew can never be underestimated. The screen writers William Roberts, Walter Bernstein and Walter Newman must also take great credit for coming up with such a lively and entertaining script. It is also a script which is cleverly laced with human truths without becoming too moralistic or didactic. In this respect it is a remarkably well balanced film. It has entertainment at its heart and this has made it such a favorite with people all over the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the bandit Calvera steals the crops from the farmers of a small Mexican village; as he has many times before some of the men think 'enough is enough' and head to the United States to buy guns. What they return however is seven men; men who will fight and if necessary die for them. The money offered isn't a lot but they have nothing else to do or at least nothing else they want to do. Some are broke, one wants to prove he has what it takes and another wants to find out if he still has what he once had. When they get to town it is clear that most of the villagers are scared; so scared that they have sent every woman into the hills to hide lest they are taken by Calvera. It isn't long before they meet the infamous bandit and his forty men; the first time he leaves the village after a short gunfight but inevitably he will return and when he does our heroes won't have the element of surprise.I have recently watched quite a few B-westerns and enjoyed them but this is clearly no B-western; it is in another league altogether; a cast full of top quality actors, a great story and a famous score all add up to make this a classic. Yul Brynner, dressed all in black, does a great job as Chris Adams, leader of the seven; the other stars in the seven include such top rate actors as Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn and James Coburn; they aren't all the stars; Eli Wallach also appears as the bandit Calvera. The story takes its time introducing each of the main characters and showing us the situation they will have to deal with once the action starts. When it does begin it is exciting and it will come as no surprise that not all of the seven will be riding out of town again at the end. As a classic of the genre this is a must see film for fans of westerns and fans of sixties films in general.</fullReview>

Was Brynner incapable of growing hair? He must be the only cowboy who ever went around with a shiny top.This film is a Kurosawa adaptation, having previously been "Seven Samurai". This was brilliant. While not taking away from the original, it is well adjusted for America by making the samurai into cowboys. I could not imagine a more appropriate replacement.There is also a message of tolerance, with an early scene featuring the burying of an Indian against society's rules. One might ask if this was typical of the Old West (likely not) or if the Indian would have wanted to be buried in the white man's cemetery (possibly). But the underlying message is all people deserve respect, especially when dead. Why this message in a Western, a genre full of conflict?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Magnificent Seven has everything going for it, a near-perfect cast, a truly magnificent score and the fact it is very exciting as a western. Maybe not as good as Seven Samurai, but boy it is by far one of the better remakes out there. If you want a bad remake, see Psycho, starring Vince Vaughan or The Wicker Man, starring Nicolas Cage, in my opinion they should never have been made. The Magnificent Seven is an example of how a remake should be made, it was one of those pleasant surprises for me of as soon as the first note of the score blared I knew hey this is great stuff.The plot is simple, but I like simplicity, sometimes simplicity is good, but it is a great concept and very well constructed. It really helps as well that the action sequences are tremendously exciting, and that the landscapes are truly dazzling. Elmer Bernstein's score has a lot to do with The Magnificent Seven's success I think as well, it is rousing, triumphant and bombastic and very like the score for Lawrence of Arabia it sticks in the mind for a long time afterwards. If I were to choose to which score I preferred over this and the Great Escape, I think this score, The Great Escape was great but I have always found that whenever I hum both tunes people are less annoyed by The Magnificent Seven.The screenplay is focused, humorous and wise, maybe a little stilted on occasions but it develops the characters well and has heart. And the actors are wonderful. Yul Brynner is the epitome of coolness here, I do think he was better in The King and I, where he was absolutely magnificent, but he does a great job here. Eli Wallach is suitably slimy as the villainous Calvera, who is more than a cardboard cut-out, and Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson and Robert Vaughn are all great. Overall, this is a great film, very exciting, great to look at and has a magnificent score. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of these western films that was competing with young TV only by the size of the screen and the color. That will not last forever. So the rhythm is still slow and the picture is often centered on the faces and the general attitudes or postures of the characters. The story is simple though: the good suffering and submissive Mexicans or Indians who work hard, the banditos who exploit these farmers and the Yankee mercenaries who are going around fighting for the good cause of work and freedom. They are seven and only three will survive and two come back. They risk their lives for nearly nothing, twenty dollars, but for the sake of adventure and to prove they are the best shots, the best human beings, the best planners. The twist in this film is that they are successful first, then defeated and then successful again. That proves the point. They are ready to die to defend human decency, human freedom, justice, and to teach with their death how to fight, resist and conquer one's own freedom. A very light touch of romance is added, just enough to prove the point that man loves freedom and justice more than anything else. But let's say that four dead out of seven, fifty seven per cent casualties, that is poor productivity, even in the wild wild west.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine &amp; University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

The action is explosive and is truly exciting. The suspense is riveting. Eli Wallach is something else as Calvera, the Bandit, who leads forty (40) desperadoes against Seven (7) heroic men who are at the end of a violent gunslinging era trying to find some justification to their lives. Their lot is to defend helpless and poor farmers against the raids of Calvera in an attempt to find the purpose and redemption missing in their lives.A sensational movie that is a "Classic" in the truest sense of the word.

		<fullReview>I'm old enough to remember the 50s and 60s. Bilingual in Japanese, I first watched Kurosawa's "Shichinen no Samurai" in the original language and uncut. Kurosawa was a better director than Sturges. I wonder what a John Ford might have done directing The Magnificent Seven? Samurai no longer employed by a warlord were dubbed "ronin" (wanderers), not "samurai." Some preyed for a living, others held to the ingrained moral values of the Code.Both movies begin with the terse way of communicating and recruiting among the seven. Both use the same traps of ditches and netting and arming to defeat the impending attack on the village.The theme of both reverberates. Each Seven begin as hired hands to do a job, become advocates and patrons of the peasants hiring them, finally willing to give their lives without recompense for those who have become friends."You came back. Why? Men like you, why?" asks the Old Man.Westerns or War movies, battles vast or personal like A Good Mind and many others, a good film reminds us of this kernel, to give respect to the struggles and the ultimate sacrifice for peace and freedom.</fullReview>

Apparently, all concerned knew perfectly well that they weren't really doing a remake of the greatest film ever made (at least to that time). Consequemtly, there is a surprising light-hearted quality to the whole proceedings. They know they have a great story and a great action director, and they don't have to compete with the original. So they let themselves have some fun with it. And they communicate this well to the audience. This is a film that cries out for a big bowl of pop-corn - it may even have looked better at a drive-in. But at any rate, it doesn't look too bad on DVD, with original wide-screen transfer. (My edition also includes a documentary and commentary which are entertaining in their own rights.) And if you love Hollywood movie music (a genre all its own) you don't dare miss this wonderful sound-track.Comparisons to the Seven Samurai miss the point; this an American adventure story, and on that level works fine.</fullReview>

In real life, he would have killed them - in fact none too pleasantly either! And as for returning the guns - forget it! The director should have come up with a better idea on that one! One other point which was a bit far-fetched. Chico riding out to the bandit camp.

The film also gives rise to that much repeated pub quiz question "name the seven actors who starred in the 'Magnificent Seven'".For those few who might not know the story of a Mexican Village who are terrorised by the bandit Calvera who is well played by Eli Wallach. They decide to hire a group of mercenary gunmen with a variety of deadly talents to protect the village.After watching the dvd it's especially entertaining to watch the leads trying to get as much attention as possible in each scene. Amazingly this doesn't detract from the film which is pretty much a blast from start to finish. It's also got some great lines such as in the "prospects zero" scene. Overall 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I see this I enjoy it more - McQueen, Coburn, Wallach and Brynner are out-of-this-world fantastic and into their roles. Bronson has the classic role that vaulted him to fame. Robert Vaughn is the only one still living and let's hope he gets the justly deserved recognition for the cowardly depiction he portrayed in this EPIC. Brad Dexter is perfectly cast as one who has ridden with Brynner's Chris character before and knows there has got to be a really big reason to defend this forgettable little village. Even Horst Bucholz does an admirable job as the young hot-shot who just wants to belong. Many of the other reviews are critical of Horst's Chico character but in many respects he is the Everyman - he starts out as a greenhorn, eventually sneaks into Calverras camp and returns, develops a love interest with local beauty and eventually grows into the He-man he wanted to be at the beginning of the movie. Chico even has the self-actualized experience of choosing to become a hired gun with Chris and Vin or do the most honorable thing and stay behind with the woman he loves. Great message for the viewer from the viewpoint of the oppressed townspeople - how long do we take this #?%&amp; before we stand up to these punks and fight for what is important to us? Several beautifully edited gun battles including fast draw contests, super-cool pistol fanning, fly-catching agility, leaping over barricades while demoing fanning technique, knife-throwing action scenes, and a shotgun-toting driver on a hearse destined for boot hill make this a classic that you can appreciate over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every actor gave his all to his character. Robert Vaughn, though briefly on-screen,is magnificent; especially when releasing the villagers at the end. Yul Brenner is magnificent; his presence throughout the movie is commanding,larger than life. Steve McQueen does not need to speak to give a magnificent performance; Clint Eastwood had to have studied Steve McQueen 101 to learn that a western character can speak few lines and be effective. Charles Bronson and James Coburn-magnifique! Words cannot describe the utter perfection that they brought to the movie; I couldn't wait to see their next scene. Eli Wallach-when I first saw this movie, I was teenager back in the sixties. I thought he was the most magnificent villian; it took me a long time to like him in other roles, he was so convincing. It took me a while to understand the Horst Bucholtz character, it wasn't until I saw the 'Seven Samuai' in the nineties that I realized why he was slightly un-magnificent. The villagers,especially the three boys who befriend the Charles Bronson character, give the story its heart. The bandits are effective challengers to our heroes. The movie's only flaw is that it is the magnificent six. The character portrayed by Brad Dexter only only in the movie so that Steve McQueen could count to seven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rated this film with a 9 only because of the mis-casting of Horst Bucholtz as a Mexican. Why do they do this? He came off as a young SS officer. If one can forgive this mistake the film is one of the greatest westerns made along with Shane, Red River etc.One of the most dynamic music scores along with editing, camera work, pacing and except for the above, casting. Special kudos to Eli Wallach as Calvera. Everyone else was cast perfectly. It's truly a piece of cinema you can watch anytime and over again.Interesting to note the rise of several men after this film was released. McQueen, Bronson, Coburn, and Vaughn. Bryner and Dexter were already established.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one is a classic. It's been said that it is primitive by modern standards. This is also true of the movies "parent"--The seven Samurai. If you want to spend 3 hours reading subtitles from japanese,in black &amp; white, with no stirring soundtrack, that is your business. Not to knock it, it is a worthwhile experience.I viewed that movie after watching this one. I feel that most American viewers wouldn't bother to take the time. There is much unique and wonderful about this movie, beyond story and soundtrack. The classic sprawling, rough scenery of the genre is also here, brought out beautifully on DVD. I find it sad that many modern movie-goers are not "charitable enough" to make allowances, and understand perceived flaws in older films. It is like they don't read the date that the movie was released. They don't understand the difficulties that past directors faced in the production of film. Perhaps in our present computer-generated world,it is just too hard of a concept to grasp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This retelling of Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" is a good Western worth watching. Yul Brynner is excellent as the leader of seven men hired to help a small Mexican village protect itself from a bandit's gang. A lot of the cast went on to become big names including Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, &amp; Eli Wallach. Not the greatest Western I have seen, but still a fun film to watch.*If you get the Special Edition dvd be sure to watch the companion documentary "Guns For Hire : The Making of the Magnificent Seven", it is full of great stories about the film and its cast and history.</fullReview>

A damn fine story deserves to be retold to all those audiences who don't want to watch a 3 hour black and white film in Japanese (more fool them). Whether that's as a cowboy movie, a kid's animated feature or a cheesy cardboard sci-fi flick.It's a great Sunday afternoon western with some fun character interplay, although I'd feel a bit dissed if I was Mexican myself. It has Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach and a stack of other very watchable and charismatic stars.It also has James Coburn in one of his defining roles. He died yesterday, by the way, so shut up and give this film some respect. Me, I'll always remember one of his finest lines:"Dock, you sockers."RIP, Jim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie much. (Thank you, TCM Western festival. Why no SHANE though, will be eating my mind.)I expect I ought to yield to the reputation of Kurosawa (THE SEVEN SAMURAI) as having done a far worthier production of the same storyline. But, I haven't seen that, and hence, I wasn't disappointed by Sturges' work."You are like the strong wind, blowing off a swarm of locusts." Nice speech by the Old Man at the end. And other expressions of this theme as well. Such as, Charles Bronson spanking one of his admiring young followers, for calling their fathers cowards: versus Bronson's idea that it takes a greater bravery than he has, to shoulder responsibility, than to gunsling like himself.Ha ha, also: "When you die, we will avenge you, and keep fresh flowers on your grave." "Mighty fine compliment; I hope you won't be too disappointed if your plans fall through." Etc.I second the commentator who said, it's engaging, but not quite emotionally gripping.</fullReview>

And appearing in one of their first major film roles, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Robert Vaughn are good as other members of the "Seven".

		<fullReview>The Magnificent Seven (1960): Dir: John Sturges / Cast: Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn: Magnificent western about seven gunslingers whose abilities are sought after when a Mexican town can no longer endure threats from bandits. Director John Sturges is accompanied by a detailed screenplay regarding the call for gunslingers and their personal stories. Yul Brynner is the first whom three Mexicans approach with regards to the raids. It is hoped that he will round up others of similar skill that can help defend their home front. Brynner brings forth both skill and authority, and he is joined by six others including Steve McQueen who is an expert with a knife. He is first seen broke due to gambling. Now he endures the tested confrontation against these bandits. Charles Bronson is also broke and upon entering the village he is idolized by three Mexican children. Eli Wallach plays the ruthless bandit leader whom they first drive off but he is much more cunning as they will learn. Robert Vaughn is also featured as a gunman amongst the chaos they underdog. While the climax is exhilarating, it also presents an element of reflection as not everyone emerges with their life. Action packed entertainment with a massive gun battle where Sturges visualizes the penalties of violence. It is a magnificent film indeed. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When bandits threaten to steal the harvest of a poor Mexican village, the farmers resolve to hire gunmen to defend them. But how will they persuade them to help, and can they trust them to honour the agreement ?I reckon this is probably my favourite American western (though Rio Bravo, made at the same time, is almost as good) - it's just solid rip-roaring fun from start to finish, features the greatest cast of cowboys ever assembled, is a brilliant story filled with terrific themes and fascinating archetypes and is beautifully shot, cut and scored throughout. Every boy looking for heroes, role models, men to aspire to be like, should watch it, but at the same time it's sad, thoughtful, tender, even pessimistic. Unlike many westerns it never glorifies violence, celebrates greed, demonises ethnic groups, or deals in clichés. It's as stylish a movie as you could find, yet the drama plays as powerfully as any highbrow play. The gunslingers all have their own reasons for being there, but few are altruistic or noble, and the villagers tolerate their presence purely for services rendered. When Chico (Buchholz) tries to crow, the others don't spare him their bitter wisdom, and when the kids attempt to lionise O'Reilly (Bronson) at the cost of their fathers, he quickly puts them in their place. The main theme of redemption is almost existential; Calvera's dying words expressing his incomprehension as to why they would risk their lives for such scant reward. And yet it's joyous fun throughout, filled with funny dialogue (Bronson's first line is for my money the best opener in cinema), amusing scenes (McQueen's dinner table face pulling), great shootouts and chases, an absolutely barnstorming score by Elmer Bernstein (arguably his best in a career filled with classics) and gorgeous desert locations in Morelos State. But perhaps its greatest asset is its fantastic cast; everybody is great, right down to the lowest part - they look mythic, they deliver fabulous performances, they feel authentic and when they suffer we are truly moved. Very few actors don't look foolish with wide brimmed hats, gun belts and spurs, yet everyone here is iconic. Brynner is perhaps the greatest man-in-black cowboy in all cinema (ironically he was Russian), Wallach is simply terrific as the shrewd calculating bandito, McQueen is the coolest sidekick in any western ("So far so good !"), Bronson and Coburn are the epitome of tough guys and even Buchholz (who was German) is somehow wrong-but-right as the loudmouthed Chico. The film's writing credits are a little controversial - the original script was by Walter Bernstein, then largely rewritten by Walter Newman (neither of whom were credited for different reasons) and adapted by William Roberts. Newman is acknowledged as the main author, although of course the movie is almost a straight remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 classic Shichinin No Samurai / Seven Samurai, with only the setting changed. It's a very rare example of a cross-cultural remake which is every bit as good as the original. Beautifully shot from start to finish by the great cinematographer Charles Lang (The Uninvited, How The West Was Won, Wait Until Dark), originally this was neither popular nor acclaimed in the US but has deservedly become recognised as one of the greatest westerns of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Magnificent Seven is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's a fun, loud and fact paced film, it goes by very quickly, the cast is outstanding, the chemistry between them all is superb, it features Steve McQueen in one of his first major roles and one of the greatest movie soundtracks of all time. It's certainly enjoyable and is well considered a classic, but as an overall film, it has problems that I need to address, first of all I think the scenes that are suppose to be viewed as severe and intense are quite poorly executed, I felt like the actors were holding back a bit for these parts and weren't expressing the emotions as well as they should have here, I think the music should have been darker to add to the effect and it needed a bigger build up. The end of the film is a bit of a mess, as I said it goes by very fast, but the finale feels way too rushed, they are trying desperately to tie up every single loose end and the finale scene is very anti-climatic, for characters I had been following for two hours, I wanted a better farewell. It has its blemishes here and there, but the Magnificent Seven is still an enjoyable film with memorable performances and a superb soundtrack, if you ever see it on television and are looking for a good western, it's certainly worth the watch. An oppressed peasant village assembles seven gunfighters to help defend them. Best Performance: Steve McQueen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai is remade as a western accompanied with a magnificent score by Elmer Bernstein.The Magnificent Seven has become a classic in its own right. One thing that stands out that its excellently acted by its seven heroes and Eli Wallach as the villain shows restraint as the bad guy who also has a code of ethics himself when it comes to bad guys. He sees a place for his villainy where the farmers are at the bottom who must provide food for his men.The film is about poor Mexican farmers being terrorised by the bandit Calvera and his mob and who resort to hire gunslingers to get rid of these pests.Director John Sturges blended the ethos of the Three Musketeers with his adaptation and struck it lucky with his casting. Yul Brynner was the best known star upon the films release. He is ably supported by Steve McQueen (and his cowboy hat) a loner cowboy who in some ways is a soul mate of Brynner.Charles Bronson is also excellent as the half Irish and Half Mexican who finds allies with the young children in the village. James Coburn (also with his cowboy hat) is the knife man. Robert Vaughn is the one facing a crisis of confidence. A feared sharp shooter who has lost his edge and nerve. Brad Dexter a friend of Brynner who thinks that there is somehow riches involved in this endeavour.Horst Buchholz, plays the young, brash Chico, a son of a farmer who wants to be a gunfighter. With a bizarre German/Mexican accent he has the arrogance of youth without the experience of the others.It might not be all action packed as its reputation suggests. There is also a lot of contemplation with the men as they try to make sense of what they are doing for the villagers, lament their past and look for a a more fruitful future where some of them are dreaming to settle down.</fullReview>

Unthinkable in most places today, but then again most things didn't turn out as we had hoped.I didn't know that this movie was derived from the Japanese film, and I didn't care, not then and not now. This was about America's role in the world. People needed help, and Americans went to help, without regard for financial gain or power. The seven rode in, did what they came to do, and then two rode out. The Americans weren't perfect people but they had a strong urge to see justice done. A simple but strong message, which is why this was my favorite movie for years. I watch it every now and then when it's on cable, and while I still love it, it leaves me sad. All of the heroes of this movie are dead, as is the message, at least in most of the world. Few act these days on the basis of right and wrong - there has to be an agenda or a profit motive. Indeed, a story like this can't be told today without making everyone good so as not to offend anyone. The world of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN has given way to the world of APOCALYPSE NOW.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Legend Among Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Magnificent Seven is a Western film that based is a western-style remake based on Akira Kurosawa's film Seven Samurai. The film stars Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, Brad Dexter, and Horst Buchholz who play a group of seven gunmen who are hired to protect a small agricultural village in Mexico from a group of marauding native bandits led by Calvera. The musical score was composed by Elmer Bernstein which has become unforgettable theme music and later immortalized as the "Marlboro Man" leitmotif.It was directed by John Sturges. Thus The Magnificent Seven effortlessly turns samurai into cowboys. The beleaguered denizens of a Mexican village, weary of attacks by banditos, hire seven gunslingers to repel the invaders once and for all. The gunmen are cool and capable.A man who brings these warriors together is the baddest bald man in the West.Spectacular gun battles, epic-sized heroes and an all-star cast make The Magnificent Seven a legend among westerns.It is enjoyable on its own terms due to the stellar cast and Bernstein's score.There's nothing especially stylish about the approach of veteran director Sturges, but the storytelling is clear and strong, and the charisma of the young guns fairly flies off the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this in a movie theatre when I was in junior high, it was one of my favorite movies. It's a nice formula. Take a group of gunfighter and have them confront the evil forces led by Eli Wallach who have used the Mexican villagers as a cash crop. What really works is that we know each actor. As with "The Great Escape," we have an ensemble of personalities who bounce off each other, portray true manlihood, and who have their own version of morality and integrity. We also have a weak society, who never really buy into what they have wrought. At the first sign of real trouble, half the town wants to go back to the way things were, holding on to their present safety, never realizing how horrible it will eventually get. The gunfighters get a little fed up. Of course, just like "The Seven Samurai," we know the showdown is coming and that there will be great bloodshed. I agree with one reviewer that the setup is better than the resolution and the film begins to drag in the last third. It's still one of the better Westerns of all time and a joy to watch all these excellent actors and movie icons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes it Rips off Seven Samurai, but it does it well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched the Seven Samurai for the first time recently, I then watched the Magnificent Seven and was startled at just how similar the films are. Even some of the soundtrack is the same. In fact a lot of the dialogue is the same. Not quite word for word (often the word Samurai is replaced by 'gunslinger, cowboy, etc) but I was able to predict what each person was going to say most of the time.SPOILER (for both films) ************ OK there were a few differences like the cowboys didn't go off to hunt for the raiders and the final battle plan was to keep the raiders inside the town rather than outside at the front entrance. Oh and the kid gets the girl instead of leaving. That is the main difference between following the Samurai code, a way of life and being from Hollywood where you do everything to get the girl. But you have a character chopping wood as he's low on money. The Samurai called it practicing and so did the cowboy. What was the cowboy practicing though?? Gun Vs Knife fight was just like the Old Samurai Vs Younger One (first with wood, then with steel). And, well not going to list them all. *******************************Despite all that, I'd recommend watching them both. I really enjoyed them both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK but extremely inferior remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An opressed Mexican village is under attack and decide to hire a gang of seven gunfighters to rid them of their problems. The seven includes, amongst others, Yul Brenner and Steve McQueen.The main problem of course is that McQueen and co. are in no way equal talents to those that collided for the original Japanese version of the story in 1952 (I believe that was the year - if I'm wrong then I repent). Currently ranked #5 on IMDb's top 250, the original is far better than this dated cowboy story that, although fun, is a bit boring in some areas and visibly not quite as enjoyable as it was when released in 1960. It's often considered to be a classic but I think the reputation of the original just got mixed up with this one in some cases (many people aren't aware of the original for some reason).Fair but don't expect too much - see the original, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on Seven Samurai (1954), this western is more accessible for the western audiences.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Magnificent Seven' is not a re-make, but based on the 1954 Japanese movie, Seven Samurai. Although it is considered a classic and one of the better movies of all time, I did not particularly enjoy Seven Samurai. I think much of that is my not understanding, or even caring about, the ancient Japanese customs, and not caring about any of the characters. However, even though the basic story is the same, I found 'The Magnificent Seven', set mostly in Mexico, and filmed in color with good sound, a much better movie. Although Yul Brynner (playing a 'cajun' gunfighter) was the established star, relative newcomers James Coburn and Steve McQueen become the real stars of the movie. Eli Wallach is also superb as the Mexican bandit Calvera. Any fan of the western genre will like this movie.SPOILERS are contained in the rest of my comments. Consider yourself cautioned. Basic story, small Mexican town is systematically raided by Calvera's band when they pass through, taking hens, hides, whatever they want. 'If God did not intend for them to be sheared, he would not have made them sheep', Calvera referring to the meek townspeople. So three of them go to town looking to buy guns to defend themselves. Instead their cause attracts several maverick gunfighters, who agree to protect the village and chase away Calvera for the tidy sum of $20 each. The band eventually numbers seven. They train the villagers to shoot and fight, set up walls and a net to contain the bandits, not easily but eventually Calvera and his band are defeated, but four of the seven hired men are killed also, the youngest survives and stays in the village with the pretty young girl he fell for. The moral - it is better to be a lowly farmer with a wife and family than a roaming gunfighter who has no roots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film, however only a pale remake of the Seven Samuri</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film features wonderful performances by Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen. The setting is gorgeous, and the cinematography is top notch. By itself it is a good film, but sadly it loses much of its appeal when compared to the Japanese original, "The Seven Samurai." The Magnificent Seven's plot is weaker, and much of its dialogue seems forced, no matter how the actors try to spruce it up.Additionally, the movie does not convey the same character development, which is probably why the dialogue seems forced. The characters are not people, but cardboard cutouts of the Japanese characters. Honestly, I believe that I would have appreciated this film more if I had not seen The Seven Samurai first, but as it is I am only left with a sense that it attempted to measure up to a work of genius and never quite achieved it. However, I must admit that the score does live up to its reputation, and nothing of fault can be found with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Dexter - the man everyone forgets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Vaughn in a recent press interview commented that Brad Dexter was the one actor everyone forgets from the 'M Seven'. This is true. Even this post on the IMDB comments boards misses Brad - "Chris hires seven gunmen to back him up the fight, among the bunch are Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Robert Vaughan, Charles Bronson, and a very fiery Horst Buchholz." (But no Brad!)The reason most forget Brad is possibly that he looked 'different' to the rest of the (younger) cast. He was born in 1917, most of the others around 1930. His face is also more like that of a 40's or 50's tough guy. Not the bunch of young guns Chris hires.Whatever the imagery is, however, the title score by Elmer Bernstein, (as with Chariots of Fire by Vangelis), moves the movie onto another plane of consciousness and makes it unforgetable</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this when my film class had to watch and write an essay on a Western. Westerns are not my genre of choice, so I was suprised to truly get into the exciting story of seven cowboys hired to protect a Mexican village from evil bandits. Knowing Yul Brynner only as the bombastic King of Siam ("et cetera, et cetera, et cetera"), I fell in love with him as Chris, the strong, brave, but somewhat aloof ring leader of the Magnificent Seven. Steve McQueen is also very handsome, and Charles Bronson is a hoot as another of the seven. I also loved the theme of the good guys risking their lives to protect the Mexicans from the evil bandits. Post 9/11, that theme was so much more relevant and riveting, especially a humorous scene of the cowboys teaching the villagers to shoot. I LOVED this movie and would recommend it to all who is willing to root for the good guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Character Study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes this a classic isn't the action scenes which have been done in many other westerns. Instead, it is a classic because it focuses on the people in the story. The plot is an interesting character study that gives its people some real depth. Each man chooses to go along on the "contract" for his own reason. Each also learns something about himself and life.The film offers lessons in true courage played out in an engaging story. Based on Akira Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI, this is a good old-fashioned American western in the classic style. In addition, Elmer Bernstein's score, used for many years in cigarette TV ads, has become a classic in its own right.</fullReview>

There are just 2 things that bother me. First of all the film is too long and second of all the way some of the magnificent seven die at the end of the movie. They had better been shot in the first shootout than to die so idiotically at the second shooting in Mexico. But don't mind me, see for yourself. 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who doesn't know this movie was 'adapted' from the beautiful Kurosawa film 'The Seven Samurai', is either too young to know it or hasn't been paying attention.The story is consistent with the original, albeit modified to fit the environment. The characters are mostly parallels of the original - except Toshiro Mifune's part is rearranged so Horst Buckholz takes on some of the character. Before you pass judgement on this film, be sure to see 'The Seven Samurai.' You'll not only see how well this story can be done, but how true to the story this film is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad swan song for the classic western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe the Magnificent Seven is the swan song of the classic western, you know the ones in which men are meticulously shaved all the time, dress in spotless clothes and the weather only turns sour when it was needed. But most of all, they did what they did because of some noble principle(unless they were bad).It is established early into the movie. Adams and Tanner step in when nobody wants to bury a dead Indian. They transport his corpse to the cemetery while opposed by nameless bigots who do not want an Indian in their graveyard. Even after death there is racism.Adams seems to be one of those decent selfless gun for hire types(think lone ranger) and thus, when asked by a group of Mexicans to have him protect their village from a band of marauders, he accepts the dangerous job for a pittance. This raises the one importance question that will plague the movie, echoed by Eli Wallach: why? What makes a gunslinger like Adams decide to put his life on the line to do this thing for no good money at all? I loathe to compare movies nowadays, but in the seven samurai there was a very good reason: they were lordless fighters who were trapped in a rigid social structure that allowed for no social mobility in desperate times. In other words: they were doomed to it. Fight or starve. But in the late 19th century US men were far doomed in that manner in a land of opportunity that experienced an economic boom. Sturges thus needs to establish another motive, so he has Tanner supply an answer of a kind: it seemed to be a good idea at the time. This might have been a sarcastic Bruce Willis line from say Die Hard, but this isn't a tongue in cheek movie because it takes itself pretty serious indeed. Wrong answer therefore. Seven against forty(six actually)is no good idea at any time. It almost feels as if Sturges is caught in between the mood of times: the spaghetti westerns will supply other reasons: greed, revenge, and other less noble principles. The classic westerns had their own noble reasons, but they are never supplied. In fact, when the villagers betray the seven, the latter even come back to save them again. The movie never explains why the men do what they do, even if their behavior is at odds with their characters. Take Harry Luck, a fortune seeker, who tags along because he believes there is more to the job than the twenty dollars pay for 6 weeks being shot at. Why would he think that Adams is hiding something? Does it follow from what went before? Is it made believable in the movie? But most of all, why does Adams take him along, knowing that Luck might bail the moment he finds out there is nothing else but the twenty dollars and the likely possibility of death?Sturges cannot shake loose from the confines of the earlier movie and the prescriptions of the classic western. He could have the villagers or Adams dupe the others. Suggesting more wealth that there was, but that would made them look bad and that cannot be. He could have spend more time on character building, thus giving personal reasons.. which actually seems the way he is heading, but alas there is not enough movie to do that for seven characters. Not even the character of Adams is well developed in the movie. The central weakness of this movie is this lack of proper motivation for the characters involved and the failure to establish their personalities. This would not have such a great weakness if the rest made up for it with, say, good gunfights. But they are weak and awkward at times. This leaves us actually with a weak movie that cannot deal with the cultural transition from 15th Century Japan to 19h Century us in an acceptable way. Sturges is just not up to the challenge. The movie therefore simply pales in comparison to The Big Country(2 years older) that sees a man resisting violence out of principle and A fistful of Dollars that followed four years later in which the main characters are no longer driven by noble goals. As such the movie is not so much interesting by itself, but rather as an in between piece of work. The last of the classic western and, perhaps, showing an embryonic development of what was to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once You've Met Them...You'll Never Forget Them?except for Harry? almost no-one remembers Harry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After their crops are repeatedly plundered by bandit Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his gang, a Mexican farming community decides to hire men for protection. They find help in the form of fearless man-in-black Chris Larabee Adams (Yul Brynner), who assembles a group of seven skilled gunmen willing to risk their lives for a measly $20 each (unlikely, but hey, this is Hollywood).It's no good? after watching hilarious ?Three Amigos! (1986), which sees Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short mercilessly lampooning John Sturges' classic 1960 western, I find it hard to take this westernised version of Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai seriously?not that it would have been easy before, the film's questionable plot, clichéd characters and an overload of schmaltz making it hard to sit through with a straight face.Brynner, the epitome of cool, makes for a suitably heroic lead, and he is ably supported by Steve McQueen, a young Charles Bronson, and the excellent as always James Coburn. Robert Vaughn, as the gunman who has lost his nerve, is passable, although he hams it up terribly for a scene where his character suffers nightmares. My overacting award for the whole film, however, goes to Horst Buchholz, who shows zero restraint in his portrayal of Chico, a cocksure youngster out to prove his worth; he's so irritating that one longs for him to take a bullet.Unsurprisingly, Horst features in most of the film's low points?Chico's drunken challenge to Yul, a silly romance with a Mexican peasant girl, and the really daft bit where he wanders unnoticed into the enemy's camp?although Brad Dexter as gold-hungry Harry made me laugh with his corny death scene, whilst the three admiring village kids who follow Bronson provide the most cringe-worthy moments.The final battle between the magnificent seven and Calvera's bandits is well handled, and Elmer Bernstein's rousing score is effective throughout, but I can't help but feel that the film would have benefited immensely from a singing bush and the occasional use of the word 'plethora'.5.5/10, rounded up to 6/10 for IMDb: not great considering it's legendary status and the talent involved, but entertaining enough to while away a rainy Sunday afternoon, I suppose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's legacy and lasting impression is stronger than the film itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great films rarely craft their quality from the outside in, but that's exactly what happened with "The Magnificent Seven." It started with buying the rights to remaking Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" and continued with director John Sturges casting top actors who were already stars or right on the verge. From there, it squeezed into its destiny as the final hurrah for the classic Hollywood Western.The premise of "Magnificent Seven" is so simple that the first half of the movie teeters on total boredom. A tiny Mexican village is tired of being preyed upon by the bandit Calvera (Eli Wallach), so it approaches a well-known gun for hire, Chris (Yul Brynner), in order to purchase guns. Chris insists that hiring more gunslingers will be a cheaper move and more effective, even if it means a team of a few against a whole armed gang.One by one, Chris convinces seven guns to offer their services to defend the town. As men with nothing else to live for in need of money, they easily agree. The first is Vin (Steve McQueen), a cool cat who lives on the edge. In his first major film role, McQueen shows all the suave that made him a star in the '60s.The other five are Bernardo (Charles Bronson), a burly half-Mexican half-Irish loner, Britt (James Coburn), the skilled knifeman, Lee (Robert Vaughn) the professional past his prime, Harry (Brad Dexter) the money-obsessed gambler and Chico (Horst Buchholz), the proud and impetuous kid. It's Buchholz whom Sturges fixates on the most despite the many other stars at his disposal. A German pretty boy, it's a little strange with both he and Brynner starring in the film as Europeans trying to talk like authentic cowboys. It's easy enough to warm up to them both over time, but at first you really don't feel like there's anything authentically Mexican about the film even though it was filmed there.William Roberts, the writer lone credited writer who crafted the film's final draft, constructs the film almost entirely on one-liners and other whip-smart dialogue. Consequently, "Magnificent Seven" leaves a much better impression than the experience of the film itself. Watching the film is an average experience at best given the obvious trajectory of the film ? Calvera's return and a final standoff ? but somehow after we see "the end" title card, it gets that much better. It's a strange phenomenon, perhaps best explained by the aura created by the stars and the nature of the Western in general. Westerns are legends in the most basic story sense, so to have so many great legends of cinema on screen at once in a Western amplifies the effect.Sturges supplies some lasting images in the action scenes and frames his shots in a way that definitely evokes the classic John Ford Westerns, but a lot of it comes down to how he captures his stars. Nobody really gets dwarfed in this film, though it is noted according to people in and close to the film that they were all jockeying for the spotlight, especially McQueen.McQueen would go on to become an icon in this decade, but arguably the film's most valuable contribution to the genre was the spontaneously inspired casting of Wallach as Calvera. Wallach left his imprint on film history in Sergio Leone's "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly," but his casting as Tuco would never have happened without "Seven," and ultimately neither would his entire 60-year career as a character actor.The on-screen talent really helps you buy into the simplistic plot devices and character arcs for each of the seven. The actors pique your interest in the characters in a way the script never does. Who can really say how much of the credit the film's many clever lines belongs to the writers compared to the fame-craving actors? Truth is, no one really thinks about the writing when they think about "The Magnificent Seven."~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fell short of expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film with fairly high expectations, hoping to be treated with some interesting dialogue and a good storyline, a la Butch Cassidy. Instead I was treated to a movie which felt very slow paced, and seemed to go on for too long, with characters who were somewhat one-dimensional. Admittedly, it is a Western, and the movie was trying to dig up that old-style of 'talk little; get the job done', but there just seemed to be a certain warmth that was missing. The lines were someone strained, giving the impression that I was watching a dramatic play rather than a movie. Each actor appeared to be struggling with what he was trying to say, and I found some of the scenes to be downright confusing. When the movie attempted to build tension or create drama, the acting became so strained that instead of focusing on the plot development, I was drawn completely to the awkwardness of the actors, completely throwing me off of the story. More than once they tried to subtly reveal certain hidden aspects of characters throughout the story, but it seemed to fall flat, and I'm not sure if it can be attributed to the writing or the actors themselves. Either way, I wasn't impressed, although I do realize the were aiming for a certain "style" of Western that apparently doesn't sit well with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regarded as an epic of its age, in which epics popped out like bunnies. Other whopping wezzies of the period included 'The Big Country', 'How The West Was Won', and 'Gunfight At The OK Corral'.Theme music blares out an instantly recognised anthem. That was itself a hit at the time, bought by those who had seen the movie. Here we have an almost-A-list of characters, recruited to reprise 'The Seventh Samurai'. Yul Bryner leads Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson et al on a mission to protect some Mexican peasants from a gang of marauding bandits.The movie starts out in great roistering fashion with Bryner's 'Chris' volunteering to drive a hearse to a funeral that's been postponed by prejudice. Mexican talent-scouts observe, then seek to engage his services. He agrees to find a band of six-gun saddle-tramps who might suit their purpose. 'Magnificent' is not a word that comes to mind.These individuals also pop-up like bunnies. You'd think they had mobile phones or wi-fi access. How can word of mouth possibly spread so quick in the semi-wilderness? Anyway; before long he has his 'seven' - including himself. Unfortunately, from about there the dialogue often degenerates into a host of self-analytical clichés of almost sphincter-puckering tedium, as each shootist dilates upon his motives and demons. It's not all bad; sometimes there's wit and wisdom; but when it is bad - it's horrid.Eli Wallach is the bandit leader with a heart. Even though these hombres manage to slaughter about half of his men; when he has them at his mercy, he lets them ride away. I just don't buy it. In the final battle these experienced gunmen get winnowed down to just 3, by contriving to expose themselves as the most blatantly obvious targets. How had they managed to survive thus far? It's so stagy, it's laughable.Filming is on a lavish scale. Though I've still seen better in lesser acclaimed movies. There is that instantly-recognisable anthem, a constellation of stars and a great plot. Other technical issues are right on the money. But that endless tiresome angst and cliché-ridden script seriously date this work now. More modern directors - notably Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood dragged the western legends into a more modern and believable context. Even contemporaries like 'Big Country' and 'OK Corral' have scripts and characters that have better stood the ravages of time and fashion.This work is still worth a watch. However it spawned a couple of sequels that were so bad they were almost beyond belief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Tribute To Kurosawa's most Influential work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a village comprising of mostly farmers. All are peace loving people . But the village is looted by a local bandit or 'Daku' once in every few months. Helpless the farmers assemble a team of trained gunmen who save them from this bandit . Recognize such a story?Yes Hindi film enthusiasts may point out the movies China Gate or even Sholay whose storyline is similar. But the movie which started such kind of story-line was Kurosawa's Shichinin no Samurai made in 1954. The immediate humble tribute to this movie was 'The Magnificent Seven' which came 6 years after the original. Basically a western, The Magnificent Seven is perhaps the best tribute to Kurosawa's most influential work. As the name suggests, seven trained and daring gunmen from different walks of life having different perspectives of life come together to save a particular peasant village from a bandit whose gang consists of more than 30 members. How many people survive and is the mission successful constitutes the movie. The movie also explores the inner feelings of all the seven men, their fears, their past and thoughts of the future. Thus it gives a humane touch to the all action adventure. The BGM also enhances the feel of the movie which is so necessary for a good western .It becomes difficult to leave an impact in a movie having so many actors. But Brynner, Mcqueen and Charles Bronson leave an impact which stays after the movie. Eli Wallach as the defamed bandit is average.

		<fullReview>Director John Sturges' remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 Japanese epic "Seven Samurai" ranks as one of the greatest westerns ever made. Along with Robert Aldritch's shoot'em saga "Vera Cruz," "The Magnificent Seven" exerted considerable influence on the look and subject matter of many Spaghetti westerns. Sturges had gained an impressmive reputation in the genre with two contemporary westerns "The Walking Hills and "Bad Day at Black Rock" as well as his frontier oaters "The Law and Jake Wade," "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral," and "Last Train from Gun Hill." Sturges specialized in all-male actioneers about tough guys in the life and death situations. Visually, he relied on low-angle photography to give his pictures a larger-than-life look, and he staged his gunfight sequences as if they were football game strategies. Sturges began a long association with "The Ten Commandants" composer Elmer Bernstein on "The Magnificent Seven." Not only did Bernstein receive an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score for his music on "The Magnificent Seven," but he also got an Oscar nod when he reprised his score in Burt Kennedy's 1966 sequel "Return of the Seven." Aside from Sturges' masterful direction, "The Magnificent Seven" boasts a top-notch cast. Sturges was largely responsible for these brilliant casting choices.Many of them, including Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, and Charles Bronson, achieved superstar prominence during the 1960s. "The Magnificent Seven" was lensed on location by Charles Lang in Durango, Mexico, and on some rather obvious sets at Churubusco Studios, Mexico City. Lang had filmed "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" as well as "Last Train from Gun Hill" with Sturges and would go on to shoot the unlikeliest Sturges movie "A Girl Named Tamiko." "The Magnificent Seven" takes place in the late 19th century. The first scene occurs in a small, anonymous Mexican village as a bandit, Calvera (Eli Wallach of "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"), and his 40 gunmen steal enough food to feed themselves. After Calvera and his gang depart, the campesinos convene in the square to formulate a plan of defense. "If he takes our crop, we might as well cut our throats and be done with it," laments one farmer. They visit the Old Man (Russian character actor Vladimir Sokoloff of "Cloak and Dagger")and seek his advice. "Fight," he urges them. "Go to the border and buy guns." The frontier west has settled down and our heroes are roaming the land in search of work. Chris (Oscar winning actor Yul Brynner of "The King and I") and Vin cross paths in a dusty little hamlet when the local citizens refuse to let an Indian named Old Sam be buried in a predominantly white cemetery. "How long has this been going on?" inquires a traveling salesman. "Since the town got civilized," remarks the undertaker, Chamlee (Whit Bissell) and tries to give corset salesman Henry (Val Avery of "The Anderson Tapes") his twenty dollars back. Three of the villagers arrive in town as Chris and Vin decide to drive the hearse up to Boot Hill. "Never ridden shotgun on a hearse," quips Vin. Chris wounds two men trying to block their way and the townspeople unload the coffin and bury it.The three villagers approach Chris and ask him to help them buy guns. "Men are cheaper than guns," Chris advises them and they assemble six men. The pay is a double eagle for four to six weeks with food and board thrown into the bargain. So moved is Chris by their earnestness that he decides to help them. "I've been offered a lot for my work," he assures the Mexicans, "but never everything." Initially, Vin is reluctant about joining up. When he learns the job pays twenty dollars, he shrugs, "Wouldn't pay for my bullets." The third man to join up is gold-seeking Harry Luck (Brad Dexter) who believes that there must be more to it if the Cajun-speaking Chris has decided to him the villagers. Bernando O'Reilly (Charles Bronson) is chopping wood for his breakfast when Chris offers him twenty dollars. "Right now that's a lot of money," he agrees. Britt (James Coburn) and Lee (Robert Vaughn) and a Mexican farmer turned gunfighter, Chico (German born actor Horst Buchholz), follow. At first, Chico doesn't make the grade but later he proves his worthiness.The seven teach the villagers to defend themselves with rifles they obtain from Calvera's men sent to spy on them. They also erect new walls in the village. "They won't keep me out," Calvera surveys them on his return to the village with his forty gunmen. Chris explains, "They were made to keep you in." A gunfight erupts. All seven survive the first foray, but the triumphant villagers are caught off-guard when Calvera's men hang around. When combat breaks out again, the villagers split into fractions. Half decide hiring the seven constituted a mistake. Chris and company change tactics, mount an offensive against Calvera, but find his camp empty. When they arrive back in the village, the seven discover that one fraction has sold them out, but Calvera refuses to kill them. He fears that their friends from up north might retaliate so he takes their guns and lets his men escort them to the border."The Magnificent Seven" brims with irony. The Old Man advises the villagers to buy guns, but Chris tells them that men with guns are cheaper. Although the hiring price of twenty dollars is low, the high-priced O'Reilly joins because "right now twenty dollars is a lot." Similarly, Chris signs on because nobody has ever paid him everything. Lee suffers from paranoia so he decides to hide out in the worst place imaginable. "The final supreme idiocy," he confesses, "a deserter hiding out on a battlefield." The performances are memorable as is William Roberts' dialogue. In one scene, Vin observes, "It took me a long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock." "The Magnificent Seven" qualifies as my favorite western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing all of the hype for this movie I have to say I was disappointed. I thought the characters were caricatures and not well developed. Of course I am comparing it to "Seven Samurai" a movie I love and have seen many times. In "Seven Samurai" I was introduced to the characters, shown their plan to defend the village, told of their plan to defend the village then watch their plan unfold in the actual attack. I felt "The Magnificent Seven" just introduced concepts and that, through my familiarity with previous Westerns, and through a familiarity with the original movie, I could fill in the story. The action sequences in the movie were OK but the scenes in between were alternately preachy or goofy. Maybe if this was an original story it would have been fleshed out more but since it was a derivation of a legendary movie and had to live in its shadow it never got fully grown. My suggestion is to watch "The Magnificent Seven" before watching "Seven Samurai".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic treasure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Satisfying western epic about Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), an ultra-cool gunman who dresses only in black, decides to help the poverty-stricken residents of a small Mexican village who have a nasty leader, Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his band of thieves that come into their town and take their food. In return, Chris hires seven gunmen to back him up the fight, among the bunch are Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Robert Vaughan, Charles Bronson, and a very fiery Horst Buchholz.Director John Sturges ("The Great Escape") and his screenwriter, William Roberts, create a clever and terrific story here, and it's no surprise to anyone that's the movie is a remake of Akiro Kurosawa's "The Seven Samurai". To be honest, I haven't seen nor rent the Kurosawa film, but the results here are wonderful and you can feel the sense of adventure (and the overwhelming odds that the seven take into account). And the musical score, composed by Elmer Bernstein, is one that goes very easy on the ears.As for the performances, everyone here make their presence felt very often and don't let up. Brynner is confident as he usually is, and Buchholz is surprisingly effective as is Bronson, whose character draws the attention of three kids who live in the village. There's one scene where O'Reilly (Bronson) tells the trio about what a father does for his family in order to survive and there's nothing to be ashamed of."The Magnificent Seven" is certainly one of those movies, without a doubt, that you define as "a cinematic treasure", period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can honestly say this has been one of my favorite film of all time. When I had discussions with other people throughout my life about their favorite movies, many of them have love this film also. Of course the elitist movies critics do not agree. I am not trying to say the acting is academy award stuff, but when you combine the great cast (all who have gone on to become major stars themselves), the wonderful story line (from the "Seven Samurai") and the great Elmer Bernstein music, it turns out to be a great viewing experience. The film also teaches us many lessons. The good guys in this movie like Yul Brenner and Steve Mcqueen readily admit they may be helping other people in need, but that their profession as gunfighters means they will loose out in life and is why their taking the job to rid the Mexican Villiage of the bad guys would change their lives and help them to be something other than gunfighters like farmers. I found the dialogue in this movie very good, the actors enjoyable and the music fantastic. People trying to compare it to the "Seven Samurai" should let it stand on its own merits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magnificent Seven is History!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dilemma I find myself placed in here is not unique to this film. How do we judge this picture. Do you want how I felt when I first saw it on a Giant screen Drive in movie, with my mom, brothers and best friends? Or should we use the recently released wide screen version with the best trick sound we can find? By the looks of these ratings I suspect that many of our voters have not had the chance to see this film on the Big screen. Many have only seen what was left after the chopped up scan and pan editors got finished. I can only request that you revise your votes when you see the wide screen version.It is not sporting to compare this genre against all others. Putting Thomas Edison's "Great Train Robbery," up against "Shindlers list," is absurd. Only one is original, the other is a copy. Westerns should be compared to Westerns.My friend the noted Western author David F. Matuszak. Prefers to rate films on realism. Were they authentic to the times. There are many excellent Realistic Westerns, they are not rated high because of realism. It is just a nice touch that the Director cared.Using that method of scoring this remake of a Japanese movie, even keeping some of the original music does not stand a chance. But as I look at the most popular Westerns chosen by voters on this web site, some of the most popular Westerns are made in Spain by Italians. People like to be entertained. A good Saturday matinee shoot-um-up western may or may not have a lot of reality. The thing is the story, the action, the players. The set "what is going on," and the setting the "Old West."Westerns like all movies, may contain drama, suspense, it may be a thriller or a comedy or a complex interweaving of these and other elements. The thing that separates westerns from all other films is the common locations they all share. We expect the good guys to usually beat the bad guys, and up hold a reverence of woman that has never been equaled in the real world.Hollywood through the years has had layers and layers of restrictions, codes, and censorship put on Directors. The wonderful "codes of the west." When judging a western you need to consider social and technical limitations that were in effect back in those days. The overriding thing common to all films of course is "how do you feel" when you see it? Will you enjoy it when seen again?It may be argued that some westerns show history. Listen... the Magnificent Seven is History. No matter how I slice it. The letterbox addition of "The Magnificent Seven," is always on my list of ten best western movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one of my favorite Westerns.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed in Spain, this movie has a great script, lots of action and a wonderful musical score. This film started more than one of its cast on the road to stardom, including Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Steve McQueen. Brad Dexter, whose character is one of the more interesting in the film, is one who did not go onto big things. The film was so successful it spawned three forgettable sequels.The first 45 minutes of the film are the most enjoyable for me. The high point is the scene in which Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen drive a hearse up to boothill. Following this, Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen recruit 5 other gunslingers to defend a Mexican village threatened by a Mexican bandit, played well by Eli Wallach. The script is wonderful in these early minutes. Yul Brynner quips "I've been offered a lot for my services, but never everything." Charles Bronson says in a later scene that "right now twenty dollars is a lot." The best line comes at the end of the movie when Brynner tells McQueen that "only the farmer's have won. We lost. We always lose."The second part of the movie is full of action as Brynner and his companions defend the village. Ultimately, the villagers grab their tools and join the fight. Guess who wins!Elmer Bernstein's score punctuates the action beginning with the stirring theme familiar to almost everyone. My favorite cut is when the three villagers ride into the border town to find help. This cut has recently become available on CD in the original soundtrack. I never could understand why the soundtrack of this film was not issued at the time. It's definitely better late than never, however.What didn't I like about the movie. It bothered me that Brynner wore his hat all the time. Of course, he was doing the King and I on Broadway at the time, and he had to do that. It looked silly in many cases. In one scene the seven and the villagers are building walls in preparation for the coming fight. Despite the obviously sweaty work, Brynner is wearing is hat.This is a wonderful film to watch. If you haven't seen it, rent it or, better yet, buy the widescreen version. You won't be sorry.</fullReview>

The acting is awful, especially for the (SPOILER) death scenes.Overall, the Magnificent Seven is rather dull. The action sequences are not very exciting, the characters are one-dimensional, and the ending is somewhat predictable.

		<fullReview>This was the first time i had seen this much loved old "classic" from 1960. Some critics felt it ushered in a new style of Western...but in reality, it did the opposite. It ended the card board cut out "heroes" and was replaced by Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood with there anti hero "man with no name". It was a reasonable movie (without the music it would have been limp) to end the fake westerns. It is endlessly said this was full of stars. It was actually full of potential stars (apart from Yul Bryner and Steve McQueen.) We all know it is a copy of Seven Sumarai by Japanese maestro Karosawa (but i am telling you again..!) He said he liked it, but i have a feeling he knew his original version was far superior. Bryner was too laconic here...he is far more effective dancing with Deborah Kerr wearing silly clothes. McQueen spent the first half of the movie trying to distract the audience by any means he could ..."look at me---I am the real star he appeared to be indicating"...maybe he was.</fullReview>

Highly-profitable Americanization of the Japanese adventure "Seven Samurai" caught the public fancy in 1960, even though isn't a very solid western. The editing is scrappy, the character development sparse, the screenplay dim. Charles Bronson whittling a flute and giving it to a little girl watching the fireworks is about as deep as it gets. Certainly the strong cast commands attention, and Elmer Bernstein's zealous, Oscar-nominated music heralds new dangers and triumphs at every turn. Followed in due course by "Return of the Seven" in 1966 (starring Brynner), "Guns of the Magnificent Seven" in 1969 and "The Magnificent Seven Ride" in 1972 (both Brynner-less). **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If God did not want them sheared, he wouldn't have made them sheep"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So said Calvera (Eli Wallach), a man who could have been talking about the audience that watched this dated tripe. Did we really watch stuff like The Magnificent Seven four decades ago?An intellectually unambitious film, it's hugely dated with corny dialogue and incidental music so loud and over the top it could burst your eardrums. But the real reason why the audience were sheep is that a truly magnificent film, Shichinin no Samurai (8 ? not Kurosawa's best, that distinction lies with my favourite film of all, Rashomon, but still an outstanding achievement) was already made. It's depth, poignancy and superb direction were watered down. The powerful black and white cinematography by probably the finest director the world has ever seen was transferred into bland colour, the honourable seven samurais (actually six samurais and a ronin, but seven samurais was a better title) transformed into mercenaries. The samurais defended a village for honour and food. The gunmen do it for cash and glory. All the subtlety and ambiguity is drained from the film, and, considering the original is 203 minutes long (often cut for western video releases, I was lucky enough to catch a version that ran for 190), it never fails to engage. The Magnificent Seven, is, I have to say, boring. A western audience had to have a classic stripped of subtitles and plunged into dumb macho formula, any trace of density or literary merit stamped out. Only then could they accept it.The film's leaning towards pretension gives us some laughable moments of would-be meaningful dialogue. Delivered by most of the seven ? Brynner particularly ? it can be carried, and by Eli Wallach as bandit leader Calvera. But when one of the supporting cast, who really aren't that impressive, deliver a line, it becomes laughable. Charles Bronson, too, is guilty of a cringe-making scene where he lectures some of the village children on the "bravery of responsibility". There were some interesting additions to the script, such as the village rejecting the seven after their initial failure, and their capture by the bandits. In the seven samurai, failure on such a large scale is non-existent. I also like the way the bandit leader's role is beefed up, though his degree of honour does have the unfortunate distinction of making him more likeable than the seven "heroes". Behind the scenes, things were less amiable. Steve McQueen was leading a revolt against Brynner's starring role (a role which was minimal in the original, but built-up for the "name" actor), and also against Horst Buchholz who had the "pretty boy" part which McQueen had assumed would go to him. Though many laugh off this revolt, which amounted to no more than McQueen trying to upstage his co-stars, Buchholz can still be quoted as saying "I couldn't take his guts". Legal fights also went on for producer and writer credits, squabbles over what is alleged to be the second most played film on American television.Three sequels were inevitably made. Return of the Seven (5) is, in many senses, an improvement on the first film, if only because it's shorter. The dynamic is stronger, with a seven who don't really like each other all that much and a mystery to solve. Rather than waiting for the "many men with guns" to arrive, here the seven have to track them down. Shichinin no Samurai is again referenced, this time with mills, rain and blockades. Two of the original seven return, though only one of them is played by the same actor, a Yul Brynner who looks tired without the competition of a Charles Brosnan or a Steve McQueen. What stops Return from bettering it's predecessor is the lack of occasion; it has "cheap cash-in sequel put together in a hurry" written all the way through it. Worst of all, it has a cringe-making stinker of a last line as Chris (Brynner) exclaims: "I'll be damned". "I doubt that," he is told, "I doubt that very much".Another flimsy piece of would-be meaningful dialogue marks out the third film in the series, Guns of the Magnificent Seven (6). When a Mexican is asked why his people have such long names, he replies. "I don't know. I guess it's because we always have such short lives". What does that mean??? It has no meaning whatsoever, it's complete gibberish! Yet two of the seven look on as if in understanding. For this instalment the original cast have all jumped ship, and George Kennedy is the new Chris. I wonder how he managed to grow all that hair between films? And what sort of name is "Chris" for a tough cowboy anyway? Lugubrious, less masculine and more ineffectual than Brynner, it's fortunate that Kennedy is backed up by the most interesting seven of the series. Though it could smack of tokenism, we get a cowboy suffering from a severe chest infection, a one-armed cowboy and Bernie Casey as Cassie, the series' only black addition. Though as Cassie is a silent strongman stereotype only there to have racial taunts bounced off him, it's perhaps not that great a feat. There are also some editing problems, white flashes clearly visible for some of the jump cuts. Yet even though the fated members of the seven still struggle on after being shot several times, their enemies getting felled by a single bullet, this is still the best of the sequels. The recruitment vignettes have a more unusual air than before, and Chris finally gets to learn about real honour.Lee Van Cleef was probably the most experienced for the role of Chris when he took on the role for the only 70s outing, The Magnificent Seven Ride! (6). He'd already appeared in 68 prior films, including notable westerns such as High Noon and Bunfight at the O.K. Corral. Chris is now married, bitter and with dubious morality. His role on the right side of the law as a Marshall is interesting in this thoughtful fourth instalment which was different enough from the others to maintain interest. However, while Cleef's Chris is arguably the most exciting interpretation of the character, the rest of the seven are the blandest of all. Most notable is the fact that they've all become two-armed, two-legged Caucasians once more, supporting Hollywood's "Persil Policy" (Persil Policy, c. my mate Griff). It might have been nice to have a devastating end chapter, but this one closes pretty much the same as the prior outings, though does at least allow Chris to find happiness.And the original? For my money, "Guns" beats it into second place, though neither are anything outstanding. I do admire the western genre, though it's base manifestation ? men with guns kill each other ? means it can, be default, be uninvolved. Though it's tiny touches of character ? such as Robert Vaughan rueing that he would have been able to catch three flies in his youth, not just one ? that elevate it to somewhere near a "6".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll make this short and sweet: Brynner, McQueen, Bronson, Coburn are likable and magnificent characters in this movie even though I wish they all each had more speaking lines. Heck, I even liked the villain Calvera even though he was not very "villainy", but that's because I can't help to like Eli Wallach.The problem I had with this movie was the casting of the other 3 played by Brad Dexter, Robert Vaughn, and Horst Buchholz. Dexter's character (Harry) was not interested in helping anybody except himself always asking about where the hidden treasure was at. The only reason he signed on was to hopefully come across a fortune whether it be gold, silver, gems, etc. Vaughn's character (Lee)was there to just basically hang out or hide out from whatever demons he is running from. The scene where he's having a nightmare is laughable I now have to fast forward through each time I watch the movie....and he NEVER takes off his black gloves for a moment. He even sleeps with his gloves on (what a freak). Horst Buchholz's character (Chico) is annoying at the beginning and several times throughout but at least he is willing to fight and not try to blend into the adobe walls as if he were a chameleon like Lee did when Calvera showed up the first time. Which is why he adds the "1/2" part to my Summary Title.Yul Brynner as "Chris" is eye candy as usual. He just oozes sex appeal all over the screen. He can just sit there and blink and say nothing. The man drives me mad. My favorite scenes are when he lights up his cigarillos in the hearse. So sexy...I have serious breathing problems looking at him. And a big thank you to the scriptwriters for not letting his gorgeous bod not get shot up by the bandidos! Chris' bond with the villagers are the friendships he forms with the initial 3 farmers who seek him out.McQueen as "Vin" is the camera's darling as he is constantly trying to steal the scenes, which he does. He also has the best lines in the movie. His bond comes with the idea of not drifting anymore but settling down in that town or some place similar. He's just so dang cute.Bronson as "O'Reilly" was quite the stud all buff chopping wood. Who would've thought the dude from Death Wish could make me go gaga? When in the Mexican village, his bond is formed with several children there making his character even more likable as he is almost like a big brother to them. They vow to make sure if anything happens to him they will bury him, avenge his death, and make sure his grave always has fresh flowers.Coburn has this intimidating presence on screen. They don't give him a lot to say but I got the impression that he is a dedicated person who finishes whatever he starts. He bonds with the village even though it's not shown/acted out but we know he has one when he says "Nobody throws me my own guns and says run. Nobody." Buccholz I wanted to punch in his young brat face one too many times. He tries too hard to be like the big men. At times, I'd say to the television, "Oh Shut up!" or "Not this kid again!". Sometimes the looks on the others' faces seemed to say the same thing, as if this kid "Chico" gets on their nerves. Chico's bond is with a village senorita he finds down by the arroyo and he comes from a similar farming village but is in denial because he wants desperately to be a gunslinger. Being a farmer isn't glamorous enough and he's ashamed of farmers.The music is wonderful. So wonderful, I made the opening song my ring tone. Even though the casting flaws (in my opinion) I still love this movie.</fullReview>

Artistically and content-wise it falls well short of Kurosawa's masterpiece. Still, it is a worthy example of the liberal-minded "message" Westerns of the 1950s and early 1960s. The opening scene, in which the heroes escort a coffin containing the corpse of a Native American to a cemetery against the wishes of racist and armed townsfolk, sets the tone. Yul Brynner is, as always, fun to watch and to hear, and Eli Wallach is always a treat. The movie's theme music is among the most recognizable in cinema history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should say that "The Magnificent Seven" doesn't quite equal "Seven Samurai", but it's still a real piece of work. While Yul Brynner is officially the star, none of the seven really outshines any other, nor does Eli Wallach as the leader of the bandits terrorizing the Mexican village. Each of the seven brings something neat to the group: Vin (Steve McQueen) brings cool demeanor, Britt (James Coburn) brings laconic wile, O'Reilly (Charles Bronson) brings an interesting background, Lee (Robert Vaughn) brings tension, Chico (Horst Buchholz*) is a man in need of guidance, while Harry's (Brad Dexter) character isn't extensively developed.Whatever the case, John Sturges directed a really fine movie. I can see in this film the same sort of tricks that he later used in "The Great Escape" (starring McQueen, Coburn and Bronson again). With a fine score by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Charles Lang, "The Magnificent Seven" is a movie to die for! It holds up very well after all these years. And Petra (Rosenda Monteros) sure is a fox!*Buchholz was known as the German James Dean. He also played an East German scientist in Billy Wilder's "One, Two, Three" and a Nazi doctor in "Life Is Beautiful".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- 1960, A small Mexican village is Winter terrorized by an outlaw bandit and his gang each year and takes it's murderous toll. Villagers decide to fight this with getting some protectors that are gun fighters from the USA. Seven gun hands volunteer for little pay to test their skills and help against the opposition for their own personal reasons. When the outlaw bandit and his gang come back to the village for winter provisions, the action drama really starts.*Special Stars- Yul Brenner, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, Charles Bronson, and Eli Wallach. Director: John Sturges*Theme- Sometimes you get what you need and what you ask for when there's trouble. Self reliance is great.*Based on- Kurasawa's 'Seven Samurai'.*Trivia/location/goofs- This film is 'featuring' Horst Bucholtz (German actor) in his first American big budget film appearance as 'Chico'. There was constant 'upstaging' competition with small character actions between McQueen and Brenner during scenes. Especially watch for small character actions in the hearse-driving scene through the frontier town streets to the hillside cemetery. Eli Wallach 'tears-up' the lead heavy role as the bandit villain 'Calvera'. Just before the first confrontation with 'Calvera', Chris removes the pistol hammer safety loop holding his six-gun in his holster, twice. The boom microphone pole shadow can clearly be seen moving from right to left as head villager, 'Sotero' walks and turns while addressing his fellow villagers after Calvera's first visit near the beginning of the film.*Emotion- This is a very memorable film for many reasons. It's similar to the giant male lead cast playing in the film, 'The Dirty Dozen' and the action comedy film, "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World" released much later in the 60's. The character roles and performances are wonderful. This film memorable for having a rousing and catchy main music film score from Elmer Bernstein. Be sure to experience this film in its 'uncut' version to experience the full wonderful effect instead of those impotent commercial filled TV edited versions. This film is not only a great film experience but artistically superior to its competition. This film created a positive role model for the western production of action films. I'm glad I saw it and own it now. It sets the bar high. Why isn't more western's filmed today like this one? They should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How idiosyncratic is THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN? After the prologue, the top three stars of the movie are introduced backing the bold play of bit player Henry (Val Avery), an itinerant lingerie salesman on the streets of a dusty post-Civil War U.S.-Mexico border town, to provide a Native American stranger who inexplicably "dropped dead" in front of him with a decent burial in the town's "boot hill" cemetery. This drawn-out bit of tense action centering around a horse-drawn hearse establishes the movie's theme that the mercenary gunmen of the Old West are less like "Come back, Shane" and more like loser outcasts who will defy prevailing social mores just for the heck of it, confident that they'll get away with doing so or be too dead to care. After the hullabaloo about the dead native is over, Henry even provides his personal booze bottle to Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) by way of thanks and celebration. Chris, Vin (Steve McQueen), and the the trepid Chico (Horst Buchholz, trailing everyone else like St. Peter slinking from the Garden of Gethsemane), have risked little compared to Henry, the first true hero of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. The rest of this feature, to paraphrase a Rogers and Hammerstein classic, is a case of showing why "the farmers and the gunmen should be friends."</fullReview>

I might have enjoyed it if I had seen it earlier, but instead watched it the week after I saw Seven Samurai, which it is a remake of, and it doesn't hold up at all. The class commentary is almost nonexistant, the characters indistinguishable from each other, and the meaning of the final scene (one of the most brilliantly set up shots in film history) is lost through the use of a different camera angle than the original. And this is to say nothing of the dialogue. "But there's no one buried up at Boot Hill except for cutthroats and barflies!", "What's...My...Name...(flops over dead)", etc.The Magnificent Seven isn't as bad as I make it seem, really. It's probably fairly enjoyable on its own terms. But as a remake its horrible. However, if you want to see justice done to a Kurosawa film, watch A Fistful of Dollars instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Brynner was always be associated with 'The Magnificent Seven', it was not a Brynner. In fact, because it enlisted the talents of Steve McQueen and James Coburn, it became their showreel for success, and their careers were lifted thereafter. The seven characters represent the alliance between Steve McQueen and James Coburn whose mutual friend was Bruce Lee. James Coburn went on to act with Cary Grant in 'Charade' demonstrating that he was on his way up and that Grant should hand over the baton to his generation. He reunited again with McQueen in a better production titled 'The Great Escape' where Coburn plays an unconvincing Australian in a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tougher than the "Wild Bunch"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have enjoyed this movie from the first time I hooked school in 1960 and went to watch it on the Big Screen. I have viewed this movie at least 100 times since then. Each time I view it, I find myself enjoying saying the lines along with the actors. My favorite is Eli Wallach as the leader of the band of Desperado's who has the best lines in the movie. My favorite line is when he says "If God didn't want them to sheared, He wouldn't have made them sheep". A classic western that will survive all future generations and become the most viewed western of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good western even if it isn't exactly original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally hate remakes and rarely are they as good as or better than the originals. In the case of "The Magnificent Seven", however, it's a really tough sell because the original was an Akira Kurosawa classic--a film currently in the top 10 on IMDb! So, there really is no way this western can be better...but it still is very good. In particular, the musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the best in the history of westerns and the cast of actors was incredibly--with the likes of Yul Brynner, James Coburn, Steve McQueen and many others as the seven.The film begins in a tiny Mexican town. The villagers are being plundered and harassed by a Mexican gang (led by Eli Wallach). Their choice is to keep knuckling under and starve or leave to get outside help. They decide on the latter and soon a small delegation heads up into the States to find some gunfighters willing to work for VERY little money. Luckily, they find a couple guys who seem to be tired of their lifestyles and want to do something better with their lives (Coburn and Brynner). These two are able to enlist some friends in the cause--no matter how hopeless it looks against an army of 40 men. What happens next, you'll need to see for yourself.What's not to like about this film? Very little. However, as I stated above it was a remake and so it needs to lose a point for originality. In addition, a few of the deaths seemed silly--like folks just wanting to die (especially the first member of the seven). Still, a very enjoyable and well made Hollywood film that is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's strangely appropriate that John Sturges' The Magnificent Seven is a Western remake of Akira Kurosawa's Japanese epic Seven Samurai. After all, Kurosawa has repeatedly said that his work is inspired by American Westerns. While The Magnificent Seven cannot compete with Seven Samurai in terms of visual dexterity or profound thematic complexity, John Sturges' Western-ised adaptation holds up as a rousing action-adventure story as well as a fascinating turning point in the history of films about the Old West. Not only does The Magnificent Seven contain a pitch-perfect cast and a satisfying amount of exciting, gun-slinging action, but it additionally finds time to explore deep contradictions of the mythic noble outlaws which proved so endemic to the American Western genre.The plot is a simple one, and follows the template established by Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. A small Mexican village is repeatedly raided by a bandit gang led by the menacing Calvera (Wallach) who constantly leaves the villagers destitute. Desperate and fed up with living under Calvera's thumb, several of the villagers travel to a nearby border town in the hope of purchasing guns to defend themselves, but end up simply hiring professional gunmen instead. A total of seven men are recruited, who travel back to the village to confront Calvera and his gang of bandits. Each of the seven men has their own reasons for being involved, but all are united under the common goal of removing fear from the village and overthrowing the evil marauders.The Magnificent Seven is divided into two distinct halves. The first chronicles the rounding up of the seven gunmen, while the second half recounts the epic battle fought between the gunslingers and Calvera's gang of bandits. Taken at face value, this is standard good vs. evil stuff. But if scrutinised further, one will uncover something much deeper. Sure, the good guys fight off the bad guys heroically, but each character is imbued with a finely-drawn, distinct and interesting personality. The gunmen are masterfully humanised; they're tough guys who have regrets and fears, but manage to do a commendable job of hiding them. Things steadily intensify during the lead-up to the final showdown which displays no mercy even towards the film's most likable characters. The Magnificent Seven also remains vital and interesting due to departures from the genre norms it opted to take. This was probably the first Hollywood Western in history to delve into the emptiness of the life of a gunfighter; they're confident in their profession, but are unable to hold down a stable home and family life. In a wonderfully judged scene, the seven men discuss the pros and cons of the life they've chosen, and it's apparent this life hasn't greatly rewarded them since they were poor enough to accept this job for which they'll receive little pay.Of course, The Magnificent Seven wouldn't be considered such a success on characters alone; there are rousing action sequences here as well. In this respect, much of the credit belongs to director John Sturges, an 'outdoor' director who keeps the pacing efficient and has an eye for action set-pieces. Prior to The Magnificent Seven, Sturges was experienced in directing both action films and Westerns with such titles as Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and Bad Day at Black Rock. It's due to the director's extensive experience that when the action happens, it's taut, motivated and convincing, with a strong sense of urgency and a clear notion of what's at stake. The expansive vistas of Western scenery, the codes of honour among the gunslingers, the camaraderie they find in each other, as well as the shootouts so common in Hollywood Westerns are all included here in spades. This fusion of so many irresistible elements raises the film several notches above more typical tales of simplistic cowboy heroes.Yul Brynner was initially suggested to direct this movie, but Sturges ended up getting the job. Instead, Brynner settled for one of the protagonists - an excellent alternative, because Brynner's performance is outstanding. Another inspired casting choice is Steve McQueen as a member of the titular team. McQueen, who eventually went on to star in Bullitt and The Great Escape, imbues his performance with cool and intensity. He was the ultra-cool male film star of the 1960s, after all. The other five champions of the film are James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, Brad Dexter and European film star Horst Buchholz. It's easy to see why these men were cast: all have unique, memorable faces that convey both conviction and desolation. A number of actors got their big breaks in this film, including Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Charles Bronson. It's funny to imagine these actors being relatively unknown at the time. It's also interesting to note that there was a tremendous rivalry between the actors, in particular between Brynner and McQueen. Meanwhile Eli Wallach is superb playing the menacing, no-nonsense villain. Too many movies allow the lead villain to remain two-dimensional, but this is not the case here.Upon close examination, there are no real flaws to point out within The Magnificent Seven - it's just flawed in the sense that it feels like an abridged reiteration of Seven Samurai. Other than that, the film is top drawer. It offers drama, strong characterisations, clever writing, action and suspense. It's exciting, witty, smart and sometimes even sweet. Added to this, it's a Western actioner that crosses the line to appeal to movie-lovers of all sorts. Deep down, you know it's not as brilliant as Kurosawa's Seven Samurai...but very few films are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fifty years on and it still works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw 'The Magnificent Seven' on its original theatrical release in 1961. It was impressive then, when westerns were coming ten a penny, viz 'The Searchers' 'Shane' 'High Noon'etc, and it still stands out today when flag waving - America must love itself - is all the rage and westerns are often really downbeat or ridiculously deconstructionist, eg the much overpraised fairly recent Oscar-laden Eastwood vehicle. The story, yes, based on 'Seven Samurai' which it never seeks to deny, works well in a western setting, although it could have done with a bit more atmospheric 'closing of the west' feel to it. It is an adventure story whilst saying a lot about heroism and commitment amongst a group of fairly 'bad' individuals. And it is told within the confines of what was the lore of the Hollywood West at that time, so not too many bearded, shaggy, overcoated gunslingers, and bullets kill first time - something Eastwood has always portrayed, even in his so-called realistic westerns. The acting is good and McQueen does not get the girl - it was his breakthrough film, being a TV actor in westerns at the time! Main actors die - does not happen too often these days to heroes of the US! And Mexicans get some respect - soon after to be slaughtered in hundreds by Peckinpah in 'The Wild Bunch!' Yes, of its time, but it is a very good entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overacting gunfighters battle hammy banditos in a fusillade of fun and mayhem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>REVIEW: Magnificent 7: First, I love this movie. Every time I hear the music I want to mount the arm of my couch and ride it like a horsie. Having seen M7 no less than eleventy-seven times I've got permanent saddle sores on my carbuncles. But we can love and still make fun of, and this movie screams out for parody.Having been paid for their lethal services by Mexican peasants to protect their town from marauding baddies, the gunslingers are similar to hookers with hearts of gold. They kill because they love, and in the meantime fall all over themselves trying to save villagers from being robbed, women from being ravished, and children from being trampled by the nefarious bandit gang lead by that most famous of Hispanic actors, Eli Wallach. Well, he pronounces his H's as J's, and his J's as H's, ain't that good enough? After trial, tribulation, and the shooting of probably 10,000 blank cartridges, the happy villagers learn how to kill people with various agricultural implements, giving a whole new meaning to "hoe down". All in all, everyone has learned a valuable life lesson.True to the title, M7 tries to be Magnificent in every way with bold music, bold men, and, uh, Yul Brynner. His hat looks about two sizes too small, but that is no great surprise given his ego. He is Poser-In-Chief as he attempts to appear majestic in every scene: while astride his cayuse, when telling the banditos to "Ride on", and in general developing the cotton-mouth smackies while gobbling up the desert scenery.In fact, the only thing that flies thicker than the bullets is the "ham" from all of the Seven actors; so much so that we stand a good chance of developing trichinosis of the eyes. Catholics should not see this movie on a Friday, and Jews and Muslims should avoid it altogether. The only thing with more ham is Hormel, or maybe Sylvester Stallone.Overacting seems to be a blessing in this oater, with each of the future-famous stars trying to upstage the others. Of course McQueen, in his biggest role since "The Blob", utilizes the "squint" school of acting as usual. It is fun to see Bullitt, Flint, the Man from UNCLE, Mr. Deathwish, and those other two guys (who are they, anyway?) before they went on to fame and fortune, or ignominy and mediocrity. The dialogue and script are as corny as Kansas, but come on, ya gotta love it! This is a Must See movie; come for the cowboys, stay for the schmaltz! I give it Two Guns Way Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generosity ! That Was My First Mistake !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To protect their village and families from a numerous gang of "bandidos" Mexican farmers go across the American border and hire seven top guns. Out of this simple plot western specialist director John Sturges ("Gunfight at OK Corral", "Last Train from Gun Hill", "Bad Day at Black Rock") achieves a most entertaining film with lots of action, a bit of romance and a focus on certain complex characters.The film is rather slow and perhaps a bit too long but in all it turns out very well mainly for western fans. Beautiful outdoor locations photographed in bright color along with its famous and strong musical score by Elmer Bernstein help the product a lot. Action sequences and the final battle of the seven against 50 bandits are also a highlight.The cast is adequate. Yul Brynner (Chris) was the only major star by the time the film was made and Steve McQueen (Vin) was clearly on his way (perhaps the best performance among the seven). Charles Bronson (Bernardo), Robert Vaughn (Lee) as the one that lost his nerve and Horst Bucholtz (Chico) a farmer himself are good too. James Coburn plays the interesting Britt a role that pushed his career up, and the seventh one is a sort of insipid Brad Dexter (Harry). On the other side, Eli Wallach (Calvera) is perfect as the bandit's boss.Perhaps "The Magnificent Seven" doesn't reach the classic's mark but it is indeed a very good film in its genre worth a watch every once in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that matches the original classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Magnificent Seven is the remake of Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai with the tale transformed into a western. The story remains the same. A poor town plagued by bandits hires a group of men, in this case gunfighters, to protect their village. What is impressive about this film to me is that while I consider The Seven Samurai to be one of the greatest films ever made, I find that this film is in some ways preferable.In comparison, The Seven Samurai, is better at laying out the plight of the villagers and their relationships with their protectors. Also, The Seven Samurai is superior at laying out the battles so that the viewer is more aware of what is supposed to happen and has a greater reaction when something goes against the plan.However, The Magnificent Seven has three significant advantages over The Seven Samurai.First, The Magnificent Seven does a much better job at making each of the title seven distinctive and easily identifiable. With actors like Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn, the movie was blessed with actors who brought strong personalities with them, and the movie used them all well.Second, the inclusion of the Eli Wallach character gave a face to the villains and the audience someone to root against which is more effective than the more anonymous villains of The Seven Samurai which are barely seen outside of quick flashes in the action scenes.Third, Elmer Bernstein's score for The Magnificent Seven is one of the greatest ever recorded and adds a great deal to the greatness of the film which cannot be said for the score of The Seven Samurai that is more functional than great.In the end both The Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven are tremendous achievements in film with The Magnificent Seven being quite possibly the greatest remake ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Characters, Action Scenes, Fine Dialogue...a Classic Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although "The Magnificent Seven" is a very well-known and well-respected film, a U.S. adaptation of "The Seven Samurai" directed by Akira Kurosawa, it is not very well understood even by its admirers. The film is about the difference between static and dynamic lives; the soldier, the explorer, the policeman ventures, does deeds and grows old, his fame being a legend of his exploits if any. The static man does something repetitive and occasionally builds on the past, his reward being holding the line against Nature, or adding a little to what he had inherited. The seven gunhawks in the film are likened to a cleansing wind, the bandits to locusts, the farmers to the earth itself, which always remains. Director John Sturges, aided by wonderful creative art direction, lighting, Elmer Bernstein's musical score, costumes, sets and intelligent dialogue has his participants talk only occasionally about this theme--he brings it to life before the viewer's eyes... The villagers including Natividad Vacio, the young woman played by Rosenda Monteros, the bandits led by Eli Wallach, and townsmen such as Whitner Bissell are all set against the seven both by active contrast and contradiction. Only the village children and the Old Man who is the villagers' solon admire and really like the men who fight their bandits to save their lives, who teach their fathers to fight for themselves. The acting of the film is quite uneven, ranging from good to extraordinary. James Coburn, Charles Bronson and Yul Brynner come off best; Steve McQueen does a lot of physical business to create his character; Horst Bucholz works hard to seem to be a young Mexican firebrand; but Brad Dexter and Robert Vaughn come off less well than could have been hoped. The film, seen for the first or twentieth time, I claim "works" on all levels; its engrossing pace is that of a dramatic film, not merely an adventure. It has a "break" in the middle, as, somewhat implausibly, a raid by the seven after their initial defeating of the bandits' attack leads to their being betrayed and captured. But this minor pause leads to the film's rousing climax--as these proud fighters for good causes adopt the one they had waited all their lives to undertake--one that proves they need owe their lives to no one so long as they can fight even to the death for the right to choose their own battles. This film spawned several rather good sequels; it is really a film about a "mission" of a military/creative variety. And it is this that allows the director and writer to include a number of telling moments during recruiting of the fighters, their trip back to the village they have agreed to defend, the wait for the bandits to attack, and on more occasions This I find is a stirring, visually memorable and technically splendid film, from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Little did John Sturges know when he made "The Magnificent Seven", that he had made a classic. Eli Wallach is great as the villain, but it is the Magnificent Seven who steal the show here. Yul Brynner is the tough Chris Adams, Steve McQueen is on top form as Vin, in his own unique sophisticated style, Charles Bronson is very good as Bernardo O'Reilly, the man who the children take an enormous shine to, Robert Vaughn, Brad Dexter and James Coburn all keep the film zooming along wonderfully, and the late Horst Buchholz is good too as the ambitious Chico. Everything that a western should have can be found in this film: a good cast, fantastic and exciting fight scenes and great scenery. A great game to play with your friends is to see if they can name all of the Magnificent Seven. This film is also recommendable for its marvelous score by Elmer Bernstein. Well worth seeing, especially if you like westerns. 8/10</fullReview>

I saw this on one of the late night movie channels, and was surprised that the supporting cast wasn't given more time. Robert Vaughn and James Coburn are my personal favorites, and they both shine in their time on screen as the dapper, nervous, Lee. And, the stoic, tough as nails, Britt respectively. I always thought neither character got enough screen time, instead they focus more on Bucholtz's Chico, who, even though being a good character, is hardly the caliber of Vaughn or Coburn, or Bronson, or even Dexter. Brynner, McQueen, and Wallach all are very good leads, but I just feel the four characters who were not really focused on (Lee, Bernardo, Britt, and Harry Luck) were still the best. Highly recommended nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If someone who'd never seen a western asked me, "Where should I start?" I'd answer, "The Magnificent Seven". If I would to teach a western film class, the first movie I'd show would be "The Magnificent Seven." Why? Because "The Magnificent Seven" is the most ACCESSIBLE great western. Any age group could understand it and enjoy it.A terrific cast (five of whom became stars, either of the big screen or TV) individual give interesting flourishes to thin characters. If anything, each of the man characters represents characteristics of human nature. Certainly, Steve McQueen represents irony, Wallich greed, Vaugn fear, Bronson melancholy, Dexter whimsy, Buckholz passion, etc. Each actor makes his character interesting, yet creates a synergy which completes a completely satisfying package. Elmer Bernstein wrote a terrific score, the most fully realized in ANY western and, maybe any movie. Play the scene when Buckholz discovers the Mexican girl, first without sound, then with the score. What is a pretty routine scene takes on a tremendous amount of energy due to Bernstein.Director Sturges and the cinematographer primarily seem to have been wise enough to get out the way and follow the action. As a result, "The Magnificent Seven" seems more natural than the westerns of the great Sergio Leone. Excellent film editing tops off this treat, giving fine rhythm both to the action and Bernstein's score. The climax is both exciting and poignant.I give "The Magnificent Seven" a "10".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magnificent Sturges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Sturges is often bypassed as an important American director. He deserves a better deal."The Magnificent Seven" is his most popular work. But equally important are his "The Gunfight at the OK Corral" and "Bad Day at Blackrock". His films might have relied considerably on performers (or, appropriate casting) but he equally believed in gradually building up the atmosphere of tension, where stark desolation of the venue became a character. The good and the bad are clearly demarcated, there are no gray areas.I respect Sturges for having stated that he borrowed from Kurosawa in the credits. And Kurosawa acknowledged how Sturges adapted Kurosawa's work and gave it a new life (the Eli Wallach character "Calvera" is lot better than the original, the Mexican kids and the Charles Bronson character Bernardo is another, the unsure anti-hero Lee played Robert Vaughn). Compare Sturges with John Huston who copied the Hungarian filmmaker Zoltan Fabri's work and passed it off as his own ("Escape to Victory" or "Victory") and Sturges stands tall when concepts like intellectual property rights were not heard of! Like Sergio Leone, Michael Mann and Peter Weir, Sturges puts emphasis on music and sound editing. Of course, Mann and Weir have better technology to aid them but Sturges knows when the music needs to be higher than the sound of the horses hooves or vice versa. Elmer Bernstein can be credited for the music, but Sturges deserves more for the using it intelligently.Most important of all this film emphasized the importance of farmers, parents who toil for their children, and wisdom of the elders--a pretty unusual detail for a Hollywood product, but not uncommon in Japanese cinema.This is a great Western--one of the finest from Hollywood</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just watched 'Mag 7' at the cinema. I own the DVD, but couldn't resist another chance to see, what was, my favourite film. I grew up with this movie, watching it at least a dozen times in the 60s and 70s, all at the cinema. The last time, I recall, was in 1974 when it was on one of its many reissues. Shortly afterwards, at Christmas that year, it appeared on TV for the first time. In those video-less days, great movies took that long sometimes to reach the small screen. In the case of 'The Magnificent Seven', made in 1960, it took 14 years, which is the same length of time it took the first James Bond film to reach TV. Don't ask me why I remember all this, but I do. Anyway, this movie was singularly responsible for turning me into a sort of movie buff/addict/anorak, or whatever I should be called. I can still recall the first time I saw it, at 'The Ritz' in Brislington (alas, long gone) with my Father. I was about 7. Unfortunately, films in those days ran continuously and you just went in and stayed as long as you wanted. Well, we got there with about 15 minutes to go, and so I saw the climax firstly. I have never really forgiven him/myself for that, but it didn't and hasn't stopped me from enjoying this film many times. When we departed the cinema, apparently I looked up and told him 'that was the best film I've ever seen'. Well, I was 7! It remained my favourite for a long, long time, and although now I can acknowledge that there are better movies, I still say that none have had the immense impact that this one did on me. I can still recall the excitement of grown men at this film! People now talk of the wonderful cast. At the time of making it, though, nearly all of the cast were relatively unknown. Surely there is not another film which has made such megastars of so many of its cast members? One one remains, alive - Robert Vaughn, who was always my least favourite of the Seven, but tonight, having watched it after 30 years since my last cinema trip, I found his performance perhaps the best. It is really McQueen's movie, though. Without him, this would never have been the classic it now clearly is. How we miss McQueen. I haven't said much of the film itself because I'm sure that anyone who reads this will know it well enough anyway. All I can say personally is that this movie recalls to me my own childhood, and that is something we could all do with remembering. No other western will ever be able to match this film; not for me anyway. I mean, the music alone is reason enough. The best movie score of all time.</fullReview>

The locations that they filmed the movie in were nice as well. Eli Wallach is very good as the villain. The only thing I did'nt like about the film was the casting of Horst Bucholzt(or however you spell it). His character was annoying and I was hoping that he was'nt gonna follow them when they left. But aside from that THE MAGNIIFICENT SEVEN is a classic western and I recommend it to both fans of action and western film's. 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was weaned on westerns, and this is one of the best ever made. But if you want an interesting experience rent "Seven Samurai" and "The Magnificent Seven" in the same evening. "Magnificent Seven" is a remake of a 1954 Japanese film. "Seven Samurai" is far more touching, with better developed characters -- watch it first. Then see how the American version abbreviated what "Seven Samurai" accomplished. A word of warning, however, "Seven Samurai" is 6 hours long, black and white, and subtitled. All that said, it still makes for a great viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first western I ever saw, along with my dad who was a big fan of the genre. Come to think of it, this might even be the very first movie with a body count that I ever watched! I have re-watched "The Magnificent Seven" numerous times ever since and it always remains an all-time favorite. The story owes all of its success to the Japanese classic "Seven Samurai" (which I scandalously haven't seen yet) but the primary reason why this western version is such an immortal classic is the ensemble cast and their unforgettable performances. This was the movie that introduced me, and I assume many others as well, to names like Yul Brunner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn. Each and every single one of them is a monument of action/western cinema and even now I still attempt to track down all of their films as much as possible. "The Magnificent Seven" revolves on a remote community of hard-working but petrified Mexican farmers that regularly receives the unwelcome visit from super-bandit Calvera and his forty minions. Calvera steals their crops, but their too afraid to fight back. They decide to hire gunmen to protect their village and approach the noble lone rider Chris Adams. He manages to hire six other multi-talented fighters who are prepared to risk their lives and protect a handful of cowardly villagers for a lousy $20 paycheck. Numerous sequences in "The Magnificent Seven" are legendary ? or at least they are to me ? like Brunner and McQueen driving the hearse up cemetery hill, Robert Vaughn catching flies, Coburn's duel, McQueen's witty jokes and Charles Bronson educating young and over-enthusiast kids a thing or two about responsibility. The climax is still very exciting to behold, with an enormous body count among the bad guys and a couple of painful and emotional deaths amongst the beloved heroes as well. John Sturges' direction is impeccable and the Oscar nominated music from Elmer Bernstein still remains phenomenal even fifty years later. A bona fide classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fine movie, but I don't think it belongs on top 10 Western lists, where it often appears. Here's what I liked:- The basic premise is great i.e. professional gunfighters recruited to protect a farming village. The recruiting vignettes are fantastic.- The supporting cast is unbelievably good. So many great stars in one movie is very unusual. As a big fan of Wallach's later "TGB&amp;U" Tuco character, it is a delight to observe how much he based it on Calvera.- The soundtrack is excellent and iconic.- Central Mexican theme is very colorfulNow here are the problems:- I don't buy Yul Brenner as a Western gunfighter. Guys named Yul aren't Western gunfighters. He's the King of Siam. He has a pony tail and wears pointy slippers. On top of that, he's a lousy actor. Way too stilted and "stagy".- Horst Bucholz is so bad it's hard to even describe in words.- The premise of the movie is great, but it's a remake of Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai". Lack of originality is not a plus in my book.- Yes the supporting cast is star studded, but nobody really has a great role. All these guys' great work lay ahead of them.- There are a several major plot holes: First, it is out of character for Calvera to let the "Seven" go after capturing them. He claims he does this because he doesn't want any trouble with the North Americans. Exactly who is going to come down to Mexico to avenge their deaths? They are all misfits and outlaws. In fact, that's one of the themes of the movie. These guys all go down there because times have changed. The West is too settled and there's no more action. Brenner and McQueen indeed seem to be welcoming death, almost like William Holden and Ernest Borgnine, another pair of implausible "end of the West/suicide in Mexico" characters from "The Wild Bunch". The gunfighters aren't needed up North. They have no purpose left. Odd that McQueen and Brenner are the only two to survive. At least Peckinpah had the guts to knock his two leads off in the end.But let's accept that Calvera feels that Texans are so racist that they will hunt him down in Mexico for killing any kind of white people, even these castoffs and criminals. (This may not too huge a leap of faith, if you've read any of the history of Texian militias running amok in Mexico at various points in the 19th century). But that still doesn't explain why he gives them their guns back (stupido!!). Second, there's a code of honor in the West, even among thieves. Calvera defeated the "Seven". He granted them clemency on the condition they leave Mexico and go back to Texas. They agreed to this, ceased fighting and surrendered. I believe they dishonored themselves by returning to the village to kill Calvera. This is a direct contradiction of their earlier characterization as honorable warriors that time has passed by. This is definitely NOT part of the homage to the Kurosawa's noble Saumurai.Third, was I hallucinating or did Horst Bucholz don a sombrero and walk right into Calvera's camp as a "spy"? How could he possibly pass himself off as one of this small band? He's a effin" German!!!! this may be one of the most bizarre scenes I've ever seen in a Western.Fourth, at one point Calvera reveals that he has forty men. Subsequent to that I came up with an unofficial body count of well over fifty. They got a little carried away with the "bad guy shooting gallery". How come these guys never take cover?</fullReview>

Eli Wallach's performance in this movie rivals his Good, Bad, Ugly role. He plays a pretty convincing Mexican for a white guy. Speaking of Clint Eastwood westerns, what is the big deal about Unforgiven? It's !@#$ing boring!!! Gene Hackman didn't even save that one. So they draw their guns more historically accurate.WOW!!!! Who cares???!!! In Unforgiven they also wear fancy costumes. People in those days made their own clothes. They would have been all crappy like in the spaghetti westerns.

		<shortDescription>The Magnificent Seven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never realised the first time I watched it that this was a remake of the Japanese classic Seven Samurai, and not remembering much about this version I had to watch it again, from director John Sturges (Bad Day at Black Rock, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, The Great Escape). Basically a small Mexican farming village is terrorised once a year by a gang of bandits led by the nasty Calvera (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly's Eli Wallach), who raid and pillage, and they promise to return. Desperate to put an end to the raids, the villagers find and hire Chris Adams (The King and I's Yul Brynner), who agrees with a $20 payment and free food everyday, to help them. First he and three village farmers, decided by the village elders, travel to the United States to find other gunmen to join them in the fight to come. First to join them is Chris's acquaintance Vin (Steve McQueen), and one by one, they find the other seven, including originally rejected young hothead Chico (introducing Horst Buchholz). Also to accept the offer for different reasons are other friend Harry Luck (Brad Dexter), Irish-Mexican gunfighter Bernardo O'Reilly (Charles Bronson), deadly with a switchblade Britt (James Coburn), and on the run Lee (Robert Vaughn), so the total amount of men to help defend is seven. Returning to the village in Mexico they are not greeted with a big crowd, but with the help of Chico they make their presence clear. While they wait for the gang of between over fifty to over one hundred men, the men prepare the villagers to defend themselves learning how to fight and use weapons. Eventually Calvera does return with a few of his men, and he doesn't seem worried by the presence of the seven men, but he runs away when they manage to shoot down and kill his thugs. The next visit is a heated argument, and more of the gang come rising into town trying to fend themselves, failing miserably to the might of the village and seven men. After the seven men all have their individual things going on, e.g. breakdowns, doubts, loves, the last of the gang come into the village, Calvera is the key victim, and the village and men seem to finally scare the gang away. In the end, Chris, Vin and Chico are the only surviving men from the fight, and they know that the village is safe now, but they ride away feeling like they didn't truly win. The almost all star cast is indeed magnificent, Bryner, McQueen, Coburn and Bronson became much bigger stars after this, and Wallach is good as the slimy villain. The landscapes are great viewing, the action scenes are exciting, but for me, what makes the film is the essential Oscar nominated musical score (and iconic theme tune) by Elmer Bernstein, one of the greatest ever made, a fantastic classic western. Steve McQueen was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 62 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 43 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 8 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 100 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 79 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a fan of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, I thought it was one of the most bloated of all overrated 'masterpieces'. For years I managed to somehow neglect seeing the celebrated Americanized remake starring Hollywood rebels McQueen, Brynner, Bronson and Coburn. Until tonight.What is all the fuss? I actually came away wishing I'd seen Seven Samurai again as it at least had some character development. Often a shot for shot copy of the original, The Magnificent Seven kicks off with that iconic theme music underscoring the credit titles (which is barely heard again with the same bravado for the rest of the picture), shows promise when Eli Wallach's bandidos roust the village, and introduces Brynner and McQueen in a compelling sequence involving a hearse and boot hill.Then it bogs down introducing the remaining 5 mercenaries to the mix and sags for way over an hour where nothing really happens you didn't already see in Kurosawa's epic. Until the final shootout this is really a dull western, though it looks great, shows off some nice locales and , yes, Brynner and McQueen are fairly good. Bronson and Coburn though are merely adequate, Robert Vaughn is a pain to watch over-act, Horst Buchholz was no Toshiro Mifune and is ultimately as forgettable as his filmography suggests, and Eli Wallach comically looks like an unshaven Mickey Rooney in a sombrero. Anyone remember the seventh guy?Notable as one of the first westerns to shake up the genre with fresh attitude after the 50's, but that doesn't save it from being overrated and rather insignificant as an entry in Hollywood's western canon. Recommended to see once, but only for its production values and because it stars Brynner, Bronson, McQueen and Coburn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the Good, Bad, Ugly and The Wild Bunch may be better, and it is inferior to Seven Samurai, this is a high quality western, and one of the few i can stand. The plot is simple, with seven gunslingers hired to protect a village from marauding cowboys, but it leaves room for top class action and we question the justice in what the 'good guys' are doing. The score is one of Bernstein's best, every performance stands out. Brynner and McQueen jostle for screen presence, while the others are happy to show off their skills in the knowledge that they are taking part in a great story. It may lack the visual flare of Kurosawa, most director's do, but the action is terrific and we root for the seven as the final showdown comes. We grow to understand their characters, Chris and Vin as hardened men, no strangers to this kind of work, O'Reilly whose relationship with the town kids fills us with sympathy, Harry and Lee who are not sure whether they want to be there or not, Coburn and his ego, and the youngster Chico. 9 out 10.</fullReview>

It is really hard to come in on the end of a genre and not resort to parody and irony for a new vision (like the Eastwood trilogy which followed).--on the other hand, this is a pale copy of a much better Japanese film.The prancing and posturing here now seems ridiculous, and so much else of the craft of filmmaking is done poorly by modern standards. What makes it work despite this is Elmer Bernstein's score. The music is so classically American that (together with `The Great Escape') we see the making of American stereotypical heros: McQueen, Coburn; Bronson largely through the music.See this for its effect on American culture. For a pure experience go elsewhere, first to `Seven Samuri.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mediocre Seven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-------------SPOILER WARNING ----------------- As a kid I really enjoyed this film, but back in those days I also enjoyed the CHIPS, Knight Rider, The A-Team and the great Buck Rogers so it is safe to say my taste was still in the development phase.Watching it again recently, I must say I was somewhat disappointed by the movie, both in terms of form as in terms of content.Let's start with Form. Here's a few things that really bothered me : 1)Death scenes. Whatever happened to taking a bullet, keeling over and dying ? Maybe it was part of the whole young-bucks-trying-to-outdo-each-other, but why the hopelessly overacted song-and-dance routines by Bronson, Vaughn, Wallace and Coburn ? What were these guys (and the director, I might add) thinking ? Being shot, doing a few twirls and squeezing in a spot of conversation with your adversary, preaching to a couple of kids, throwing the odd knife (at a dodgy looking brick, no less) or (my personal favorite) doing a veritable love scene which practically includes frenching a stone wall !? That's not just stretching credibility, that's outright laughable...2) Stunts. Badly performed and thus very obviously fake scenes once again stretch the credibility of the movie. The worst one is where a farmer strikes at one of the bandits seated on his horse with a scythe.3) Horst Buchholz. Clearly the least convincing actor of the bunch and also the least charismatic. Yet for some reason, he is pretty much the center of this film... Compared to Seven Samurai his character is a blend of two of the most important samurai (the young one and the farmer-turned samurai). Why ? Am I wrong in saying the focus on Chico causes other (much more interesting) characters played by charisma-oozing guys like Coburn, Bronson and McQueen to remain quite one-dimensional ? In my opinion the attention devoted to the development of the other 5 (besides Chico and Chris) was just too small.But these visual flaws pale in comparison to the plot holes, the illogical twists and turns in the Content of the film : 1) Chico infiltrating in the bandido gang. At that point the bandits are NAMING their fallen comrades, which implies they know damn well who is part of their gang and who isn't. Yet Chico (who was shooting at them hours before) can mosey on into their camp in his bandido hat disguise without anyone going "The hell is this guy ?" 2) The farmers betray the gunfighters. The reason why is a bit dodgy to begin with, but what about their reaction to it ? Why would they even bother returning to help the villagers who clearly show they no longer want their help ? What is their MOTIVATION at that point ? Also, why not follow up on punishing the traitor(s) (I believe this Sotero character was the main culprit) who are in fact responsible for the deaths of 4 of their comrades ? 3) Calvera returning the guns, complete with ammo. In the very beginning Calvera explains it's not easy being a bandit chieftain. It seems this type of business venture includes important overhead costs, not in the least the feeding and arming of your bandido employees. So why GIVE AWAY free guns and ammo (to people who tried to kill you) ? Letting them go in order to avoid payback, sure. But why not send them on their way empty-handed or even with their guns minus the ammo.In light of all these points, I experienced The Magnificent Seven not as an important western, but rather as a contrived unconvincing star-vehicle remake of an important Japanese film.And in reference to the previous poster, this movie was shot in Mexico, not in Spain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film could never compare to the original -- Seven Samurai. On it's own, The Magnificent Seven is an underdeveloped, and at times, lazy western. Even macho cool guys like Steve McQueen and Yule Brynner don't light the screen up. Surprisingly, Horst Buchholtz gives the best performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>::Cues up Kurosawa and the Clash::</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I could live in a world where I had seen The Magnificent Seven on its own. I imagine if I had come to this maybe as a kid (it seems like a quintessential "dad" movie or even a "grandad" movie, just sit around on a Sunday afternoon and watch it with dad, but it somehow passed us by) and got into the heroics of Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson (hell, even kids look up to Bronson in this one!) and how James Coburn can sure flip a knife at someone in a lightning fast pinch and that uh Horst Bucholz guy as Chico, the hot-head who really just wants to be part of the gang. It's a tough, manly movie with a convincing and compelling villain (Eli Wallach as Calvera)... and yet I didn't.If you see Seven Samurai first, as I did, then it's practically impossible to not see The Magnificent Seven as being in Kurosawa's shadow. More to the point, it lifts not simply the basic plot but whole scenes and set pieces - Coburn's stand off with the gunslinger as his introduction is the same as the introduction of the samurai who kills the man in the standoff for example, but even down to smaller moments like when Chico has an emotional meltdown it's similar to one that Mifune's character does - and it's a wonder that Kurosawa didn't go after the filmmakers in court; the fact that it's not credited feels even more egregious, if you can imagine it, than Fistful of Dollars with Yojimbo (he did for the latter, apparently, according to IMDb, he was impressed so much he sent the director John Sturges a sword).So is it possible to divorce oneself from the 1954 classic (and it's really one of the great films, an epic in the boldest and most artistically delicate sense of the word) from this? Yes and no. No in that for about the first half of the movie the original loomed really large over many of the introductions and set pieces. It's like, man, could you even deviate just a little? But by the second half the movie finds its own rhythm once the gunslingers come to the farmer's village and the actors shine through more. Indeed the one thing that maybe not quite trumps the Kurosawa original but comes pretty close is having strong personalities in the cast; aside from the stoic leads (who do show some emotion here and there) with Brynner and McQueen, Bronson has a good turn as a surrogate hero-father to a few kids (these kid actors are terrible, by the way, just objectively they're weak kid actors), and Chico gets a lot of the charm and personality.While it seems odd that someone who is a German actor (?) playing a vaguely Mexican gunslinger, he makes him a fascinating character. He's not quite Mifune, he is an outcast due to his race and wanting to be apart of something much greater than being a farmer, which is where he comes from (this last bit is from the original too, but it's made something else here). At first I thought Bucholz was playing him much too broad, like the bar scene when he bursts in and everyone assembled are frozen to their seats as he flails about demanding Brynner to stand up and face him.And at the top of the heap is Wallach. He isn't in much of the film compared to the heroes, but he sure does make his mark. He's a congenial piece of crap bandit, and he makes the villain full of humanity to the point where you almost kind of like him... well, it's hard to like a bully, but he does have that striking sense of not being some cardboard bastard. He has a code and he has a method and strategy. By the end when he (predictably) get his just desserts it comes at a point when he should've won already, and his "why?" to the heroes is this slightly pathetic final moment. I almost felt sorry for him, but only almost. Nevertheless, much like Tuco in Leone's film, he really steals the show.So it's a good movie, at times very good. I wish that it had a little more, how shall I say, some 'umph' to the craft of it all. It's a solid western and has its exciting moments. Nothing about it is exactly *wrong* aside from, you know, in its conception in the script taking wholesale from Kurosawa's film without acknowledgment. But I wish it had really blown me off my seat, aside from delivering a dribble of moral ambiguity at the last minute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We lost. We'll always lose.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's "The Seven Samurai" (which I have never seen) dealt with seven Samurai in old Japan who are hired by the inhabitants of a small village to protect them from bandits. This story was too good for Hollywood (nearly as prone to creative plagiarism in the early sixties as it is today) to resist, so it was remade as "The Magnificent Seven", the tale of seven gunfighters in the Old West hired by the inhabitants of a small Mexican village to protect them from bandits.Rather surprisingly, given the iconic status it holds today, the film was neither a great critical nor a great commercial success when first released in 1960. Its performance at the American box-office was disappointing and it had to rely upon foreign, especially European, receipts to make a profit. The Academy, predictably, ignored it. (Westerns were not their favourite genre at this period). Over the years, however, its status has increased to the point where it is today considered a classic. Part of the reason was a corresponding increase in the status of some of those who acted in it. Yul Brynner was already a big name in 1960, but the likes of Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn and James Coburn were not yet the major stars they were to become later in the decade and in the 1970s.The main reason, however, why the film has come to be held in such high esteem is its high quality. By this I don't just mean the way director John Sturges handles the shoot-outs and other action sequences, although those are pretty good. I am also thinking about the acting and levels of characterisation. The title might suggest that the Seven are just anonymous members of a gang of gunfighters, but in fact each emerges as a fully-formed individual in his own right, with his own reason for wanting to take part in fighting the bandits.The men's motives are not generally mercenary ones; the village is a poor one and the money on offer is not much. Nor, at least initially, are their motives idealistic, although as they get to know the villagers some of the Seven, especially Bronson's Bernardo, come to sympathise with them and befriend them. Most of them are their either because, like McQueen's Vin or Coburn's Britt, they are at a loose end and looking for a challenge or because they have something to prove to themselves. Vaughn's Lee, a man tormented by nightmares, is suffering a crisis of confidence and needs reassurance that he has not lost his nerve. Chico is an inexperienced and hot-headed young man who dreams of making a name for himself as a gunslinger.Although Chico is of Mexican stock, he is played by a German actor, Horst Buchholz. (Not as surprising as it might seem when you consider that Brynner, who here plays an American, was of Russian and Swiss ancestry). Buchholz is perhaps the only one of the Seven who did not go on to become a big-name Hollywood star, although he remained a well- known actor in his native Germany, and why he did not do so has always been something of a mystery to me, given his good looks, his command of English and his acting skills. (He had also given an excellent performance the previous year in another English-language film, the British-made "Tiger Bay"). Perhaps he might have done better had he adopted an easier name for American audiences to pronounce.The other performances which stand out come from Vaughn, McQueen and Brynner, whose calm, emotionless black-clad gunfighter Chris Adams became an iconic figure, and the obvious inspiration for the robotic gunslinger Brynner was later to play in the science-fiction Western "Westworld". There is another good contribution from Eli Wallach as Calvera, the leader of the bandits. Mention should also be made of Elmer Bernstein's excellent musical score; the iconic main theme has become one of the classics of the genre. "The Magnificent Seven" is one of the great character-driven Westerns with something in common with, say, "The Big Country" from a couple of years earlier or the best of the Mann/Stewart Westerns from earlier in the fifties. In some ways it can be seen as looking back to the traditionalist Westerns of the forties and fifties which celebrated the Legend of the Old West; everyone knew who were the good guys and who were the bad guys and when the guys in the white hats were sure to come out on top. In other respects, however, it looks forward to the "revisionist" Westerns of the sixties and seventies which challenged that Legend rather than celebrating it. It avoids the once-customary triumphant ending for something more downbeat. As Chris says at the end:- "Only the farmers won. We lost. We'll always lose." 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Samurai: The Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every and I mean EVERY person of whom I have told about Seven Samurai always said to me that The Magnificent Seven was worth watching. I then decided to find it and take a look. Needless to say, it is inferior.First of all there is a lack of development with some of the 7 characters. In The Seven Samurai that was vey well done, to the point I couldn't believe it when some of the Samurai die. Here I watched it and when they died (which contrary to assumed belief I was expecting them to survive because of the sequels) I really couldn't care less.The only reason I can see anybody wanting to watch this over The Seven Samurai is because it is relatively short (IN COMPARISON).As far as what I liked about it goes, I was expecting basically a butchered Western version of The Seven Samurai. Which is not what you get, The Magnificent Seven has an identity other than hiding behind another identity (if this all makes sense). Like for example I did not expect Calvera to end up taking over the town and sending them away.However if anybody asks me to watch the sequels I will say "no" on the grounds that 3 survive and one goes off and lives a farmer's life. How are they going to continue that Idea, "The Magnificent Duo"? Aside from this is a decently made movie and would recommend to anybody who has seen Kurosawa, so that they can see his influence on cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As it happens, barely short of being magnificent; a fantastic western which zips along whilst keeping an ample eye on boiling tension and forging character details.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The spin on what many might constitute as a more familiarised western narrative framework is, with The Magnificent Seven, given somewhat of an upheaval and has that undeniably fresh feel about it. The crux of John Sturges' wonderful 1960 western revolves around a small, isolated town being liberated from that of an apparent grip local bandits have on it; the tinge to proceedings coming at us with the fact there is not one lone, oft-mysterious lead riding on in to do his stuff, but all of seven handy and dandy folk exuberant; talkative and rather affluent outside of their newfound boundaries arriving to deal with a problem in a town that only happens to rear its head once every so often. Indeed, by the time everything has been said and done and the titular leads are where they are, a more familiar service has been resumed; but it is only to drive proceedings into the final act that this reinstatement occurs, a resuming of a norm. which we do not mind and observe eventually acts as a catalyst to a terrifying finale that neatly rounds events off.We begin with the people of this domestic set up, a small Mexican village, going through their daily routines; simple and honest, they peel vegetables and occupy makeshift huts banded together under the watchful eye of a large church steeple towering over all within, the sense of farming and religion and a general knitted community going some way to establishing their type. What complicates life far more than any therein would like is that of Eli Wallach's Calvera, a red-clad ring leader of a gang of bandits whom ride on in to musical tones of a Comanche ilk so as to periodically invade proceedings and take most of the harvest ? all to the villagers' disdain. Calvera is the natural leader to a group of disparates; fiercely unbalanced in a distinct way, he deems the robbing of these people with the leaving of just enough food for them a sort of good-minded politic which goes hand in hand with a general agreement of town protection. His initial presence at the village, we feel, is a lot more muted than past instances have been of his being there; instances that have built so as to instill enough of both anger and confidence into that of the townsfolk to employ some people to protect them thereon, people whom eventually become the titular seven.The ringleader of this troupé arrives in the form of a certain Chris (Brynner), a man who volunteers himself for a dangerous exercise when we first see him that will place him perilously close to death as he upsets a balance within a town and strives to bury a dead Native American in a cemetery populated only by white folk: something the locals dislike. He is backed up by a certain Vin Tanner (McQueen), and between them, their bravery; skills with weaponry and general sense of upstandingness allows some of those Mexican townsfolk on the hunt for bodyguards to approach him for protection employment. Chris is a man whose been offered "a lot" in his time doing what he does, inferring a sense of expertise within a domain of gunslinging and fighting for whatever cause. Through him, an array of people ranging from Vaughn's curiously well spoken and extravagantly dressed character named Lee; to a wood chopper in that of Bronson's Bernardo; to that of a blade expert of few words named Britt (Coburn) ? a man who's supposedly the best in the land at both the blade and the pistol, so what has anyone got to fear?, come to sign on.Aside from the fact the seven are a refreshingly antithetic bunch of egotistical youngsters; ageing greats and such, Sturges inserts an effective degree of ambiguity into proceedings when it becomes obvious some men are perhaps using such a protection offer to work only in their cash-flow favour, and that the fates of these villagers lies lowly in their priorities. At the village, the film has some fun inferring these guys are well out of the depth; an amusing exchange between two of the eventual seven seeing them highlight the bizarre ideas that the town have in trying to keep a grasp on what the weather might do. From some interesting beginnings is spun a fascinating action-drama as loyalties shift; developments arise and what appeared as a simple enough job for many turns into an eyesore of a quandary inflicting moral dilemmas onto each of these men as they come to face what they face.Where the film is effectively that of the Mexican's and their plight into apparent extinction at the hands of the seedy Calvera, the film, depressingly so, but depressingly so at the wish of the Mexican censors, plasters them each in blank and anonymous white inferring blandness - particularly evident when stood up against the far more rounded; more humane and, in terms of star power, far more recognisable 'seven' whom go on to drive a film which essentially starts out as that of the farmer's and their struggles. The film has a real eye for capturing the impending disaster of conflict or warfare; Calvera and his men seemingly taking an age to troop from one place to another as spotters consisting of village kids furiously try to communicate with one another from afar by merely waving thus attempting to get the message back that trouble is on its way, the likes of which culminate with one of several instances highlighting a wondrous screenplay when respective sides verbally clash. The film is a taut and well made western; never once bogged down by its vast array of central characters and seamlessly weaves in the plight and shifting views of that of the villagers, whose own priorities and ability to function as a respective unit are corrupted by developments, in what is a gloriously involving feature.</fullReview>

Bernardo befriended three(3) young Mexican boys who seemed to follow him wherever he seemed to turn up. Robert Vaughn,(Lee),"Motel Blue",'99, was a gun fighter who started to turn into a frighten man, because of all the horrible killings. Last but not least was James Coburn,(Britt),"Deadfall",'93 who also revealed the stories of his past. Eli Wallach, "Two Much",'95 was really the great star in my opinion, and played the tricky or foxy bandit who was after these Seven Men and did a great job of keeping them all on their toes. Great film to be enjoyed for many years into the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cow Boys, guns, showdown and the lifestyle of the old west are strange to people of Eastern world. Yet, western movies are the favourite pastime for many like me. The extraordinary skills of the cow boys in handling fire arms, their dress and style, horse riding and gunfighting in amazing locations always thrill us. ' We think you are the man we can trust' ? not only the innocent villagers but also the viewers think of the great actor Yul Brynner. In the very first scene we are impressed by a fighter for justice. The inherent leadership qualities of Yul Brynner add to his acting skills. All the characters in the movie simply obey this born leader. He is a perfect specimen for a real leader. His eyes are so powerful that no one could even look at. I have seen this movie for the first time in 1962 in India. Oh my God ! How many times in how many places I have seen this movie later. Now I have my own DVD and that gives me a feeling that all those magnificent heroes are always with me at home. Simple story, true to life characters, excellent music and brilliant direction have made this movie an unforgettable one. The beginning of friendship between Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen when they join hands for a noble cause and their sustained team spirit even in risky situations strengthen the scenario. The villain Eli Wallach is the perfect opponent for Yul Brynner. He lives not acts, an arrogant, crooked, ruthless and a clever villain every one is scared of. The way he justifies his unlawful life style is quite different. When he comes to know that his Privileges are refused in the village protected by unexpected gunmen, his inimitable expressions frighten everyone. The building up of the seven men team, each member a champion gunslinger is an exciting outset. The knife thrower James Coburn, woodcutter Charles Bronson and all the other team members enter with a distinct and interesting introduction and prove that they are really magnificent. The performance of Vladimir Sokoloff, the wise old peasant is outstanding. His facial expressions in response to the amusive lecture by Horst Bucholz is superb. Each time I view this movie, I wait for this particular scene to pay special attention and admire his acting skills. It is hard to believe that this is the first movie for Horst Bucholz. With a highly suitable character, he wins the hearts of all the viewers just like that. It is interesting to learn that, clapping hands as fast as one can is a brilliant technique to assess how fast a fast gunner is. Not only the innocent villagers in the movie but also the vower's are happy at the end for having seen a good movie in all aspects. It is a great success for Director John Sturges and his unit for making a movie to remain a favourite for many movie lovers even after 45 years even in far off countries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite western film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this one ever since I was a nine year old kid and it still amazes me how cool it is. This one was a big deal when it came out and it's a big deal even now. There were 8 big names here (including Eli Wallach of course) and they make it a viewing experience you don't ever want to forget. The musical score is beyond awesome and adds a lot to the film. I will always remember Eli Wallach riding up on his black horse and me thinking the whole time "He must be the most evil man who ever lived!" and I am sure he wasn't in real life but he sure had you convinced which was quite a testament to his acting ability. The story: A fearsome Mexican bandit Culvera (Wallach) and his forty thieves are terrorizing a small Mexican village on the border and therefore the villagers decide to go to Texas and get help to drive them off. They find Cris (Brynner) who recruits six other gunman who for different reasons of their own are willing to be paid to fight the bandits. The seven gunfighters are in for more than they bargain for though as some of the villagers are not willing to finish the job and the bandit chief Culvera proves to be devilishly clever. Like the Alamo, they find themselves outnumbered and surrounded in a battle to the death. The final scene between Culvera and Cris is the greatest part of the whole show where the tables have been turned and Culvera asks him, "Why?" "A man like you, for a place like this?" "Why!" There is as much drama in this western as in a drama and it is used to good effect. Brynner is fantastic and so is Steve McQueen as his right hand man and good friend Vin. Based on the Japanese movie "The Seven Samurai" it is both a cinematic feat and a classic treasure.</fullReview>

The story at its core is one of men who go to protect others, each for their own personal reasons.The music score is instantly recognizable (though possibly not to the younger viewers) and is one who's opening music and theme can send chills of excitement similar the themes from Star Wars.This movie is one of the great classic Western movies. Watch it and enjoy. However, also watch the movie that it was based on--Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samarai, another wonderful movie that is probably even better than the Magnificent Seven.Watch the DVD extras.

		<shortDescription>A classic which changed the idea of 'westerns'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When all the umming and arring is done, when everyone has finished trying to compare with 'Shichinin no Samurai' and trying to draw conclusions with this film being a mere remake of the Japanese film, when everyone has given up trying to convince themselves of a cowboy imitation of a medieval nipponese story, we might just get down to good old common sense and start calling a spade a spade instead of trying to give it some other name, which either would not fit or would be a euphemism. However much one might insist on Sturges having copied a Japanese story, it should be taken into account whether Sturges was even conscious of the Japanese story before he started, and if he was, he only used the story to build his own transferred to the wild west.How many other films have done the same or similar adaptations from one film to another? Or from a book to a film. In one case, for example, Tom Cruise made his version of Amenábar's film while the original was still on at most cinemas: but comparing one with the other is a complete waste of time and only suitable for short-sighted misoginists.'The Magnificent Seven' goes down in history as one of the greatest films of its genre, precisely because it veered away from the unintellectual aspect of goodies against baddies or simply white Americans slaughtering redskins. However famous John Wayne might be, few - if any - of his films with or without the supposedly proverbial John Ford, clambered out of the mire of rather limited horizons. I mean, once you have seen Big John galloping across Wyoming at full tilt, Winchester blazing from the hips, apart from whichever platinum blonde he may be dangling from the other wrist, once you have seen one you have seen them all. I feel uninspired.'The Magnificent Seven' sought to improve story-line, getting a good bit of moral thinking in to measure, with some rather good performances from a cowardly Robert Vaughn to a young and daring and romantic Horst Buchholz (who died a few days ago in Berlin). From Yul Brynner through the rest of the main actors, the different personalities and characterizations burst across the screen; the secondary actors - mostly Mexican peasants or 'bandidos' - are equally as good.Despite being somewhat dated this film deserves to be considered a classic of the genre - but do not bother with 'The Return of the Seven' made three years later. As often happens with an original product, their sequels are rather floppy to say the least, frequently trashy, and rarely come up to the work responsible in the first place.'The Magnificent Seven' belongs to that exclusive club of westerns which include Sergio Leone's 'spaghetti westerns' shot in Spain,'Dances With Wolves' (qv) and 'Jeremiah Johnson' (qv) among very few others. And however much you might wish to knock this film, it is about as ineffectual as trying to make the Great Wall of China disintegrate banging your knuckles against it.I have just seen this film again, and enjoyed it as much as the first time 40 years ago, and the other two or three times in between: you cannot do that with other mere 'westerns'. And I assure you I could not do the same with the Japanese film from which it is too often said this film is taken.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Wonderful western that just happens to be a remake of Akira Kurosowa's incredible Seven Samurai. While I won't attempt to compare the merits of these two films here it is quite incredible to see how closely this film follows it predecessor.Simply summarized we have a small Mexican town plagued regularly by bandits who decide they need protection. That protection arrives in the form of seven disparate men all gunslingers each here for his own reasons.One of the highlights of the film is its stellar cast, there are certainly better actors out there but this group including some great characters and this group several great icons. In Steve McQueen, Yul Brynner, James Coburn, and Charles Bronson you get a group of actors that for different reasons seem to effortlessly exude cool. I almost added Robert Vaughn to this list but while his performance is fine it doesn't seem quite as effortless.The film also features the very talented Eli Wallach who virtually disappears into his role as the leader of the bandits.The other highlight of the film is the remarkable score by Elmer Bernstein which was nominated for an Oscar.Director John Sturges would follow this picture up 5 years later with another great ensemble picture The Great Escape. This cast would also include Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn. The action scenes while possibly tame by todays standards are still remarkable and a testament to one of Sturges strengths as a director.While the movie was itself a remake it would spawn 3 sequels of its own (all of which were considerably inferior) and a TV Series. Also the robotic gunslinger from both Futureworld and Westworld played by Yul Brynner was a very obvious tribute to this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can tell a real classic because the story and the characters don't get dated, no matter how many years go by. Indeed, a fresh viewing will certainly have peace activists arguing how the Mexican villagers would have been better off just giving Calvera most of the damn harvest. Neo-cons, on the other hand, will delightedly observe how a well-intentioned American incursion brought liberty to an oppressed part of the world. And die-hard foes of NAFTA can point out how seven highly-paid gunfighters wind up working under dangerous, in fact lethal, conditions for a measly 20 dollars apiece when forced to seek employment in Mexico. But seriously, folks... Like the classic that inspired it (as acknowledged prominently in the opening credits), Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, this film grips us for the same reason that Casablanca does. It is about men discovering that there are causes more important than themselves. And, as with many classic westerns, it is about violent men who do not know quite what to do in a world that seems to be getting increasingly civilized. Directed by John Sturges, this movie was an instant member of America's pop culture mythic pantheon. In fact, there is something so darned American about the film that, on first viewing, we didn't even care if a couple of the cowboy heroes (Russian-born Yul Brynner and the German Horst Buchholz) had strangely European accents. And what a line-up of adventure movie icons that joined them: Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn. Sadly, they are all gone, save Robert Vaughn, who played the gunslinger who lost his nerve but then found it in the end. But nearly as important as any of the actors was Elmer Bernstein's immortal score. Just hum it to yourself and try not to feel stirred.</fullReview>

Here, John Sturges did the almost unthinkable: he remade a classic into another classic.The story is fairly simple as Mexican villagers hire seven gunslingers to help them protect their village from a group of bandits who've preyed upon them for years. However, within this simple framework is a character-driven story that examines the supposed glory of the wild west.One of the most important elements of this film is the cast. Yul Brynner was the certified star at the time of the film's release but the supporting cast is awe-inspiring: Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Eli Wallach and Robert Vaughn, to name only the most recognizable.Luckily for these fine actors, they had a crackerjack script to work with. There are several memorable lines and, amazingly, even with seven characters, the script doesn't scrimp on character development.The direction by John Sturges may not be especially noteworthy but it is nonetheless well-handled. The real star on the technical side is the legendary score by Elmer Bernstein. It is not hyperbole when I state that it is one of the half-dozen best film scores of all time.Other films may showcase greater artistry or may be more profound but to me there are very few films that are this enjoyable. The bottom line is that this film is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magnificent Seven on Reel 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN was a watershed film in my childhood ? such a sense of heroism and decency propagated throughout. However, watching it again on Reel 13, I was reminded of something that I always knew, but didn't want to admit ? while Mag 7 is good, it's not that good.The key problem is in adapting Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI, the transition from feudal Japan to 1800's Mexico is awkward. The premise of 7 mercenary gunmen coming to rescue a Mexican village from bandits for a measly sum is hard to swallow. You get the sense that screenwriter William Roberts had a sense of this. He works hard to give each of the seven their individual reasons for going, but it's a stretch. Additionally, Kurosawa used 4 hours to tell his story. By cutting that in half, Roberts and director John Sturges sacrifice a great deal of character development time that they really could have used.Another big detractor is Horst Bucholz as Chico. He's an overacting nuisance, which is a shame because it's such a pivotal role in the original. Thankfully, the rest of the cast is strong. Yul Brynner is unusually understated as the leader. The more I see Steve McQueen, the more I appreciate his charisma and vulnerable masculinity. James Coburn probably only gets to speak 12 lines in the whole film, but each one is a gem ("I was aiming for the horse"). Charles Bronson is also effective with a cute storyline where he is adopted by some village kids. What's most memorable about MAG 7 is the action. It's really a triumph of editing. If you look closely, you'll notice that in those sequences, each of the seven are in different places around the town. They were probably shot in several different locations far apart on several different days. The thought of keeping it all straight makes my head swim, but Sturges manages to do just that. The angles he chooses, the juxtaposition of appropriate images with one another and the breakneck pace all combine to almost miraculously make the scenes work.(For more information on this or any other Reel 13 film, visit their website at wew.reel13.org)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why remakes can be as good as sequels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing always amazes me when it comes to lists rating the best films of all time - why does 'The Seven Samuri' always make it into the top ten but 'The Magnificent Seven' doesn't even make the top 250. To say that this film isn't at least as good is ridiculous. Sure - it's a copy of an original story but why has that ever been an issue before? 'The Godfather' is based on a book - as are many great films - so why should a remake be less worthy than a film version of a novel. When Akira Kurusawa made 'The Seven Samuri' he based it on his love of the 'Western' genre. So a Western based on a film designed to emulate a classic western is a no-brainer.In my opinion, 'The Magnificent Seven' is at least as good, if not better, than 'The Seven Samuri'. For a start, the pacing is better, the characters are better defined, the line between good and bad is less clear and (and why should this not be taken into consideration) the production values are better. But for me it's the character study aspects that are far better in 'The Magnificent Seven'. Each individual character, large and small, in this film is perfectly defined - not just the Samuri / Gunslingers but the bandits and the villagers too.They say that hindsight is a wonderful thing. In this case I'd more than agree. 'The Magnificent Seven' takes what 'The Seven Samuri' presented, transfers it to (and let's be honest here) it's originally intended setting and makes each individual character stand out far more prominently than it's Japanese counterpart.That there's effectively a 10% difference between the two films in ranking IMDb terms is almost a crime. "Yojimbo" is ten times the film that "For a fist full of dollars" is - but in this case (for once) the American remake is the superior film. Let's not be pretentious when it comes to ranking a 'foreign' film against a 'domestic' version. You CAN improve on greatness - here's the cinematic proof.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brynner Beats Wayne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that means nostalgia to me. On Danish television 15-16 years ago they would show old American classics among which The Magnificent Seven was one. It aired quite a few times after wards and my Dad and I would watch it on Saturday afternoon with our legs up on either couch...well I would watch it, my Dad would usually nod off after twenty minutes. That's why this movie, to me, is epitome of nostalgia. It is in my humble opinion that this is about as good a western as they come. I haven't seen the original movie "Seven Samurai" and I don't think it really matters.This is just a "magnificent" movie in it is own right. The all-star cast and the FANTASITIC score by Elmer Berstein lifts this movie up and beyond any other western ever made. I have never been a fan of the butch-chauvinistic-patriotic westerns starring John Wayne, as they are too much caricatures where the characters in this one come of as REAL people.The great, although sparse, dialog between the gunslingers set up the feel of the characters and their background. The whole conversation during dinner where the six experienced fighters try to tell the newbie that their lives really suck and that they NEVER can win, is just pure brilliance and completely unheard of until then.I can only regret that this classic movie was turned into a franchise with very poor sequels, and I can only wonder why Brynner agreed to do no 2, and George Kennedy as Chris in the following two is just not believable. Brynner, McQuen and Bronson in the "original" are really the driving forces of the group and Bronson's talent for under-acting is bone chillingly great. I especially like the scene with the celebration in the town square: Eli Wallach and his men are approaching and the seven have to get ready for their first showdown. Brynner gets up from his chair, walks over to Bronson and without any conversation he knows what to do. His face and body language says it all. All in all this is a must-see movie no matter if you like western or not. It is so much more than just a western, it is a character study of people living on the edge of life and how they cope with the fact that no one cares if they live or not.HAVE to see it....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Western Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first western that I can remember seeing as a child, and later I found out that it was based on Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai". I saw the Seven Samurai much after I saw this movie and again recently which got my interest to see this movie again. The thing that struck me the most was how much of old innocence this movie has with good guys clearly depicted as heroes, and bad guys are - well bad guys. There are no complicated character back ground, just pretty cool guys fighting for the oppressed. The other thing that struck me was how young Steve McQueen, and James Coburn looks in this movie, and other five guys are also very different types of hero actors from today. This is probably the first of big westerns that marked the '60s. Everything about the '60s was big, and the Magnificent Seven lead the way for other big western movies that followed. It also set the careers of few actors in this movie. I like this movie for what it is: A good western. Things were simpler back then, and the movie serves as a touch stone to that time. Kurosawa's Seven Samurai had more believability to it than this movie, and asides from it's cinematography, would still stand up as a contemporary movie, but Magnificent Seven if it was made today, the believability would be far less than the Kurosawa's original. This is probably Chris is no longer a type of hero we see as real today as opposed to Kambei character in the Seven Samurai can be found among us today. So this film to me is not aging very well, but still to me, when I think of classic western movie, I think of this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spectacular Western...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a magnificent film this is, with plenty of star power, great directing, a beautiful backdrop of cinematography, and writing that matches the wit and skill of the bard himself. This is an American translation of the Akira Kurosawa film Seven Samurai, and boy does the feudal Japanese tale translate well into a Western film. John Sturges replaces the wandering samurai with hardened gunmen of the West, and the Japanese villagers (of the same nationality of their hired warriors) with peasant farmers across the border in Mexico. What's interesting about this is that no longer are the gunmen (samurai) fighting for their own people, but for the safety of others. These are totally detached men, isolated from the world, who for their own reasons decide to come to the aid of strangers, for a pittance fee, to liberate them from the harsh reign of a bandit king named Calvera, and his forty men. There's wise old Chris (Yul Brennar), maverick Vin (Steve McQueen) hard luck Bernardo (Charles Bronson) slick Britt, gambler Harry (Brad Dexter) the haunted fast gun Lee (Robert Vaughn) and the brash kid Chico (Horst Buchholz). What's amazing is the chemistry on film with these stars. When viewing the back-story footage, and seeing the clicke's that were formed during the filming, it's truly amazing to see none of the animosity some of these stars had for one another, each trying to upstage the other. Most notably of the feuds was McQueen and Brennar. This is a credit of the direction of Sturges that he managed to keep the production together, and more amazingly produce a Western Masterpiece. Each Character is given their own silhouette in which to shine. Sharp dialogue, and interesting back-stories help the flow of the film, turning it from another western shoot em up into a true work of art. Chris is hardened and wise but not jaded by his life of gun toting. He keeps his humanity by reaching out to the defenseless and aiding when he can. Vin is a recluse, always down on his luck looking for the next big thing. An admitted degenerate, he accepts his life for what it is. Britt is a silent killer, but not remorseless. Bernardo is just looking for peace, but can never seem to find it. There's always an excuse to pull him back into the game of hired gun. Harry is a happy go lucky guy, not tied to gunning out of necessity, but rather out of desire to find that one big score to set him up for life. Lee is a tormented man, haunted by the number of bodies he's seen fallen in his life, mostly at his own hands. He senses that his considerable skills are diminishing, and fears death greatly. We can see that he choose a profession to defy death itself, to make a stand against mortality, but all he's really reaped from the life is horrific nightmares and constant fear. Finally we see Chico, he's like our eyes on the scene. He's a neophyte, someone at a crossroads of life. His choice, to become a gunman or farmer. Two more juxtaposed professions you'll not find. It's through victory and defeat that we learn the meaning of sacrifice, humanity, and the basic truths of life. There's some great dialogue at the end of the film by the sage of the village, "Only the farmers have won. They remain forever. They are like the land itself. You helped rid them of Calvera, the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts. You're like the wind - blowing over the land and... passing on. Vaya con dios." As they leave the village Chris says to Vin "The old man was right. Only the farmers won. We lost. We always lose." True, that violence begets violence, and only faith, hard work, and communal sense of charity pays off in the end. No matter how many villages Tucco or his kind rob, they'll never be sated, no matter how many men Lee or Britt kill, they'll never be the best, they'll never be satisfied that they're the deadliest with gun or knife, or the fastest. There will never be a shortage of men coming after them to prove themselves. Only the farmer is content to reap what his own hands sow, and provide for himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A woman's opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been my favorite movie since I was a little girl. Funny thing is that I am not really a big fan of westerns. The many reviews on this site for this movie keep comparing it to Seven Samurai. You cannot compare the two! I will readily admit that I never saw Seven Samurai all the way through -- I got bored after an hour. It is over three hours long! Now, before you go accusing me of having the typical American attention span, let me tell you I have watched the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy all the way through (and the Extended Versions, not the theatrical releases). I can watch long movies if they interest me. I have seen other Kurosawa works and love many foreign films so I have nothing against long movies with subtitles. But there is something magical about the Magnificent Seven. I estimate I have seen it more than 30 times and I never get tired of it. The incredible cast and the fine script combine to make these "gunslingers" seem like real people, not the cardboard cutouts of other westerns. So, if you are a woman and not sure if you would like this movie, please let me encourage you to give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Points To Ponder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First-rate film, it easily makes my list of the Top 10 westerns. Here are a few points to ponder:"The Magnificent Seven's" score by Elmer Bernstein received a 1960 Oscar nomination but the award that year went to "Exodus"; which "featured" something called "The Exodus Song" (with lyrics by Pat Boone!!). 45+ years later there is not even a CD release of "Exodus" while the score from "The Magnificent Seven" is one of the most recognized pieces of music ever written. If anyone needs proof of the staggering lameness of academy voting this is the most obvious of countless examples.The score was further popularized in the late 1960's as the theme for Marlboro cigarettes. An odd bit of irony given that Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, and Jorge Martinez de Hoyos all died of lung cancer; Horst Buchholz and Charles Bronson of pneumonia, and Brad Dexter of emphysema.In the film, only two (Brynner and McQueen) of the seven leave the village alive (Buchholz survives but stays behind). In real life these two actors were the first to die, preceding the others by about 20 years. The other four deaths (only Robert Vaughn is still alive) occurred over just a nine-month period (James Coburn in Nov 02, Brad Dexter in Dec 02, Horst Buchholz in March 03, and Charles Bronson in Aug 03).Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Magnificent Seven" is an unusually thoughtful Western. Many moments exist simply to give us some insights into the characters, and all these quiet moments ring true. The cast, as everyone else has said, is suberb, with McQueen (he is a lovable anti-hero) and Bronson standing out. The final showdown is well-directed and admirably realistic: sometimes the "heroes" get shot and die, something that the producers probably wouldn't allow if the film was remade today. The picture is somewhat longish (its only weakness), but, most of the time, great fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen my fair share of bizarre moralizing from (left-wing) Hollywood flicks so I should be used to the nonsense by now, but this one has even me shaking my head in bewilderment. It's not left-wing, nor is it right-wing. It's confused-wing.Let's just ignore the utter absurdity of a band of unscrupulous Mexican outlaws/rapists actually SPARING the lives of 7 gunmen hired to kill them, even returning them their weapons upon releasing them! Let's just forget that utter nonsense ? for this is 60s Hollywood western-movie cheese ? and focus instead on the extremely dubious decision of the Non-Magnificent 7 to go BACK to the village of spineless cowards who betrayed them, and to "reward" their highly generous former captors by slaying every last one of them in a sneak-attack worthy of the most psychotic gang of thugs. Does this weird anti-morality play make sense to anyone out there? If I'd written the finale, I'd have given the Semi-Competent Immoral 7 some TRUE magnificence but having them return to the village to slay the Mexican farmers who betrayed them ? not the bloody gang who showed real mercy (and stupidity) by releasing them.I AM a fan of bad movies (though TM7 is hardly a bad film despite its childish premise), but I am not laughing, yet somehow I think I should be. Not exactly "Plan 9", but the absurdity of what transpires in the last quarter of this flick astounds me. If someone spares your life ? despite the fact that he knew you were out to kill him ? you simply don't go back and sneakily attack and obliterate him into non-existence. (Well, you do if you're an immoral bastard.) What a bizarre message to send to the kiddies, especially in light of the continual barrage of moralizing that pervades the entire movie, much of it aimed directly at nose-picking adolescents. Most characters are constantly spewing wise, giving short moral speeches, or dishing out sort-of Ghandi-like prose, and yet here we have 7 "Magnificent" Douchebags who display their gratitude toward Wallach for sparing their lives by killing him and his entire gang. Wow. Am I the only one who noticed this travesty of logic and morals? I did laugh though when Buchholz managed to infiltrate himself briefly into the Mexican gang ? despite the fact that his Spanish (if indeed anyone speaks Spanish in this Hollywood version of Mexico) must have been heavily tainted with an instantly recognizable gringo accent, not to mention the fact that he looks decidedly un-Mexican. Last but not least, this Mexican gang numbered only 40 ? not 8,000 ? hence for none of these banditos to realize that he's an impostor is too outrageous, even for a cheesy fairy-tale western. Even Ed Wood might have at least attempted (badly, admittedly) to justify the ease with which Horsty succeeds in his suicidal spying mission. Still, the first half of the film is quite fun, if not exactly spellbinding. The cast of Wallach/Brynner/McQueen/Coburn/Bronson should have been used with much more gusto though. This somehow legendary western pales in comparison to the best ones such as "The Wild Bunch" and "High Plains Drifter". Should've been better.I get a feeling that most viewers are too blinded by the catchy main theme and the cast of movie greats to notice how essentially average this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable typical American western, nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of the original, i was really looking forward to watch that film, though i wasn't expecting too much from it, i just wanted to see how the adaptation of the epic by Akira Kurosawa turned to be in an American Western film. It's not at all that bad actually, though it couldn't kept some things that made of Shishinin no Samurai a great and possibly one of the best films ever made, one of that things would be the fantastic ending and the rich and involving character development, both aspects that can be easily noticeable for those who watched both films.For the standards of the American Westerns, this can be considered a good effort, but as a remake, it's disappointing and distorts a lot of things from the original. I don't want to spoil the original here, but i guarantee that it has much more details and is an infinitely times richest and involving film. You really care about the characters, because each one has a distinct and powerful personality, and you can easily follow each one. The acting was also way too underwhelming, it seems that the characters of this film were all apathetic and slow, it was weird. I couldn't care less about these emotionless characters. Of course, the only exception was_ironically_ the villain, portrayed by the excellent Eli Wallach. He did the only character that i felt interested in, unfortunately he don't has that much of a screen time. Still, he is much more of an active character than all the others in that film. It in fact, ends to be an almost antithesis of Shishinin no Samurai, and if you watch it you'll understand why.The soundtrack was also totally off-put in this film. The score would work well if Magnificent Seven was a kid or family film, but it isn't. It's a western, so the so acclaimed score just sounds ridiculous in it. The cinematography was good though,there is an excellent use of the scenarios. It also has some perspective games, like in the scene where the Mexicans were sending signs to each other in the top of the cliff and also in the top of the church. This 'advanced' techniques are hardly found in the westerns of that age.In the end of the day, Magnificent Seven is an enjoyable western, but is way too generic and easily forgettable. 6.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a redo of The Seven Samurai, a 1954 excellent movie about a town that is constantly invaded by a marauding band of evil men. Although the cast of actors is exceptional and deserves 9 stars, the movie script deserves less than 6 stars. The very first problem is that every Mexican speaks proper English with a full vocabulary. That raises disbelief immediately.Another big problem are the gun fights where gun fighters often stand in the open rather than take cover which is a human instinct. This also raises disbelief. And, I don't understand, not only in this movie, but many movies, why survivors in gun battles do not take guns from dead victims and use them to their advantage.There are a few other poor script decisions, but that would produce spoilers.The acting by the magnificent seven, though, gives life to the movie.Watch Samurai Seven first, which is very believable.

		<fullReview>The problem for "The Magnificent Seven" is that it is too often compared with Akira Kurosawa's "Shichinin No Samurai"(Seven Samurai), when it should just be viewed as a normal movie, not a remake of "Shichinin No Samurai". The difference's between "The Magnificent Seven" and "Shichinin No Samurai" are endless. Just a few are: "Shichinin No Samurai" is a action, adventure, drama, wheres "The Magnificent Seven" is a western, "Shichinin No Samurai" is black and white, "The Magnificent Seven" is in colour, one is set in Japan, the other is set in America. Despite me saying that "The Magnificent Seven" is too often compared with "Shichinin No Samurai", it dose not mean it is a perfect film. Far from it, "The Magnificent Seven" is not a perfect movie. When you look at other westerns by, say Sergio Leone, you realise that "The Magnificent Seven" is not very gritty, or realistic. But what it dose have is performances. Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen are effortlessly cool, and Eli Wallach as always, is great.Not the greatest western, but very enjoyable.</fullReview>

Though his name wasn't exactly marquee-ready, his matinée idol looks (he sort of favors Warren Beatty) and easy screen charisma should've made him a star.As for the film, it owes much of its reputation to it's amazing star power and iconic score.

		<fullReview>The above named film has a magnificent score by Elmer Bernstein. We heard such a fine score in a western 2 years before in a much better western film, "The Big Country." The film has beautiful cinematography. As far as I'm concerned that's it.Yul Brynner tries to give orders in the same way that he did as Ramses in "The Ten Commandments." The picture has a rather simple plot-organizing 7 guys to fight off desperadoes who are making life miserable in a local Mexican village. Wouldn't it have been great if the male cast in that great epic film had been part of the group aiding the people?Robert Vaughn, one of the 7, must have thought that he was back in "The Young Philadelphians" in the crazy way that he acted during a bad dream sequence.The film is getting the villagers ready to fight for themselves with the 7's assistance. It is a story of pride and doing what's right. The problem is that we've seen this so often that the characters are hackneyed.There is no question that Eli Wallach steals the film with a fine performance as the head of the Mexican bandits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this film is like a Stallone moive before its time. Action packed, with a huge gun fight conclusion. Better than the Wild Bunch, but this film ages poorly. Not a classic Western, but a TBS late night movie. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not A Magnificent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood doesn't have a very good record record at re-making classic movies . Compare GET CARTER , JUST VISITING , THE Italian JOB , THE JACKAL etc etc to see how they fail . With a classic movie like SHICHIN IN NO SAMUARI made in 1954 and currently at number 5 in the IMDb top 250 list Hollywood might have made a blunder but thankfully American movie makers in 1960 weren't influenced by MTV in those days so we don't have a pop music hit every ten minutes and Elmer Bernstein's score is certainly memorable!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!!My major problem is that a Japanese epic has been switched to a western setting and I'm not keen on westerns . Worse still we're treated to all the Hollywood clichés like your life depending on how fast you can draw your gun . In reality most gunfighters died with a bullet in their back , a fare they more often than not inflicted upon their victims . We're treated to a ridiculous scene early in the movie with Chris and Vin riding shotgun to a cemetery where a bunch of rednecks tell them to go back to town . The rednecks aim their guns and Chris and Vin wound the rednecks . Yeah like this happened all the time . It should be pointed out that while the original was an epic this re-make tries to be epic in length which makes the movie overlong which should be classed as a failure on the part of the producers . I will give THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN some credit and that is that it isn't afraid to kill off some of its heroes . I won't go into details but there's a coupe of Hollywood re-makes made in the last few years where the hero is killed in the original but for some reason the producers of the Hollywood version deem that they should survive in the American version , so I give THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN some faint praise for not doing that here</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's quite good. But if it were released today it wouldn't be as received well. And I can prove it... next year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With them remaking this remake next year, might as well review this movie. Why not?tl;dr: It's pretty good, but don't just because it's old doesn't make it better.This movie goes to show that Hollywood's always been about avoiding originality. This is one of those yankification movies, taking a foreign movie that was in a foreign language, and bringing it home, like the granddad of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Only, unlike new yankifications, The Magnificent Seven set it in a new location. Cowboy's instead of Samurai's.The characters are pretty nice, I liked Kyrton from Red Dwarf's dad in this (that's what he looks like). And I liked a couple of the other cowboy's. The story was well told but lacked good characters, the final fight was good. And the music is bloody amazing. Especially the villain piece. It's one of the best things about the movie.I went on about this movie's age quite a bit, and there's a good reason for it. It came out in 1960. It's kid friendly. It's got a lot of charm to it. I can see why people would see past the faults in the character department. I wish we could see more of the villain's story here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has Some Fun Sequences But Is Overall A Bit Dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a young film fan who is more into modern day cinema than 50's or 60's films, I will say that it is sometimes tough for me to enjoy a film like this. It's not that I can't enjoy films from this era, but I just prefer movies from the 70's and onward a lot more. I guess this is why I didn't find The Magnificent Seven to be that good.The cast here is pretty good, I must say. I especially enjoyed Charles Bronson, because he just seemed so damn cool. But I think the biggest let down is the chemistry between the characters. Although it wasn't the best, we do see some character development to at least give us an idea of who they are, but I never really felt them come together as a crew, which is a big let down.There's probably 3 sequences I liked in this film. The funeral scene, the first shootout, and the final shootout. I felt like a lot of the rest of it was just slow dialogue that never really builds to anything. I feel like that is something that a lot of these old films do that I don't like. They have a lot of dialogue that I just don't feel adds anything, and is simply exposition or useless. I'm glad that screenplay writing has evolved over time to fix this.Overall, I can see why some people might have some nostalgia about this for whatever reason, but as a newcomer to the film, I was pretty let down. It needed more focus on the crew as a team to keep me engaged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Long Way's Off From Magnificent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1960's The Magnificent Seven is considered to be one of the great Westerns. Obviously it has inspired numerous sequels and remakes, and its influence in film and American culture is undeniably great. But taken on its own merits, is there anything truly magnificent about The Magnificent Seven? By all standards, it's competently made, but it surprisingly lacks in two key areas: character development and exciting action sequences.The Magnificent Seven (itself a Western remake of the 1954 film, Seven Samurai) is about a team of seven Americans that are hired to defend a small Mexican town from bandits, who have repeatedly returned to pillage the town over the years. The seven Americans quickly realize they are outnumbered, so they must also train the town to fight.As previously mentioned, there are two major problems with The Magnificent Seven. The first of which is character development. The film has seven primary characters, and while some are faithfully developed (primarily Chico, a hot-headed youngster), most of the other characters are given little defining traits or dimensions. I would argue that only two or three of the seven protagonists are given personalities with any kind of depth. The other four are given a single notable feature (one is on the run, one is good with a knife) to support their presence. If nothing else, the villain, Calvera, is entertaining to watch, even if he is drawn equally thin.The other big problem is the ineffectiveness of the action sequences. They fail to raise one's pulse, and though the finale does seem to have genuine stakes (and actually follows through on its risks), it lacks any element of fun. Given the serious circumstances, one could forgive the lack of joy involved, but there is little tension or even thrill to compensate for this.There are a small number of other issues as well. After the first 80 minutes of the film, The Magnificent Seven begins to drag, and it never really picks back up. As a result, the last 45 minutes seem incredibly long. Also, an unnecessary love story has been shoe-horned in, but isn't developed at all, and finds itself swaying closer to comedy than touching poignancy. While not without memorable moments, there is little of outstanding notability in The Magnificent Seven, excepting its massive legacy. It takes surprising risks with an ending that's more somber and less triumphant than most modern Hollywood endings, and though the characters themselves are lacking in identification, the performances are great.Many of the poorly written characters are saved by strong performances. Admittedly, some do fall prey to melodrama, but they still hold up reasonably well. The standout performance belongs to Horst Buchholz who makes the most of an annoying character, and incidentally, the one that's the most developed. Yul Brynner, who portrays Chris Adams (arguably the leader of the seven) is an intimidating screen presence, despite the fact that he plays a protagonist. The same could be said of James Coburn. The villain portrayed by Eli Wallach is enjoyable to watch, and is certainly the most entertaining cast member.Elmer Bernstein's score is easily the most magnificent element of the film. The main theme is proudly performed in the opening titles (perhaps the best part of the film) and is given several reprises throughout the film. The Mexican influence seeps into the score, allowing for a bit of color in the form of guitar and castanets. The only real problem with the music is the absurd overuse of one particular guitar chord is played on its own at least a dozen times (or more) throughout the film. It's a tad distracting, but it is only a small blemish on an otherwise, highly entertaining score.The Magnificent Seven is a perfectly watchable movie, but it's a long ways off from great, and even a recommendation would feel generous. Had its characters been stronger, and the action sequences more thrilling, The Magnificent Seven could have been something great. Alas, its flaws and slow third act keep this legendary Western from living up to its legacy. It's not bad by any stretch of imagination, but it's a disappointment nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These Misnamed 7 Totally Missed The Mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I would never call these 7 saddle-tramps "magnificent". On the contrary, they were far from being that. But, of course, if the viewer was clued into this, then, you can be sure that this 1960 Western would've inevitably flopped at the box-office.Considering that The Magnificent 7 was made at the very pinnacle in popularity of movie Westerns, I was really surprised to see how severely lacking in the action department that this cowboy movie was. There was just far too many critical lapses in the action to hold this viewer's undivided attention for this film's full 130-minute running time.If you were to ask me, I'd rightly re-title this picture something like - "Robin Hood &amp; His Less-Than-Merry Men".Out of all the big-name actors starring in this picture there wasn't even one, single stand-out performance in the entire lot. The attitude of sheer laziness that prevailed amongst this lot of actors was annoying beyond belief.In between frequently senseless bursts of triumphant music, it really killed me that these 7 rough &amp; rugged dudes in the story all chose to risk their very lives for a lousy $20 (payable to each, if they lived, after the job was done).The biggest bit of nonsense in this story was when big, bad bandito, Calvera, with his mighty force of 40 thieves, actually captured the 7 and, then, inexplicably set them free. Naturally, these dudes gallantly returned in order to finish all the bad guys off.Duh! All-in-all - This over-rated Western was nothing but a major disappointment on all counts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Should Have Picked Arnie And Sly!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this supposed classic of cowmen and Indians, a group of farmers recruit 7 Hollywood superstars to help them out of a sticky situation. Why they didn't call the police I don't know, maybe they were corrupt or away on holiday. The farmers have been under attack by a roaming gang of hoodies, you see, the farmers have created a new style of potato which is more tasty than other types and have cowardly decided to keep them all to themselves. These roaming hoodies have taken it upon themselves to break in every season, steal as many spuds as possible and ride off to a nearby glade where they spend the next 2 months gorging themselves on their bounty, laughing, and listening to Bob Dylan. The farmers can't stand it anymore, so they decide to go to the surrounding hamlets to recruit some Hollywood heavyweights who should be able to help defend their crops. As it was only 1960 however, their choices were limited- preferably they would have picked Bruce Lee, Arnie, Sly, Bruce Willis, Van Damme, Chuck Norris, and maybe Dolph Lundgren but of course none of them were born yet.Eventually in typical action movie style they find their men and each one has an individual skill- Steve McQeeun can jump over fences on his bike, Yul Burner has a magic hat (when he takes it off he can pull any weapon or item from it), Charlie Brosnan can through rocks really far etc. They actually only find 6 people, but a local teen seeking adventure decides to tag along, and later falls in love with one of the farmers. We get to know each character, but not much of their lives are revealed- they should have included some lost style flashbacks. People say this adds mystique to the cowboys, but I think it's just lazy storytelling. After a while, they come up with a plan- Murdock will hide in the bushes near the enemy camp and at nightfall will rush in screaming 'I need a trash bag'! This will stir the hoodies into a confused and angry state and they give chase. Murdock hides round the corner with the farmer he has fallen in love with, and the hoodies enter the camp and find they are in an ambush. The music soars, and the big battle scene begins. Most of the action is on horseback so it isn't as fast paced as today's speedboat movies, but it's still OK.I won't spoil the ending, but some of the good guys are killed and the plan comes together. The most interesting part is that the director blurs the line between good and evil- the bad guys just want their fill of potatoes and while I cannot condone thievery, if the farmers had just struck up a deal with a local supermarket they could have become millionaires and bought speedboats, while the hoodies would have had all the potatoes they want at a reasonable price. In fact, the sequels to this film deal with an evil business man trying to burn the farmers out of their barns because they won't hand over their recipe. There is even the suggestion that our heroes may well have once been hoodies, or even recovering potato addicts. We never find out.I think this film is actually a remake of an even older black and white one which was set in the time of Knights, Maidens, and Dragons. If they'd kept that setting but updated the colour it could have been a great show. I can't honestly find too much to fault this- it's just not my glass of coke. There are lots of slow parts, a silly love story, and to be honest at times I forgot who was the goody and who was the baddie. It's one of the only ancient films I can watch, but I've watched it once and won't again. It wasn't a waste of two hours, but I might be a waste of four.Favourite bit: Steve and Yul Bruneul's famous exchange: 'After awhile you can call bartenders and potato dealers by their first name - Derek! Rooms you've rented - five hundred! Meals you eat in McDonalds- a thousand! Home - none! Wife - none! Speedboats... none! Suppose I left anything out?' 'Yeah. Places you've been tied down in - 17. Toilets you've soiled- a few million. People who laugh at your hat- a hundred and thirty seven.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, shame it was a complete rip-off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good movie if you like westerns. Now see, The Seven Samauri, by Kurosawa which is, strangely enough, also about seven warriors who defend a village from forty bandits, and win, but at great cost. Due to the high level of rip-off, I would give this movie a 1 to The Seven Samauri's 10. If it had been an original work, a 7. It might be worth knowing this sort of activity is all too common. You might want to watch Kimba, the White Lion, and Simba, the Lion King, back-to-back.</fullReview>
