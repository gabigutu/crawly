		<shortDescription>What happens when you overvalue a movie concept and undervalue the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The answer to the obvious question hovering around Jon Favreau's latest action blockbuster is yes, "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is as ridiculous as the title sounds. Yet blame doesn't quite belong on Favreau's shoulders or that of star Daniel Craig or the rest of the cast; rather, the failure of this alien-infested Western results from the domino effect of the countless studios and producers who put their faith (and money) in a concept rather than a story.To be fair, I know nothing of the Platinum Studios comic by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, but it couldn't have been all that good if all the hottest screenwriters in Hollywood couldn't whip together a plot worth a damn. The duos behind "Iron Man" and "Star Trek" along with "Lost" writer Damon Lindelof all took cracks at the screenplay and an earlier treatment from another pair of "it" writers who wrote next month's "Conan the Barbarian" was discarded. Frankly, criticism of "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" all stems from a story with lackluster characters equipped with cliché motivations. Despite some cool aliens, the action doesn't offer anything unique enough to counter that we've no reason to care.Craig stars as Jake Lonergan, a stoic outlaw in Arizona sometime in the late 19th Century who wakes up with no memory and some metal device on his wrist. When he arrives in the town of Absolution, the sheriff discovers he's wanted and attempts to ship him off for a reward. That's when the aliens attack, bombing the town and roping up locals before flying off into the night. Lonergan's bracelet activates as a weapon and suddenly he's the only one capable of defeating these things. He joins a rescue party led by a grumpy Civil War vet named Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) and they all set off to find out what happened to their loved ones.The script introduces characters willy-nilly and provides little satisfactory explanation for anything that happens. The story paints Lonergan as a quiet badass, but one who has flashes of some woman he loved. Because his past slowly unravels with nothing revelatory to show for it as the film wears on, it's tough to care much or even see him as capable of romantic feelings. Regardless, a woman named Ella (Olivia Wilde) keeps approaching him with questions he doesn't have the answers to and she evolves into a love interest for nothing but the sake of it. Sam Rockwell has little to no bearing on the film other than serving an example of an otherwise peaceful man who will do whatever it takes to get his wife back. He's a waste in the role. As for Ford, he just gets on screen and acts grumpy and impatient. We've seen everyone on board do so much better. Did these folks not read the script? Probably not considering the number of drafts alone.Worst of all, the script thinks we will care; after all, this is "Cowboys &amp; Frickin' Aliens!" In the final sequence, suddenly all these supporting characters have little moments together out of seemingly thin air. What are supposed to be moments in the story tying up relationship subplots between characters end up as reminders that these relationships and subplots even existed in the first place. Consequently, the film's pivotal moments result not in hearts beating, but eyes rolling.In fairness, Favreau shows his adeptness from an action perspective once again in this film. The movie looks good if nothing else with strong visual effects and a strong concept team behind the aliens and related technology. The genre experiment generally works from a tonal perspective, an obstacle that certainly stood in Favreau's path. The film feels like a Western and one in which aliens could feasibly exist, so no problems due to identity crisis.Yet the film never provides a single reason to justify why it had to be a story about cowboys and aliens. In that sense, the movie results in nothing more than several studios and producers thinking we'd simply be interested in a fusion of a shoot-em-up Western with an alien invasion. All involved failed to ask the one critical question when making a film based on a concept: "is there a good story here?" No, there's not. Despite every ounce of you wanting to find a reason to care about what happens, none arrives. As such, "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" offers watchable but lifeless entertainment.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow i enjoyed this, partially due to the negative reviews here on IMDb (thanks guys) and in part due to Harrison Ford clearly having more fun with a character than he has in a long time.Its not a perfect film and there are questions that could be asked of some of the plot points, but the questions, such as they are, would require irrelevant exposition, which would only serve to hobble the pace of what is essentially a "Men (and Woman) on a mission" movie. What really stands out for me were the scenes at the beginning of the film, Jon Favreau introduces the characters, locations and situations in such a manner that when the real threat manifests itself, despite the films title, it catches you as off guard as the characters are.The cast are all great, some nice character work from Clancy Brown and Keith Carradine. Daniel Craig brings the stoic, no nonsense aspects of his Bond to Jake and as i said earlier Harrison Ford obviously relishes the role of Dolarhyde.It reminds me of the films i used to enjoy about twenty years ago, that had lively pace, but were'nt frantic. The effects are special, but not overblown or overwhelming to the point where they become the focus thereby obviating any interest in the characters stories. I don't want to talk about the story too much and spoil it, i'd just urge you to go and watch it, because this movie is an honest attempt to try something a little different. Its not Superheroes, its not a TV show, its not a line of toys and its not cute animated whatevers. Its an unlikely, but successful fusion of two genres to produce a film with humour, drama, action and a refreshing amount of practical effects work. Give it a chance, i really was surprised how much i enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks good, superb cast but painfully predictable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its 1873; New Mexico Territory; an &nbsp;Outlaw and a Cattle Rancher must put aside their differences to stop Alien invaders hellbent on experimenting on humans and stripping the land of its gold.There's something kooky about the title Cowboys and Aliens, B-movie-ish, yet, exciting, enticing and genius. However, even with the star talents including&nbsp;Daniel Craig and&nbsp;Harrison Ford, with the striking&nbsp;Olivia Wilde and excellent Sam Rockwell Cowboys and Aliens still falls short of expectations. The script is bland, every effort has gone into developing the two main leads but at a cost of the rest of the characters, the basic story and plot. &nbsp;The special and practical effects are well integrated and executed but while fantastic they are nothing that hasn't been seen before, reminiscent of District 9, Independence Day to name a few. Considering director's&nbsp;Jon Favreau fun and exciting Iron-man outings this offering is less satisfying. It's not the mishmash of classic genres that's the problem, it's the lazy, predicable story telling.&nbsp;The films opening is strong and intriguing, building up to the tension of Ford's character Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde meeting with Craig's Jake; its Jones meets Bond, perfect. Both are excellent giving weight to the proceedings. Horses are flipped, guns and gauntlets go wild, aliens leap and stomp on cowboys. But after the first few alien attacks the film wavers onto familiar territory. Although it has a fabulous cast beneath its hat and sweeping, breathtaking Western landscapes under it's belt - it buckles under it's own weight.&nbsp;Even with its somewhat serious tone it's not brave enough to explore or&nbsp;commit to its own themes leaving it underdeveloped. But it also omits much needed fun leaving the whole film unseasoned and as empty as the plains of Arizona. Debatably, flop Wild Wild West (1999) infused the sci-fi and Western genre more successfully.&nbsp;Cowboys and Aliens is entertaining, it looks good, has a superb cast but it's painfully predictable and just not that great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge Disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did someone put a gun to Jon Favreau's head and ask him to make this boring 'western'??Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, one of the most fun directors around today, and a title containing both Cowboys and Aliens - this was definitely the most awaited summer movie for me!! And yet, somehow, the 'Curse of The Modern Day Spielberg' managed to defy all expectations and deliver a total damp squib. The story's weak (why capture the humans? why come to earth of all planets to mine for gold? how can one stolen gun destroy an entire operation?), the treatment confused (the whole Olivia Wilde arc), the actors under-utilized (somebody please stop the brutal destruction of everything that Harrison Ford has come to mean to moviegoers), and the action and thrills extremely underwhelming.Please do not go to see this movie. More than the time that you'll never get back, it'll spoil James Bond, Indy, Cowboys, Westerns and Movie Aliens for you forever. To think that I missed work to catch the first, early morning opening show. So disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Old West, an amnesic stranger awakes in the middle of the desert wounded in the belly with a bracelet in one of his wrists. He is attacked by thieves but defeats them. He rides a horse of one outlaw and heads to a former mining town, where the local preacher treats him. Then he sees the youth Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano), who is the son of the powerful farmer Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), bullying with the bar owner Doc (Sam Rockwell) and the other locals. When Percy provokes the stranger, he reacts and beats up on Percy. The local Sheriff John Taggart (Keith Carradine) arrests Percy and he finds that the stranger is the wanted Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig). The sheriff returns to the bar with his deputies to arrest Jake, but he subdues the men. However he is hit on his back by the mysterious Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) and he faints. Jake is arrested and when Sheriff Taggart is ready to take Jake and Percy in a coach to deliver them to a Federal Marshall, Woodrow arrives with his men ready to protect his son. But they are attacked by spacecrafts that abducts several dwellers, including Percy, Doc's wife and the sheriff. Woodrow organizes a posse to seek out the kidnapped people in a dangerous journey against an advanced race of aliens. Meanwhile Jake Lonergan has glimpses of his past life and they learn that someone among them may help them in the fight against the invaders. "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is a very entertaining film with a battle between cowboys and Indians against alien invaders. The result is a funny adventure that blends western with sci-fi. Unfortunately Harrison Ford is histrionic and cliché in the role of the ambiguous Colonel. Daniel Craig is great, as usual and Olivia Wilde is very beautiful and charming. I had low expectations with "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" and in the end I had lots of fun. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Cowboys &amp; Aliens"Note: On 18 June 2015, I saw this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tedious experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some months ago, I read the graphic novel Cowboys &amp; Aliens...and it honestly bored me to tears. Leaving the innovative concept described on the title aside, the story only offers hollow characters, sci-fi clichés badly combined with western clichés, and an excessively light tone which does not make any justice to the potential from that combination of genres. Paradoxically, that disappointment improved my expectations for the film Cowboys &amp; Aliens. After all, Hollywood tends to change the novels it adapts pretty much, and I thought that some "expert" screenwriters would fix the many fails from the story. And even though Cowboys &amp; Aliens improved a few elements from the book, it also preserved the characters without any substance, the arbitrary narrative and the inconsistent behavior from the aliens.The idea of brave cowboys facing an alien invasion is interesting, but I think it works better as a concept than as an execution. The crash between advanced extraterrestrial technology and primitive weapons from 19th century would lead to an unilateral massacre which would make the film to conclude in its first 10 minutes; so, it is necessary to find the way to give the advantage to the cowboys so that the battle is more credible and there is suspense about who the winner will be. Unfortunately, co-screenwriters Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby did not find a logical way to solve the problem, and as a consequence, they employ many traps, excessive inconsistencies and absolutely ridiculous notions in order to give the cowboys the opportunity to defend themselves from the invaders. Without deepening too much in order not to get into the spoilers field, I will mention that, despite their technology and destructive potential, the favorite method of combat from the aliens is...body-to-body fights. And besides, their vulnerability changes according to the screenplay's convenience; when the presence of suspense is necessary, the aliens are practically indestructible; but whenever the movie decides to introduce a "cool" scene, it is easy to kill them with just one shot, an Indian spear, or a small knife.And because of that, the movie constantly "pulled me out" with its coincidences and forced narrative short-cuts. On the positive side, the special effects created by Industrial Light &amp; Magic are competent. As for the human element, Harrison Ford brings an adequate performance, while on the other side of the coin, Daniel Craig feels bland and antipathetic as the anti-hero. By the way, I am going to propose an hypothesis; Sam Rockwell and Clancy Brown interpret two supporting roles in this film, but they are too short and inconsequential; however, I think Cowboys &amp; Aliens would have been a better movie with that duet in the leading roles; Rockwell is one of the best contemporary actors, and he has more cowboy "looks" than Craig; besides, his less athletic physique would make the challenges the character faces more interesting. As for Brown, he would have been absolutely perfect as the cacique from the village. Sure, none of them would have attracted as much spectators as Craig and Ford, but anyway...I am sure this movie would have been better if that fantasy was true.In conclusion, I cannot recommend Cowboys &amp; Aliens, because I found it insipid, irritating, and the worst thing of all, boring. Instead of wasting your time with this film, I recommend you three very entertaining "western/fantasy" hybrids: The Burrowers (cowboys against subway humanoids -which also includes Brown in the cast!-), Dead Birds (cowboys against ghosts) and Tremors (modern cowboys against crawling "graboids"). Cowboys &amp; Aliens might surpass them in budget, but it is not even remotely to their levels of ingenuity and amusement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Waste your Time and Money on this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in with little expectations on this one. I expected Cowboys &amp; Aliens and thats all I got. What more could I ask for right? I could ask for story and a point this story, which this so called movie didn't deliver. I wasn't disappointed with the cowboys, but the aliens were just ridiculous with little intelligence. The movie never explained why they were on Earth or what the reason for aliens wanting gold was about.There was no reason for this movie to be made other than to take my money and dupe people like me who want something new and different than the conventional western or sci-fi movie. This movie was just two hours of people riding around on horses. Loved the cast but i hope they got paid well for being in a less than worthy movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Ass Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this is a summer movie with a unique premise that's not only out there, but works so well that it makes me say "That was BAD ASS." Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the next heavyweight action film of the summer: Cowboys &amp; Aliens.Okay let's get the obvious out of the way: YES, cowboys and aliens in the same movie sounds like an absurd premise that would only exist in the mind of adolescent boy. And yet, this child-like premise is immediately forgotten when you watch surprisingly deep characters struggle through a dangerous situation with overwhelming odds against them. And this film can get DARK in both terms of the fights happening on screen as well as the gravity of the situation. Instead of some silly-mindless action, you get a film that will make you grow a beard sitting through its 2-hour run time (which flies by fast). And don't worry ladies, you get plenty of eye candy too. The film stars Daniel Craig (flawlessly using his American accent) as Jake Lonergan, a cowboy stranded in the middle of the Wild West with only a strangle bracelet on his wrist and no recollection of who he is or how he got there. After a series of dodging mishaps in the nearby town of Absolution, he is corned by Elle (played by Olivia Wilde) and hard-as-nails rancher Han Solo, I mean Colonel Dolarhyde (played by Harrison Ford). An alien invasion then commences and lays waste to Absolution while abducting several of its citizens. Lonergan must then join forces with Dolarhyde and the strange woman to stop the alien threat and discover who he really is.The first twenty minutes of the film play like any Westerner you've seen: Craig plays the gruff loner invoking the spirit of Eastwood, Harrison Ford plays the gruff boss-man of a bunch of thugs, and the usual Western archetypes are present throughout the cast. It's when the alien invasion begins that these archetypes are immediately thrown out the window and you find surprisingly deep characters. Lonergan is a wanted man with a brutal past but the allure of a lost love drives him to learn more about her fate. Harrison Ford is playing the best we've seen him in years (yes even better than Indiana Jones) as a former colonel who has seen the horrors of war and he uses his gruff demeanor to inspire confidence in lesser men. Both Craig and Ford bring their A game to this film as they pull of convincingly deep cowboys. The rest of the cast turns in solid performances. The gorgeous Olivia Wilde plays a mysterious woman who knows more than she's telling, but you can't resist caring about her. Sam Worthington plays a meek bar tender out to find his abducted wife and Noah Ringer plays a scared boy searching for his grandfather. And yes, these two minor side characters develop their arcs as boys become men. Everyone else does a great job in this setting as well. Okay, so now I've praised the story and the deep characters, but is the action any good?Oh. Hell. Yes. The fist fights between humans are brutal and visceral. Horseback chase scenes are made more awesome with alien ships hunting the heroes down. And the aliens? Looking damn fine. The computer generated images aren't glaringly obvious here with the aliens looking bulky, hideous, and monstrous. They are the perfect band of bad guys. And unlike other alien invasion films, you get to see humans get into vicious fights with the extraterrestrials. Limbs are blown off, Guns blow holes into alien bodies. Aliens eat humans right in front of their comrades. All of it is exceptionally well-done and reminds you that this is most definitely NOT a kids movie (PG-13 rating be damned). The best part? The fights mean something. You care what happens to Lonerman, Dolarhyde, Elle, Doc, and Emmett. When characters die, the persons close to them EMOTE. The characters who die are characters YOU grow attached to. You WANT their deaths avenged. You are made known in none-uncertain-terms that the situation is dire. And that's what elevates Cowboys &amp; Aliens from a merely good film to a GREAT film.Unique action movies are hard to come by and big budget films with great characters are harder still to find. Cowboys &amp; Aliens finds a way to merge the Western and Alien Invasion genres into something fun, entertaining, and meaningful. Characters don't get any deeper and action doesn't get any harder than you'll find here. A fantastic summer movie that I highly recommend everyone to check out in theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big dumb mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a hokey name like "Cowboys and Aliens", you're really not supposed to expect much more than Cowboys and Aliens, fighting.And very little of the movie even deals with that.Being PG-13, it couldn't go all-out in a faithful depiction of the Old West, but it seems they only really pushed it so as to show off Olivia Wilde's buttcrack and a quick shot of a a guy with a big hole shot through the chest with an alien weapon, as everything else is virtually squeaky-clean, not a hint of racism or sexism, grit or grime, and an utterly blas? attitude from everyone but Sam Rockwell as the bartender "Doc".As the review in my local newspaper said, very little is devoted to "why" with regards to the alien, and far too much "why" with regards to Daniel Craig's Jake Lonergan, played so stony and cold you don't give a damn about any of his problems.The characters are horribly one-dimensional and predictable, and there were so many instances in the film where not only me, but a large group of people, burst out laughing. And not when the movie was being funny.Not going to spoil it, but the big "revelation" moment with Olivia Wilde's character caused some very loud and noticeable derisive laughter from many of us in the theater, and the moment with the alien that Jake had first met having a final standoff with him at the end was so hackneyed, it provoked chitters and groans.For a movie that felt so long and, by concept, seemed to be aiming for something big, it sure felt small, like a Syfy original movie with some big-name actors in it.But the absolute biggest plothole involves the aliens interacting with the people. Not only is it never explained WHY the aliens are randomly abducting people, but as it turns out, their ultimate reason for coming to Earth, and their goal, not only has little to nothing to do with humans, but considering their technology, they could EASILY achieve without EVER interacting with the humans at all! Considering how a clich?'d Hollywood flick like this ends with the good guys winning, these aliens could've saved themselves a lot of trouble by not looking to pick a fight with the natives for no reason. But then we wouldn't have this big dumb mess we call a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the beginning, there's a cowboy movie. A man from nowhere, Daniel Craig, wakes up with a device on his wrist ? then he's surrounded by three rough necks ? followed by a quick, neat fight straight out of the opening scene of SILVERADO. He wanders into a small town, where a few more characters are set-up, and it feels like the kind of Western we love to watch, perhaps even something by Sergio Leone ? that's the attempt, anyway. We meet the town brat, overplayed by Paul Dano, whose father, Harrison Ford, is a cattle baron with lots of money. All these and more folks are introduced, so many it's hard to keep track.Then the aliens, in speedy vessels with lasers, and even lassos, attack: computer animation meets the scant Western setting. When a posse is formed, and the cowboys venture to kill the formidable foes, the pace flags. But it's when Craig's gorgeous love interest, supposedly the town whore, becomes "enlightened" by Indians and knows everything about the aliens... spouting exposition like directions on a new stove... that the film sinks beneath the surface of banality, completely losing its rough and tumble origins to a science-fiction melodrama.Daniel Craig, attempting the iconic Clint Eastwood Man With No Name, is so tiny he's lost in his big hat. He juts his lips and hisses each line, and while this seems to work for James Bond, his performance as a mysterious stranger doesn't hold water. Harrison Ford, with a gruff, world-weary voice and a bitter hatred for mankind, seems to be doing a performance or imitation. The aliens, free from their ships and computer animated to the hilt, are too quick and dangerous to be worthy foes ? thus Craig's wristband gun comes to play, making the other riders (and way too many of them) useless.The only involving performance is by Clancy Brown as a wise, tough preacher, but alas, he makes but a quarter of the trip: one that starts with a quick bang and ends with a very long whimper. So here's one "spoiler" to sum things up ? the girl eventually turns into a hummingbird, an image more stupid than the convoluted back story of our hero and the aliens, which is still completely unclear.For More Interviews: http://cultfilmfreakreviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great western, not great sci fi. What's left?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ONE LINE REVIEW: not a great western, not great sci fi. What's left?RATING: Wait for the instant download. (rating system: "see it in theaters", "wait for the instant download", "don't waste you're time")NO SPOILERSCowboys and Aliens opens with our hero Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) waking up alone in the desert wearing an alien bracelet and a fractured memory. He saunters into town and meets Ella Swensen (Olivia Wilde) who seems to know him. The aliens appear and abduct half the town, including the son of cattle man Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). Now the remaining townspeople must muster courage to find the aliens and retrieve their loved ones. Our three heroes are joined by a doctor, a boy, and an Indian aid. Jake has a flashback that lets him remember that the aliens killed his wife, and now he wants revenge. With our team established and filled with sufficient resolve, they begin their trek to find the aliens, retrieve their kin, and destroy the alien invaders.This story reminds me of the old-time westerns where Indians would raid the white man's town and make off with their womenfolk. Then, the men folk would form a posse and go retrieve their families. Only here, Indians are replaced with aliens.So, this movie really offers us a story that was retired decades ago. But with sufficient star power and CGI, will it be entertaining to a modern audience? Let's find out...Daniel Craig is the new "Bond". You'd think he might deliver a presence as the central character that carries the film. But no. In fact, he has very few lines (delivered in an American accent) and delivers them with complete solemnity. He spends most of his time brooding and taking his hat off or putting it on.Harrison Ford is very believable as the hard-nosed cattle man with a past that includes fighting for the South in the Civil War. He's good... He's Harrison Ford, after all. His character goes through some important changes as a result of this journey. But that is usually what the lead is supposed to do. As good as Ford is, he cannot carry this film playing second fiddle.Olivia Wilde is everywhere these days. She took a year off from "House" to make movies and she has put the time to good use (Tron, On the Inside, The Change Up). She is a smart and beautiful actor and I'm looking forward to seeing her in a lead role. However, the scriptwriters and director did not put her to good use in this film. She spends most of her time in the background watching everything else happen. We never get invested in her - nor does anyone else.The special effects in this film are quite good. The aliens are pretty cool. They did seem to borrow from Aliens and Predator, however. The fighter ships that abduct the townspeople have a unique design. However the Mother ship resembles a vertical cigar. As for other special effects, a particular explosion was too reminiscent of the Challenger disaster for me. Too soon, I guess.Overall this is a pretty unimpressive movie with under-powered performances and a stale story. I can't recommend you spend $10 on it, but you might enjoy it at home if you "Wait for the instant download"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Title Says It All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to figure out what Cowboys &amp; Aliens is going to be. I'm not familiar with the comic book that it's based on but the film is definitely what the title has promised us. There are cowboys, then there are aliens. If you are fond to Western movies then you'll be entertained but if you are expecting too much aliens then you might get disappointed. You won't be seeing anything mind blowing in this film. If you want to see Sci-Fi action plus Western Violence then this film is just for you.Cowboys &amp; Aliens is nothing but to entertain you. The only thing that is unique here is the Western &amp; Sci-Fi collaboration. The film is just your typical Western movie but instead of Indians or some sadistic bandit, the aliens are the antagonist of the film. The aliens are pretty intriguing but we don't see them that much until the third act. It's disappointing if you are expecting too much aliens. The only things we see them do are ride their ships, stab people, shoot with their weapons, &amp; jump scare the audiences. It's also your typical alien invasion film.At least the action is full of explosions. Jon Favreau sure knows how to make the action scenes exciting no matter how flawed they are. The performances saved most of the film. Daniel Craig's character is actually bland in the script so does Olivia Wilde's, but Craig's performance gives a little more character to the role. I don't know what to say about Olivia Wilde's, she is just hot. Harrison Ford &amp; Sam Rockwell do what they do best. Paul Dano can be both fun to watch and annoying at the same time.It's easy to recognize that the CGI effects were made by Industrial Light &amp; Magic, since the CGI aliens looks just like any monster from J.J. Abram's films. No doubt, it's good. The score is true to its western themes. The production design is pretty decent enough for a western film.In the end, Cowboys &amp; Aliens is just another blockbuster released to our cinemas. I don't know if this film is going to be remembered years from now but I think the only purpose of this film is to show its gritty western violence and some sci-fi action. If you're expecting more than the title then you will be disappointed. If you are expecting more aliens than the cowboys then you'll be disappointed. Cowboys are the focus and the aliens end up being the jump scare of the movie. It's not bad nor good though. If you are careless about the story and the character development, &amp; you're just seeking for some sheer action and huge explosions then I can recommended this. But not quite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No cowboys freaked out at the sight of aliens in this movie...why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's what I couldn't get out of my head during the entire movie. At least they could've allowed Sam Rockwell to play up his somewhat comical over the top reactive style of acting to lighten things up a bit and take my mind away from the nonsensicalness of it all, but then he'ld probably steal all the scenes compared to everyone else's dead pan serious tough guy &amp; gal persona's.I don't think there was one character in the movie that said... "Look at that! Wow! Did you see how ugly and creepy those aliens are? AND THEY CAN FLY!" All the characters underplayed their reaction to something that would even freak us out if we saw such creatures and these dudes could FLY! It bares repeating. But the cowboys stuck to their tough, rough rider exteriors as if they were used to seeing such things as just some ornery cattle rustlers to contend with.I mean first off the aliens are lightning fast, bigger than a horse, creepy and terrifying as hell and shoot rocket propelled grenades off their arms while the cowboys were constantly emptying their six shooters and rifles at them getting off some of the most lucky shots imaginable. I know, it's a movie. You have to allow that.And yet not one character in the entire movie was in a fetal position, drooling and chewing their tongue and gnashing their teeth upon seeing such horrific and unstoppable creatures.I really don't think in reality cowboys, even the toughest ones, would've reacted that way back then and that's what made the whole movie seem off kilter.The special effects and alien designs were amazing and quite realistic, though, which is why I give this movie 5 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank heaven I saw this on cable &amp; did not pay for it. Holy smokes, this was predictable, already done, clichéd.**Spoiler Alerts**the character played by Oliva Wilde is an alien - it is so heavily foreshadowed, it clunks you on the head. She's there because the bad aliens killed all of her species &amp; she wants to stop them (Uh, Star Trek, the Borg?) Speaking of foreshadowing, whatya think happens when Harrison Ford gives the boy his knife - gosh, is the kid gonna become a man when he kills an alien? You betcha! Native American guide is able to unite cowboys and Indians to fight together against the aliens. Together, they dodge, out run and out smart the aliens who have laser blasters. Since movies like this need a sacrificial victim, the guide gives his life to say everyone else.The alien weakness? They don't see so good in the day time (Predator, anyone?).Oh, and a LSD like trance induced by the witch doctor helps Daniel Craig remember where he got the killing bracelet and what happened to his wife that will lead to save the day.The climatic attack on the alien spaceship frees the hostages and everyone is able to outrun a spaceship blowing up.Cowboys Vs Aliens deserves to be on a short list of worst movies ever, but won't become a cult classic like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or Planet X.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can anyone not like this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is well acted. It is well produced. It has a star-studded cast and a fun twist on sci-fi action thrillers. Here's what you do for a "summer fun" movie: Combine a bunch of cowpokes with a hostile alien race, set it in a time period where the human race has no concept of time or space travel. Then let Spielberg do his thing.I've had fun watching this film several times. As with all good flicks, there's always something you missed the first, second and third times. This isn't really meant to be serious science fiction. It's meant to be an entertaining romp that mashes up the western and sci-fi genre, and it throws in just enough action and special effects to make up for a so-so script.If you watch this and don't like it, then you don't like watching fun movies. This. Was. Fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than I thought it would be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This came and went from the cinema without much fanfare, and I've only seen the Director's Extended cut on Blu-Ray. But I can only imagine that those extra 15 minutes made a huge difference.Firstly, it's a Western. Rough characters in a dusty town. Then there's the aliens, who terrorise the towns people. It's a recipe that doesn't necessarily sound that it would work, but the direction of Jon Favreau with a story by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman works to grasp the audience.Characters are portrayed by all the actors with a touch of realism that's rare, and perhaps because of the extra time the director's cut allows each character is made believable.Action scenes, and it's certainly not short of them, are fast paced but again the direction of Jon Favreau is excellent. Rather than the current trend of fast cuts where little is seen, the action is visible to the viewer and as such better for it too.Overall, an action film which has a strong plot with character development. That in the end you do care for the characters. These days of action after fight after crash scene with little time for interaction between character to build on plot, this film is a refreshing treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Iron Man director Jon Favreau brings to this comic book adaptation is texture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Old West, a mysterious man (Daniel Craig) wakes up not knowing who or where he is. He's been wounded in the stomach and has a mysterious metal bracelet attached to his arm that he can't break off. After he escapes a group of bandits he rides back into town to heal up. But he brings attention to himself by taking out a thug named Percy (Paul Dano). Suddenly, people recognise the man as an outlaw named Jake Lonergan and he is knocked out by the mysterious Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) and winds up in a cell right next to Percy. When army Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) learns that his son Percy has been locked up, he rides into town with his men to free him. But the town is attacked by alien spaceships, which capture by people by roping them up into their crafts. One of the people taken is the wife of bartender Doc (Sam Rockwell). When it's noted that Jack's bracelet can shoot down the ships, Woodrow insists that he comes with the group including Ella, Doc and Nat (Adam Beach), an Indian, to try and get their friends back. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy Cowboys and Aliens. It's a ridiculous concept, melding the Western with science fiction and not one with any recent or memorable comparison. But importantly, what Iron Man (2008) director Jon Favreau brings to this comic book adaptation is texture. It surprised me what a violent and grubby film this is. That means that it's not appropriate for small children but it does make for a more grounded Western. Out of all the ways to describe a movie called Cowboys and Aliens, I never imagined I'd be using the word 'realistic'. But believe it or not, the characters in this film look and feel like real cowboys, hardened battlers of the frontier. Many of them are unshaven; they drink too much and engage briefly in torture. In one scene a man is tied to two horses as his limbs are pulled in two different directions. Even the early brawls in this film are more involving and intense than we usually expect from films like this because they're shot cohesively and with some gravity. The cuts and the bruises here look real. I appreciated the attention to detail that Favreau decided to bring to this movie, instead of easy self- referencing. Any humour in this film arrives in just the right amount of doses. It never becomes a winking parody because the mood of this film and the performances play the concept straight. This allows the deadpan humour to come through more naturally, mostly thanks to some fun supporting roles by Sam Rockwell and briefly Paul Dano. They seem to be having great fun with some of their dialogue and they're really enjoyable to watch and listen to. But the casting of Craig is particularly interesting. Robert Downey Jr. was originally was attached to the film because of the success he and Favreau shared with Iron Man. But Craig is, I think, a better fit for the movie. His weathered face and constant grimace evokes Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name. He doesn't bring any of the smugness that Downey Jr. would have. That means that there's less jabs and winking at the source material. Instead, Craig makes himself effortlessly cool by snarling lines like: "Demons took your gold. When you get to hell, you can ask for it back". Harrison Ford is in grizzled form here and really chews the scenery as the battle hardened Colonel. There is a little more depth and warmth to his character, because of his interactions with Nat, while thankfully avoiding much of the schmaltz of Super 8 from earlier this year. Olivia Wilde is merely serviceable but at least slightly more active than most female roles in movies like this. These characters aren't as rich or romantic as the ones from Iron Man but they're tough and humorous enough to be a lot of fun. The aliens are the least interesting part of the movie. This is where the film loses a lot of its gravity. There's nothing particularly unique or interesting about the aliens. They have few weaknesses and not much personality. They're just after gold. And not having read the comic book, I don't know if the aliens are meant to be symbolic or allegorical. Favreau is not interested in that aspect. Some of their sequences have a few jumpy scares, which does add to the fun but others are just overdone or too far-fetched. If you think the aliens are a stretch, wait till you reach the Indian campfire ceremony. There's also a silly scene on top of a spacecraft and the last battle, like so many of these films, goes on far too long. That said, the action is very slickly handled and violent and the actors are engaging. I think a lot of comic book and video game fans are going to love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every bit as stupid as its setup</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is what happens when a good director (Jon Favreau) makes a moronic abomination. Of course, you shouldn't blame him. Blame the five writers who still managed to louse it up.It's an already stupid setup (Western meeting Sci-Fi) executed just as badly as you'd expect. Daniel Craig's character has the name "Jake Lonergan". Ugh. Puns like these made me sick. But that's not all. The flick is pounded by a confusing plot, unengaging characters, CG that doesn't feel as good as it should, and utterly stupid and ridiculous plot twist: mysterious girl Ella being revived by fire. Are you kidding me!? It makes no sense (even for Sci-Fi), it destroys our willing suspension of disbelief, it's an utter disregard for basic biology, and it has a flimsy explanation-she's an alien. That's not an excuse! On top of that, it barely explains anything else about her, either! Her death by explosion actually make more sense than this.So, overall, this movie should not be watched by anyone. It's a brain dead mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome entertainment - Perfect mix of James Bond attitude, special effects and heavy alien presence...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one entertaining movie. It had all the elements that have made Hollywood timelessly entertaining for so many decades now - Great western "feel", the gripping new James Bond attitude of Daniel Craig, realistic CG, and heavy alien presence.The plot requires some suspension of disbelief but hey that's what entertainment is about. If people want "believable" movies they need to watch docu-dramas. If they want to get entertained and want an entertaining experience of "what would something look like if it was real" then this movie is it. It's highly engaging, the story doesn't drag at all, the action is bullet proof, and the concept is 'unique' if nothing else.High marks to Daniel Craig's "as man as it can get" character. He truly excels in such roles. Harrison Ford did a magnificent job as a gutsy western hero who just won't back down from a fight. The story moves along very well and despite what anyone tells you - MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT ABOUT THIS MOVIE. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO WATCH IT. YOU WILL *NOT* BE DISAPPOINTED.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do live on a tight budget. After buying the DVD and watching this move 3 times I realized that I would have paid full price to watch this movie not once, but twice. John Wayne would have been proud of this movie. So would have many other cowboy legends such as Roy Rogers. Not only was the base of the story well thought out the cast, crew and other members of this film worked really hard to entertain us. There are basic morals taught in this film if the viewer would jus pay attention. As far as Christian lessons carefully placed the writers could not have done a better job. Family values soared throughout this tale. This wasn't just a Sci-Fi-Western mix film. This is a brand new way to look at human struggles and how to beat the odds. This a fresh way to look into our hearts and learn to fight as a band for our survival. The odd thing there is a tremendous amount of sacrifice made all the way throughout the movie. And let's not forget about the humor. There is a subtle funny line at least every few minutes. For a viewer like myself I had to watch it 3 times since I really wanted to understand the deep message. And boy did the fireworks light up my soul. The way to win lives is truly amazing. I wish I could shake their hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay I really don't have a clue why this film's rating is so low. It was awesome. Without giving any details of the movie and messing it up for anyone let me just say that despite a very few slightly cheesy points, overall the movie was very exciting and in fact, thought-provoking at some times. The special effects were absolute great. Usually CGI leaves me for wanting but they did a really good job of making the aliens come to life and look very very real. If you like westerns, you'll like this movie. If you like sci-fi, you'll like this movie. If you like explosions, you'll like this movie. If you like a bit of romance, you'll like this movie. If you like being thrilled, you'll like this movie. I don't care that It's not your typical down-to-earth, realistic movie. In FACT, that's why I love it (and have watched it several times, thanks to DVD!) If you are addicted to PBS, but hate everything else... that's the only time I could see you not liking the movie. I hope they release a Cowboys and Aliens 2. I'll definitely watch it, as long as they don't flub it up with 3D and force people to waste 5 bucks renting uncomfortable 3D glasses. The theaters are so expensive as it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been over 42 years since a "good" Weird west movie came out. Now, Paramount Picture attempts to revive the genre again. Did It work? This is my review on Cowboys and Aliens.The plot goes like this; A man wakes up in a desert without any knowledge of of history or his identity. He also notices a metal armband around his arm which looks like something WAY beyond it's time. He eventually finds a small town in Arizona entitled "Absolution". After causing chaos with the local Sheriff, he runs into a dirty, good-for-nothing Cattle owner named Colonel Dolarhyde who seems to own the town. But before Dolarhyde could get ahold of him, mysterious attackers from the skies assault the town, abducting anyone who stands in their way. After the attack, Dolarhyde decides to cut a deal with the man with no name, due to the fact that his armband is some sort of alien weaponry. A Posse is established and they set out to find the invaders and reclaim their family members.With a few exceptions like "True Grit" and "3:10 to Yuma", Westerns that have come out in the 21st century have been far from Brilliant status of the older movies. Cowboys and Aliens seem to mix the two together; Assembling a classic western storyline with a modern alien twist- and it works! The story has all the stereotypical western characters that appeared in the oldies. You've got an old drunk, the young kid that needs to learn manners, a greedy land owner and of course, a man with no name. The writers did a really good job establishing some great western clichés that seemed to be used a lot in the old movies. The characters are extremely well acted- And why wouldn't they be. It stars great acting legends like Harrison ford and Daniel Crag. Harrison plays brilliantly, grunting and growling like some savage beast which the character seems to be. Daniel is quite good to,though there is nothing out of the ordinary to talk about. Good acting in general, but don't be going in thinking that there is going to be the best acting ever- because it isn't.One factor a look at most in Sci-Fi movies is the Aliens. The aliens in this movie are amongst the greatest of modern aliens. Im probably alone in this, but they make me feel like I'm watching an old-school alien ultimatum which is very hard for modern filmmakers to achieve. One thing I like about them is their weaponry. You see a alien armband on the Daniel Crag's character for most of the movie, but as you get to the end they reveal a lot more. They have huge, under-arm Lazar cannons that explode large sections of the landscape which is quite entertaining to watch.The aliens' motivation is nothing special but it wasn't TERRIBLE. For the appearance and weaponry, I think they deserve credit.There is a lot of action scenes to keep the action junkies happy. As well as the explosions mentioned before, we has huge spaceships blasting people, Indians stabbing aliens, Cowboys shooting aliens etc. There is A lot of battles which are extremely entertaining.Im not saying this movie is for everyone and most people will disagree with everything i have just said, but I, on the other hand, can't praise it enough. It brought me back to the old school B movies. I highly recommend the film to fans of Sci-fi action and old B westerns.I give it a 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I Think "Cowboys and Aliens" is a Worthy Summer Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was in 7th grade my father bought me and my best a friend tickets to see "Alien" and when the theater manager protested that he could not buy two kids under 17 tickets to see the R-rated movie alone, he purchased a ticket for himself and when the lights went down, darted out the side exit. He saw "Alien" as an important film for me to see and noted it was groundbreaking in the Sci-Fi genre.That said, "Cowboys and Aliens" is no "Alien" but I still enjoyed it. Maybe I am sucker for the actors, Daniel Craig and his well-played outsider and Harrison Ford's arrogance and insolence. Maybe I just like sitting in a cool theater on a terribly hot summer day. I was not sorry that I saw the film.I enjoyed this film better than some of the other summer blockbuster films I have seen. Yes, there are flaws but the action is captivating and the premise is one that resonates in every good v. evil film. Overall, this is why I think this film is a worthy summer film: - I found the characters believable. - I found myself taken away by the story. - I enjoyed the gritty scenery and the special effects were very realistic. - I found myself on the edge of my seat at certain points. - I rooted for the good guys.Is it Academy Award worthy? Doubtful. But if you are just looking for a short break from the real world, this film will take you away on that sweet little trip. And how can you beat seeing Daniel Craig in chaps? Thank you, Jon Favreau! ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cowboys, but did it need the aliens?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like cowboys, dirt, Daniel Craig, or a boy with a dog, you should go. Overall, surprisingly thumbs up. Warning, the good dialogue comes at the beginning, the good horse riding comes in the middle, and the embarrassing face you make when cringing comes at the end. Yes, this is a popcorn film (I ate my whole bag), but it also does an excellent job putting some real hitch in the giddy up of cowboy flicks. Daniel Craig shines as rough, reluctant hero, and really stuck it to the producers of Bond for not continuing his reign (making hearing him speak in an American accent all the more odd). Jon Favreau once again brought a pleasant grounding to what could easily slip into Michael Bay-let's just blow things up and move the camera really fast-territory. I am reminded of his insistence on "Elf" to do as many in-camera effects as possible before resorting to CGI, lending the tipping point of keeping it reasonable and earning his place at the table with the big boy producers of this film. As a fan of early cowboy films of Ford, Wayne, Huston, and Steward, I was pleased to see the pacing and emphasis on the journey honored. This film is more about riding than stare offs. I just wish the destination was as much fun as the chase. At times it seemed like a chore to continue stabbing and shooting the aliens. Classics like "Winchester '73" knew best to get the killing done and wrap in up fast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, Bland, and Bloated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I struggled with giving this a much lower rating because just the presence of a good team does not a good movie make, and this movie exemplifies a tremendous waste of talent: Craig, Rockwell, Ford, Wilde, Dano, Carradine, people who have done sensational work before just stand in the middle of this mess, and to echo what other people have mentioned here before barely outdistance the biggest waste of CGI, animatronic, and money ever on a science fiction film ever.Several questions are still in my head: 1) Is this really the best reason five writers came up with for the aliens to be in the desert? No wonder the movie ended that way, and I am surprised they lasted the whole two hours if they ended up losing one of their "bracelets" so quickly. 2) Are hanging bodies the standard in movies now? 3) Have people run out of imagination when the best they can do is imitate "Alien" for their appendages? and I don't Ridley would consider this a tribute.Truly, there is too much botched here and is not because the genres do not mix. Science Fiction and Cowboys have been around before. Do you remember a certain Yul Brynner film? and what about the exciting conclusion to the "Back to the Future" trilogy, but those films had imagination, consistent and talented writing, not just a showcase for a waste of money. It's sad that we waited a whole year for this. Really, there is nothing in this film I would recommend to anyone, but I would offer to a warning to those who want to make a good film and say: "see it and do the opposite of what they did, and you have a winner..." Case closed.</fullReview>

Great concept(aliens and the old west), two great actors (Craig and Ford), behind the scenes (Spielberg and Ron Howard), how could it miss, right?? Holy cowpucky was I wrong! In cutting the actors some slack I'll admit they didn't have much to work with. The plot is very weak. Once again we have reptilian-like aliens (hostile of course) who are advanced enough for inter-galactic space travel but still relegated to growling and clawing, only this time there here for our gold. We never find out what they want or need it for. There's also another alien (a good one). We don't know how she/it arrived on earth, but apparently she/it's here to save us from the bad aliens. Much to the Craig character's delight she/it's apparently a shape shifter and appears in the form of a very attractive earth woman. In some scene's we're unable to kill them, then we can, then we can't again. There doesn't seem to be any continuity but in the end in an act of alien self-sacrifice the good pretty alien destroys the bag ugly ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I worry for Daniel Craig. It seems like it will take a lot for him to prove to the world that he's capable of doing more than playing James Bond. And furthermore, it doesn't look like he'll be any more able to pull off a performance as Mikael Blomkvist in the upcoming Dragon Tattoo remake. Because just an hour ago, I got out of the movie that may just be solid proof of his inability to act outside his comfort zone... Cowboys and Aliens. I'll admit I didn't have any expectations for this movie except just a fun and enjoyable blow-em-up alien flick. In fact, something with such a title as "Cowboys and Aliens" should not be boring. And a cast like Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde should help offer SOMETHING of that promise. Unfortunately, the movie has its head so far up in the clouds, it thinks it's something other than what it should be.I will say the movie got off to a good start with the opening moments, where Jake, the film's protagonist wakes in the desert, unaware of where he is, and then the following scene with Jake beating the men up and stealing their clothes and horse was great too. Speaking of the protagonist, I'm not sure why we don't find out his name until about 30 minutes into the movie, or so it seems.Anyways, back to the "plot". He appears to have woken up with a bracelet made of iron on his left wrist, which leads to what may be the most ham handed Chekhov's Gun example later in the film. He appears to have no memory at all and later finds out he is a wanted robber, and is imprisoned after a bar fight. One night, aliens attack the town, and it is unknown why (nor is it really explained, save for some weird gold subplot later in the film). And there's more attacks, and the men go on an adventure to stop the attacks, and blah blah blah... The end.Oh and I forgot, Olivia Wilde is in this. What she was even in there for again I'm completely empty at the thought of too, and maybe my summary wouldn't be so vague had there been STUFF HAPPENING in the film. Sad thing is, her performance is the best thing of the movie.Honestly I am amazed. I haven't had this much trouble trying to find the words to say about such a frustrating film. How could a movie with such a concept be so BORING. There is basically almost no fun in the film. When a movie is called "Cowboys and Aliens" and there's no fun in the movie whatsoever, that is not a good sign. In fact, why are there aliens in the movie, anyway. They are indeed very pointless and they feel forced in just to create some pointless conflict involving gold, which gets left to naught in the end. And we rarely see any of the aliens anyway. In fact, we see more spaceships than aliens. And the aliens look dumb anyways. Do they give razzies for CG? Because they look so bad, they make the aliens in Battle LA look awesome.The movie gets two of three stars for Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde, both the best things about this film, and the third star for the beautiful Arizona locations. The rest... yawn.OVERALL: 3/10Pros: Olivia Wilde and Harrison Ford give good performances, as well as the location is great.Cons: Cowboys And Aliens is essentially a fun-less, boring, slow and plodding dirge with boring action and pointless subplots that do nothing but drag a film that should be 85 minutes to a boring 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So that's what westerns were missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something about the old west that makes you think alien invasion. Sure we've seen plenty of westerns lately ("3:10 to Yuma", "True Grit"), but it's been a while since we've seen a western with aliens. But now, Jon Favreau (Iron Man) brings us "Cowboys and Aliens." First things first: we need some cowboys...And who better to play these cowboys than Indiana Jones and James Bond. That's right we have Daniel Craig playing Jake Lonergan, a cowboy who wakes up in the middle of nowhere and knows only how to speak and fight. It was almost the same thing we saw in "The Bourne Identity." All he can remember about himself comes to him in memories triggered by familiar places and feelings. Then we have Harrison Ford playing the rich and powerful Woodrow Dolarhyde. From trailers and posters of the movie, I went in the movie thinking these two would be a team from start to finish. What we actually see is Ford's character start as a villain type and evolve from there. He was the most developed character throughout the entire movie and was a lot of fun to watch. Then there was Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) who seemed to be a little clichéd as far as strong western women are concerned, but we soon realize that she is quiet different from past westerns. All of the characters (including some of the aliens) are really dynamic.&nbsp;The movie is set in Arizona in 1873 and holds strong to the setting for a long time. You get the western feel of it and see all of the classic western elements. There are people fighting in deserts, bars, jail cells...and there was a lot of great violent action. And then the aliens come and you completely forget about the setting. But your okay with it because in the alien scenes, someone/something is getting stabbed or shot in the face. Which brings me to my next point...The action scenes in this movie were what we should have been seeing ALL SUMMER LONG. If a helicopter is spinning out of control, I don't want to see someone imagine a roller-coaster that guides it to the ground gently (that's right Green Lantern, cut the crap). In the same way, if aliens come and invade a town and abduct most of the peoples' family members, I want those cowboys to hunt them down and find new and creative ways to make their body parts disappear. And "Cowboys and Aliens" did a really good job with that. I would say that it had a few of the best action scenes I've seen all year.&nbsp;So "Cowboys and Aliens" was a really fun movie. Not the kind that makes you think really, or even one many people could relate to, but it was still fun in that it was gory when it needed to be, it was funny when it needed to be, and it was even emotional when it needed to be. It was just a really great summer action movie (which is apparently where Jon Favreau thrives). It was a great western with great sci-fi. And really, how many other movies can say that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They should have left the aliens out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie started off, and aside from the thing on Craig's wrist you'd be mistaken for thinking this was a proper Western. In my opinion, they should have just used this cast and made a True Grit style Western. The actors aren't the problem. Daniel Craig is fantastic (as always), Ford is Ford. The rest though seem a bit underused. Sam Rockwell didn't really have much to do, neither did Paul Dano (who seems to have fallen by the wayside since There Will Be Blood) and Walton Goggins (who lights up any scene in The Shield or Justified) was barely in it too. The plot was thread bare at best, some incomprehensible mess about aliens mining for gold, capturing humans, blah blah blah. The least they could have done with this was a District 9 style where the aliens co- exist with the cowboys. But they never explained very well why they were capturing humans, nor why they needed the gold.And the aliens looked like a large version of Rango.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've not read the book (books?) so I have no bias in that regard. For me there were several plot issues that I had issues with. This isn't a spoiler, so I won't go into details. A simple one is size of scout ship vs. size of alien. The way the story weaves in all the players of the wild west, Cowboys, Indians and Outlaws is very well done. The performances are pretty good, but Craig plays it too much like James Bond for me. Maybe Favreau wanted him to play it quiet-cool, it just comes off as too 'Bond-ish' for me. Ford is terrific as the tough-as-nails ex. Civil War Colonel. The effects are first rate. I enjoyed it, but they could have done a little better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrison Ford &amp; Daniel Craig star in two different movies at the same time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to Cowboys &amp; Aliens. There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to enjoy it. Good ol' fashioned western crossed with some alien invasion. James Bond and Indiana Jones teaming up to whoop on some extraterrestrial elements and they got the man behind those super-charged Iron Man movies? Hell, yeah! But then I saw it. Color me disappointed. Jake Lonergan (Craig) wakes up in the middle of the desert. He's got no memory whatsoever. He doesn't know how he got there, where he came from, hell -- he doesn't even know his own name. He does know he's hurt and he's got some metal bracelet on his wrist. After the initial shock wears off, he rides to the nearest town on a horse he borrows from some very unfriendly prospectors. There, he butts heads with Percy Dolarhyde (Dano), the son of wealthy (and pretty much town owner) Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Ford). While he's in the saloon drinking off his encounter with Percy, a pretty young woman named Ella (Wilde) seems to know who he is. Their conversation gets put on hold pretty quick, however, because the local sheriff (Carradine) spies a wanted poster with the stranger's mug on it and throws him into the hoosegow with Percy. As they're being transported to Santa Fe, an alien spaceship appears and starts to snatch up some of the townsfolk. Among the taken are Percy, the sheriff and the saloon owner's wife. Divided by hatred, forced together by a common enemy, Jake and Woodrow put together a posse to track them down and get their people back. As I sat there and watched this movie, many things were going through my mind -- What happened to Jake? Why does Woodrow hate him so much? Why is he a wanted man? What the hell is that bracelet? Who is the woman that knows him and what part does she play in all this? Why are the aliens here? The entire movie is shrouded in mystery. I love a good mystery as much as anybody, but this film just reeks of it. I built up such incredible ideas in my head about what it could all mean and how they could put together this complex jigsaw puzzle and when things finally get revealed, I was so let down by it's simplicity. This part of the movie had to be good. It was very important for the screenwriters to have this aspect of the film work because it was weak on so many other levels. Because of all the things that was going through my head for the entire 118 minutes of screen time, not once did I think, "Boy, this is exciting!" Clearly, Cowboys &amp; Aliens has pacing issues. They even hide Harrison Ford from us for the first half hour of the film. I almost felt as if I was watching two entirely different movies. One movie has Daniel Craig with amnesia and sharing most of his screen time with Olivia Wilde and the other movie has Harrison Ford walking his posse through various terrains and trying to communicate with some Native American Indians via his translator (Beach). I wanted an un-buddy camaraderie between the two, yet they hardly shared any dialog together, let alone any screen time together. This is why the puzzle pieces needed to be a bit more elaborate. With only three action sequences to speak of throughout the entire film, we need something more thrown at us than Ella's big (and just plain dumb) reveal. I actually preferred seeing the supporting characters on screen more than Craig, Ford or Wilde. The saloon owner (Rockwell), the sheriff's grandson, Emmett (Ringer) and the preacher (Brown) were all interesting characters and I think I cared more about them then what was happening with the leads. I cringed at the romantic implications between Craig and Wilde (what is it about life-threatening situations that makes people want to stare all googly-eyed at each other and almost kiss?) and poor Harrison Ford was practically interrupted almost every time he was actually trying to bring some witty repartee to the table. I was very disappointed, it could have been a lot of fun, a lot of laughs and intense and exciting as well. Instead, we got an all too boring western/sci-fi action/adventure film that spends too much of it's screen time masquerading around as a Sir Arthur Conan Doyle mystery novel and taking itself way too seriously.

		<fullReview>I liked this movie. I think the people that didn't are either analyzing it too much or trying to be self important.I didn't like "Aliens", and generally don't go for those kind of movies, but found this one to be a good flick, despite some of the clichés.I watched it without trying to analyze it too much, and think that helped. I know what some of the criticisms are and I agree, to a point.It's been said that Daniel Craig isn't the best "cowboy type" for the film, but to me that's the point. He wakes up in the middle of the desert with a weird bracelet on. I think casting Craig for this role keeps you guessing. Is he one of the aliens in the title? You have to watch the whole thing almost to discover the answer through flashbacks. Craig plays a great western tough.As for Ford, I found his performance somewhat stiff, but frankly, he's always that way and this is no "Regarding Henry" or "Witness". To me, Ford's performance in any of the "Indiana Jones" movies were no better. But they were fun, and that's the point. He's made better movies. That said, I like Harrison Ford and give him the benefit of the doubt. His is a supporting role.As for Olivia Wilde, you get the idea she's "not one of us" fairly early on, but it's just an inkling, you don't know for sure until later. I'm really not that familiar with her. What is she supposed to do? She plays an alien in human form. They could have made her part more interesting, but it's only a two hour flick.We rented the movie from Blockbuster, so I couldn't see the extended version, but I liked "Cowboys and Aliens" enough to want to buy the blu-ray in order to do that, so either that means I liked the movie or I'm stupid. Perhaps a little of both...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll let others talk about the nature of the disaster here.There are so many disintegrated narrative chunks in this stew that you are forced to grab onto one. The one that fascinates me is what 'the girl' is all about. In the sort of generic western they quote here, she would be the home, contrasted to the call of the wild. The safety. Rarely in a western is the girl a prop to carry through dangers while she is threatened and screams. Heros and fatherstuff are roughly the same in both westerns and alien scifi, so the fulcrum around which the merger is balanced is 'the girl.'While the male leads are box office heaviweights, for some reason they chose a B or C list girl. This is someone not particularly appealing to the camera. In this era, she's someone who actually changed their name in the pattern of a porn actress! Maybe that was all they could get for the confused role.She is from another planet, we are told, the last survivor after the bad aliens took all the gold. For some reason after taking the gold, they went to the effort of killing everyone save her. (That aliens would come to Earth in search of concentrated heavy elements is entirely believable. The stuff the Earth is made of is vastly older than the Sun. And the concentration as a planet appears to be vastly more rare than stars.)Anyway, she gets here by means that are lost, and adapts the human form, also by magic that does not factor into the story. Thereafter, she is profoundly ineffectual, given the powers she must have. Think about how much more interesting this film would have been if it followed the women rather than the men. If Pedro Almodovar could have dealt with her frustrations at having to rely on these oafs to save the world.Her situation does have some dull issues, like the 'I'm in a female body so can't help kissing Steve McQueen here' syndrome. Calling Jane Campion!I'd like to recommend here one of the essential films from my must see list: Phantom Empire.

		<fullReview>We were all excited to see this, me and 6 of my friends had our tickets pre-purchased and we trekked out to the theatre which is in its own little way becoming more and more uncommon. I wasn't expecting much... i knew it was a comic (not that popular) and i knew it had a lot of cash and production muscle in it, not that it means its going to be good ... but the point is that i really wasn't expecting to be dazzled, maybe some Harrison/Craig action mixed with some sci-fi and sexy-ol' Olivia Wilde right? Wrong. At about 45 mins into the movie i had fallen asleep, my one friend sitting next to me noticed this and found it quite funny but, interestingly enough, the one sitting next to me on the other side didn't notice because he was asleep also. Noticing that we were quite peaceful i guess he decided to let us be for the remainder, which for the most part we both did. Im 25, I've been going to movies for a while now ,not to say that i know more than anyone else my age, or that this implies some sort of knowledge, but I've never come close to falling asleep in a theatre. Apparently neither had my friend. Consider what kind of a feat it is to fall asleep in a modern movie theatre, consider now the added problem of explosions at max volume and attractive women doing exciting things purely for ones enjoyment... how did we sleep for 80% of the film? Better yet how did i (and my friend) still manage to walk away with a perfect understanding of the storyline? Needless to say the film didn't deliver the action it promised, never mind all the other characteristics of good films...</fullReview>

The western portion is as stale as stable stuff and the alien element is completely clichéd and unconvincing. It all is presented with stodgy scenes with no suspense and no surprises. OK there is one twist in the middle, but that is so corny and contrived that all the characters react with nothing more than a dumb look as if to say, is it time for the next boring scene and they just move along as if nothing happened.The action is so routine and the aliens are so uninteresting that this comes off as something made by people who have never seen an alien film or a cowboy movie.</fullReview>

If you are looking for a Jon Favorue or however you spell it, this didn't seem like it, but it was still really good. If you enjoy movies involving the old west, which have been popping up, and you like sci-fi this is good for either of you. The trailers didn't give a lot away so a lot of things are discovered in the movie that you were not expecting. All in all, the story was probably a 7/10, the acting a 9/10, and the cast a 9/10. I give this movie an 8/10 and hope to see more movies like this.</fullReview>

Favreau,(who gave me a big grin when I said San Diego Baby! San Diego Baby!)For the movie, wasn't expecting that much, but the movie starts with Daniel Craig waking in a crazy spot. He is absolutely fantastic in this role. He really plays a great Paul Newman tough westerner. Oscar nods will come from this role. excellent cinematography, great story, flows well, and of course, great aliens and space crafts from the Spielberg clan. I would suggest at least 14-15 years old, as there are some pretty violent parts and would probably trouble younger children. This should turn out to be a big grossing block-buster.Great Comic con Experience, thanks Hugh for picking me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie with this title that delivers zero amount of fun really has to be considered a failure. The concept starts out fine but almost every scene that goes by peels away an uncomfortable layer and the film slowly degenerates in to an unpleasant time at the cinema. How did they end up doing that to this concept? Both leads start off as genuinely unlikable characters. As they move through the film, they slowly find redemption and win over the audience. By that time, as mentioned, the movie itself fizzles. The writers try and flesh out Harrison Ford's character but fail. Olivia Wilde's character is truly a contrivance and really makes no sense at all. The makers of this film in the absence of fun jam in death and semi-horror in hopes that something sticks. Overall, this is a mess of a movie from a cast, director and producers that really should know better.</fullReview>

A posse of cowboys and natives are all that stand in their way. Daniel Craig teams up with Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde to save the day. Problem? Nope. "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is a blast of summer blockbuster fun, delivering fun visual effects, consistently entertaining action, and fun dialogue to spice up the fun. This is the kind of film you would expect to be god- awful, but turns out to be super fun and enjoyable from start to finish. None of the actors try too hard to be serious, knowing what kind of film they're in. And producers Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard also understands what audiences are going to want out of this film.

If I had seen this movie without knowing the title and synopsis like I did with From Dusk Till Dawn which had me incredulous with its amazing twist. I had no clue as to what was to follow. Daniel Craig was unbelievably perfect as the confused clueless gun slinger struggling to remember his identity. Ford was exactly the hardened war veteran you wanted that had to think on his instincts despite what he was seeing. The originality was insane. The past meets the unimaginable and the necessary meeting of 4 different groups of humans in the 1800s just to defeat the darkness is something to revel in.

		<fullReview>If you thought Hollywood didn't know how to make a decent western anymore, check out "Cowboys and Aliens." Drawbacks: Daniel Craig is unemotive almost to the point of being an automaton; he might be in a zombie movie. The film is so purposely deadpan it never gives the audience a wink (filmmakers don't give their audiences credit for enough imagination). And while heroine Olivia Wilde is lovely, her looks are so very strange they're unnerving (there is a purpose for that I won't reveal).On the other side, the film is full of colorful characters, like the polite outlaw holding up a posse. Another excellent performance is turned is turned in by Sam Rockwell, in a small part. And though it's not mentioned much the movie treats the characters' spirituality with respect and even has a likable, sensible preacher (an extreme rarity in Christian-hating Hollywood).Harrison Ford, as expected, is excellent, though his gruff voice is a bit grating at times.Overall, a solid western with an interesting twist: what would happen if a typical western town was invaded with body-snatching aliens? Can cowboys and Indians with conventional weapons of the period hope to compete with futuristic invaders? Well, I won't reveal that part. But the movie is almost unrelievedly grim, with only Rockwell and the preacher being given lines of any wit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes cowboys and aliens has problems with it but it also has a lot of good to make this film a lot better then most people believe. The story starts in the old west where Daniel Craig's character Jake wakes up with no memory and the only thing he has is an alien bracelet weapon. As the aliens invade and kidnap people he teams up with the colonel played by Harrison ford to take down the aliens. Daniel Craig is a great actor and he is a good lead in this film and had more layers to him then I believe was going to be the case. Now the side characters are a mixed bag for me as Harrison ford is easily the best character in the film and he is the one that you can truly see the development of his character throughout. Also the aliens are cool looking even though we don't see them a lot. However, I did think Olivia Wilde's character was weak and I didn't buy her relationship with Craig at any point. I also found Sam Rockwells character to be annoying and childish in the film. The story is as expected pretty straightforward with a few twists which does take this unique concept and kind of bland it down. Also the script isn't great as ford and Craig attempt to use it as well as possible. The style of this film is great though with the western outfit to the alien technology. From the opening minute to the last this film looks great and this adds to the film. It can be slow at times but the last 30 minutes truly make this a solid film with its pulsating fun. Cowboys and aliens is better then I expected and I believe it should be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest problem I have with this film - we don't care for any of the characters.The beginning of the film presents us with two unlikable leads, and then asks us to care about them because they can't remember who they were, or because of their new-found plight.This film is already at a disadvantage combining two genre's that rarely get combined(especially with any success). And in those terms, the movie really isn't all that bad. The effects are pretty nice, and the film goes with the flow and ends a lot stronger than it begins. CHeck out "Burrowers" for another "average" cross-genre film that is similar to this - only it's better and has virtually no budget or big name actors. Same goes for "Purgatory".There's a love interest subplot that also lacks punch because Craig plays a guy that just lost his 'real' love interest; not to mention the new love interest isn't who we think she is(which presents a whole different problem for the relationship between the two).The action and Daniel Craig do their best to "save the day" with the audience and the characters' friends and family, but in the end, the audience gets left in the dark.Aliens attacking the wild west is way down the list of unbelievable plot situations here, and that's obviously not a good thing.You MIGHT like this if you liked:Jonah Hex(better), The Day the Earth Stood Still(remake/better), and Purgatory(better).48/100I didn't expect the storyline to be complex, but the script does a really terrible job of molding the characters. This was a HUGE waste of resources.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting and High profile cast don't make a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. Just watched Cowboys and Aliens. Before I say anything else, I have seen Harrison Ford in many films. and liked most of them. The only mistake he has made was being part of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. That was until I saw this film. Big mistake. From the start I thought the writers and producers of this film must have either been real gutsy or real dumb to make a film about Aliens set in the 19th century Arizona. New concept. But that was for a reason. Nobody wanted to make such a film. May as well have a film called Aliens and Sparta! Aliens invade Ancient Greece. Sparta, Greeks and Persians join up and kick Alien butt. Just as bad an idea.There was one good to this film. The acting. Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, Olivia Wilde...great acting. Unfortunately, you could be the best actor in the world, but you can't make a great film with a bad storyline. Will Smith = Brilliant actor..Wild Wild West = Bad Film.If you have a spare 2 hours and you love Sci-fi...like me, then you MIGHT at least enjoy the film. If not, don't bother. Definitely not worth buying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I expected and not in a good way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really sure what I expected from this film. Maybe Unforgiven meets Aliens, perhaps? But the reality is more like Maverick meets Independence Day, with none of the charm of either.Cowboys and Aliens is not a bad film, but it is a little more popcorny and action-oriented than I was expecting and less grim and dark than I hoped.I don't really have a problem with it not being what I expected. Sometimes the best movies are ones I completely had the wrong idea about going into them. But here, the popcorn movie-fest that Cowboys turns into sits uncomfortably with its darker, Western beginning.As always, I take exception to the illogicality of certain scenes, included for no other reason than they are mandated by some Hollywood script-writers bible.As a result, we get many clichéd characters and stereotypical scenes. It actually becomes funny when you watch a movie and can identify future scenes almost the moment the foreshadowing is done.So you get the boy who is given a knife and told a story about how it made the giver a man etc. Gee! I wonder if the boy will use the knife at some point in the film in a similar rite of passage scene? Or, the hero flashes back to the death of his loved one, and escapes, maiming the alien that did it in a particularly obvious way. Hmmm..wonder if we'll see that alien again so that there can be a personal reckoning between the two? Yep! And the above examples are what makes this movie rather tiresomely predictable. As a result, the movie it could have been is lost in favour of appeasing the great god Formulaic! In a movie with cowboys and aliens, it's hard for me to nitpick much. But there is one scene, right at the end that made me go Huh? The alien mother ship, replete with smaller vessels that appear to use some form of advanced engine technology such as gravitics, and who use the same gravity-defying technology to mine for gold (don't ask), is itself powered by a massive chemical fuel rocket? Wait...what? The final scene, which involves the alien ship attempting to take off and escape, then being blown to pieces, was uncomfortably similar to certain actual footage of things like the Challenger disaster. I'm not saying it was right or wrong, just that they might have wanted to rethink that one a little.At that point, I half expected the cowboys, townsfolk, bandits and indians (yes, they left no Western cliché stone unturned) to end up in a celebration a la Return of the Jedi, so cheesy had it all become.They really tried to cram too much into this one (even a small bout of Indian mysticism at two points) and it comes across as too busy, trying too hard to be good.As I say, it's not bad. But it could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rubbish title for such a good movie.. Wait.... oh no it isn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect much from this movie but it sounded like good light-hearted fun. From the start you are met by great performances, an intriguing story and great action. Harrison Ford is at home as a cantankerous land owner and Craig does what he does best (acts hard and takes a good kicking)Some advice. When they go after the aliens stop watching and make up your own ending. With some imagination you will feel like you have seen a great movie.Because from then on it feels like a Hollywood executive has walked past the set and thought 'hey maybe I can help with this.'. Everything that is rubbish about Hollywood alien invasion movies is hurriedly condensed into a few minutes of puke-inducing sentimentality. In the middle of battle everything stops so issues are resolved, unrequented love settled, bridges built to span mistrust and racism. I expected General Custer and Sitting Bull to run on and start high-fiving. Then battle resumes with new vigour and all of a sudden the previously bullet-proof aliens are felled with sticks and stones.If you don't take my advice and switch off early make sure you have a bucket to hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot more serious than the name would suggest. Decent effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I put off watching this movie for some time, for the simple reason - it sounded like a slightly spoof or comedy sci-fi/western due to the name. In fact this is nothing of the sort (thankfully) and is actually a very decent shot at combining typical western fare with an alien element. From the first (quite violent)and bloody fist fight you'll realise this isn't silly kids stuff. Too often these days, a movie like this would have been dumbed down and littered with comedic or slapstick scenes. The story such as it is, is basic, but believable. The way the movie plays, at no point do you question the believability of having cowboys fighting aliens with their obviously superior technology. It was something that concerned me before watching but it works out right and makes sense. No issues with any of the acting, or the effects. Overall a decent effort, worth watching especially for sci-fi fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better as a Comic Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scott Mitchell Rosenberg first devised this silly story as a comic book aka graphic novel - and it should have stayed in that format. It is worrisome to note in the credits that the screenplay was written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby and Steve Oedekerk: six cooks in one kitchen do not a successful meal create. So we know from the start that this is a joke and as a joke it becomes entertaining in parts and just plain silly in others - sort of like a comic book...The 'story' unfolds when a spaceship arrives in Arizona, 1873, to take over the Earth, starting with the Wild West region where a lone cowboy leads an uprising against a terror from beyond our world. A stranger (Daniel Craig) with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. The only hint to his history is a mysterious shackle that encircles one wrist. What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). It's a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky. Screaming down with breathtaking velocity and blinding lights to abduct the helpless one by one, these monsters challenge everything the residents have ever known. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been (excerpted from the package insert).Aside from Daniel Craig (still buff) and Harrison Ford (long in the tooth) the cast includes a lot of mechanical gooey multihanded and body compartmented aliens (identities withheld), Paul Dano, Sam Rockwell, Abigal Spencer, Keith Carradine, Olivia Wilde, and a lot of other one- liner actors. It is all rather silly and over the top, but then that is the popular concept in epic films these days. You pays your money and you takes your choice. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie irritated me, for exactly one reason: This film had no sense of humor about itself.You can't name a movie 'Cowboys &amp; Aliens' and not have some fun with the thing, but that's what Favreau does. I don't know why. Just a fraction of the chuckles I got out of the second Iron Man would have made this ten times better, just one character who throws out something funny on a semi-regular basis. But no, we get very minor league religious and family sentiments, and a love interest with an alien, wrapped in a plot with some extra-large holes. Come on, Jon. One really funny death scene might have excused so much...The graphics were good and the actors played their parts well enough, and I actually thought the cinematography was great, especially at the beginning. For a minute there, it was an arresting film. But... crap. Such a waste of a potentially fun premise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tired in both genres</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cowboys and Aliens was made for one reason - graphic novels have built- in fan bases. It's an unfortunate mishmash of sci-fi and western, rather than a cohesive mashup of same, that's just riddled with clichéd writing and acting. You won't want to suspend your disbelief so much as bungee jump it off the Burj Khalifa. Its plot barely works within the narrow confines of its dominant genre (western), and it offers one-note performances and even shallower special effects.A man (Daniel Craig) awakes in the middle of Arizona in 1873 with a metal bracelet on his arm that just won't come off, making it one heck of a lousy accessory. He knows nothing of himself or where he is. But that's okay, because after quickly dispatching three gunmen who figure him for a runaway convict, he heads to the closest town, where he gets himself into trouble by kicking the son of the local Big Man squarely in the cojones.You might be wondering where the aliens enter into this. Well, soon as our mystery man and the scion/scourge are locked in a wagon to take them to Santa Fe (not sure why, since they're in Arizona and not New Mexico), aliens attack. They send out these robotic tentacles that grab various, mostly dispensable townsfolk and take them into their little scout ships. Our mystery man is able to destroy one, though, thanks to that nifty jewelry. Neat gadget, that. The arrival of the spaceships befuddles the town, including local bad guy/Big Man Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), one of those typical iron-fisted, "I gave you your job!" yo-yos who feel that they own the town, which they often do. With perpetually gritted teeth and the occasional sneer, Ford tries very, very hard to be the bad guy, but he's just not that good of an actor. It hurt to type that. He's a terrific actor and makes a great hero, but he can't do evil. Then again, the movie's title might indicate that he's not the focal bad guy anyway, right?No one knows quite what to make of the spaceships arrival and quick disappearance, so everyone does what comes natural and rounds up a posse to track them down. It's quite a posse, with Dolarhyde, our now-named hero Lonergan, a woman gunslinger (Olivia Wilde), a kid, some old fellers, a Native American (Adam Beach, who is always stuck with that role), and a dog. The movie itself isn't terribly noteworthy, as it takes the blandest, most-repeated aspects of each genre and beats them to death very slowly. Putting aliens in a wild-West setting is creative; doing nothing with that premise is a magnificent failure. The aliens, as bad as they may be, are hardly even seen until the third act, as much of the plot has to do with the unbending Dolarhyde and the taciturn Lonergan at loggerheads. It's another one of those movies where Harrison Ford has lost someone dear to him, whether it's his wife (Frantic), his dad (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), or even his entire family (Firewall). Here, it's his shiftless son, played by Paul Dano. For all of his efforts to find his boy, Dolarhyde spends little time interacting with him or even talking about him. For the Colonel, it's all about running things and getting results. This is more of a Gene Hackman role than a Harrison Ford role. Ford's effort here varies between constipated and ineffectual, depending on the needs of the plot.The rest of the cast isn't bad. Craig isn't asked to do much other than look menacing and dish out some punishment, and he does both well. Wilde's job is to look pretty and reveal a big secret. Sam Rockwell is the town doctor, a nebbish who (why not) must learn to shoot a gun while on the trail. I won't blame you if you don't pardon this pun, but the movie is a misfire. It does have some real ugly aliens, though. But they seem easily thwarted, if you catch my drift. But a lot of things in the movie just didn't make enough sense to sustain the creaky plot, anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cowboys &amp; Aliens combines the two best genres boys know, Western and Sci-Fi. Jake Lonergan wakes up in the middle of the prairie with a bout of amnesia, wearing a strange bracelet. When he goes into a small nearby town he finds out he is a wanted man. But strange events interfere, suddenly the town is attacked by aliens abducting people, and Jake's memories slowly return to him. He is the key if they want to rescue the abducted people.The movie is pure fun. Action and special effects en masse, with a little humor and a few scenes that are supposed to scare a bit thrown in. It is entertaining, quite so, but suppose you must like the genre and buy into the story. This is about as far from realistic and plausible you can get.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weirdly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was reluctant to perform the not pleasurable act of writing about this movie, but I realized that I needed to get it off my chest! Yes, you should see it for its weirdness value. But you'll feel frustrated.It's like two movies in one. The first half is bewildering and boring. The only actor who seems to enjoy his character, right off, is Harrison Ford as a bossy, grumpy geezer. Daniel Craig plays his usual wooden soldier (throughout). Olivia Wilde seems present in body (yes, nice) but absent in spirit. The others seem to have "roles," but not "characters. There is a scene in the middle in which a posse beds down for the night, during which I nearly gave up.One thing that is still a mystery to me is why these old-west humans were consistently made to appear less fazed than I was by unimaginable events and explanations. But the action picks up in "part 2," during which "events" are explained, in a unimaginative, narrative fashion. Actors settle in to their characters. Olivia begins to shine.More could have been made of the contrast between alien technology and the clubs, bows/arrows, and revolvers of the Old West. These particular humans don't use their brains! The culmination of this movie's events is both satisfying and disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Clichés from Outer Space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm giving this movie a 5 since I feel generous and sorry for Daniel Craig. The script and direction for this piece of crap was so bad, that even normally-powerful actors like Daniel Craig and Sam Rockwell couldn't make it anything but B-grade sci-fi. Every scene telegraphs the scenes ahead of it. We know pretty much exactly what is about to happen because the laws of cliché demand it. Here's a list of the sins of trite scripting that are present:- Every fight is broken up by another fight. - The bad guys arrive right at the specific plot points they are called to. - The offspring of the rich always act like complete idiot assholes. - Nerd becomes hero with amazing aim after a few lessons with a rifle. - Gunmen covering hostages never actually shoot them even when there's nothing to stop them. - The hero has internal GPS, able to re-join the group even after a side/plot quest. - Wall climbing aliens apparently teleport where they're needed when the plot calls for it, but can be easily tracked by humans RIDING HORSES WHILE TRACKING. - Restraints give way at the darnedest times. - All Native Americans speak the same language and they can even retroactively switch tribes when battle demands it. - Aliens don't scout during the day, except for that one time when they did. - Dogs are invulnerable and also can teleport. - Groups of 40+ need next to no supplies. - Native Americans really just need a strong grizzled white man in their lives to give them direction and save their lives, unless they need to die to heal that man's old redeemable heart. - When people die, they just relax and look off into the distance. - When the armored alien can't get at the tactically-meaningless kid, it's time for it to -of course- expose it's most obviously vulnerable anatomy to said kid, just so a meaningful prop can be used at the right time. - All battles pause for a moment when emotional scenes demand it. - A kiss can do anything. - Every hostile spaceship must have a conveniently located tunnel/exhaust port/whatever that leads DIRECTLY to the unguarded main reactor. - Heroes can turn alien technology into anything they need it to be. Gun? No, it's now a bomb...cause I said so! - Aliens with weaponry that can explode rock will always charge unarmed into obvious choke-points.And then, on top of all this, there's the God thing. At various points of the movie, we're not so subtly reminded that heaven awaits the fallen in battle. This is actually very blatant, especially at the end. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind seeing portrayals of faith, and one of the better characters in the movie is actually a pretty neat gunslinger priest, but the film-makers apparently didn't want to just portray things, they want to make it a point.This movie only barely keeps your attention and abuses it at every turn. Congrats to the film-makers for trashing up a nifty concept.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie sadly needing a sense of humor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly, pretty much everything I see these days coming from Steven Spielberg is disappointing, and "Cowboys and Aliens" is no exception. As in "Super 8," the most likable character spends much of the movie captured by an alien. The scripters have delivered virtually no clever one liners and the battle between the cowboys and aliens seems to go on forever, with what appears at least to be at least 10 times as many cowboys being killed as were there to fight the aliens in the first place. While Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford make terrific cowboys, the script doesn't allow for much chemistry between them. I am impressed with Daniel Craig's taciturn performance. I never would have expected Craig to make such a fine western hero. While his actions are more reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's "Man With No Name," his gestures and walk reminds me more of Gary Cooper. Interestingly, for me at least, his facial structure reminds me of the great silent western star, William S. Hart.The music and photography is especially good, especially in the interior scenes in the overturned river boat. The cinematographer has made excellent use of Olivia Wilde's blue, blue eyes. It is too bad the script doesn't make better use of her character.It's also great to see Walton Goggins ("The Shield") back in action. It's too bad his role is so one dimensional and repetitious. Sam Rockwell is especially wasted as "Doc". Rockwell is one of Hollywood's best character actors and I was really hoping for more from him.It would be great for Craig, Ford, Rockwell, Wilde and Keith Carridine to make a straight western, instead of this uneasy hybrid. Oh well, maybe next time.I give "Cowboys and Aliens" a strong "6".</fullReview>

He's trying to rescue his no-account son while the Native American who looks up to him like a father figure tries to get some of his affection.Clancy Brown was a treat as the Preacher character. Daniel Craig was pretty good. Everyone else, meh, not so much.So these aliens are doing typical alien stuff, abductions, unnecessary surgeries, memory blanking. They refrained from the anal probing, so we'll give them that, but they are never really clear on what the aliens were kidnapping people for. I guess they wanted Gold, and that's fine. Just enough plot to hang the action scenes on, I guess.NO real surprises in this film, really. I'll give it an extra point for Harrison Ford, but that's about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant niche movie :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this movie yesterday evening, and i was positively surprised.Cowboys &amp; Aliens can best be descriped as a Independence Day type movie, set in the Wild West. It is a niche movie that test the limits of the Alien movie genre, and it works. I for one was beginning to get tired of Alien Invasion movies that all look alike. This opens up a brand new way to go with this type of movie. The only thing that really is annoying about this movie is the title and the first 15-20 minutes of the movie. With the title giving you the basic plot of the movie you find yourself watching a western and just waiting for some aliens to pop up. Also you are as a viewer dropped directly into the whole Cowboys vs Aliens thing. I think this movie could have been so much better if they had given it a "shock" effect, like From Dusk til Dawn. If it had had a better title that didn't give away the plot, and the first 20 minutes would have been a great and good western movie, introducing the aliens after some time would really have had people up from their seats :)Apart from that, it lived up to my every expectation, even though the plot is easily figured out by the audience so you will often find yourself just sitting and waiting for that thing to unfold on the screen. The action in the movie is just spot on, both the sci-fi action but also the old style Western action part is really great. Daniel Craig puts on a OK performance, he tries his best to talk hillbillie American, but it fails a bit from time to time. I would have chosen another actor for his part, maybe Ryan Reynolds?Harrison Ford plays his part great, he has a dark side to him that is not the usual Harrison Ford'ish role, this really works.This movie really aim at the male part of the audience, and it does not disappoint. If they where to make a spin off called Knights and Aliens, i would definitely watch this movie too :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 10 minutes of this movie are quite good. As a matter of fact I was anticipating so much more from the rest of it after watching them. 10 minutes in you kind of find the movie living up to its big-name actors and semi large budget.After the first "alien attack" I found myself urging for a fast forward button through every single dialogue in the movie. I don't have words to describe how bad the storyline is, but it isn't bad enough for you to watch it to find out, so huge spoiler alert for those who are reading this and actually are going to watch this, read no more. For those who want to read the storyline summarized, here goes: A dude wakes up in the desert, he's been abducted but he just walked out of the Alien cave (More like a gold mine, but it's a cave). He is equipped with Alien weaponry that fits like tailormade for his wrist. He kills some dudes, goes to town, gets his drink on, meets a girl (who is an alien who "took this form"), I think they hook up despite the fact that she isn't human or even a woman, they defeat the aliens by fighting Indian, white man and crooks together, the aliens are here to take over the earth for its GOLD RESERVES.3/10 for a hot female actor, the first 10 minutes and because Harrison Ford is in it, although his character is nothing more than a clich?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love SciFi and I will watch even the worst so I am often forgiving in my review of SciFi and I think I am forgiving here.The premise that a group of cowboys and Indians could overcome aliens with such superior technology is the most overt flaw of the movie. The notion that such aliens would be after our gold is a stretch. And the convenient way in which three disparate human groups, cowboys, Indians, and gunslingers, join forces so quickly was improbable. The story line brings my rating to "5 or below".What drops my rating from a 5 to 4 is the use of clichés - the boy given a knife to become a man, one leader saving another leader in the heat of battle - then the nod of acceptance. One after another, all very bad.What takes my rating from a 4 to a 3 is the fact that the special effects are not special. Fires and explosions look a bit fake. Aliens either move too fast or are too dark to really enjoy the effects. Flying devices are never really disclosed as to what they are. All very disappointing given the advancement of special effects.I'm left wondering why Ford and Craig took the parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a word - ouch.Okay, so we have a corking cast, a good director and a nice idea - which makes the resulting mess of a movie all the harder to fathom.I love the crackers idea of melding a western with an alien invasion movie and throwing so much acting talent at it. However, one of the main problems I had with it is that it doesn't think anything through to a decent conclusion - it's just a question of "yeah, that's cool, we'll throw that in, doesn't matter if it makes sense or not!" For example, if the aliens have bad eyesight in the daytime, why do they go out on scouting missions during the day? Are the scout ships manned or unmanned? If they're manned (as is suggested at one point), why did they leave the crashed ship in the town without checking it for signs of life? And so on and so on.One of the major issues that I had with this was the total and utter waste of the talent on hand. Why shovel in so many awesome actors like Harrison Ford, Clancy Brown, Sam Rockwell and Olivia Wilde if you just sideline them all and don't allow them to do what they do best? And the revelation as to who Olivia Wilde's character is was just.........nonsense to be honest. If something had been made of it, then that would have made sense but ultimately, it just felt like one plot twist too far.That being said, Daniel Craig was cool being a bad-ass and the smack down at the end was kinda fun - it's also surprisingly brutal for a movie rated 12A in the UK.Probably not worth making an effort to see it at the cinema, just wait for it to hit DVD or Sky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cowboys &amp; Aliens sticks to its guns. Symbolically, that might suggest a certain strength, but in truth it means the filmmakers couldn't have played it any safer. The story is a weak hodgepodge of ideas riding past the point of homage clear into Cliché County. The crisp, colorful visuals likewise present an unmemorable wallpaper of established western and science fiction iconography devoid of individual vision.It's a clear case of too many cooks. Credited to a screen writing seven, their conglomerated output is anything but magnificent. With a cast of caricatures that includes an amnesiac outlaw (Daniel Craig), a bumbling medicine man (Sam Rockwell), and a grizzled cattle rancher (Harrison Ford), director Jon Favreau's crack team of creatives had their bases covered with western stereotypes. Their failure is in their unwillingness or inability to add anything beyond extraterrestrials to the mix.Stripped of its sci-fi gimmick, the world collapses. These people aren't compelling in their own right, and their predictable reaction to an otherworldly threat negates the period setting. The titular visitors are off-handedly called demons, but the unique perspective of a society that hasn't yet read H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds is absent. Explaining the invasion using Christian ideology might have helped set Cowboys &amp; Aliens apart, but it subsists instead solely on the novelty of combining its constituent genres while doing neither justice.Presumably because the audience is expected and even depended on not to think, the screenplay circumvents such ambiguity at every turn. Instead of allowing our turn-of-the- century protagonist to make sense of the ordeal on his own terms, religious or otherwise, the writers employ an expendable, expository character to do it for him. Do we really need to know the back story and endgame of the antagonists? It used to be enough just to know they're here and they're dangerous.Then there's the aliens themselves. It seems almost unjust to criticize the creature design given how low Hollywood has set the bar, but Cowboys &amp; Aliens' take is particularly uninspired. Bearing resemblance to the grasshoppers from Pixar's A Bug's Life, these cartoony insectoids feel completely at odds with the gritty western setting. Granted, dichotomy is the name of the game, but when they share screen space with our human heroes, the result is more Who Framed Roger Rabbit? than was likely intended.But far more important than its intellectual and stylistic shortcomings is the fun factor. Cowboys &amp; Aliens has a handful of decent set pieces, though its climactic battle is too helter- skelter to impress. Aerial assaults in the aliens' mechanized dragonfly drones prove most entertaining, though remain too few and far between. Their unannounced arrival is especially memorable and chaotic, but as the scale escalates, the stakes never ante up.Cowboys &amp; Aliens is a hopelessly average blockbuster. Big stars, bigger budget, and zero staying power. Much has been made of the "risk" associated with Favreau helming such an unproven franchise. After all, where are the wizards, the superheroes, and the vampires? This is not a brave film, nor the work of a brave filmmaker. Universal Pictures inherits the slim financial risk that this oddball mash up won't recoup its hundred million dollars; Favreau himself takes none.In other words, he sticks to his guns. He fulfills his contractual obligation to bring the offbeat Cowboys &amp; Aliens comic to the screen, but traverses cautiously over the safest possible path to deliver it. Call that what you will, but cowardice has a nice ring to it. ? Colin</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good Sci-F/Western Hybrid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time that Hollywood crossbred a western with a science-fiction saga was the 1935 Mascot serial "The Phantom Empire." In this largely forgotten twelve-chapter cliffhanger, famous singing cowboy star Gene Autry clashes with an advanced civilization of subterranean humans over 20-thousand feet beneath his property on Melody Ranch. Technically, these subterraneans were not of the same Earth as Gene Autry. Instead, they hail from deep within the Earth. They possessed technology and armaments that Gene Autry had never seen. Of course, Gene wielded their own technology against them to defeat them. The fracas blew up because everybody was fighting over the radium in the ground of Melody Ranch where Autry warbled western songs. Since then Hollywood never mashed-up westerns and science fiction movies. Okay, Hollywood put dinosaurs into some westerns, such as "The Beast of Hollow Man" (1956) and later "The Valley of Gwangi" (1969), but these constituted little more than lariat epics about dinosaurs on the plains. The closest thing to a sci-fi western was the final installment of the "Back to the Future" trilogy when Marty McFly followed Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown back to 1885 in "Back to the Future III." The number of sci-fi western mash-ups is few and far between. NBC and Universal Pictures remade "The Phantom Empire" as a made-for-television movie in 1979 under the title "The Secret Empire.""Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is a routine outlaw western. Our hero, Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig of "Casino Royale"), awakens in the middle of a hot sunny desert. He wears nothing but his shirt and his denims. He discovers an unwieldy mechanical contraption on his left wrist. No matter what Jake does, he cannot dislodge the bracelet. Three of the most unsavory looking scalp hunters ride up and find Jake. They inquire about the way to the town of Absolution." When he doesn't respond swiftly enough to suit them, Wes Claiborne (Buck Taylor of "Gunsmoke") and his sons Mose (Cooper Taylor) and Luke (Matthew Taylor) decide that Jake may be a fugitive with a bounty on his head. Jake disposes of the Claibornes with rather adroitly without acquiring a scratch. He appropriates whatever fits and rides into Absolution. No sooner has Jake been in Absolution than he tangles initially with Meacham. Meacham (Clancy Brown of "Highlander") examines the wound that Jake has in his right side, and Jake explains that he has lost his memory. Not long after, a scene occurs on the street when a young, obnoxious man, Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano of "Little Miss Sunshine") shoots a deputy in the shoulder. He threatens Jake with his gun and Jake kicks him in the jewels. Sheriff John Taggart (Keith Carradine of "The Long Riders") rides into town, arrests Percy, and confront Jake in the saloon while a mysterious woman, Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde of "TRON: Legacy"), watches with interest. Jake takes on at least five opponents and fells everyone. What he doesn't suspect is somebody behind him who clubs him unconscious. Three cowboys are sitting around a campfire with cattle on the background when blinding lights fill the skies and things start to explode. One cowboy survives and tells his boss, Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford of "Star Wars"), about the strange occurrence. Of course, Woodrow refuses to believe him. At the same time, Woodrow learns that Percy has been arrested. He gathered his cowhands and rides to town. When he arrives town, it is after dark. Woodrow finds Percy locked up in a wagon with Jake and vows to free one and kills the other. Sheriff Taggart refuses to hand either prisoner over to Woodrow. Just when things couldn't get weirder, scaly flying contraption burst from the darkness and bomb Absolution. When these skeletal looking aircraft aren't firing explosive rounds, they deploy the equivalent of a lariat and carry off citizens. Jake escapes from the prison wagon and finds that the bracelet on his wrist has activated. He fires at the alien craft about to strafe him and knocks it out of the sky. During the fracas, Woodrow lost Percy so he assembles some townspeople, and they head off into the desert to find their abducted loved ones. Eventually, Jake joins up with them. What they discover is a little bit more than they bargained for. "Iron Man" director Jon Favreau and "Star Trek" scenarists Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and Damon Lindelof along with "Iron Man" scribes Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby have converted a fairly ordinary oater into a lively little science fiction movie. Happily, no matter how incredible the plot remains, Favreau and company play everything straight. They don't poke fun at either our 19th century heroes or the advanced space invader opponents. The creature designs are straight enough so the adversaries look idiotic. Nevertheless, despite their ability to spring anywhere at will in an instant, they won't prompt nightmares. The blood in their veins is not the toxic juice of the "Alien" franchise. Mind you, the alien villains here are plenty tough, and they die hard. Indeed, they are susceptible to Apache lances and bullets, but our heroes have to pour on enough of either to make them go down and stay down. These aliens have utter contempt for mankind so they don't expect the licking that they receive. They are virtually indestructible unless their own weapons are turned against them. These aliens wouldn't last a second against the spider aliens from "Starship Troopers," but they are formidable. British actor Daniel Craig makes a rugged, believable anti-hero, but Harrison Ford has the better role. Unfortunately, "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" bears little resemblance to its source material, Scott Mitchell Rosenberg's Platinum Studios graphic novel of the same name. Favreau and company have replaced the wagon train plot with the outlaw plot. Nobody suffered from amnesia in the graphic novel, and the aliens could talk. As it turns out "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" qualifies as a surprisingly entertaining hybrid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't quite as great of a big popcorn movie as say a movie like The Avnegers, The Dark Knight, Iron Man or anything like that but it's a good effort with a good combining of the western and science fiction genres. The combining of those two genres could've gone very cartoonish but Jon Favreau did a good job with it. For example a director who did a bad job of this is Barry Sonnenfeld in the atrocious Wild Wild West.The movie has a strong pair of leading men with Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, basically teaming up of James Bond and Indiana Jones if you will. And with the always great Sam Rockwell in a supporting role and Paul Dano who's a good rising actor in his own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We enter the story by finding a man (Daniel Craig) unconscious in the desert. He awakes with no memory and discovers a strange device on his arm that, despite numerous efforts, he can't remove. Before he's made any real assessment of his situation, he's discovered by three men who believe he'll bring them a windfall when they turn him over to the authorities. But, despite his memory loss, he makes short work of his would-be captors and moves on. Victorious but still with no memory.His wandering brings him to the nearby town of Absolution. Its inhabitants are nowhere to be seen until the local preacher (Clancy Brown) discovers him and offers to stitch the wound he (Craig) discovered when he awoke. Unfortunately, they are interrupted when Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano), son of the town's benefactor and all-around miscreant, causes a commotion and accidentally kills a Marshall and (Craig) subdues him. As a result, he's identified and arrested for crimes he's previously committed. Our amnesiac's name is Jake Lonergan and before being transferred, the town is attacked by mysterious creatures first referred to as demons but that are, of course, aliens. Hence the title.I was as wary as anyone when I saw the title of this film. I expected a farce with a poorly written script and star-studded cast. While the cast is chock-full of familiar faces (Olivia Wilde, Keith Carradine, Sam Rockwell and others) the film is engrossing, well-written, and easily one of the better films based on a comic book that I've seen in some time.</fullReview>

Really,Really Bad.I agree with the majority of users who said this movie was terrible,its really that bad.For viewers who gave this a 9 or 10 star rating, they may have just got cable installed in their house or just learned how to push play on a DVD player. Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig should never mention this movie to no one. When you see scenes in this movie with aliens shooting cowboys and Indians, yes I did say Indians,with laser guns that can level a side of a mountain, then you see these same cowboys and Indians shoot back with six shooters and bow and arrows, the credits for this movie should start rolling and the movie screen slowly close shut.</fullReview>

And the money collected of the viewers who went with hope for a good movie. For Harrison Ford is time to rest as a pensioner on the beach, the other actors can play in minor films. Poor movie, very weak! If aliens are more stupid than cowboys, why are UFOs? If they have flying saucers, why they do not have better machines for mining and extraction of gold? If cowboys are so smart, why aliens are smarter than their children? If viewers are smart, why don't they watch another movie?</fullReview>

Kevin Smith fans will know why I kept expecting a giant spider to turn up in the third act. This was a movie made by a committee, edited by a 'focus group'... and marketed by people who had never seen it.I wanted to see a novel twist on an old genre... I saw a shameful parody. I wanted to see Harrison Ford turn in a mature and masterful performance... I saw another parody... (and not that it was his fault).The dialogue was absolutely terrible... (by terrible, I mean Dan Brown terrible). The characterisations were embarrassingly predictable... and the resolution of the plot was a pale imitation of several hundred movies we have all seen before.I am trying to remember why I gave it a '3'... I can only think I was remembering Harrison Ford in Blade Runner!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanna see Cowboys fighting Aliens? Then this is your movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are certain movies where the title gives them away, and Cowboys &amp; Aliens is one such movie. A cowboy with no name, and actually no memory, arrives in the small Western town of Absolution, which is the theme of the entire movie. The cowboy, played by Daniel Craig, obviously has a dark past, one that he wants to be absolved of, though it is tough to be absolved for one's sins when demons (a.k.a. aliens) attack the small Western town and abduct the town's inhabitants. Cowboys &amp; Aliens is an odd sort of mash up of two clashing genres (Sci-Fi and Western), but it actually works to create fun action set pieces, and the credibility comes in the fact that the aliens are never called aliens but are often referred to as demons (of course, us from the 21st Century know what they are). The movie co-stars Harrison Ford as a gruff old rancher, not all that likable, and ultimately a forgettable character, and that really sums up the whole movie. Like Daniel Craig's character, this is a very gruff, straight forward movie that just doesn't have anything fresh or intriguing enough about it to make it memorable. While we have seen these Western and Sci-Fi tropes played again and again, there is a cheap thrill that comes in seeing these things come together in the entertaining action sequences shot by director Jon Favreau, but the thrill doesn't linger.I give Cowboys &amp; Aliens an 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I didn't believe other reviewer. How bad can it be as I was thinking to myself. Well, now they can count me in. This movie is a total mess!! I think this is one of the most disappointing movies of the year.Synopsis: After being attack by the UFO, a group of cowboys are after the alien in search of rescue their love one that the alien took.It all starts with the script that is a total mess. The story itself has a potential to be a decent action movie instead they opted for something 5 years old could watch and has omitted everything good for fear that it might scare children. Like a tiger without its claw, this movie is no fun. The dialogue is just weird (No way cowboy speak this way), and everyone talk, walk and moving about without any passion. There is no character development at all. The story is just unacceptable - almost seem like 12 years old wrote it. Seriously this is written by 7 screen writer? Really disappointed with Jon Favreau. His movie till date has been more or less watchable and more or less entertaining. But this is just bad. Like he never read the script before he did this movie.I think the casting was the main attraction for this movie. They somehow managed to get many A lister to be in this movie. All of them fail. Don't want to get into detail, but with so ridiculous character even A list seem like an amateur. Harrison Ford character is just sad!!! He was beyond awful.Overall the only good thing about this movie is its very catchy name. Yeah that is about it. The movie runs for almost 2 hours and they can't even put in anything good into it.Recommendation: skip it. seriously!! Rating: 3/10</fullReview>

Well I can honestly say that after watching this film on the TV I wish, I would have gone to the theater to see it. I think it would have been much more fun to see on the big screen. We enjoyed this movie very much.It has a interesting, fun story with lots of action and pretty cool twists and turns in the flow of the story. We liked how Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, Adam Beach, Keith Carradine and Raoul Trujillo's characters interacted in the story.

		<fullReview>I'm not saying you must have a lower-than-normal IQ to enjoy this movie...but IF you do have a lower-than-normal IQ, you probably enjoy this movie.The plot...whew...It has more holes in it than a horse-trader's mule! Where do they come up with this stuff?! First, Craig's character escapes 3 people who have rifles pointed at him from a fairly safe distance...then he escapes the townsfolk who have, get this, a $1 Million Dollar bounty on his head (a RIDICULOUS dollar amount for the late 1800's), then he escapes a she-woman-alien who's following him, then he escapes some aliens who chase him, then he escapes what seems to be 500 Indians (the actors were Mexicans in Indian gear), then he escapes some aliens again...then I turned the movie off! Who knows what he else he escapes from?! Craig's escape-ability would make Houdini blush! I don't like the word "retarded", but come on, what other word can possibly be used?!...I'm not Stephen King ya know! Get this...Craig once jumps from a running horse onto the wing of an flying alien spaceship!!! I can approach this from so many angles, its difficult to choose where to begin! I mean, really, how fast was the damn horse running in the first place not to be completely blown-away by a spaceship that conquered interstellar space travel?!?! Then, and you barely even need to be paying attention to notice, but...Craig is hanging off the wing of this spaceship, the one he just jumped onto from a horse, traveling at a tremendous rate of speed, which he then manages to blow up, and all the while Craig's frigging hat stays on!!! That hat would have had to of been welded onto his head for it to stay on there! Then he lands in a river and the hat is finally off his head...I guess that G4-like wind wasn't enough to knock the hat off, nor was the massive explosion he was just involved in, but hitting the water sure did the trick! Its just stupid. On a side note, the horse-to-spaceship-jump supplants the previously #1-ranked "Idiotic and Unrealistic Jump In A Movie", the bus-jump-without-a-ramp scene from Speed, down to #2! Also, beers were apparently .50 cents -- in 1883!! I get 50-cent beers during happy hour here in 2012! 50 cents in 1883 would buy you more than a beer?this movie makes no sense. Watch for Craig too, while at the bar, to hammer a few shots, then pours a shot, gets interrupted before he drinks it, then pours himself another shot in the shot glass that should have already been full! My buddy asked "How could they make such an obvious mistake?"?I responded with "You mean that scene or the entire movie?!"At the time of this writing, I've watched over 1800 movies...and this is one of the worst! It stinks.JD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't remember having this set of plastic figures as a kid, but I'm sure it would have been awesome! Cowboys on horses with winchester rifle and 6-shooters, aliens in little space craft with cool blasters. Oh the battles little Fat Man would have had!! This roughly described the "OH YES!" reaction to the trailers and even just the idea of Cowboys &amp; Aliens, but like most ideas out of Hollywood, someone ruined it like a child ruined by hippie parents.There's not a lot to spoil plot-wise ? once again, the trailers pretty much finish all but the last 5 minutes of the film. Daniel Craig is a tight-pants (VERY TIGHT) wearing cowboy who doesn't know who he is or where he came from (but he just has to remember?). He wanders in to town and immediately starts kicking locals around Bond style. He teams up with a bumbling Sam Rockwell, gruff Harrison Ford (minus his pretty pretty earring), and a mysterious Olivia Wilde who knows exactly what is going on, but refuses to tell anybody. Suck it, Olivia, here's what's going on ? aliens are taking people and they need to be stopped! Was that so hard? The majority of the film pretty much covers the "stopped" portion.I hated this movie. I had delicious beer to drink while hating it, and I still hated it! I had trouble putting my finger on it, but I think it can be summed up with stupid plot, bad acting, and bad aliens. The entire film had a single idea of "We gonna find them aliens and we gonna KILL 'EM!" No side plots, no intricacies of character. Once Daniel Craig remembered everything, all mystery was put aside. The trailer promised nudity, but there was none? unless you're really in to shoulders. There were a lot of sexy nude shoulders. Ford and Craig should have been a joy to watch, but they weren't. Even usually fun Paul Dano seemed out of touch with his role, just whining and wandering across each frame. Actors need to be directed ? they can't be left to their own devices ? and there was a genuine lack of any direction. It's not like they had good dialog (you just have to remember?) to work with, but Ford salvaged the Star Wars cheese writing somehow. Does that make George Lucas a good director, or has Ford just gotten feeble minded?The aliens need their own little paragraph. After all, they came all the way to the wrong time period only to be beaten by apes with sticks and little pebbles. Super 8, while a good film, had a pretty disappointing alien. He was a terrifying beast compared the the weird space-frogs in C&amp;A. Ooo, they're going to get me with their teeny hands! What does it take to get a good alien? I understand that you had to show the aliens pretty early in order to get the story moving, but they've gotta be impressive in that case. If I can't describe anything other than "tiny hands that may grab at you in very close quarters," you failed at Alien Design 101. There's a new The Thing coming out this fall and I can only hope it keeps in line with John Carpenter's unsettling masterpiece.Awesome title and weak execution take what could have been a fun, light- hearted romp into an over-serious film that threatens to bore you to death. And probe your dead body to see if it you've got any money left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good time is what I expected from this movie and, thank heaven, a good time is precisely what I got.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the year 2011, a picture like Jon Favreau's "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is both a rush of excitement and a sigh of relief. Excitement because it is taut, pumped full of spectacle and adrenaline (and very exciting) and a relief because it comes in the third quarter of a year where a lot of the movies have been either total duds or instantly forgettable swashbucklers. Admittedly, it is very nearly as silly as a lot of the movies I have dismissed in recent months (a la "Transformers: Dark of the Moon," "Red Riding Hood," "Green Lantern," "Season of the Witch") but it plays it intrinsically ludicrous elements to the hilt and yet still produces a spectacle out of it.And let's face it, if there is a man in today's cinematic realm who can make great spectacle on the screen, it is Jon Favreau, who recently made the two enormously commoving "Iron Man" pictures. Mr. Favreau has produced a very notable career in the past few years bringing comic books to the silver screen and he does that again here, this time adapting Scott Mitchell Rosenburg's pulp tale. I am unfamiliar with the original comic book, but the film is a wild mash-up of my two favorite genres, the science-fiction spectacle and the Western. As it opens, an man (Daniel Craig) finds himself stranded in the middle of the Old West with a cauterized wound on his abdomen, an iron contraption strapped to his wrist, and a mind plagued by amnesia. After tangling with some gritty swashbucklers in the middle of nowhere, he finds himself in a dusty cow town run by - what else? - a wealthy cattle baron, played by Harrison Ford. When both Mr. Craig and Mr. Ford's character's son are jailed by the local sheriff, a group of extra-terrestrial warships wreak havoc upon the town, in which Mr. Craig learns that the device attached to his arm is in fact an alien weapon. Several locals are captured by the alien warships and soon a posse of many mismatched individuals is formed and "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" becomes a rowdy posse picture, with the baddies being slimy aliens instead of scruffy bank robbers.Sure, "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is goofy, about as much as its silly title would lead you to believe. No offense meant to the comic book devotees, but how can you stage a story with gunslingers and aliens without some form of intrinsic lunacy? Mr. Favreau recognizes that and wisely, as he has in the past, incorporates wonderful touches of comedy into his more rough, straight-mannered bursts of kinetic action. The movie's got the same sort of dry humor as his "Iron Man" pictures and some of the same supporting cast and the results are effective. It's a modern touch of action movies to go for laughs amidst rushes of violence, but here's a moment where I actually did chuckle or even laugh out loud. And as an action picture, Mr. Favreau's talents do not disappoint or lag. Wisely moderating his usage of wide shots and closer angles and almost always keeping the camera moving (but not at a dizzying, out-of-focus speed), his combat scenes between the cowboys and aliens are dazzling in their own way, even if they are very much the same thing over and over again.Exciting as it is, "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is hardly perfect. It is dramatically uneven, with its down-to-earth human elements hardly as enjoyable as the comic touches. I found it very hard to believe in many of the dynamics between the characters. The plot also becomes, especially in regards to the character played by Olivia Wilde, a little too complicated, I think, for it's own good. But those are dismissible flaws for a silly action spectacle like this. The only real nitpick that I have about the picture is the lack of raw power in its villains. Thanks to the talents of the cast, the cowboys hold their own but the aliens are underwritten and not given enough attention to really hold their own. In addition, their computer generated imagery seems a little quirky and unfinished.So what if it is not a masterpiece? I was not really expecting great character study from a movie based on a comic book called "Cowboys &amp; Aliens." A good time is what I expected from this movie and, thank heaven, a good time is precisely what I got. In regards to the cast, Mr. Craig and Mr. Ford are their usual selves: charismatic and dominant over their scenes. Supporting parts are played quite well by Sam Rockwell as a nervous saloon keeper, Olivia Wilde as a mysterious girl in town, Paul Dano as the cattle baron's high-on-himself son, and Noan Ringer (improving from his performance in "The Last Airbender") as the stereotypical lost little boy just wanting a father figure.Footnote for my fellow Western fans: keep an eye out for a familiar old face, to be found in the very beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than what you've heard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, here's the thing. I pride myself on knowing a good movie when I see one. Some of my favorites are The Departed, Doctor Zhivago, Singin' in the Rain, Annie Hall, Closer and The Terminator (mostly the first one, when the those involved were hungry for an engaging story and were forced to be creative rather than rely on CGI). That being said, I think I enjoyed this movie because I knew EXACTLY what to expect when I bought my ticket. When people watch a movie and forget the spirit in which it's made it really irritates me. I'm seeing reviews for this movie that are filled with plot issues and lack of CGI precision. We are not talking about a movie that promises a deep script or stellar CGI. We are talking about a creative romp. A fun, summer movie that's meant to entertain. I thought it was fun, had just enough cowboy grittiness (Daniel Craig is tough and rugged but VERY aesthetically pleasing and Harrison Ford is pitch perfect as the crotchety, cantankerous Dolarhyde) and moments to make you jump. How can an intelligent person go to a movie entitled "Cowboys and Aliens" and be disappointed that it was about cowboys and aliens? Don't go in expecting Shakespeare meets Avatar, for cryin' out loud. Suspend belief. Give artistic license. It's very simple and so some people are making it harder than it has to be. It was fun. Period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cowboys and Aliens." Really? Has Hollywood run out of ideas? Sounds as terrible as "Aliens Vs. Predator" or even "Snakes on a Plane." Only an immature adolescent would come up with such an idea. Believe it or not though, "Cowboys and Aliens" is an excellent film. The film opens with John Lonergan (Daniel Craig), who is stranded in the Wild West. He has a mysterious bracelet attached to his wrist and has no recollection of who he is or what has happened to him. After a series of run-ins with unsavory characters, he comes to a town called Absolution. He encounters the mysterious and sexy Elle (Olivia Wilde) and the tough, no-nonsense Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). Within minutes, the town is savagely attacked by flying machines that capture and kill several of the town's citizens. The trio makes an unlikely alliance, and ride out to find their townspeople. Unlike many pictures nowadays, the screenwriters and actors are able to make the viewers suspend their disbelief and engulf them with a solid story and deep characters. We know the story is absurd and unrealistic, but it is pretty straightforward and even plausible. My eyes were glued to the screen for the whole two hours. And when characters die (in which several do), the actors are able to emote the sorrow and remorse and the viewers want them to be avenged. There are also plenty of jump moments to keep the suspense going throughout the feature.Having mentioned that the actors are great, they are perfect. Each embodies a character of the old west. Craig is like Clint's the "Man with no Name". He's a mystery and we don't know his whole story (until later in the film). What we do know early on is that he can handle both his fists and his weapons well. Ford is the gruff, tough hero, similar to the old John Wayne. He's not only a rough fighter, but he has to do things his way and does not tolerate others. There is even a pistol wielding drunk, a man with gold teeth, a bartender who can't shoot worth a darn, Indians, including one who know how to track, and a preacher who is not afraid to carry a rifle. Olivia Wilde, however, is not the typical damsel in distress. There is a twist about her character in the middle of the feature that I did not see coming. This fits flawlessly into the story's structure. The cinematography is a real treat. Many of the shot compositions that are used is a throwback to the old westerns?beautiful wide shots of epic landscapes. I also like how careful the angles and shots were used when the aliens were first introduced; it holds their physical identity as a mystery for the first 40 minutes or so of the movie. It's worth noting though that the lighting in the attack of the town Absolution is very dim, which makes it difficult to see what's happening on screen. Then again, it would be hard to see at night, specifically when under attack by aliens in spaceships. The animation is pretty good, but I was little disappointed in the creature design of the aliens. They reminded me too much of the alien in J.J. Abrams "Super 8". It works though, for the aliens look monstrous and are huge? this makes them perfect bad guys.The choreography of the fight scenes between humans and humans against aliens are very impressive. The director does not shy away from bloody injuries and wounds that both humans and aliens sustain from fighting. There are even scenes where aliens eat and beat humans to death right in front of the camera. Though a PG-13, this is not a kid's movie. If it were any worse, this movie would have been a hard R. It is a rare feat for a big-budget movie to have both a good story and characters worth caring for. "Cowboys and Aliens" pulls this off with finesse and brings a new look of the western genre to the table. It's not about men in white hats squaring off with men in black hats, but men on horses up against the monstrous beyond.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not expect much out of this movie; after all it is called "Cowboys and Aliens. At the same time it had some recognizable actors in it, so I thought it may be worth watching. I saw the movie on a flight so the alternative was reading the flight magazine. From the start the movie was predictable; it just went through the motions to the point that half way through I was counting the minutes. The characters were two dimensional and boring, (seen it all before) a quarter through you see on the back ground the usual token tough gun wielding female with perfect makeup skin and hair, to satisfy the feminist lobby. It has become so tiresome in action movies there is always the token tough female, they are so out of place that it takes all credibility out of the movie and story. The story has so many holes in it, the writers don't even try to justify anything that happens. Put it this way if I had paid for this movie I would ask for my money back. Waste of time. I give it a generous one out of ten.</fullReview>

They should refund peoples admission price for this embarrassment. Absolutely do not waste your time on the DVD, even if your buddy lends it to you. You will be ticked off that you wasted the 2 hours. The story is such a garbage bag of camp movie idioms that it is impossible to achieve that willing suspension of disbelief. It is scriptwriter masturbation gone bad after too many scotches. I can visualize the writers getting drunker and drunker, stupider and stupider, trying to one up each other with crazier and crazier ideas. The producer who actually allowed it all into the movie should have his career ended by one of Aliens or Cowboys or maybe the Indians or Indiana Jones or something.

		<fullReview>I expected so much more. The concept was a total run away that could have been an award winner BUT the overall concept failed. This is one of the most boring movies i have seen in forever. My mind can think of many ways this movie could have really blown you away. It seems they had a great idea but didn't know how to make it work. There's many things that are never answered in the movie as if it didn't matter. Great actors with a bad script. Im surprised they wanted to be a part of this disaster. It seems they had a very low budget with most of it shot in a prop town and the dessert. Not much was spent on the aliens nor their spacecraft and ships. It just irratates me that it could have been so much better. I woulnt classify this as sci-fi it was more western althugh I've seen way better westerns. Some movies i say don't pay to see but this one is don't waste you time watching it. Im not sure even kids would like this movie. Im glad there was no opening for part 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cowboys &amp; Aliens is a 2011 American science fiction Western/action/ET film. Directed by: John Favreau. Starring: Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not a single piece of line that you carry back home, an insult to the genre which is credited with some of the greatest quotes in movie history. From the start to end, I wondered, when would the REAL action start! No Action, No Humor, No story. With stars like Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, it was a real disappointment.Aliens abducting "Humans" in like 1800s with space crafts and digging gold which is also precious for them. I have to admit however, Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig gave their best and were in full action, but its just the story that goes no where.Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) wakes up with heavy breathing and an unknown metallic bracelet on his left wrist.Introduction to the character was great. When you're doing a western, it's always key to add the gritty nature. Harrison Fordis introduces as the bad guy. Indeed, a treat for the Ford fans. How often do we get a grumpy Harrison Ford out for blood? Not too often. Yet, later he becomes a good man and a good father going behind aliens to flea his son.In short, nothing that you'd miss if you don't see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why IMDb fails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie epitomizes why it's impossible to use IMDb ratings when searching for a movie to watch. There is no way on this green earth that this movie should rate above a 3 or 4. The acting was poor to the point of amateurish, the plot had so many holes in it you have to assume they expected the special effects to carry the movie. The attempts at humor were either in inappropriate places or not funny enough to take your mind off how bad this film was. I was astonished to find Ron Howard's and Steven Spielberg's names involved in this....well, Ron Howard's, anyway. So much of this movie just screamed "STUPID" at the audience. The only reason we watched it was because of the 6.2 IMDb gave it. Perhaps there was a computer error and the score SHOULD have been 2.6. I just thank my lucky stars we rented this for a dollar thru Redbox and NOT at the theater. I would have HAD to insist on getting my money back.Egads, I have to purge any memory of this movie out of my poor head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was surely a different take on a western movie and alien movie. Who would have thought two such different civilizations would exist in the same time frame. The movie was interesting, but there were some parts that could have been better.The story was weird. It was over a fight over possession of gold. Aliens after gold? Yes, it was said to be just as valuable to them as it is to humans. The aliens had a much more efficient and effective way of mining it over the humans' methods.The aliens could have been created much better though. They looked so rough and jagged. Their movement was a bit choppy as well. The "spaceships" they flew in were pretty sweet though. They kind of looked like a giant mechanical dragonfly.This movie is ideal for a person who enjoys both alien-related movies and cowboy set movies. But keep in mind that this one has a twist to it, and is not like all of the ordinary movies already out there.</fullReview>

Cowboys &amp; Aliens is different to anything I've ever watched it's I think not very predictable at all and is just enjoyable to watch a good old twist on country western with the added modern near future spin. Daniel Craig plays his role great As does Harrison ford (as always) I really do believe this film deserves more credit then it got I was always put off watching it after hearing people saying how boring it was and just complete and utter nonsense. But I enjoyed it I really did you feel like you get to know all the cast and feel their emotions Over all I would recommend people watch it apart from the occasional bit of gore the film is for the family I think everyone will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not so short rejoinder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a far from perfect movie and relatively recently Firefly certainly did a far more effective blend of cowboys and space opera. However, it is interesting to note that many of the folks reviewing this film here are having just as much difficulty accepting a Science Fiction Western as the critics had accepting it when they reviewed Firefly.This is the first film in years in which it felt to me like Harrison Ford was doing much more than going through the motions. His performance here is complex and carries an emotional arch that I have never seen him achieve before. I found nearly all the actor performances quite compelling, complex and engaging, although the character of Percy Dolarhyde was written as so whiny and wet that even a very creditable performance by Paul Dano really could not save it.Daniel Craig appears to me to be playing the stoic, turned in, thoughtful, but essentially violent man that has lately become his stock-in-trade. I have seen him do other parts that required him to give more as a performer, but in this movie he did all that the character required.As to the illogical "faults" of the aliens. As I watched the movie the first time I just assumed that the "killer scouts" we saw were a sub-species, perhaps a genetically engineered sub-species, of "soldiers" in much the same way that there are worker, nurse, and queen bees and ants that are harvesters or soldiers or scouts. It seemed obvious to me that these brutal killing machines were not the ones that designed and built the tech and merely the soldiers who kidnap "the natives" and turn them over the the less armored, slower, and more intelligent scientists doing the planetary survey for testing, who would eventually report the findings to the "kings" or "queens" who will decide whether the planet will live or die. (Since I wrote this I've had a chance to listen to the commentaries on the Blu-Ray and it appears that most of my inferences were correct.)A comment on Sam Rockwell. IMO no one can over-act so consistently, annoyingly, and clownishly as Sam Rockwell. For me, Iron Man II just barely survived the pure schmaltz of Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. BUT credit where credit is due, Mr. Rockwell's truly excellent performance as "Doc" in this movie gives me hope that I will never again have to endure another characterization gut-clenchingly strident and irritating as Justin Hammer.And there are many other excellent performances - Keith Carradine's being particularly notable. To me the biggest defect of the film is the speed at which the aliens move. Most of the time by the time you notice where they are, they are gone. In the commentaries Jon Favreau says this was intentional. To make the aliens more mysterious and therefore more menacing, but my aging brain cannot quite keep up with the action at that speed and I lose the sense of what is happening where, and thus how the action is being resolved.Cowboys &amp; Aliens is unlikely to become a "classic" like, certainly, "Star Wars IV" or "The Day the Earth Stood Still" (1951), but IMO it is a better than average production, with excellent acting, that pays respectful homage to Film's powerful "Western" tradition, but sadly based on a very odd concept.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, the Bad and the Aliens (mainly good though!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mixing genres that don't normally mix can be risky at best of times. Sure, put sci-fi with horror or thriller, but westerns? It's a gamble. Luckily, in this case, it's a gamble that WORKED.Cowboys and Aliens - just by the title you don't need much of an explanation as to the plot. Basically though, it's a B-movie that's elevated to the heights of an A-movie courtesy of some top notch stars (our very own Daniel Craig - doing a passable American accent and, of course, the ever great Harrison Ford) and a decent budget.The proper stars and budget naturally make a great movie with plenty of fun (if a little stereotyped) characters and realistic-looking (not to mention nasty) aliens to fight.The film's longer than the average ninety minutes, but don't let that put you off. The opening half hour establishes the characters nicely and from then on the action flows.Aliens who fly around in space ships and pack big laser guns versus cowboy with six-shooters and Indians with spears and bows and arrows makes for the perfect mismatch. You can't help but root for the humans. They do a great job and it's awesome to watch - the perfect popcorn flick. The only thing missing from the film was a part for Sigourney Weaver. I think it would have been great to see 'Ripley' riding with cowboys while slapping the odd alien along the way!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another comic book based movie, this time based in the Old West. Outlaw Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) wakes up with amnesia and a strange device strapped to his wrist. Eventually he makes his way to the old west town of Absolution, where he finds himself in trouble and in the middle of several unfolding story lines. This is all well and good since all are about to come together when aliens hellbent on taking over the world appear, and Jake and all the characters of the town are all that stands in their way.The Good: This is an A-list cast. Everyone in this movie could, and have pulled the weight of movies by themselves let alone in an ensemble like this. There always has to be a pretty girl and Olivia Wilde could sit still and fulfill that role ( a role that was originally tagged for Eva Green, an equally hot choice). It's got a little of it all, comedy, action, sci-fi, aliens, western, and gunslinging action. It's also a big budget blockbuster so the filming aspects, camera work editing and special effects are topnotch so it has no need to try and be some sort of artsy film, just a decadently fun one.The Bad: The A-list cast which is also a good thing, sometimes just drowns out each other. Daniel Craig has the main role but as the movie goes on, all the others have visible roles as well and that kind of muddies it a bit. I don't really think this film has a real identity, it at times tries to be, and fit into many different styles. At times it goes sci-fi thriller, at others a spaghetti western, a more modern gunslinger western, and a romance story, all with a little comic book type feel mixed in (It is a comic book based movie). It can become a little too much at times, and sometimes a little corny. There were other times that I started to feel it was running a little long and drawn out as well. Fortunately, it is a pretty fun, and entertaining movie so I can forgive some of that. I am actually pretty surprised at how much I liked it.All in all, I give it a 7 out of 10. It was a fun and entertaining movie to watch. It's got a bit of a dark edge here and there that doesn't make it a total cheese-fest, the A-list cast both helps and hurts, and it is somewhat original. Jon Favreau didn't do as great of a job as he did with Ironman, but it fits the mold of a big action blockbuster, albeit not one I will be hoping he makes a sequel to.Like my review? Hate em?

I would have also liked to have seen the alien's physical match up with the cowboy to be a little more even. The mother ship was pretty original too.

That is a pretty big request that they make for all the SciFi geeks out there that are the demographics for this type of movie, especially a graphic novel crossover. You guys cannot not stop thinking !!! admit it.Let's just give you the basics: The plot begins like a Spaghetti Western with a Cattle Baron (Ford) and a Man with no name (Craig)meeting in a town which is about to get a railroad passing through. The Baron who is called Colonel (what a surprise) has a no-good son who is a coward and a bully. A bunch of fish from outer space (the director says they are closer to turtles) that have faces similar to the Mon Calamari in Star Wars chase Indiana Jones and James Bond through the desert (I know you thought I was going to say Hans Solo lol). Oh yes, and let me not forget to mention that there is a very, very pretty girl. It is a attractive film to watch and Jon F has some real talent as a director.

Then also place would have been to the conflict that inevitably arises when you realize that you are one of the evil space found. C &amp; A tries to accommodate perhaps a bit much. The man without memory, which is obtained from its past, the gentle bartender who has become a shooter needs, the boy who will become the man, the mysterious stranger, a mysterious stranger still, the ratio of Dolarhyde to son and foster son, the ratio Dolarhyde and Jake ... and then even an alien invasion is thematically very much.Cowboys &amp; Aliens Olivia Wilde Daniel Craig is over long distances as a tough guy to beat me, which I did here lacked the depth of the script. I would like to learn more about the man Jake. Harrison Ford is good, if somewhat flat, which I put back on the screenplay. Clancy Brown as Meacham's great priest and died way too early in the film. Olivia Wilde would have earned more than eye candy as a writer Compliant take part.The film has no boring places, but with 123 minutes is too long to get Cowboys &amp; Aliens. The story could be told in 100 minutes as well. Then some of the clichéd subplots could have believed it.If you take a deep breath through and pushes aside all expectations, offering Cowboys &amp; Aliens 2 hours dense Wild West entertainment with extra fun by aliens.6,5 / 10 points</fullReview>

Plus the girl who sacrifices her life is pretty much what would be expected.On the positive side, it was really funny and I enjoyed it for the most part. I forgot it was pg:13 and so a lot of the graphic violence wasn't really needed. I had to hide my eyes a few times because the gore was a bit too strong.

And you can tell that Harrison Ford had fun making this.But there is an underlying feeling that there could've been a little bit more. A little bit more back-story, a little bit more CGI, a little bit more meat overall. As it is, it does feel a bit like an adult/western version of "Super 8", which itself was an homage to 80s movies. While not bad at all, I felt it did lack substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly entertaining action adventure if you get over it's deviated story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was planning on seeing this in theaters, but my attempts failed miserably and tried to wait months and months for the DVD release of this film even though I saw the mixed reception it had on Rottentomatoes. All at once, I had pretty low expectations after I got the DVD last week on my 18th birthday. Two weeks later, when I watched the whole thing, my jaw dropped and became so amazed and it had exceeded my expectations. To my surprise, this is a surprisingly entertaining and very interesting film.Sure, the story does deviates itself from the graphic novel it was based on with a few questions that weren't explained during the Men and Woman quest to team up with the apache Indians to defeat and destroy the aliens and the Dialogue for this film can be pretty mediocre at times, but I was too busy being enthralled by the action throughout the entire film. They're flawless and captivating with some very creative ones.Of course, how can I forget about the actors? Well, to my surprise, they were entertaining and a lot of fun. Especially Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford. I was like, "James Bond meets Indiana Jones? Dude, that is so extremely radical!". Even the development with the characters is exemplary at it's best along with the romantic relationship with Daniel Craig and Olivia Wilde (who also did a great job as Ella Swenson). To those who think that it's blend of both the Western and Science Fiction genres was distracting are dead wrong because I happen to like it's blend of western and science fiction that makes this film very interesting to watch.This movie has everything else that made this movie looked good including the perfect visuals, the groundbreaking CGI effects on the aliens, the excellent make up for the alien, the extraordinary costume designs and sets, and the riveting music score from Harry Gregson Williams. Even the pacing is pretty good.Although, not a masterpiece, Cowboys &amp; Aliens is a riveting and enthralling entertaining science fiction western and action flick worth watching for die hard fans of science fiction and western films.Rating: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gold rustlers from outer space...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a haggard Harrison Ford settling into his "crotchety curmudgeon" phase (his character comes across not unlike John Wayne's character in THE SEARCHERS, only with the kind of sappy sentimentalism we find in most of the Hollywood product these days), COWBOYS &amp; ALIENS could've been titled COWBOYS &amp; INDIANS &amp; ALIENS. Not that it matters; I'm just saying, you know...? The storyline is by-the-numbers familiar (ain't nothing like some clichés to keep the cowboy fans happy), despite the intrusion of the uppity extraterrestrials. (I found it more than a little odd that, at no point in the movie, did any of the main characters look around and question just who or what these eetees were. They were just some kinda flyin' varmits or airborne cattle rustlers to these cowpokes...) While you're at it, Hollywood (and while you're apparently itchin' to tell some supernatural western tales), why not go back to THE GHOST RIDER- the original, who was a cowboy. Giddyup.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you liked 'Wild Wild West', you'll like 'Cowboys &amp; Aliens'; why wouldn't you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked 'Wild Wild West', you'll like 'Cowboys &amp; Aliens'. I have seen the 1999 'Wild Wild West' movie with Salma Hayek, Will Smith and Kevin Kline, back in the days; I did not care much for it and thought it was a silly movie. I had no problems watching 'Cowboys &amp; Aliens' though. Perhaps someone who was relatively satisfied with PVA the 'Predator vs Alien' movie would like this movie; that would make sense and that's obviously my case.You have Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Keith Carradine and of course Olivia Wilde starring in the movie; Jon Favreau directed the Dreamworks production. Why would I not consider watching it? That was my reason for doing so. The cinematography was very nice, just as one would expect. The special effects were well done, though I didn't like the look of the Alien much. The acting, given the premise of the movie (see the IMDb storyline) was pretty good.I don't expect I will bring up the movie in conversations and may keep my opinion to myself, except in this review. I feel silly just reading aloud the storyline. One can't watch only thrillers and psychological dramas; a little silliness is called for from time to time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Get What You Paid For...Cowboys &amp; Aliens.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>COWBOYS &amp; ALIENS gives you exactly what you expect when you sit down to watch it; no more, no less. My hopes for this movie were higher than they probably should've been, but for all the right reasons: it was directed by Jon Favreau (who did great justice to the IRON MAN movies), and the cast looked phenomenal. After I watched the movie, I wasn't disappointed per se, but I wasn't thrilled. It was a passable popcorn action movie that works fine for a slow afternoon. It opens with a nameless stranger awakening in the middle of Arizona with a strange device around his wrist and no memory of who he is or how he arrived there. The stranger wanders to the nearest town, Absolution, and gets involved with the locals when he stands tall against the spoiled son of a local cattle baron. He's recognized as a criminal who was involved in a recent gold robbery and, when things couldn't get any worse, alien forces arrive and abduct a handful of townspeople in a violent raid. Now this stranger, identified as outlaw Jake Lonergan, joins cattle baron Woodrow Dolarhyde and the town's bravest in tracking the aliens that made off with their loved ones. Aided by a mysterious woman who may not be what she seems, Lonergan and his posse ride out to confront an alien race that has come to strip mine our planet. Wild West meets Outer Space in a genre blend that might take itself a little too seriously.Western films and science fiction come across as two polar opposites in the context of movie genres. I have a hard time wrapping my head around a truly good mixing of the two. I suppose you can say it's been done to an extent in movies like the original STAR WARS but that was less sci-fi/western and more fantasy/adventure. This is really as close as I can see anyone getting when blending the gritty drama of a western with the flashy, explosive action associated with an alien invasion. I don't think it's that Jon Favreau did a horrible job with the subject matter. I just think the premise was flawed to begin with. It's like trying to mix oil and water. It just wasn't meant to be. I could be wrong (in fact, I probably am) and there might be examples out there of western/sci-fi success stories. I checked out information on the original graphic novel to see if it was just a weak adaptation and no?no it wasn't. I haven't read the original novel but the plot summary I read looks like an explosive cheese-fest (two words: anti-gravity horseshoes). In fact, I give kudos to Favreau and his writing team for making COWBOYS &amp; ALIENS as passable as it was. It's got all the ingredients of a good blend: the mysterious gunslinger, conflict with Native Americans, a plot based around the most valuable resource of the period, and, of course, aliens. I guess they did what they could, right?The cast in the movie is loaded with all-stars. Hollywood's most recent go-to hero Daniel Craig does an awesome job as Lonergan (dude, it's got "loner" right there in his name?). Film icon Harrison Ford does better than he has in some of his other recent roles. And the supporting cast is rounded out with some wicked choices including the talented rising hottie Olivia Wilde, Sam Rockwell (one of my favorite actors and a bit underused here), and Keith Carradine. With an ensemble cast like this, everyone gets just enough story to keep the movie going with a little extra focus on Lonergan and Dolarhyde. There's a lot of little stuff going on here but the main focus is confronting the invading aliens. For whatever reason, this movie moved pretty slow for me. It's got its fun moments but the bits between the action scenes (the parts where the movie was supposed to be more "western") weren't interesting enough and I'd get bored at times waiting for the next battle. A lot of people have complained about the plot, more specifically the reason for the aliens' invasion. Personally, I thought it was a nice touch. A little far-fetched, but a nice touch. I hope the studios hadn't gone into this movie expecting the birth of a new franchise, because COWBOYS &amp; ALIENS was far from the blockbuster they must've expected with Favreau at the helm. In my opinion, it was just an "all-right" movie that promised to be more than the premise really allowed.But hey?at least it wasn't JONAH HEX.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such a strange and unique film. We have cowboys, Indians and aliens. Quite a unique mix. You have to give credit to whoever thought this up. I was left shaking my head during some of it though because it just didn't make a lot of sense. So many questions not answered. The acting is great, no complaint about that. We know there are aliens because of the title so I'm not giving away anything there. But they are here for our gold for what reason? Why not quietly land on earth, mine the gold and leave? Why fly over a small Arizona town and bring attention to yourself? Ah, because they want to study the weakness' of the humans. I see. Another question-a cowboy wakes up without his shoes and hat but has a strange electronic bracelet on his wrist? But why? Why does he have it? So many unanswered questions. Too bad because it is unique and has some great action. A lot of it doesn't make much sense though and for that I can't give it a higher rating. Fun action film with a unique premise that doesn't really explain itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can cowboys of the 1800s old western New Mexico save the world from an alien invasion? (Hint: We are still here!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always find it interesting to see what motivated the producers to make certain movies. The DVD extras have some interesting insights. It is pretty simple, in the history of movies there has never been a story where aliens and old west cowboys face off. So now we have it.Daniel Craig as cowboy Jake Lonergan wakes up in the desert and doesn't remember much. He doesn't know who he is, or how he got that bad wound to his side. Fortunately he remembers how to fight, and that gets him out of a big jam. But as he enters the nearly abandoned gold boom town, others recognize him as a wanted gunman. He gets into a scrape with a gun-toting kid, who happens to be the non-favored son of Harrison Ford as Woodrow Dolarhyde, the big man around the area. Rivals, Jake and Woodrow must end up cooperating to encounter the aliens who are scouting Earthlings to discover their weaknesses, and then take over our world for themselves.Yes, pretty much a hokey story, but it is fairly well done in a comic book style, and I found myself solidly entertained for its running time. Olivia Wilde is pretty Ella Swenson who seems to be just any other western woman, but turns out to be an alien from a different location, assuming human form and there to help save Earth from the bad aliens.Other notable actors are Sam Rockwell as Doc, Paul Dano as Woodrow' s spoiled son, Percy Dolarhyde. And Keith Carradine as Sheriff John Taggart . SPOILERS: Jake wakes up in the desert with a strange "bracelet" on his left arm, and he finds out quite by accident that it can shoot powerful, destructive rays. A flashback later shows us how he came to get it while in temporary alien captivity. This weapon eventually becomes the key to destroying the large alien ship as it tries to leave Earth. Ella is the hero, she takes the weapon inside the ship and they all blow up, ending the alien threat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shallow ripple in the Force.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is COWBOYS AND ALIENS a boring western movie, or a clichéd alien invasion movie? At some point, I wondered whether it was just a tax write-off for Stephen Spielberg, who seems to have phoned in his producer's credit on this one. At least he hired Han Solo.A cowboy (Daniel Craig) awakes in the desert with no memory and a futuristic bracelet attached to his wrist, which turns out to be a supercool weapon. A classic Eastwood-ian laconic avenger, this Stranger wanders into the nearest town, which is run by a mean-tempered rancher named Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford playing nasty). As the Stranger is run into jail, a strange anorexic woman with catlike eyes, a nice ass and an ironing board chest (Olivia Wilde) skulks around him and makes portentous remarks.Then aliens attack. Sounds dumb. Plays dumber. At one point, we almost wish that the movie would just remain a good old-fashioned Western, as the production values are top-notch, and fine actors like Sam Rockwell, Clancy Brown and Paul Dano are creating memorable, dirt-smeared roles. When mosquito-like extraterrestrial alien ships swoop down and start grabbing people and blowing things up, the tone is meant to shift to fun and action, instead shifting to stupid and eyestrain.(Note that even though the Stranger has that snappy arm-weapon, Han Solo is the first person to start firing back at the aliens! "Give me a good blaster any day...") Dolarhyde (great name, huh?) and the Stranger team up to lead a posse to rescue the snatched townsfolk from the aliens, who have parked their big cigar-like spaceship in the desert and are mining gold.Like INDEPENDENCE DAY or STAR WARS, the writers' lack of imagination for the aliens' battle tactics is astounding: the extraterrestrials have those fancy laser arm-weapons (one of which was stolen by the Stranger), yet when the cowboys attack their ship, what do they do? Run outside naked and start punching everyone.There are two good aspects to this poorly thought-out art experiment. One is the CGI. Far be it from me to praise CGI as a defining factor of a movie's quality, but I only mention the Computer Graphics as a comment on the state of the art; the CGI extraterrestrial aliens (which resemble the DISTRICT 9 aliens - no points for originality) are completely IN the movie. There is no doubt at all that we are looking at anything but rampaging extraterrestrial marauders that fully interact with people and horses and the landscape. On the other hand, they are purely used as 'device' - no characterization, no depth, just faceless, nameless things that the humans must overcome.The other powerful aspect of this film is the emotional connection that gradually grows between Dolarhyde and the young Native American Nat (Adam Beach - watch that boy! Oscars in his future!). When Dolarhyde eventually realizes Nat is the surrogate son he wished he had, special effects have already killed him - and through our tears we realize why the great Harrison Ford was chosen as Dolarhyde. Not just for the wealth of Han Solo gags - only Ford could begin as an unsympathetic, cantankerous villain and arc to touching his long-buried heart with such tear-welling effect. Making us weep like Ewoks.From the comicbook by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg and directed by Jon Favreau, with enough screenwriters to guarantee it was going to be a circle jerk, the mashup of genres in COWBOYS AND ALIENS is almost as dissonant as the same mashup involving aliens in INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL.Apparently, the overwhelming number of INDIANA JONES fans leaving that movie weeping in outrage was not enough to deter Spielberg from trying to "alien"-ate us again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Cowboys &amp; Aliens (probably more than most), but it has flaws that can't easily be ignored. It's longer than it probably needs to be, and there are lengthy stretches that are outright boring. Serious is fine, boring is not. The focus on Jake's (Daniel Craig) lost memory isn't exactly the most exciting way to tell the story, and the aliens themselves aren't that memorable or fearsome.&nbsp;Like I said, though, I still enjoyed it. Primarily because of the cast, which is full of some of my favorite actors (even though none of them really stretch themselves in their roles). And I won't lie, I'm predisposed to liking almost any movie that Olivia Wilde is in. Add her to Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, Sam Rockwell and Paul Dano, and it's one of the better casts of the year. The movie looks great, too, and when things do get interesting, it's a fun time.The potential was here for a great movie instead of one that was merely okay, and that's a shame. More memorable characters and a tighter, more imaginative script that gave all those quality actors more to work with would have gone a long way towards accomplishing that. Still, Cowboys &amp; Aliens is far from a bad movie, and I'd recommend watching it at least once to anyone who's interested.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was close enough to Frontier Earth that if you squint your eyes a bit you can see some of what that series might have looked like on screen. It does have action, and lots of it. Nice locations, aliens that look very much like I envisioned the alien Kra'agh's to be. But beyond the view, the similarity stops. And the plot doesn't fail, it's just missing, along with story and character development. So which would you rather see? this movie, or a more menacing; alien guy with amnesia in wild west with no wrist brace, but with a non-functioning AI unit in his chest. Evil aliens who feed on people and fear who can look completely human thanks to holographics. Alien girl searching country side for her lost partner, and cowboys and indians having separate encounters with the various aliens running around the old west. It would certainly be quieter and you wouldn't have Harrison Ford looking up at a sky filled with alien ships! Take your pick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally watched this cowboy film...it didn't blow me away, but it entertained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to go watch this film when it was at the theaters, mainly cause I liked the concept and it had Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford in it. I always thought Harrison Ford would make a good western character. Well for whatever reasons I never made it to the film. Then one night while at my girlfriend's house, she happened to mention she had it recorded on her DVR and asked if I wanted to watch it, so I said "Sure." Well I finally watched it and it was pretty good. Not super great or anything, but it kept me entertained for the most part. I enjoyed both actors mentioned above, as they made the movie more enjoyable than it would have been without them.The story has a man waking up in the middle of nowhere, with no recollection of how he got there or even who he is. He has a strange bracelet on his wrist which does not seem to want to come off. A group comes along and tries to take him in, and the man takes care of them before heading to the nearest town where a preacher fixes up a wound that he has acquired. Well a young man starts shooting up the place and it turns out his daddy is a cattle baron that basically keeps the town relevant. The mysterious man takes cared of the young man as he is shooting up the place and the baron comes to get his son out of jail because the boy accidentally shoots a deputy. Well aliens invade the town and the device on the stranger's wrist comes to life and he is able to shoot down one of the invaders. Townspeople are taken so the town forms a posse to track down one of the wounded aliens in the hope it will lead them to their kin. There is also a woman, who seems to know more about the aliens than a regular person has a right to.It is entertaining, however, it does seem slow at times. It actually does a fairly good job with being a western, but the alien portion of the film could have used some work. The explanation of them capturing the townspeople just did not work for me, mainly due to their reasons for being on the planet. It seems they could have done their entire operation in secret and not worried about dealing with the people on the planet. They also seem much too savage to be able to master intergalactic travel. They also look like the typical aliens you find in films as they seem like a combo of the xenomorphs in Alien and the invaders in Independence Day.Still, this film was entertaining and it gave me something to do. If Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford was not in it, it would have probably knocked the score down a point as they make the film. There are some good action sequences, but this film is not wall to wall action. It runs a little long too, as they could have cut a few scenes here and there. It also had a number of downer moments that one would not expect in a film titled Cowboys and Aliens...with a title like that, one just expects a few more lighthearted moments I guess. Still, overall it was pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What promises to be a mega budget all star slice of B-movie fun is instead yet another session of Hollywood hoop jumping with a predictable plot, clichéd characters and a lifeless script. Taking the reigns is Iron Man director Jon Favreau and while his film is a handsome looking spectacle, it's also a saggy one that plods along in a seemingly aimless way. The coming together of the energy and fun of the alien invasion movie versus the true grit, slow burn of the western genre never really pays dividends. For starters, the aliens themselves are a crude collection of computer generated nondescripts that serve only to jump and leap around in the most underwhelming way while at the same time picking off the disposable cast members. What's more, they are given no real introduction or mysticism which reduces their threat to that of your average video game gribbly. What should be the dream screen pairing of Indiana Jones and James Bond results in a chemistry vacuum in which both actor does his own thing in a reasonably solid but forgettable way. Olivia Wilde and Sam Rockwell tag along for eye candy and comic relief respectively, but neither gets much chance to shine due to a criminally witless script. It might look the part, but Cowboys &amp; Aliens is a mostly unrewarding experience that begins promisingly but gets lost and chokes in it's own dust. Yee-snore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take two of the most dependably capable and rugged men in Hollywood (Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford), add a solid supporting cast (Clancy brown, Sam Rockwell, Walton Goggins, Olivia Wilde, Keith Carradine), a superstar director (Jon Favreau) and a comic book premise, and you would think you've got the ingredients for a kick-ass Summer movie, right? Not here, you don't."Cowboys and Aliens" combines a mediocre western story with a mediocre science fiction one to create an overly serious slog of a movie. How's this for perspective: Clint Eastwood's somber masterpiece, "Unforgiven" offers more chuckles than "Cowboys and Aliens".Now, for all I know, the comic was just as dour as the movie. But with a title like "Cowboys and Aliens", and a Summer release date, it's logical to assume you're in for a fun ride, isn't it? Something that doesn't take itself so seriously? Maybe it's an issue of "too many cooks", what with six(!) writers sharing screenplay credit.But I don't think I've ever been so bored by a movie backed with so much star power. It's a Spielberg production, for god's sake! 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I feel I should mention that I am a BIG fan of westerns, and have been so for years. And there have been plenty of science fiction movies I have enjoyed in the past. So it would seem that "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" would fit my tastes. But it didn't, for several reasons.The first problem is the sluggish pace of the enterprise. To be fair, I watched the extended cut on Blu-Ray, which runs about fifteen minutes more than the theatrical version. But I think even the theatrical version would try the patience of any viewer. The movie really needed to be more snappy, more fast-moving, which it isn't.The next problem I had was with the performances. Nobody gives a really good performance here. Craig and Ford don't seem to be enjoying themselves, or acting to their most professional capacity. They end up making their characters really boring.The third problem I had was with the portrayal of the aliens. They are pretty unimaginative, being mute beings that simply like to cause a lot of destruction and mayhem. What if they were smart, talkative, and cunning? I think if they had those traits, they would be a really interesting foe.While not aggressively bad, the movie ends up being very mediocre and not worth your time under practically any circumstance, even if you are fan of westerns and/or sci-fi movies.</fullReview>

Another thing is that if Ella Swenson(Olivia Wilde) would be from another planet why would she have human emotions, or even be sexual attracted to a human. Just like the dog, everyone in the movie knows his name.

But it never succeeds as an action movie.It tries to be a rough tough western but characters are so busy being rough and tough it is hard to take them seriously.It tries to be a metaphor for colonial injustice but it fails there too.It tries to be a journey into our very nature as humans but doesn't really succeed at that.Oh, and always, the aliens have some really stupid weakness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saved by its geek value...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and I don't think I need to explain that all too much, but director Jon "I can do it all" Favreau's "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" has precious little to recommend it beyond the "high"--and, yes, someone must have been--concept and some mostly nifty fx work. Oh, Matthew "Black Swan" Libatique swoops the camera around well enough, and catches some great Western vistas and all, and like I said, the special effects are competent, certainly up to today's exacting standards, but even with some Tinseltown heavyweights like Spielberg and Howard involved, and a cast full of brand names, "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" fails both to transcend its childish comic book nature and, equally, to live up to it.Let's face it, when you get right down to it, the whole conceit of the film is the fantastical juxtaposition of two completely different genres, and for this to work, both ought to be equally strong, equally well-conceived, and sadly this is not the case with "Cowboys &amp; Indians". The elements of both are noticeably formulaic (in no small part due to a decided surfeit of screenwriters involved--five, count 'em, five!), and distressingly dull, almost stupid. The acting isn't as bad as many have claimed, but none of it is anything to write home about, and at least it's accomplished without visible tongues in cheek (which might have been the better approach), but even top-notch acting, let alone serviceable, can't save a script loaded with logical inconsistencies and leaden characters. A lack of star power would have sunk this turkey without a trace, and deservedly so. In an effort to mine as much clichéd fool's gold as possible, the storyline bogs down with predictability, illogic, and lack of credibility.Apparently it didn't take a complete financial bath, but it surely deserved to. I suppose everyone involved had fun making it--yay!--but the only real fun in watching it was realizing how misconceived and silly it all was, and how far Hollywood has sunk in its efforts to stripmine every last piece of gold out of our collective childishness and lack of good sense. Much like Roland Emmerich's horrifically bad "2012," this benighted film is probably best watched without sound. Definitely not recommended to any but the utterly bored and indiscriminate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has both cowboys and aliens - but precious little actual entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some times that I can see the future so clearly that I swear I am at least partially psychic. For example, next Monday thousands of co-workers will answer the question "You saw Cowboys and Aliens huh? What was it like?" with the following pithy quip; "Well it had cowboys and aliens?" Ahhh that's the good stuff.And there'll be the mutual 'good one' chuckle which will quickly tail off, followed by the watcher hoping against hope that a more detailed description is required.Because there really isn't one. Because Cowboys and Aliens is a far easier product to sell than it is to watch. I mean Indiana Jones and 007 facing off against a bunch of nefarious ETs? I'm finding it hard to go to sleep with this perpetually raging nerd-on.But now I've watched it and can think of not one scene, moment or idea that was even vaguely creative aside from the aforementioned casting and title, meaning Cowboys and Aliens is everything you expect, only somehow much less.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Jake (Daniel Craig) awakens in the blistering desert sun, bleeding, bedraggled? and bangled, as affixed to his arm is some otherworldly 'Leela from Futurama' like contraption. But that isn't so important right now, as Jake not only doesn't know what the thing on his arm is, he doesn't recall exactly who he is.Shortly after though he comes across three rogues hell bent on doing him harm, and he swiftly proves to the trio ? and himself ? that he is at least not someone to be messed with casually.With this knowledge ? and a spiffy new black cowboy hat that was filthy only seconds earlier ? Jake moseys into the town of Absolution.Jake quickly gains notoriety after a run-in with the son of a local big-wig, finding attention he wants no part of. He decides to head to the saloon and drink his memory back, however his newfound local fame has spread and he is recognised as Jake Delaporte, a wanted man with a price on his head.Fast forward a few moments and we meet Woodrow Dollarhyde (Harrison Ford), the local big-wig cattle man whose son Jake wronged, but before they can wait for High Noon to sort things out in the main street? CONTACT! Right, cowboy part over. After an unforeseen air-raid of sorts that sees many locals lassoed away to places unknown, a tenuous alliance between some of the remaining locals including Jake and Dollarhyde is formed, and the group head off on horseback for a totally non-remarkable final hour.The locals see Jake's wrist accoutrement and assume he must be an insider, they want answers, Jake insists he knows nuthink and he wants answers himself, and pretty random chickie Alice seems to know a lot more than everyone else, yet every time she preps to give Jake the skinny he wanders off. Maybe he just isn't that desperate to get to the truth? Anyway the final hour sees Jake learn about his past and the bracelet, everyone learns more about Dollarhyde than he cares for, and quite a deal more information arises about Alice. There is a section that is cowboys and naughty cowboys, another which is cowboys and Indians, and finally the payoff cowboys (and Indians) and aliens.For what it's worth the aliens look way too big for their ships, and I had them pegged as a bit (H.R. Giger) Alien, a big Kuarto and a bit Predator.Harrison Ford does little but purse his lips and wonder if this is really better than Indy 5 (it is) in more a supporting role than a headliner, Daniel Craig similarly broods a lot and when he does manage to spit out a couple lines sounds exactly like Buffalo Bill from the Silence of the Lambs, and Olivia Wilde sure is pretty in a role that in short confused the hell out of me.And Sam Rockwell is in it. Though now hours after watching the film I can't think of why that might be important.Cowboys and Aliens is vaguely entertaining and totally disposable, it has nothing that will be referenced, copied or discussed in years to come, not even spoofed in one of those lousy Epic/Disaster/Date movie moron efforts. Now that it is here it is simply one of countless films that exist, unremarkably so.Final Rating ? 5 / 10. Cowboys and Aliens is here. It will make a lot of money for a lot of people, then will be swiftly forgotten. Daniel Craig will still be 007. Harrison Ford will still be Indiana Jones or Han Solo. Jon Favreau will still be the guy who made Iron Man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the talent involved with this movie, it really should have been so much more. The dialogue is clunky, and often points out the obvious. The characters are hard to relate to, especially Olivia Wilde's character: she is so withdrawn and seemingly around for no reason until she explains what she is; which since we see none of her true self just makes her even less relatable. Craig's character is interesting until his mystery is completely explained half way in, which really hurts the story's momentum. The movie never really can find itself tonally, which really makes it hard to watch. The aliens are cool enough, but their appearances are always tiresome due to poorly choreographed action scenes. Watch True Grit and Alien back-to-back instead.</fullReview>

The final confrontation is at least laughable. I wonder why all the aliens want to land in the U.S.A. and not in any other part of the world.? Why ,in more than 80% of the films, they want to destroy our word, with no apparent reason? and finally why all of us are saved by American super heroes, who most of the time are brain-deads( the only realistic thing about these films )? In my opinion:better stay away from a film who is inspired by a caption in the front cover of a magazine</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Hum, Too Much CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jake Lonergan (Craig) wakes up in the desert, discovers he is wounded and has no idea what happened or who he is. He has a unique bracelet on his left wrist and has no idea what it is and can't get it off. Later he discovers Aliens from another world come around and kill everything in sight. Why? And, what do they want from earth?I think the movie, back in the day with Gene Autry, in the Phantom Empire (Martians were headquartered in a mountain if memory serves) was better. And, one could consider it to have been the first Cowboy and Aliens movie. No CGI, but better. You get the flavor of a western for about 10-minutes and then the CGI with Aliens takes over and oh, hum??this is going to be like Transformers?..a so-so simple story, and a lot of CGI. You are not going to see a lot of acting in here. You will see and hear a lot of explosions, Alien planes flying in and around everything blowing things up and people running, running, running. Wait, wait, they have Indians in here too. Almost forgot. Can't have a western without Indians, now can we?I noticed they had about 6-screenwriters for this and I wonder what they all did. It's a mystery. Now, what would have helped? Some good lines, a little humor injected here and there and more dialogue with all these big stars. Hey, they had about 6-screenwriters and they did nothing along these lines. Nothing. The other big mystery was why did the Aliens attach the bracelet onto Jake. If there was an explanation for that I missed it. Yes, the bracelet was a weapon of sorts. So why would Aliens put a weapon on Jake and was that intentional or one of those Alien Ooops moments? Hey, we all have them.The Aliens, laid off from the TV show Battlestar Galactica, had some bulk added to them to them and for some reason we saw hands that came out of their bodies when they got close to their prey, and no one is sure what that was all about. But, it was creative. Maybe that's what those screenwriters did. Hmmmm????Here's something for you to chew on. Harrison Ford is cattleman Dolarhyde and is depicted as a not likable, tough, mean person. In my opinion, Ford has tougher and meaner moments when his character is playing a good guy in other movies. He should not be made to play a bad guy because we won't believe it. Looks forced. I wanted to see this in a bad way, but the CGI killed it all and oh, hum, here we go again! Oh, the acting was okay, not great. Why all the A class stars? The title alone would have pulled people in. You know I would be there. All in all very disappointing. Bummer. 5/10.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No F-bombs, some SOBs and GDIs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a bad film. It could have been a 4 star film if maybe the played with the narrative earlier on but the plot itself is actually quite good and the best bit is the whole blowout at the end. Daniel Craig is brilliant in this film as being himself an Englishman his American accent is really good and his character as this mysterious lone ranger is portrayed really well. Harrison Ford does not disappoint as his supporting role is really good that he almost comes to the same level as Craig (in referring to the amount of focus the film has on the characters). Oliva Wilde is good, at first seems like an ultimate stalker for wherever Craig is at the beginning she is right behind him...being stalkerish. But she turns out to be not such a creep as she appears to be later on. The appealing thing about this film is the generic hybrid of the western and alien invasion genre and it's interesting to see how people of a western era react to an alien invasion, instead of seeing how people of the present day react (as it has been done before, not a bad thing though) so if you're unsure about this film, it doesn't hurt to check it out! However it can be pretty violent, maybe should have been a 15 rather than a 12A certificate. Oh well</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A serious tone collides with a ridiculous story and misleading title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the wild west, a man (Daniel Craig) awakens with no memory, even of his own name (who's his brother, Clint Eastwood?) and after taking out three assailants, makes his way into a mid west town, where he has another run in with the son of Sheriff Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford.) With the two men set on bad terms, they find they must come together when they find their small town under attack from aliens, while the man has recollections of his past that set him on a mission of vengeance.Having read one or two of the reviews for Jon Favreau's summer blockbuster, one of the most frequently occurring complaints is that it is too serious, lacking in humour for a film that seemed so throwaway. I personally didn't have a problem with the tone, which felt no different from something like Indiana Jones, the trouble is really the awful title that the thickest Hollywood movie exec probably just threw off the top of his head, giving false expectations of the type of film to expect. Not that the wrong tone could make a story this nonsensical and far fetched any more palatable, as it goes through the motions with all the clichés of the wild west genre, with some iffy writing throughout (to wit, sophisticated alien technology light years advanced to anything from the cowboy's time being destroyed by a single shot gun bullet to break people free from mind control.)Ergonomically, there's nothing wrong with the movie. Craig manages a decent American accent, whilst Ford has aged gracefully into the role of the weather beaten, facially groggy old timer. The alien costumes/effects aren't bad, either, but this is all superficially pleasing stuff. Everything that matters really isn't there and it says something when some stupid kids sat behind you in the auditorium making fart noises at pivotal moments provides more entertainment than the film itself. Or maybe it was the cast of Blazing Saddles? **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great title, visuals, soundtrack and action but soulless and unengaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I first heard of Cowboys &amp; Aliens it was actually one of my most-wanted-to-see movies of the year. However, when it came to seeing it I found it a let down. Not all of it is a mess though. It is a well made movie, with cinematography and editing to be admired and settings and costumes that are not only great but show some imagination. The soundtrack is fitting and memorable, and while the first action scene was a tad overlong, the action is beautifully choreographed and definitely one of the more interesting parts of the movie. Plus the title is great and one of the things that drew me in in the first place. The let downs however are in the writing and in the story. The writing is mostly awful, particularly in the slower moments where those moments are peppered with schmaltz, and the story is dull with little satisfactorily explained. Jon Favreau's direction is mixed, great in the action scenes, pedestrian at other points, while the characters are underdeveloped and little more than clichéd. Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford are decent enough but deserved much more than they got, while the female lead was annoying and forgettable. In conclusion, wanted to like it but there were too flaws that prevented me from properly engaging with it. 4/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Combines two genres with mixed results.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When two genres are combined on one movie, in this case the western and sci-fi genres the results can be mushy. This movie combines these two genres with mixed results. First, once again Harrison Ford proves that he is a great actor. His presence in the movie practically guarantees that the movie will be at least watchable, regardless of the story. How, regarding the story itself, it is clever and keeps the audience's interest. Daniel Craig gives a strong performance and the Olivia Wilde is stunning in the female lead. The one aspect of the movie that brings this movie down are the aliens themselves. Their portrayal as being little more than hysterical brutes is completely inconsistent with the sophistication of their technology, which suggests a level of social and intellectual development much more complex than than that portrayed. There is no reason why the aliens should be portrayed as monsters. Just because they are marauders and thieves does not mean that they are necessarily brutish or ugly. Nevertheless, the movie is watchable, primarily because of Harrison Ford whose presence saves this movie from being jettisoned into space, and to DVD land.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Bond and Indiana Jones vs. the Saucer Men from Mars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit it: I was ridiculously giddy when I first saw the teaser for Cowboys &amp; Aliens. I mean, Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, Sam Rockwell and an insane genre mash-up? What is there not to love? Seriously?Then the reviews began trickling in after the film's recent Comic Con premier. Most critics have lambasted the picture as being much too predictable, dull, or some synonym thereof. While I don't disagree that it pulls any unforeseeable punches, I do think the movie is a fun experiment that could have been much, much worse.Is it a western? Is it a piece of science fiction? The answer, of course, is that it's both. Cowboys &amp; Aliens straddles an extraordinarily fine line that sees it succeed on many levels, but there are certainly times where the logic of the whole thing is a little headache-inducing. It's surprisingly preachy from time to time, too. I mean, when you have a finale that sees Native Americans, cowboys, stage- coach mercenaries and the like joining forces it looks an awful lot like Independence Day (or any other "we've got bigger fish to fry" extra- terrestrial invasion flicks).For my money, the film is perfectly cast. Ford is great as the grizzled Civil War vet who's hanging on to just a sliver of humanity, and Craig is?well? his usual James-Bondish self (okay, so maybe he's not quite so debonair here, but you get the point). The ladies like him, he's an efficient killing machine, so on and so forth.The aliens themselves are slickly designed too, and they possess a noticeably menacing presence when they're tackling outlaws on horseback and using goo-covered mandibles to toy with their prey.Again, Cowboys &amp; Aliens is a lot of fun, but it's not going to set the world on fire. On the most basic level, it exists purely as a love letter to sci-fi fans who love ridiculously outrageous genre benders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this expecting a kind of campy, tongue in cheek action movie good for some eye candy. Actually, it was much better than I imagined it would be. If you can get past the premise, it's really very well executed. There's some common tropes and formulas, but nothing that stands out so bad that it becomes a cliché or really hurts your enjoyment of the movie. All the actors--and there's a huge amount of talent here--do a great job at making their roles into real people--no saints, no villains, just folks with their own quirks and flaws. Doubly so for Harrison Ford, who manages to take what could otherwise be a cardboard cutout antagonist and give him real depth. Enough that even though your first introduction to his character is him threatening to torture somebody for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, you end up liking him by the end.It's not Citizen Kane, but it's a good, fun movie you won't regret seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sci-fi western with great potential, which was never fulfilled and that took itself far too seriously.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a title like Cowboys and Aliens, mixing the genre of sci-fi and western (obviously done before with Will Smith in Wild, Wild West and I'm sure other films too) and with a star studded cast of Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig and Olivia Wilde, it promises the idea of a wacky and wild fun ride with the air of a good old fashioned adventure with great action and funny comedy. Unfortunately the end result though not a complete disaster is a rather bland and incomplete affair with too many problems with it to ignore. Obviously there are those that have said that a film with the title Cowboys and Aliens shouldn't be taken seriously and that it's just harmless entertainment and it shouldn't be nitpicked. However the tone of this film, which compliments Jon Favreau's intentions is to be serious and for us to approach it in the same manner, which is just ludicrous for a B-Movie such as this. So if we are going to take it seriously as Favreau wants us to then it has to be critiqued, both positive and negative aspects.What adds to this seriousness is the element of mystery that Favreau presents particularly surrounding the character of Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) like who is he? What happened to him? And what is that metal bracelet on his arm? There are also more questions as well that fit together like a puzzle as reviewer Terry Roehrig II rightly points out and again when all revealed it's very simplistic, which is a bit of let down as it just has that air of mysteriousness, which makes you feel as though when all is revealed it will be something exciting, but no. The film seriously needed to have more of a sense of humour, though there a few chuckling moments I did enjoy and Daniel Craig gives a great performance, it needed an actor with a sharper and wittier sense of humour. It has already been suggested Robert Downey Jr would have been perfect for this role who would have injected some much needed life into this soulless film. Of course an actor can only do so much with an awful script which felt poorly written and lazy. It was truly dreadful, particularly when it came to the schmaltz moments of Jake having memories of his wife and him and Ella (Wilde) sharing an intimate moment or two (They lacked any romantic chemistry) or various members of the clan trying to bond when they go off in search of the aliens that took their loved ones etc. I wouldn't have minded these moments but it was just boring and uninvolving and we don't come to care about any of these characters or what happens to them, though it tries to be touching. All I wanted was for it to get to the next action sequence.There are also large plot holes in this movie, which others have already pointed out and it just becomes too long. The last forty minutes in particular being the worst and when the film hit the eighty five-ninety minute mark I just wanted the film to end instead I had to put up with another tedious twenty five minutes. Faverau had this problem before of an overlong film (Iron Man 2) trying to go for character development and substance in which he just fails. The thing is there is a wasted opportunity for this as Woodrow (Harrison Ford) and Jake have a disliking to each other. Their relationship is never explored, though their in the same film together for most of it, they spend it apart with little interaction and dialogue. This makes it seem as Terry Roehrig II again rightly says it's as though Ford and Craig are starring in two different films at the same time. It instead ends up with Jake mainly interacting with Wilde's character Ella and Woodrow with some native Indian chief of a tribe. If Speilburg executive producer of this film had been in the driving seat, this would have turned out differently. However where Faverau cannot be faulted is the action sequences (though the last one was overlong), they were choreographed superbly with plenty of suspense and tension. These were the moments I most enjoyed. The special effects too were impressive with good leading performances from the three main stars, particularly Ford being a villain for once. The scenery itself was lovely to look at and there was some great soundtrack music. I did actually really enjoy the first seventy minutes being a few minutes here and there that were boring. I was at a point where I was thinking of giving the film a seven out of ten but by the end I was sorely tempted to whittle it to four, but I thought that would be unfair as it does have some saving graces, but really it's too rusty around the edge with a slow pace. With a better suited leading actor for the role (no offense to Craig), Speilburg being at the helm and the tone taking itself less seriously this film could have really been something of the highest entertainment. But it falls well short and the finishing product is a film that is messy and largely bland. The stars Craig, Ford and Wilde deserved better material than this and so did the audience. It's just a pity that the potential the film had was never reached or realised by those making it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bitter disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't outline the story as many other reviews have done that. It seems to me like Hollywood wanted to do another alien invasion movie and after realising just about every concept has been explored someone said - I know, let's set it in cowboy times! The fact that it is set in the old west progresses the story no further and really makes no difference at all - I can't think of one reason why it could not have been set in modern times other than the fact that if it had been, it would have looked so similar to so many other movies and would probably have not been made.Add to this a big nod to the "prey" video game, the "Halo" series and a reworking of the Independence Day finale and there is nothing at all new in this film which is very disappointing considering the talent behind and in front of the camera.There's nothing wrong with the acting - Olivia Wilde is very good and stunningly attractive, Harrison Ford is a pleasing, grizzled bad guy but at times almost slips back to being Indie -(it was fun to see towards the end of the movie during an escape he was actually ahead of James Bond! Life in the old dog yet!) Daniel Craig is OK but doesn't really bring anything special to the table and the monsters are pretty good but it's all been done before.Hard to believe Mr. Spielberg is involved but when you think he was also behind Falling Skies (again adequate as a time passer but not what you'd expect from the master) maybe he is losing his magic touch.I read that the budget was $163,000,000! That is crazy if true! The special effects are OK but not THAT special and most of the first two thirds of the film is talk and shots across the desert of people riding horses which means the majority of the cash must have gone on actors and the director I guess. The fact that this cost so much yet delivers so little reduces it from 2 out of 10 to 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Don't Think It's Bad; I Think It's Just An Incompatible Mix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trying to mix different genres is always a tricky process and, in this case, the two don't go together. A Romantic Comedy/Mystery or Romance/Thriller are OK but Science Fiction/Saturday Morning Western? Not so much.The Western is basically a Ride, with only as much plot needed or desired as is needed to justify the shooting. Too much intellectualization ruins the ambiance. Cowboys may be poets, but they're not given to techno-babble.Science Fiction, on the other hand, is information driven. It relies on scenes with people in white coats standing around theorizing. Even a pure ride like "Transformers" has the required scientific justification for its existence.If one tries to go for one genre or the other, the one Not chosen is going to provide Plenty of disconnects, and it's fairly impossible to keep both genres going equally in the mind.I chose the Western pretty early on, and just let the SciFi wash over me, dealing with the aliens as overbuff bad guys. As a result, I didn't have a problem with the fact that the woman gives a non-answer to the question, "Why do they want it?". Within the Western Canon, "They value it just as much as you do" is the right answer; just enough to keep the action going. Try to see it within the SciFi canon and you're left either angry or confused.Choosing the SciFi genre to focus on presents a number of problems on the other hand. One wonders why they don't grab more bracelets when they get the chance. The Western answer is that they don't know what they are, and only know that Craig's bracelet shoots because they have seen it. Cowboys wouldn't extrapolate.Just go back to being 6 years old, with a bag of popcorn on your lap and your knees on the back of the seat in front of you, and it all works. Try thinking, and you're lost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man with no name and no memory wakes up in the middle of the desert. He has no idea how he got there but it appears he has been in some sort of violent situation and there is a metal bracelet attached to his wrist. The stranger (Daniel Craig) unluckily attracts frequent attacks including bounty hunters, local thugs, and then aliens. He may not remember his past, but he certainly remembers how to fight and shoot. This comes in handy since the film's title is Cowboys &amp; Aliens.Craig moseys into town trying to find answers but all he finds are the sheriff (Keith Carradine) who has a warrant out for him, the town strongman, Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), Dolarhyde's pathetic son (Paul Dano), a mysterious woman (Olivia Wilde), and a nest of marauding aliens who attack from shoddy, metal flying contraptions.The aliens show no motive for their chaotic attacks on the town but they do kidnap some of the town folk with metal lassos. The survivors put together an ad hoc posse to go and rescue them lumping together most of the named actors who are now on the same side even though they were enemies just before the attack.The veteran actors take the material seriously and provide their respective enjoyable performances. Both Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford play grizzled and world weary men who do not seem all that shocked by aliens. They might as well be Indians or the other side in the Civil War. The supporting cast is less convincing and looks like they are just giddy to be in a film with Harrison Ford and Executive Producer Steven Spielberg.Paul Dano engages in a bit of farcical slapstick acting during his few scenes and his protector and team tracker (Adam Beach) is downright atrocious. He was quite good in Clint Eastwood's 2006 Flags of Our Fathers but seems to have lost his way here. Olivia Wilde joins the crew as an attractive woman who just happens to be in town and may not be all that she appears to be. Sam Rockwell doubles as the town doctor and bartender but is underserved with his small role and Keith Carradine who is always a pleasure to watch has barely any role at all. I have a feeling much of this cast signed on to be able to share credits with Spielberg and Ford.There are nine credited writers on this film which may be a clue as to why the script is not very good (too many cooks in the kitchen). The lead two screenwriters are Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman who appear to have worked together on all of their projects. They have produced winners with the Star Trek remake, Mission: Impossible III, and work on the Alias series but have also disappointed with the first two entries in Michael Bay's Transformers trilogy.The weight of the film feels light. There is no overriding mystery or any particular southwestern atmosphere. An Indiana Jones type mystique is absent. The script has the characters just bounce around between action sequences and lacks a positive narrative flow. Some members die, some members join, and then another battle scene will start. If there is only one alien film you get to see this year, make it Super 8 and not Cowboys &amp; Aliens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's see...Cowboys...Aliens...Aliens...Cowboys...Aliens and Cowboys...Cowboys and Aliens - yeah! That's the ticket, take a couple of disparate movie genres and mix them together for a surreal blend of action and adventure. My, my, the critics for this film are taking things way too seriously. I was pretty leery about this one going in myself, but just couldn't restrain myself as Westerns are my favorite genre. I don't want to use the pleasantly surprised cliché, but this was about as much of a blast as I was expecting.The mental picture of the title conjures up guns, shoot 'em ups and big explosions, and on that score the film delivers. I thought the aliens themselves were a little hokey, but after Aliens, Predator and the denizens of the Mos Eisley Cantina, there's only so much left to the imagination out there. The chest burster strategy caused me to groan a little for example, along with the nod to Butch Cassidy's kick to the groin at the former Lonergen camp. In fact, when you get right down to it, there's nothing really new or original here, the aliens even have green blood.But come on, it's Cowboys and Aliens! Nobody's ever thought of it before unless you go back to that OK Corral episode of Star Trek, and those aliens looked like the Earps and Doc Holliday. Just go into this one with one part of your brain lassoed behind your back and you'll be just fine. And for those of you citing this picture as the worst one ever made, your memories are just a bit short. Have you forgotten "Snakes on a Plane"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chix Chat on Film review: A man suffering memory loss in the old west with townspeople encounter an alien threat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a refreshing new take on two movie favorites that I have never seen nor expected to come together on screen. When I first saw the trailer, my initial thoughts were peanut butter and bananas, I like them both separately but the only person that I can recall who paired them to their liking was Elvis. This pairing of Cowboys &amp; Aliens proved to be an interesting and entertaining dynamic. The cowboy that we see this story centered around is Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) who is a man of few words, which is probably a good thing to keep the fantasy going of him being a real life true grit cowboy, giving that he is British. He looked the part so not a lot of talk the talk was needed, but he did do plenty of walk the walk. I liked the fact that through a series of memory flashes we get an understanding of his past and who he is as a man, and more. There was some fancy gun handling and a really cool saloon brawl, and a number of other staples that are common to this genre of film. This story all in all was very true to the good old American western, with an abundance of rowdy cowboys, an affable sheriff John Taggart (Keith Carradine) and the man who pretty much is running everything because he holds the purse-strings, Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). The only character that was a bit of an oddity and not really explained as far as her place or position in the town of Absolution was Ella Swensen (Olivia Wilde). She seemed to just be hanging around waiting for something and nobody seemed to find anything about her presence strange, and I found that to be strange. The film had a good pace, good early American costumes especially those chaps that Jake wore, and good special effects. But, when I saw the alien hand in the trailer all I could think was can somebody please come up with another color for aliens. Can we get a really brutal butterfly multicolored alien or something other than gray? I digress. This film like so many others proves that crossing the pond to portray a role with an accent other than your own goes both ways, Mr. Craig pulled it off nicely. Perhaps somehow an opportunity to reprise the role of Jake Lonergan will emerge but only if it is a good story as was this one. I seriously hope that we don't get inundated from copy cats with ridiculous premises like Frankenstein &amp; Aliens or King Tut &amp; Aliens. I really like westerns and I really like sci-fi so I give this film a fazer guns blazing green light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to watch a movie on a weekend. And it had to be "Cowboys &amp; Aliens". Frankly speaking, the trailers didn't capture my imagination. I thought it would be a boring movie. Just before watching this movie, I might have watched Indiana Jones played on a Television channel, and yes my mind was properly set to accept a Cowboy movie.When I entered the theater, and as movie started playing, the first scene was that of Jake lying on ground, fainted, with a strange gadget on his hand. Then he wakes up and fights with a bunch of cowboys on prowl. The music played, Jake's Theme, really grabbed my ear buds. It was really cool. Jake goes to this town, and there he's captured by the local police. Aliens attack, and take away people. Jake and few more cowboys go out to rescue the people taken away by aliens. This pretty much sums up the story, if you are still reading it.What really amused me was how well the movie amalgamated a Sci-Fi related theme(Aliens) with Wild West, and it was done quite well. The aliens never looked out of place or unnatural, nor did film look any more modern because of all the alien weaponry, it still retained its rusty wild west look and feel. It was as if Clint Eastwood met E.T., not so epic, but pretty damn good. As you might be aware, this film had lot of hype going about before its release, and it has lot of fans and good will. Expectations were other-worldly, and maybe it didn't reach up to the expectations of some people. But it deserves more than 7/10, it made me sit through out with excitement and gave me happiness and hence I respect this movie for whatever it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to hate this movie because I am a western character actor who auditioned for the film and wasn't cast. I went to see it expecting to hate it -- I wanted to hate it -- but I ended up liking it immensely. Great story, well-crafted, no plot holes that strained credibility. Daniel Craig looked authentic, and Harrison Ford was perfect. Good -- no make that terrific -- supporting cast, including Buck Taylor (too short a screen moment), Julio Cesar Cedillo (Melquiades Estrada) and many other excellent performers, Paul Dano as well. I was impressed that they could put aliens into a western credibly. Well done. Two caveats: 1) Took my 8-year-old and she was terrified of the aliens. They are quite overwhelming and the violence is extreme at times. 2) Why do producers insist on hiring actors and extras for westerns that look like hippies who have rolled in axle crease. People actually used to bathe and get their hair cut in the old west. It's incorrect to portray westerners as filthy. They weren't. And most didn't wear their hair long because it was a weakness in battle to have hair an opponent could grab.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read mixed reviews for this film, I wasn't sure what to expect. Some were very positive but others were less than enthusiastic. I decided to forget what I'd read, good and bad, and simply see it with an open mind and no expectations either way.I found C&amp;A extremely enjoyable. I'm a fan of westerns, but not really into sci-fi. The aliens in this film were very well done, however, and decently believable. The film stays true to its western setting, the characters are realistic (though I do wish their backgrounds were fleshed out a little more), and, more than anything, the acting is fantastic.The plot is straightforward. The biggest complaint seems to be the simplicity of the script. It's uncomplicated, yes, but I liked it that way. Will it have the most intricate, twisting plot you've ever seen? No. And with a title like Cowboys and Aliens, it doesn't pretend to. But will it make you laugh and cheer? Yes. In fact people did both several times at the theater I was in. All in all, it's a very entertaining action film with some touching, heartfelt moments. I'll probably see it again and I'll definitely be getting the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far one of the worst movies we have ever seen. Terrible acting by major actors Craig and Ford. In "sensitive" scenes, it appeared like actors were suppressing laughter. Characters were clichéd from the past 75 years. Movie was totally boring &amp; we couldn't wait for it to end. Some of the animated characters and scenes were not realistic. The whole story was a cliché. Story line seemed to be stolen from many other movies. "Alien" characters were laughable and not convincing as real protagonists. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but was vastly disappointed in it. Story was not worthy of the trouble of making it a movie.</fullReview>

Say what you want about Michael Bay, but his films while narratively inept have good action scenes. This film, however, is a such a drag. With a title like Cowboys and Aliens one should expect a fun and dumb action film. This film is dumb, but instead of fun, it is boring and plays itself too seriously.The actors are all mostly good, except Olivia Wilde, whose character is nothing but eye candy and a character devised to provide exposition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O.K. This one had six credited executive producers, five producers, four co-producers, five writers, two "stars" in the leads who haven't had a box office hit for ages and as source material a graphic novel nobody knows. We also have a awful lot of genres mixed together, whereas two of them, Western and Scifi, fits so much to each other like Harrison Ford's chest hair waxing to deforestation of the rain forest. BTW, dear Harrison, they do not "wax" the rain forest, they burn it down! Maybe you should have done the same to your chest hairs...Daniel Graig is probably more Bond in this movie than he was in his recent rather experimental Bond adaption. He has his high-tech gadget! The movie cost $165 million, another $150 million to market it worldwide. So it probably needs to do $400 to break even. Nothing seems to fit, at least the budget and the $36.2 million the movie made over its first weekend.Well, the title doesn't fit, its horrible actually. The movie makes no sense anyway, and you don't need Harrison Ford in a refrigerator for realizing that. But somehow Harrison Ford should have fit into this mess of genres, wasn't he Indiana Jones and Han Solo at the same time? But he doesn't, like his earring does not fit to a 70 year old cranky who takes himself as a very serious actor.</fullReview>

If you are curious, think 'Super 8' with Cowboys instead of the 1980's characters. The script and plot could well have been written by a half dozen or so Jr. High students in homeroom over the course of a week or so.The lead character is apparently the toughest super dude in the West to begin with. Lucky the Cowboys had him in the right place at the right time....and for the Indians.The big name actors cast must have had contract obligations to accept this job is all I can say. I cant say that I was even impressed by the special effects since every movie that come out now a days has the same level of effects as this.It was predictable for most all of the film with the exceptions of when it made no sense at all.

But, surprisingly, I enjoyed it all the way to the end. Of course, it's all very silly and predictable, but such comments would apply to a whole lot of movies out there. I'm actually more amazed by the critics here about the film. I don't know how such a movie deserve a 400 words or so critique, especially if the conclusion was 0 star. I'm told the writers couldn't come up with a good story, or that the actors were so and so Well, it's not Casablanca for sure, or Gone With The Wind. It's just a movie, entertaining, leave your mind in the lobby style and laugh in the wrong places if you must. Bring in the Aliens, the cowboys and the Indians, six shooters, arrows, lances, ray guns and what not. In my opinion all the superheros movies out there are just as predictable and silly. And for once, for all it's worth, I even enjoyed Daniel Craig this time around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a concept film that was put together with science, reality and culture all in one. It does sometimes hurt apparently to see reality with some viewers who only want James Bond/Indiana Jones/John Wayne as a starting point to what reality is. But wake up the producers did a fantastic job combining all the aspects to entertainment and reality and combined it a dose of human/alien nature. See the use of taking what would be a Western and introduce a new angle sideways that not only could have but most likely has occurred. Yet the recording devices of the past couldn't hold a candle...literally to the 20th centuries digital world. So, what better to introduce it than by folklore and the telling of a tale. The director here did just that with a story told that just happened to combine the best of mankind in all of its forms. The good that can do bad, the bad that does good and the coming together to accomplish the impossible.And as I mentioned earlier the truth does sometimes hurt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic idea, which the execution doesn't quite support</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien stories tend to take place in certain time periods. Usually it's the modern day, or the not so distant future. If they take place in the past at all, it's usually in the backstory and about how they helped to build the pyramids or something like that. So imagine if you had an alien story that took place in the Wild West. There are no time travelling characters or anything. The alien invasion is set to begin, but about two centuries before humanity is even remotely ready for it.Brilliant idea, absolutely brilliant. The title pretty much sums up the best part about this film. The setting is something we have rarely, if ever, seen and allows for some really cool moments. The film also has a strong cast to pull it off with Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford playing the leads. The former an amnesiac outlaw, the latter a ruthless cattle rancher. The film focuses mainly on them trying to lead an unlikely group of townsfolk against this threat none of them have ever seen nor have any context for.Where the film drops the ball just a little bit is the story. The starting point and the setting are both fantastic, but the film doesn't take full advantage of them. Mainly in that the story could easily have taken place in the modern days. There's very little reason for it to take place in the Wild West, beyond the coolness factor. Also, the aliens are your typical movie aliens. They don't speak, they look rather bug-like, their space ships are dark and twisted caves. You know the type I'm talking about. And that's a missed opportunity. Why not have the aliens take the place of pioneers, with the cowboys playing the role of Indians this time around? Or something like that.But, in the end, the film is a lot of fun, despite its flaws. It's by no means a great film, but it's very enjoyable if your reaction to its premise is a resounding: "Oh yeah!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fun movie. Cool concept. The story is thin but present. Motives for all parties make sense but aren't rich or layered. For example the aliens show up because they really want gold. OK, flimsy but it is a reason. I reckon the Cowboys wouldn't really know why these creatures showed up so how could the audience know? It's not like the aliens sent out a memo. So we just get to assume it's for fuel or building, who know's what. It is a fun one time watch if you are looking for an action movie and like sci-fi. It surprised me because I expected nothing and got a coherent movie within the boundaries it created. You also get to enjoy some big name stars that turn in decent work.</fullReview>

The opening scene was quite gruesome and in your face, I hoped the rest of the film could continue with the grittiness but alas it did not. It lived up to its 12 rating and teased with potential destruction only to fall short with a pop and fizzle. Very very entertaining to watch but maybe an 18 rated version would pack more punch, something with less prancing around and more action. Still, quite enjoyed myself and recommend if you have a spare Sunday afternoon. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) with no memory is stranded in the middle of the desert with a mysterious shackle on his wrist. Passing cowboys try to take him into the town of Absolution. Jake overpowers them. He rides into town with stolen gear and horse. The population isn't too friendly cowered by the iron-fisted cattle rancher Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). Preacher Meacham (Clancy Brown) finds the stranger in his place and treats his wound. The town is terrorized by the Colonel's son Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano). Jake gets on Percy's bad side. Then Sheriff John Taggart (Keith Carradine) notices Jake's face on a wanted poster.The town is all angry and unlikeable. The fact is the aliens come into the movie a little too late. The cowboys part of the movie isn't very compelling. It's a lot of posing. The story isn't all that important. If the movie is anything, it's to pit cowboys against the aliens. I don't see any reason to tease the aliens for thirty minutes. Director Jon Favreau should have made this a straight up action adventure. Instead there is some unnecessary mano a mano between Ford and Craig. They basically step on each other. Olivia Wilde tries to add some likability to the cast. The posse is filled with characters that nobody cares about. There is a twist that tries to make the story interesting. It would have been great if I actually care about anybody in the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining experiment in genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cowboys and Aliens? Well, why not? After all, if there are space aliens, they could just as well invade Arizona in the 19th century as Manhattan in the twenty-first. In fact, the main interest of this film comes from using the idea that alien space invaders attach Arizona in the 1870s as a rationale for combining the two most sharply defined genres in cinema: the Western and the Invasion from Space sci-fi film. The idea more or less works, mainly because everyone involved takes it so seriously: if anyone cracked a smile, the whole thing would dissolve into guffaws. The result is a watchable couple of hours of slickly produced entertainment, which combines the usual set-pieces of both genres in ways that are potentially interesting but never quite seem to engage each other. The special effects are state of the art, but the acting is a mixed bag. Daniel Craig is one of those actors who plays pretty much the same character in every film, and he lives up to expectation here as the desperado who escaped abduction by the aliens to play a mysterious role in battling them. Harrison Ford as his enemy and ally has a more interesting role as the typical Western powerful rancher bad guy: he starts off as a complete villain, but gradually develops into a more sympathetic character. As for Olivia Wilde as the mysterious spooky female lead, well, let's just say she belongs to the "Stand-There-And- Open-And-Close-Your-Mouth" school of acting.Recommended for fans of the lead actors or students of cinema genres. Advisories: lots of not too graphic violence, some foul language, one mild semi-nude scene; the vividly slimy aliens may be frightening to younger children. This review is based on the Universal Home Video 2011 standard Region 1 DVD, which has excellent image and sound quality; there's also a Blu-Ray edition available.</fullReview>

True enough,the movie doesn't have state of the art special effects ,as does the original, and the English translations may be off, but the movie makes up for that with good action and fight sequences that make you almost wish you were a cowboy. Plays out like a goofy live action anime with the extra hilarity that naturally comes with it.

		<shortDescription>Excellent cast, unique plot, so-so sci-fi/western action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just re-watched Cowboys &amp; Aliens to see if I missed something the first time. Nope, same results - it was an OK movie.Why is this movie just OK? The casting is superb! The best part is that all the characters hit the mark - the lone cowboy/gunman (Craig), the rich landowner (Ford), the beautiful woman (Wilde), the barkeep/Doc, his foreigner wife, the bad guy gang, the sheriff, heck maybe the best performance was the Preacher, the young boy, the Indian chief. Everyone was incredibly excellent in becoming that character - very believable.The storyline maybe? No, what a unique premise. A lone cowboy in the 1800s wakes up, doesn't know who he is or how he got where he got. He rides into Absolution, what a great name, and starts fighting back against anyone who pushes against him. Daniel Craig is the perfect casting for this Bond-like character who's on his own, and boy does he like it, while struggling with his past. Then out of nowhere, Aliens appear and attack. Holy smokes - cowboys &amp; aliens? in one movie? what a cool concept. They even capture humans and spirit them away. Where, why? And what is this thing on Craig's wrist - how did it get there? Lots of good threads that draw you along.Maybe it's the aliens then? No, they were fine, as far as aliens go. The aliens really resemble a hybrid between the Predator and Alien movie bad guys. Slimy, dark, creepy. They also seem to run like the aliens from Cloverfield did in NYC, and just as vicious.I think the failure to really win with this movie lies with the director, Jon Favreau (Iron Man). I enjoyed the IM series, but in Cowboys &amp; Aliens, there was not enough tight choreography. The chase scene was just too long. The whole ending sequence ended up being just too long. Inside the big gold digger machine at the end - again, just too long. How many times must we again see Wilde crawling through a tunnel. OK we get it, there's a race going on.You will laugh, you will cry, this movie WILL get you emotional. But at some point, you'll be saying - come on - get on with this. Much like many Bond films have big things exploding all over at the end, like the IM #3 too, this movie does the same. Life lessons learned - can't we all just get along (Ford and Indian chief). Other lessons too about letting things go, live for the day. OK, their preaching was just about right - not too heavy handed, again, just too long.The first half of the movie - excellent. The second half - too long, but interesting enough. All told, a decent flick, with a great creative premise, and above all, excellent casting, great chemistry, solid acting. Olivia Wilde - she's cool - she will impress you.You should enjoy this entertaining flick - it's worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great idea in theory...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the initial concept I thought this would be awesome, but it wasn't the blockbuster it could have been. I mean, it's got James Bond, Indiana Jones, the hot TRON girl, the old west, aliens, AND it's directed by the director of the first 2 Iron Man films - what could go wrong? Well, I wouldn't say anything in particular went wrong, but it never had the oomph one might expect from all of those ingredients put together. It was good, I enjoyed it for what it was, but something was needed to push it into the upper echelon of fun actioners where it should have been. Perhaps a shot in the arm of Joss Whedon on the action sequences. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over-hyped sums this film up pretty well.Sure it's got a fun premise and some great actors, but the story fails on several levels. First up: we wanted to see cowboys vs. aliens, not cowboys abusing alien technology and alien cowgirls.There wasn't subtlety - the whole abduction thing isn't surrounded by mystery, everything is plain as day. There wasn't discussion of the topic - who are these demons exactly and where are they coming from? The aliens themselves looked bad. Classic western character types weren't utilized... well, they were utilized a _little_. It wasn't all bad. Harrison Ford takes on the "tough rich guy"-trope with great results. Daniel Craig is badass as ever. Olivia Wilde is beautiful, but her character suffers from really bad lines, stuff that is supposed to be cryptic but is really just obvious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't see what the problem is here. Cowboys &amp; Aliens was a fun, action-packed, genre-bending and big-budgeted Bmovie. And for me to like it means something; I am not fond of westerns nor subscribe to the alien-invasion films.We've had hundreds of alien movies and even more westerns. But, how much more vulnerable are we (humans) are against alien life forms than in the old west? At least this film shined the light on a new angle to the age-old creature assault kind.Believe it: we have everything handed to us from the two separate types that we would love if we cared for both genres. A man with no name. A man who runs "the town." Aliens with a mission of extraction. A beauty with a secret. A secret weapon triggered by emotion ? oh, wait, that's kinda like the Hulk, but still.I enjoyed my time here. It was a fun and (mildly) leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature. Daniel Craig (Man with No Name/Memory) did great and had some exciting action, hand-to-hand combat. The ever lovely Olivia Wilde kept her secret safe to add tension. And the town ? and desert neighbors ? were alive with great and well-known characters.Sure, the movie wasn't perfect?Harrison Ford was annoying, as usual. Why he couldn't be the one that threatened, and then kept, retirement plans like all the other actors that irresponsibly and prematurely stated is beyond me. His last great role was 1997's Air Force One. Please Ford, leave. I'd say, "While you're ahead" but that was 14 years ago. We'll still remember you as one of the greats, but you've dug your own grave for far too long.Basic synopsis: Man wakes in desert with no memory and makes way to dysfunctional old-west town which is about to be attacked by aliens. It's up to the disagreeing town folk and neighbors to align forces, with (primitive to us, or regular movie-goer's expectations) whatever weapons possible to defeat the greedy out-of-spacers.Really, it's that simple and stretched for two hours. It should've been shorter, but it still worked and was a fun ride. Even if you're not keen to westerns and/or alien stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cowboys &amp; AliensThe real reason extraterrestrials visited the Old West was because outhouses were the ideal probing stations.And while they aren't knee-deep in pioneer poop, the aliens in this sci-fi film are abducting cowpoke at an alarming rate.Waking in a desert with no recollection of who he is, or what the device fettered to his wrist is, Jake (Daniel Craig) heads to the nearest town for answers.There, he runs afoul of Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), a wealthy cattleman he fleeced earlier.Before they can duel, however, aliens attack and snatch up citizens, including Dolarhyde's son (Paul Dano).Now, a posse consisting of Dolarhyde, Jake, Doc (Sam Rockwell) and a drifter (Olivia Wilde) must embark on a rescue mission.While the genre amalgamation is bewildering at first, the end product is succinct and surprisingly entertaining.However, instead of annihilating them, early-Americans should've teamed with the aliens to steal Texas from Mexico.

		<shortDescription>Cowboys &amp; Aliens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨Whether you end up in Heaven or Hell isn't God's plan, it's your own. You just have to remember what it is.¨In Cowboys &amp; Aliens Jon Favreau meshes two genres that I never thought I would see in a same movie: a Western and Sci-fi film involving an alien invasion. The idea is pretty original considering we've seen several alien invasion films like Men in Black and Independence Day, but they all take place in big modern day cities. Cowboys &amp; Aliens on the other hand takes place in a small Arizona town during 1873 where local cowboys have to unite with bandits and Indians in order to fight against these aliens. The idea which was based on an independent comic book was great, but the film itself is mediocre. One of the main problems in my opinion is that there were too many people involved in the adaptation of the screenplay. It's never a good sign when you have more than five people writing the story. Jon Favreau proved in Iron Man that he can direct great films, but this time he was missing an actor like Robert Downey Jr. who can deliver great action scenes along with some comic relief. Downey Jr. was actually Favreau's first choice to play the lead role, but due to scheduling conflicts he had to go with Daniel Craig. Craig is a great action star (he was great in Casino Royale), but he doesn't have the charisma that Downey Jr. has and it could've came handy in this role. Cowboys &amp; Aliens had plenty of well staged action scenes, but the comedy was missing. I think some humor could have worked better to let the audience know that this movie should be taken lightly considering the title and the plot. I still enjoyed the movie, but I've seen a lot better westerns and sci-fi flicks on their own. Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) wakes up near a small town in Arizona with no memory as to what has happened to him or who he is. He has a strange bracelet in his arm and a cut near his abdomen. Once he arrives in the small town he has a dispute with a young kid named Percy (Paul Dano) who thinks he can do what he wants because his father is a rich and important cattle man: Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). Woodrow used to be a Colonel during the Civil War, but now he runs the town known as Absolution. The local Sheriff (Keith Carradine) discovers that Jake is a wanted man and locks him in prison, but Woodrow wants his head because apparently Jake has stolen gold from him. Jake has no memory of this, but a young local woman named Ella (Olivia Wilde) seems to know more about him. It's during this dispute between the Colonel and the Sheriff that the aliens attack the small town and abduct about half of the population, including Woodraw's son. The few cowboys that remain decide it's best to settle their differences and unite in order to try to find the aliens. Jake discovers that his bracelet works as a powerful weapon against the aliens and he can be their only hope. As the search begins, Jake begins remembering things about his past and piecing things together with the help of Ella.Daniel Craig is a great actor, but I don't think this was the right role for him. Harrison Ford has been playing similar roles as a grumpy old man and I really think he can do a lot better. Olivia Wilde is beautiful, but she doesn't have much to work with in the role she was given. She pretty much stares at Jake all the time, and we get to see her pretty eyes a lot, but that's about it. Sam Rockwell is very talented and he does what he can with the small role he was given, but I insist a much more comedic approach should have been taken with this film. More comedy, less action. The special effects were good, the action scenes also pretty entertaining and the aliens looked cool, but that is about it. I really like the cast, but they were just given poor material to work with. I still had a decent time with the film, but I was expecting a little more from Favreau and the boys. Cowboys &amp; Aliens is fun, but I've enjoyed regular Westerns or Sci-Fi films a lot better. For example I would much rather prefer seeing True Grit, a straight up Western, than this film. What I mean to say is that there are a lot better looking Westerns and Sci-Fi films on their own, and this film would have been a lot better if the meshed genres were better. I still recommend this movie, just don't go into it with great expectations. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the trailers, I was really looking forward to this movie. And now that I have seen it, I can honestly say that I wasn't disappointed. However, the concept of cowboys and aliens thrown together into one pot still does seem a bit odd to me.The story in "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is pretty easy to follow; Jake Lonergan finds himself without his memory and a pretty neat-looking bracelet around his wrist. Thrown into a desperate fight against a far superior species, Jake, the people of Absolution and the native Americans find themselves in a showdown for supremacy.I must admit that the story is fairly much on the 'no-brainer' side of the storyboard. This is the type of movie where you can switch off your brain and just run on the adrenaline alone. There is action from the start of the movie and right up to the end of it. The fight scenes were really nice to look at, lots of guns blazing (both archaic and future guns), explosions and in-your-face action scenes.The movie is making good use of make-up effects and CGI effects. The aliens look awesome, and they look so life-like that it is bordering on being too real. Thumbs way up for the effects team on "Cowboys &amp; Aliens", they sure did a great job.As for the cast, then I think they got a good group of people together for the movie. And I must say that Daniel Craig (playing Jake Lonergan) is more cut out for something like this, rather than playing James Bond. And it was really good to see Harrison Ford (playing Woodrow Dolarhyde) in this movie. He is in top shape here and putting on a really good performance, both in acting and action scenes."Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is a good movie for an evening of mindless action entertainment. If not for the action sequences, then for the effects and CGI. Compared to some of the recent movies that make heavy use of CGI effects, "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" came off as more than just a shallow story trying to stay afloat by effects alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cowboys &amp; Aliens &gt; Fargo. Movie critics need to actually watch movies before rating them or just get better taste.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie that is underrated. I guess it didn't go over well at the box office &amp; it's Metacritic rating is just 50/100 and users of IMDb, while a little more kind, gave it an average of 6.1 and to me there is no way this movie isn't a 7.The story made sense &amp; acting was decent. There were moments where I was made to think about how in this world we work together or well don't work together &amp; what it takes to get races/nations to work together &amp; sadly it hasn't gotten to the point where we are all working together as one to make the world better for all. This movie had great action sequences &amp; good graphical presentation. In terms of movie type it is sci-fi so people watching need to remember that it is fake. Seriously I wonder sometimes if people can handle fake anymore.The acting was decent enough. I never felt that it was bad to where it hurt the story. Acting as it was for this flick was what was required. This was not Titanic or Platoon. Now there were some emotional moments but it didn't need over the top acting to convey what they wanted to convey.Music definitely fit but was nothing memorable.As for how the movie ended/could have ended. Well I was led to believe for a moment that the ending I expected wasn't going to be &amp; that is good &amp; is something that makes a movie a quality movie.In comparison to other movies this is similar to Sky Captain &amp; the World of Tomorrow in terms of how it wasn't appreciated. To me this movie was much more entertaining than movies of other subject matter that won huge awards. An example of a horrible movie that was full of lies &amp; was so dry yet did so well was Fargo. What a piece of garbage that movie was. To me it kind of sums up how bad Hollywood &amp; the movie industry is right now. Now while this is no Platoon or Man on Fire it was better than Fargo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Let's see. We've made thousands of western movies an more movies of alien invasion then anybody can count. So why the hell not join these topics?" That's probably the thoughts of the people who produced this movie an hired half a dozen screenwriters to mess this sweet idea up. And messed up it is. It's a run of the mill western movie with some aliens thrown inside. Most of the time it looks like shot for TV, really uninspired stuff. That nothing really happens, doesn't help either. Really. Just riding horses, talking heads and exploding stuff. If there is any surprise, suspense or thrill to be found, i missed it. Even the aliens aren't great to look at. Just monsters like you've seen a thousand times before. Harrison Ford is playing some kind of villain here an i never noticed what a hack he can be, making faces all the time. He's really bad here, but not in the way he's supposed to. He definitely should call it a day soon. Daniel Craig looks quite ugly. Maybe it's the hat. But he presents a very fine pair of t*ts. An ugly guy with t*ts may be the perfect cast for a British secret agent, but i doubt back then in the good old west men sported pectorals like that. They just didn't knew how to grew them at that time. Well today they know. Craig is proof enough. Sam Rockwell is totally wasted here. Good for him. If you expect some entertaining no-brainer, action, thrills or anything spectacular you WILL be disappointed. But great idea!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard that this movie is sorta underrated therefore I gave it a try. Have to admit the premise is kinda interesting and there are a few things the movie gets right (mainly the sets and visuals).Sadly on the other hand the story is boring and painfully predictable, the actors all look tired and bored. There are plenty of characters to pick your favorite - except none of them is interesting enough to care about.The final battle (which could have somehow redeemed this movie) is also quite unexciting, sterile, dull, lame...you get the point.So overall if your expectations are high because of the household names and the premise you have been tricked just like me. The execution is nowhere near to what this movie could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't have high hopes for Cowboys &amp; Aliens, as I don't think Jon Favreau is a particularly skilled or talented guy, but this film had a good cast and an interesting premise, so I gave it a shot. In some ways I was impressed, and in some ways I was disappointed. It's a fun little movie as long as you can get past the fact that literally nothing makes any sense. And I don't just mean the basic suspension of disbelief required to watch a movie about an alien invasion; I mean that even within it's own universe, much of what happens in the film makes no sense. Why do these aliens need to come to Earth for gold? Gold isn't a particularly rare element in the universe; there are plenty of uninhabited planets and asteroids out there that have gold, and these aliens clearly have the ability to go wherever they want. Why go through the trouble of capturing hundreds of humans 'to find their weaknesses' when it's totally obvious from the very beginning that people are no match in any way for the alien technology and are easily killed? Doesn't it make more sense to lay low and just kill anyone who happens upon their operation rather than going out and making their presence known? Even if the aliens' end game was to invade the planet, at that point in history nobody would have been able to do much about it if the aliens just went about their business. How did that bracelet weapon fit Daniel Craig's human wrist so perfectly when it was clearly designed for the much larger alien wrists? How can his brain operate it when it was made to interface with the alien brain? After freeing the prisoners on the ship, why did Olivia Wilde sneak off and head for the core without Daniel Craig when she needed the bracelet in order to carry out her plan, and he still had it on? Did she just assume he'd find her? Pretty big assumption considering that her whole entire plan, which she traveled from another planet to execute, depended on it. And if the only way to destroy the core was with one of those bracelets, how was she planning on getting her hands on one if Daniel Craig hadn't very accidentally stumbled onto one and then escaped? It didn't really seem like she was working towards any kind of goal at the beginning of the movie. SO MANY QUESTIONS! It just makes me wonder how movies like this can even get made. Doesn't anyone read the script? I mean, these would be easy corrections. Surely for the $165 million you'd think someone would at least try to make sure there weren't huge holes in the plot. I don't know, maybe Favreau has been spending too much time with George Lucas.But still, it's not all bad. The effects are great, the aliens are sufficiently weird looking and the cast is solid. Worth watching on cable.</fullReview>

Ford is turning into one of those seasoned old coots who knows his way around. Daniel Craig has yet to make it as anything but a prisoner or a superhero. And -- well, I'll give Olivia Wilde a pass, whatever she's there for. Her face has the exquisite perfection of a model's. When she's thrown into a river, she appears from underwater with her make up intact.Well -- what do you want, egg in your beer? That's the kind of movie this is. It's aimed at children or, I suppose, at adults who have been living on top of some marble pillar in Turkey and have never seen what computer-generated visual effects look like.It's not worth going on about. The monsters from the space ship have come here to mine all our gold and prepare the way for a conquering horde. Their object is to take our wealth and learn our weaknesses. Monsters after gold. There's a new one. They're slimy. When they open up or morph or whatever they do, the sound is that of a wooden paddle in a pot of molasses. They can build huge space ships but cannot speak. They can only roar or growl, rather like King Kong, but in Dolby Digital.Watch it if you must. Olivia Wilde emerges nude from a bonfire but the director has the bad taste to shield most of her from the view of the audience.</fullReview>

I enjoyed the visual effects, action sequences and acting. But disappointed by the characters and length. Let's start with the characters and running time, it's not the story. I thought the way the characters moved and went on during the film was a bit rapid for the running time. Despite that I thought most of the characters were a bit wooden. Harrison Ford looks too old for the part and a bit cocky as a powerful cattleman. Daniel Craig and Olivia Wilde are in fact the only people who are not that cocky characters. What I mainly describe about the two main antagonists teaming up together is what I put as the summary at the top. I thought it was going to be more creepy aspect than action-packed.

		<shortDescription>Not as Horrible as Some Spielberg-Credited Movies Recently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hesitantly, I decided to watch this movie. I had just seen the AWFUL "Crystal Skull" movie (which I have reviewed), and I wasn't expecting this movie to be much better. The movie is really not all that bad, but it isn't the overwhelming garbage that "Skull" was, either.Probably like most other postings (I am assuming, given the breakdown of reviews - I NEVER pre-read reviews before my own reviewing on IMDb), the movie has little that is original, and there are plenty of holes that are troubling. However, I was wanting and willing to simply be entertained, and I (and my family) were at that. Favreau, director of "Iron Man," still kept true to his directing form, with action and pacing that held my attention (more or less). What is faulty is the story, which seems to be missing about 45 minutes. I believe the main problem with the film is that some producer (why does Spielberg's name pop-up) said, "Favreau, keep it at 120 minutes! No one will watch a 3-hour movie!" (I will add the line: "I don't want someone doing a better version than my 'War of the Worlds' 'masterpiece'!" -sarcasm, you know) Oh, the agony, and with names like Craig (always wonderful) and Harrison (equally so), this movie should NEVER have had the restrictions placed upon it like it had. I firmly believe that the problem with the movie stems from its producers, not the filmmakers per se.That said, the movie has Harrison doing a great Eastwood from "Unforgiven" impersonation (voice and face), Craig doing a sort of "Magnificent Seven" role ala Bond, and (even though I'm not into multiculturalism) some more realistic portrayals of Indians than the stereotypes of cinematic lore. However, the plot merely replaces Indians with aliens and "cowboys" with "Americans" and falls back to twisting stereotypes around. Politics aside, why would aliens want something as "rubbery" as gold? Where did all the aliens go who were fighting? Why were the aliens, who couldn't see well in the dark, so darned great at slaughtering? How do you get a giant into a flying Mini Cooper?Again, it is an entertaining film, if you just let it play. It's has faults (to be sure!), but I believe that some hands were "tied" so that the movie that one sees is not the intended one, but one that was produced for public consumption. I was disappointed to see talent wasted, but with Hollywood and finances the way they are nowadays, it's no wonder.6 of 10. Just for entertainment value. If it weren't entertaining, it'd be an easy 2 stars ------ E.</fullReview>

If for no other reason, you have to respect the film for not baiting and switching.If you've ever played the video game Prey, then this film is very much like it, only the hero is a cowboy, is less spiritual and has the backing of townsfolk, bandits, cow people and even indians.The acting is good, the directing is reasonable and the movie highly entertaining. It is full of clichés and nonsensical bits, but does that make it any less fun? No. The truth is that if you like westerns and sci-fi, there is no honest reason not to like this one.Bottom line: yes, it is much easier to extract gold from the asteroid belt than invade Earth, as it is to shoot people where they stand rather than run naked and skewer them to death, but you know aliens, they're craaaazy. The film is fun and a lot better than the average blockbuster. Just give it a chance, you might enjoy it.</fullReview>

Also, too many character clichés - the pragmatic preacher, the sheriff bucking the overlord, the overlord's boneheaded son, the 'stranger' who is a reformed bad guy AFTER a bump on the head, the climax inside the alien spaceship - to make this more than two hours of mildly escapist entertainment. One reviewer wrote that this would have made a great STRAIGHT western, and I agree.Despite the attractive scenery and outdoor photography, viewers are probably better off with the original material or other classics such as UNFORGIVEN, THE SEARCHERS or HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER.

		<fullReview>Oh boy, months waiting for a movie to come out and when it does it just feels kinda tame. There is something to be said for certain clichés, unfortunately for a cliché to really pay it has to be superbly acted. We also have to really care about the results of this acting. For example, Harrison Ford's character comes across as a racist, grumpy, greedy idiot. Result, he would have been better off being killed off in the first Alien attack on the village. Daniel Craig was an all but two dimensional hard man, without an Inner city Glasgae twang or a real sense of uncontrolled violence to really bring it off (hint stick to James Bond). This is a man who ran an outlaw gang of 30 men? He wakes up with a bracelet of fire on his wrist. Like an RPG game, but instantly giving away the fact that he had been already 'abducted' and no doubt rectally probed by the evil aliens. The aliens view us as insects...despite in 1876 or whatever already possessing weapons that can kill them. These aliens presumably all have awesome blasty bracelets of mass destruction but when it comes to an all-out attack on their mother spaceship - remember they are a scouting group for the whole civilization which is a gazillion light years away - respond by streaming out of their ship in the buff, yes with no arms or armor on. One would think a civilization 20,000 years ahead of us, could have designed some pretty amazing weaponry and tactics for dealing with the upset locals. The plot they were here for gold was no more interesting than any other movie, aliens are always here for some resource or other but never for peaceful trade. The movie got really ridiculous when Olivia Wilde suddenly 'came out' and admitted she as an alien too, but a shape shifting sort who could possess bodies, she was hot, and wow! We even got a screen kiss, but really. Questions could literally jump out of your brain, where did she come from? How did she get to earth? Didn't she realize it was unethical of her to possess another being, or was it okay being she was the town whore. I not saying this was a complete wash out, clearly the budget was there, but so unmemorable. A sad waste of vital resources. Once again Hollywood fails to impress. Hate to say these words, but currently I am playing Skyrim on the PS3. Awesome game, and an example of why games are taking over from the movie market. If Hollywood can't do better, a whole generation of younger people are going to seek out video games as a much more satisfying way to spend 2 hours on a Monday evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horrible. I fast forwarded a lot after Daniel Craig jumped onto a flying alien space craft from his horse as if it were a train scene in some other western. This is pretty much how the movie went after that point. Never mind that a bunch of cowboys and Indians could sneak up and attack an alien craft without being noticed, and they wouldn't be nuked or lasered or whatever. I was disappointed with the son/father line of the plot. The rich dad owning the town, the spoiled son, getting away with being a jerk. Come on, lets get some fresh ideas here.I'm not asking for realism, just believability.Postee</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I kind of thought the fire scene was awesome though I saw it coming. Which about sums up the rest of my review...Totally predictable. And not in a humorous or nostalgic way. Through out the film I was having this unofficial competition with my co-watchers about who was going to be right. Except we all agreed. So it was more of a competition of who could say it faster. My boredom presented about 1/3 into the flick and it didn't save me from the wrath of my friends who argued that it was my idea to catch it. There were so many ridiculous scenes that the most enjoyment came from ragging on the...the...thing. I liked and continue to like all of the actors involved. This was just the most worthless piece of crap I've scene on the big screen ever....Besides maybe 28 Weeks Later which I walked out of due to vomit reflex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>welcome to 19th century Independence Day. The aliens are here and are here to wipe us off. Looking for gold, they of course chose to land in the USA (instead of for instance a national bank holding bullion reserve). The H. sapiens find out, and forming a team, they locate, and finish off the aliens before they finish us off. The plot is similar to Swiss cheese (although I prefer the cheese): full of holes. Thus, it is unclear why the downed alien fleeing back home has to be in the same place as the slower humans chasing him. Neither is it clear why the aliens show up to steal the gold in the thief's lair rather than earlier in the diligence he attacked to steal the gold himself. The humans are kept in an abulic state, but the "hero" is able to slash off his torturer. The aliens are said to have poor sight, yet got no problems in the daylight open-air battle. And the aliens look like other monsters running amok in other Hollywood flicks. Of course there is a ref or two to the Nazis: the Mengele torturer, and the pile of gold (including teeth), which for some odd reasons had just accumulated rather than used by the aliens. The movie is worth a four-letter word, and that's why I gave it a four.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If all you want to see is an action movie, be assured, there is not enough of it. If you want to see some original story in the sci-fi genre, well there is not many movies combining aliens and cowboys out there but you will still fail to find this one fulfilling. What else I can say for this movie? Oh yes, after watching this movie, you will know that colonist immigrants did not actually slaughter the Native people, and wild west was a much more pleasant place that you know it to be. I like Craig for his unorthodox performance for the James Bond role, and I "love" Ford for many reasons I do not undertake to count here. Their presence in this movie can only be justified as a presentation of misplaced trust to the producers, or lust for Dollars. Do not go and and watch the movie. Wait till it's out on your pay TV. It will suck less when you know you had paid for it already without knowing.</fullReview>

My main fault with this film is that there is just not enough explanation for anything that happens i would love it if there was just more of an explanation for the whole plot and i mean this film is not short by any means but it really doesn't put any effort into developing the characters or plot.

		<fullReview>The title says it all: COWBOYS AND ALIENS. There really is no more to it than that. The cliché'd Western elements - stranger with no name (and no memory), mystery woman with no past, greedy cattle baron with spoilt-brat son, gang of bank-robbers and tribe of redskins - combine forces to tackle video-arcade-style aliens who have come to steal gold from our land. Yes, gold. Oh, and people, although it's never explained quite why they're abducting humans and attaching them to a glowing membrane inside their multi-storey spaceship.The CGI furry critters from outer space do generate some make-you-jump moments, but the biggest shock of all is why Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford signed up for this piece of junk (yeah, that must be the reason). There is more substance in your popcorn than in this popcorn movie. Steven Spielberg was one of the producers; he must have been having an off-day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ronseal!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have a commercial in the UK for a product called Ronseal, and the tagline is "Does exactly what it says on the tine." I have from time to time referred to certain films as Ronseal movies on the grounds that the movie is perfectly summed up by its title. Cowboys And Aliens is a Ronseal movie - once you have heard the title you don't need to know any more.It is a very traditional western in many ways - hard man with soft centre and mysterious past, small town in thrall to local cattle baron with unpleasant son who trades on father's position of importance, gang of outlaws, tribe of indians......and a load of aliens who are a) snatching humans and b) mining gold. I quite liked this, but it was no classic. I liked the idea, I liked the look of it. I liked the fact that it didn't always go along entirely in the direction I expected. And I didn't mind the selection of questions which remained unanswered at the end But...I didn't think it was very well written. In particular, the three main characters played by Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde seemed to be motivated solely by what the plot required them to do, rather than as real people. Ford came close to persuading me that he may have been a real person with emotional attachment to his son and semi-adopted Indian Adam Beach rather than Harrison Ford acting an old curmudgeon, but Daniel Craig never convinced, and there were too many problems with the conception of Olivia Wilde's character for her to be successful.So, while I enjoyed it, I think it was probably better in the conception than the execution.</fullReview>

I have to admit that I "jumped" a couple of times and was on the edge of my seat once or twice. There were some funny lines too. There was a lot of action but somewhere, something happened and the movie was all done, just all done. They could have probably left a lot more on the cutting floor than they did! Perhaps they should have brought in a fresh writer to pick up where the other ran out of juice. I don't know if that's a common practice but it should be!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that I hadn't really been expecting to be ingenious or anything, but I didn't give it low expectations. I was curious how the movie would turn out and how well it would follow the premise (comic). Well it was a bit of a disappointment.The first half of the movie is great, and really is enjoyable. The movie at first introduces the aliens fairly quickly, but you don't see too much of them at first. This is what made it fun, was because they encounter the aliens every once in awhile. I think the movie did kind of show the true form of the aliens a little too quickly, but besides that it was good.The second half however was not quite as good. The first half of the movie was enjoyable because it felt very much like a western, but just with some mysterious aliens that are seen every once in awhile. The second half however entirely drops the western theme, and goes more into a gigantic battle that lasts a little too long. There are some gruesome deaths in this movie, and the aliens seem to attack everyone in the same way, by leaping onto the helpless victim and biting.The acting in the movie was quite good, and there is some enjoyable action sequences, some mild mystery, and some nice set designs. I guess the biggest problem is that the movie doesn't seem to have a sense of accomplishment at the end, because in the movie it says this was only a scout ship... doesn't that mean that the aliens are still around? I like the movie, and I kind of don't like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hated one thing about this movie : The reviews that were written about it. They should have been bombarded by nuclear bombs till the end of the international nuclear stored ! Feels that I'm violent or unjust? OK, bear with me..Though the title is simple, the movie isn't. You have to value its creativity, since it isn't a western movie or sci-fi movie only; it is a western with sci-fi element which initially makes it a distinct western and an interesting sci-fi in the same time. The story pushed me to remind Akira Kurosawa's (The Seven Samurais) in terms of different men on a mission to defeat a village against powerful evil, also Clint Eastwood's (The Outlaw Josey Wales) in terms of a western with unbroken cliffhangers. Yet, it has its own originality.Moreover, it has the single precious thing that all the action movies of Hollywood misses : THE DRAMA. Surprisingly there are "characters" that have different "problems", and while the action they find their "salvations" appropriately. It's like what the real western movies were back in the day, with seriousness and heart. So this movie didn't relay on CGI alone, it had more to it. And it happened to be rare and well-made "more" !The premise of it as an action was so ambitious. The equation of Cowboys vs. Aliens has to make you wondering all the time; how the west will win ? And the script, along with the directing, did it so right. The differences of powers between the 2 teams do thrill. The conflict's steps are smartly and diligently studied. Every confrontation is calculated regarding how these dusty cowboys with their primitive weapons could face those advanced aliens with their electronic everything. The last battle in specific is made in a way that convinces you by the cowboys' superiority, so aside from how their eventual victory achieves the impossible, it ? also ? pulls off looking realistic. The only point to deviate from this discipline is how the gang's men would collect their desired gold (the script gratifies them with an explosion for the spaceship which spreads some Alien's gold !). That cast was dazzling; enough to name : Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Hollywood's number 1 scene stealer Sam Rockwell. The performances were truthful and effective, except Olivia Wilde who goggled much; as if that makes her character weird enough ! The CGI made impressive aliens. And the action reached a high top (the kidnapping long scene, shot in the night, was perfect). Clearly Jon Favreau mastered all the stages of the movie, and delivered a package of absolute proficiency. This movie was treated badly. When I read what the critics said about it, I feel that they were watching totally another movie. Well, "Unfair" is the least word to describe the general look to it. But for me, (Cowboys &amp; Aliens) isn't just a fine piece of work among all the usual commercial movies of its time (like Marvel's superheroes, the teen garbage comedies, the endless remakes and sequels.. etc), but rather an instant B-movie classic. It provides good story with good directing. Solidly built western with flashily shot sci-fi. It makes my mind, along with my eyes, both enjoyed. Who needs more when originality, narration and style are all present together ?! In short : That's Entertainment !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cast, premise and technology could not save the insensitivity of its handling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superbly cast, excellent premise and a pathetic treatment to the said premise leaves it in a cohesive mess that never lives up to any expectations. The element of surprise for the cowboys seeing Aliens or even digesting the fact is missing as a bunch of gunslingers go about as a routine kidnapping and rescue mission. It fails both as a western and a science fiction.A man with no name (Daniel Craig) wanders into a small town in Arizona with a weird object attached to his wrist having no memory of his past. The town is in the iron grip of a powerful landlord with past military experience Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). When the man with no name was identified to be Jake Lonergan a notorious criminal wanted by the law, an alien invasion occurs abducting many people from the town which is when everyone realizes that Jake's wrist object is the only weapon that could help them. The rest is the adventure to take the attack to the enemy and free their loved ones.Harrison Ford starts off as not being too comfortable playing the second fiddle but comes to terms as the story progresses. Daniel Craig doesn't have much talking to do and he looks mysterious throughout even after the mystery is solved. The visual effects are a little inconsistent which can be no excuse in today's times that too coming from a big studio production while the director has a past record of handling it a bit too well in the Iron Man franchise. The talented Sam Rockwell is wasted here and Olivia Wilde looks like she has just freshened up in every frame while her character is in the harshest of conditions. With its bloated runtime, it can work up your patience as everything looks all too familiar even with a fresh mash-up of genres.Cast, premise and technology could not save the insensitivity of its handling</fullReview>

That's not the case here. He's perfect for the role he plays.I wasn't at all prepared for James Bond...uh, I mean Daniel Craig in a western. Again, I was quite surprised to find that he was perfectly cast as the not-so-good hero. In fact, I can't imagine any other actor playing the role better than he did. I should have had more faith in him, as he is one of our finest actors.The special effects, photography, directing, dialog, and acting are all much better than I would have expected in a film like this.

		<fullReview>After looking at this movie's ratings here on IMDb, my expectations were low but with Spielberg as a producer, I thought I should give it a try. I was really surprised at how I liked this movie. The acting is pretty great and the plot is very cool and original too. I definitely recommend this one.Although I really liked it, there were three main aspects that bothered me. The first one is the fact that the aliens were looking for gold. Gold itself is pretty useless even to humans, talk about aliens. The other two aspects are two specific scenes: the one where Jake brings gold home and the one where Pat dies. Why would the "devils" go after Jake and a bag of coins if they were extracting gold from the earth as if it was oil? And just before Pat is dead, there is a war going on but as soon as he dies, the war apparently stops for one minute or two while they are around him.But as the movie ends, you can look behind and tell it was a good one. Once again, I was really surprised at how good it turned out to be. It's worth watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had everything going for it. Let's have a look under the cinematic hood of this incredibly anti-climactic film shall we? This film had Jon Favreau as both director and executive producer- green light. The dream team, the most incredible line up of producers I've ever seen or heard: Brain Grazer-Green Light!, Ron Howard- GREEN LIGHT!, and Steven Spielberg- GREEN LIGHT!!! GREEN LIGHT!!! GREEN LIGHT!!! With a cast consisting of Daniel Craig- Green Light!, Harrison Ford- GREEN LIGHT!!!, Olivia Wilde- a fine Green Light, and Paul Dano- green light. All spoiled by a terrible script. What happened??? The concept is intriguing, it really is. In all alien movies, America is always ready with our military, but what if the aliens came at a time when we weren't ready? The old west for instance? Again a great concept! But terribly executed. The dumb aliens were after gold. Gold? Really? When Favreau tweeted about the film being like Jaws in the sense that you don't see the creature(s) for a bit of the movie because there is nothing scarier than your own imagination except the thought that Spielberg is starting to lose it. Ah, perish the thought. I kid of course, every dog has his day. I digress, we saw the alien within like 20 minutes, but there wasn't a build of suspense like Jaws. So overall, under the cinematic hood is a mere hamster on a wheel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Opinion Hole: Cowboys and Aliens: The Film With No Soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of this film, I saw the teaser trailer. The premise was outstanding, for me my two favourite popular genres: science-fiction pulp and classic westerns would at last be joined forever in the glorifying summer blockbuster stable. To be honest, I had to ask myself 'Is this real, can it be as good as it promises?' Genre collisions are a very rare and mystifying aspect of filmmaking, take a few good examples: Alien (horror and science-fiction), Aliens (science-fiction, horror, action), Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (animation, live-action and film noir) and a more relevant example: Serenity, the Firefly feature length spin off which is questionably to best living proof of a 'Western in Space' done right.In Joss Whedon's brilliant swansong to his criminally under-rated TV series, we follow a ragtag group of thrown-togethers as they run and gun their way through the worst Mos Eisley towns this side of the Outer Rim. You watched that film and not only could you be amazed at the technology, the spaceships, the pristine, and the staple sci-fi government conspiracy parts, but the characters dressed, acted, and were as lovable as John Wayne, Clint Eastwood and Han Solo (yes, Solo a space cowboy if there ever was one.) This brings me neatly to the crutch of the review: Cowboys and Aliens, from Iron Man director John Favreau. The film stars Daniel Craig, Olivia Wilde and Harrison Ford ? who still brings back memories of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.*[1] In the beginning, Jake Lonergan (Craig) has amnesia. He wakes up, who he is? We don't know. He has a strange, steam punk-esque device strapped to his wrist. Three crooks try to rob him, he quickly subdues them. And here is the first overlying problem of the film. It is never established exactly how Lonergan is able to fight them off so effortlessly, leaving us with a person who simply seems not have to worry, nor care about overcoming anything, if he is able to combat three armed drifters after being unconscious. 007 is cool and detached, this character is a Terminator. A machine. He heads to the nearest town.Moving along, Lonergan ends up in jail because he is recognised by the sheriff in Absolution as wanted outlaw. The titular aliens attack the town during the night, where many people are abducted, including Percy the son of ruthless cattleman Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Ford). If Lonergan is a Terminator, Dolarhyde is Yosemite Sam ? gruff, cantankerous, and unlikeable. These characters are so underwhelming and lacking in unique development that it cements the film as having all the elements of TV movie with the added sheen of 'star power'. I suppose you could defend the movie, arguing 'Well, it has the conceit of a B-Movie, the premise I the same; surely you can say it's alright that the characters are flat and boring.' Consider 1996's Independence Day which, for a better word, is the 'ultimate B-Movie'. It is a self-contradicting title; surely B-Movies aren't summer blockbuster material? But then why did ID4 make nearly six times the money that Cowboys and Aliens did? Possibly because it used the cinematic format to increase the scope and scale and show audiences what an alien invasion could look like and make it exciting. It also had some likable characterisation in Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum's family lives. Something Cowboys and Aliens failed to do.After a lovely Western journey cross country, with formulaic moments of rest and character development (Like the church scene in Saving Private Ryan except on rapid-fire back-story mode), the Lonergan/Dolarhyde party arrive at their destination. The alien's base of operations is a goldmine. Yes. The aliens have travelled all this way, to mine our gold. Why? To power their machines. Okay, so you have a function, what is the reason? Why do they need to power their machines, what machines are they and why does gold power them. It's cheat, presenting a problem to overcome; it's like building a brick wall for a character to climb over. The wall is just there, it doesn't need explaining but if they don't get to the other side then, well, the climax won't be satisfying! And they have been abducting humans to carry out experiments on them, which is fair enough. Better than the gold subplot. Still reeks of bad B-Movie plotting.The film ends with Ella (Wilde) actually dying to save the kidnapped humans, after Lonergan regains his memory of his 'true love', perhaps Ella served her purpose and she had to take her rightful place at being dead. Lonergan really is a Terminator, incapable of love or commitment to women. He ends the movie, riding off into the sunset. Dolarhyde redeems himself and becomes the character I wish Ford played from the beginning.A film like Cowboys and Alien looks nice, it has many recognisable faces, the special effects are so-so and it should be defendable by the 'mindless' summer blockbuster theory. However, this film which looks amazing has, underneath, nothing. No memorable moments, any standout set pieces. It's all been done better and done before. This film has no soul. And it's really hard to say that about a movie. I will say it tried; it tried to appeal to everyone, to be post-modern and to be the next big franchise. But it failed because it was too formulaic and didn't try anything new.*** [1] Note: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, is a terrible film, because it attempts to disprove the last three films' religious pathos as mumbo jumbo, forcing onto the audience the overruling concept of pan dimensional 'aliens' as being responsible for everything in history that has supernatural elements ? which goes against everything the Indiana Jones films stood for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's one thing and one thing only I demand from a film called "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" and that's entertainment. Sadly, that's something this film offers very little of.First we get a clichéd, poo-faced western that only pics up when we finally get to see cowboys fighting aliens. And at that point the attempts at drama go out the window with plot holes paved over with extra silliness.In the end it's all a huge missed opportunity. As well made as Cwboys &amp; Aliens is, it's just not entertaining enough to hold the title. The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. is still the king of sci-fi westerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>rarely does a film come along that allows people to purely have fun. cowboys and aliens is one of those films, the romance of the west, the mystery of aliens, what more is there to ask for? attractive leading roles? well yes, Daniel Craig Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde provide all the attractiveness one of any generation and sexual orientation could ask for. It has all the allure of a western with all the excitement of a Sci- FY movie. it's rare that a movie comes out that lets the audience have fun and escape for two hours without demanding thought and judgment of the acting and quality, cowboys and aliens is one of those films. sit back, relax and enjoy the ride, because it's gonna be a good one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What kind of a movie is this? A Western with care and attention paid to clothing (although I question a few things, one hat in particular) and firearms; a horror film with fearsome ugly monsters; a drama propelled by character development; a complex story of family relationships; a buddy cop movie; a science-fiction story; and possibly a few other things. Despite, or perhaps because, of this complexity "Cowboys and Aliens" is an amazingly satisfying cinema experience. Harrison Ford can do more good acting without lines than anyone in decades. He is a Westerner in a Western. Daniel Craig learned to be a Westerner; the scene when he and Ford are fleeing an explosion and Craig bends down to grab his hat on the run is not something an Easterner or a Brit would ever do. The effects are great too. I had been looking forward to seeing C&amp;A for a long time but with low expectations. Can one really take that title seriously? What a pleasure to enjoy a big noisy motion picture more than anticipated. I loved this film! And I loved the hummingbird.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised with this movie, because I didn't expect anything more then waste of time before going to bed. But in the middle of it the metaphor and political comment on present world and economical situations are started to reveal it self. What I liked it more is the fact that it is done with subtlety and style which is not in your face or vulgar like the last SF film which I know about who have tried to say something more then just generic SF plot. I'm talking about movie which have aliens placed in ghetto in South Africa city, I can't remember the title. Cowboys &amp; Aliens have also some parallel themes, along with the fight against the common enemy, which are nicely incorporated together; finding solutions for different cultures who have to live together, understanding between them and forgiveness for past crimes. I would have to watch it again to see some other aspects of it, because I wasn't prepared for even one. In past couple of years Hollywood big SF movies are just generic waste of effects and violence without any message or moral or political statement. Just for the fact that this film is trying to incorporate something more in it's genre I would give it a 9/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly and marginally entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just as preposterous as you would expect from the title. Then again, pinning completely parallel iconic groups (or characters) one against the other in absurd environments has plagued the collective imagination for some time. Alien vs Predator, Ninjas vs Pirates, DC Comics Heroes vs the Marvel Universe, Jackie Chan vs Bruce Lee, Sailor Moon vs DBZ. Anything goes.There are a few secrets to make an outrageously silly production like this work: 1. don't take yourself seriously. The idea is silly, adding drama to it makes it even sillier. Use the silliness to your advantage, perhaps some self-irony. 2. stray from the "source" material. Whatever you claim as source, it is as "original" as pizza in an American restaurant. However good and changed, pizza is still an Italian dish. Therefore you don't need to feel bad for modifying it and giving it some touches that the author never thought of. Who knows, you could make it better.Favreau and his writers fail across the board. They hesitate to make the source material their own. I already know that Favreau can do pretty good things (see Iron Man). Here he doesn't and the result is stiffness all around. Stiff acting, stiff writing.The movie takes itself too seriously. As far as Craig's character is concerned, that would work if they would've stuck to a silent dark mysterious hero. He has the make of it: shoot them to death, don't talk them to death. That part has its charm with a bad-ass like Craig. Downside? He has no background. If Favreau would've left him with no background, that would've worked. What doesn't work is an attempt at giving him a back story that has absolutely no effect on the plot. Wife dead, memory lost (sure, an old fart like the sheriff gets his memories back 2 minutes after getting out, the Craig bad-ass needed Indian intervention two days later), a pathetic attempt at a romantic subplot.The girl (oh, alien girl). Why is she even there? A lot of jibber-jabber about her lost world then she commits suicide. I was happy when she got killed first time and so annoyed that she came back to life (also, the fact that nobody seemed very disturbed that a dead woman walks out of some random flames managed to disturb me - yeah, that happens everyday in Texas). Oh, and she's nowhere near as hot as the movie poster makes her to be.The clichés run high. In fact, there's no western movie cliché that doesn't fall in, with one exception: Indians doing the war (or even ghost or rain) dance. Nope. They smoke the hell out of Craig, visions and so on, sure. They talk funny and pretend not to know English.Oh, and Harrison Ford is there too, but I barely even noticed. Also, a bunch of useless character that die along the way. Obviously, of the two likable characters, one dies first (the wise preacher). Thankfully, the other (the dog) survives.The end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cowboys and Aliens, nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, i did not have high expectations for this considering I'm a Malick and Kubrick fan but I went into the cinema room expecting to at least have fun. The first third of the movie is amazing, a very tense atmosphere is created which is at the same time filled with mystery. Although there are a few action scenes towards the beginning it still feels like the movie hasn't "broken out"; in other words the tension remains (it's hard to explain)I love how they show little of the aliens towards the beginning of the movie, this creates an aura around them. But then a certain fact is revealed about a main character and from then on the whole movie goes to the sinkhole. It becomes a typical no-brainer blockbuster with hundreds of plot holes and senseless details. Another thing is that I really think they shouldn't have named it Cowboys and Aliens for it gives you just that: Cowboys and Aliens, nothing more. If another title would have been given, the bracelet and the ships would have been a little bit more mysterious, and we would have been able to see things a little bit more from the perspective of the cowboys... It is a little hard to explain if you haven't see it. It might have been a little more surprising and exciting. Instead of having fun watching this movie all I did while watching it was check my watch to see if it was going to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cowboys and Aliens. What a strange title, right? It doesn't get a lot more blatant than that. You read that title and you know that there will surely be cowboys, and most definitely there will be aliens. And that is basically all that Cowboys and Aliens is. It's cowboys fighting aliens and aliens fighting cowboys. It begins with a man waking up in the desert, having no idea who he is or where he came from. There is also a strange metal bracelet attached to his wrist. He finds his way to a small town where he meets the great cast of characters this movie has to offer, such as Sam Rockwell as the town doctor, Olivia Wilde as a mysterious girl who's past is unknown, and the great Harrison Ford as the grumpy old Civil War veteran who doesn't smile once throughout the whole film. Shortly after the meet and greet, aliens attack the town and abduct many of the citizens. This initiates a journey to find the creatures who attacked the town and return the stolen people to their homes. It's a special effects laden adventure with every scene delivering more cowboys and more aliens going head to head in an ironic battle royale.As much as I want to love and cherish a film about cowboys fighting aliens, I have to be realistic. Cowboys and Aliens disappoints. It is no doubt fun, but it doesn't go much further than that. The characters aren't all that interesting, despite being portrayed by a plethora of great actors. The script leaves a lot to be desired and the story, overall, is pretty forgettable. All we are really given by this film is what the title alone promises us. There are cowboys, and there are aliens. Everything else is just sort of there. I wouldn't call this film's plot awful or nonexistent, just weak. It's nothing special and with a premise as bizarre and ironically brilliant as this, there could have been a lot more going on. There's nothing in this film that I outright hate, but I couldn't fall in love with anything either. I can't think of any other movie that pits cowboys against aliens, yet I feel like I have seen the movie Cowboys and Aliens before. It is just too bland and too much of a generic Summer blockbuster to be anything truly special.But, as I said earlier, the film does deliver two things. Cowboys... and aliens. The action scenes are a lot of fun and this film really is entertaining. It's nothing that will bewilder you or make you go, "Wow. That was amazing," but it's exciting enough to be a great popcorn flick. The film's special effects are great and the creature design is fantastic. The movie gives us a great look at every detail of the aliens the special effects team of this film came up with. They are grotesque and amphibian like and the film's action utilizes the design of the creatures excellently. The ships are also designed very well with a strange scorpion-like look to them, a design which looks great against the desert. And, with that in mind, everything is more fun against an ironically strange backdrop such as the wild west. But great creature design and wildly explosive special effects will only take a movie so far, and there's not much more that Cowboys and Aliens has to deliver.It's a shame to see a movie so endlessly hyped, being advertised to the extreme, miss its goals, entirely. But that's what happens when you don't deliver the masterpiece you had made the film out to be. Sadly, Cowboys and Aliens isn't that incredible of a film at all. It's fun, sure. There are some great things about it and I don't regret seeing the film, but for the long exciting expectation game that the marketing team played, it just didn't deliver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you get when you mash up the genres of old Hollywood westerns and sci-fi action films? You get an ambitious, slight misfire called Cowboys &amp; Aliens, the newest film from Iron Man director, Jon Favreau.In the film, a man (Played by Daniel Craig) wakes up in the desert, with no memory of who he is. When he wanders into a busted up town, he's recognized as western outlaw Jake Lonergan. But once Lonergan is captured, a swarm of alien scout ships take people from the town hostage, for use in their mysterious intentions. To rescue the town's people, as well as piece together his lost memory, he joins a posse led by crime boss Woodrow Dollarhyde (Played by Harrison Ford), and also takes interest in a mysterious traveler (Played by Olivia Wilde).Just gonna get this out of the way. The first 30 minutes are fantastic. It plays out like a straight western, it raises intrigue, it secures tension, Craig and Ford are great, Olivia Wilde, Sam Rockwell, and Paul Dano turn in solid characters, it establishes a tone, and it's beautifully designed. The first act is TERRIFIC! ...And then that's where the movie went downhill.It's not a bad movie, but it isn't a good movie either. The screenplay, written by a total of six different people, just doesn't always give proper answers, and arcs in story feel unsatisfying, but the solid performances of the cast do help that out some. The biggest problem with the film is that the distinctive Hollywood western and sci-fi action tones tend to clash with one another. It is difficult for them to find even ground, and they don't always mesh together.Still, the action scenes are quite good, the movie moves quickly, and is exceptionally designed. It's shot grandly by Matthew Libatique, tailored fittingly by Mary Zophres, and dazzling rendered by Industrial Light &amp; Magic. The standout aspect, however, is the sound. The mix is neatly and coherently handled, and the sound design by David Farmer and Frank Eulner is outstanding.Cowboys &amp; Aliens has problems, but the good definitely outweighs the bad... and the ugly, if we wanna go THAT far. :D**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cowboys and Aliens is not a bad movie as many people have suggested. Granted, I was turned away from this film because the I was not amused or turned on by the trailers. This film also has a director who knows these kind of genres. Jon Favreau happens to be the one who directed the enjoyable Iron Man films, Elf, and Zathura. I also liked this movie because they made the attempt to do something never seen before in film: to combine the genres of sci-fi and western. I thought it was a successful attempt. The story was a little weak but the action, visual effects, and great acting all make up for it.This film is about some guy Jake who wakes up in the middle of the desert not knowing who he is and why he had a strange bracelet on his wrist. He finds out that he is a wanted man. He also happens to get himself caught up in an alien invasion as these aliens are taking away humans from towns and tribes.As always, Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford deliver fine performances. Ford still looks good for his age and is able to do some good action scenes. Of course, he has is trademark grumpiness in the film. Daniel Craig is good as the cold-blooded Jake. I also liked the supporting cast led by Sam Rockwell and Olivia Wilde.Overall, I had a very fun time with this film. I liked the genre fusion and most especially, the alien designs. These creatures are unlike anything I have seen in a sci-fi which is always good. There are some plot holes and a weak script, but great acting and solid direction is what makes this film enjoyable. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete waste of potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have a film directed by the man that gave us the stupidly good Iron Man. A film that has both James Bond and Indiana Jones. Together. At the same time. As cowboys. How on earth do you mess that up? Just watch Cowboys &amp; Aliens and you'll find out.A summary first: Cowboys &amp; Aliens is about, well, cowboys and aliens. When 1873 Arizona is invaded by aliens, it's up to the cowboys and natives, led by Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) and Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), to save the Wild West.On paper, this is a great film. It has all the makings of a really fun action movie. Cast, crew, budget, story, everything is there to make it a success. And yet it's not. Cowboys &amp; Aliens is boring, that's the problem. It plods along, never really being as funny or as action-packed as it wants to be. There are a few good moments, but not enough to save the movie.The biggest disappointment is Harrison Ford. While Craig is actually quite good in his role as the take-no-prisoners, wise-cracking anti-hero, Ford is really wasted. His stereotypical humorously gruff persona was perfect for this; instead, he's gruff without the humour, and that's not great. Olivia Wilde, despite her 'shocking' character twist, is rubbish. Sam Rockwell and Paul Dano (both actors I really like) are wasted.The one strength of this movie is the special effects. The aliens look really good, and scary, all the CGI was done well and everything looks amazing the way an old-school Western tends to. But that's not enough. A disappointingly dull film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horrible Mish Mash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted this to be good. A neat cross genre idea, good actors, big budget and an experienced director. But this fails. Not as a spectacle, but as a story. The $168m outlay was recouped, and some, so the money men will be happy, but none of the actors will place this high on their CV. Cowboys &amp; Aliens pretty much sums up what is wrong with 21st century Hollywood cinema.The western location settings in New Mexico and California are sumptuous. Careful study has also been made of the ingredients of classic westerns, the opening is classic Clint Eastwood territory as the man with no name heads for Absolution. The residents are subjugated by a cattle baron and his bullying imbecilic son, and then the aliens start a bit of terror all of their own. Some of the set pieces are fine, the torture of the sole survivor of an alien attack because the cattle baron does not believe his story is plausible, as is the opening alien attack. But it soon becomes a painting by numbers exercise. The Indians , the bad guys and the good guys all join up to defeat the common enemy. The kid triumphs, and there is a dog. Dynamite is all that you need to defeat intergalactic technology, and the women have grossly underwritten roles.Forty four year old Daniel Craig, hero and man with no name flaunts his naked, finely toned torso in sexless, strangely homo-erotic style. Harrison Ford is grumpy, presumably with the script. And the women don't have a fat lot to do. The conclusion is preposterous.What the film lacks is wonder. The inhabitants of the wild west seem to pretty much take alien invasion in their stride. When the opening western based story is unfolding director Jon Favreau is pleasingly sure-footed, but he abandons all sense of reality when the aliens arrive. Having successfully handled Iron Man 1 &amp; 2, the budget and the big production is no problem, but all sense of artistic coherence is lost. We don't care about the characters and the climax is funny, rather than dramatic.A terrible waste of quite a good idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Western and a Bad Sci-Fi...What's Left?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a name like 'Cowboys &amp; Aliens', it would be understandable to think that this is a comedy with action and wit. However, this began as a serious western with hints of sci-fi elements with little back story, reason or intrigue.Daniel Craig plays a cowboy with a convincing stance and accent but with no charm or reason to like him. However the script and plot is to blame as there is never a full explanation for the happenings or why the audience should care.Olivia Wilde's character was never explained and often she became a pretty (permanent make-up even when wet) but annoying tag-along that seemed to want to prove herself among the acting giants of Craig and Ford.The western side of the movie seemed like a caricature of the old west, seemingly parodying great films stars like Wayne and Eastwood with none of the charm. It also featured landscape a silhouette shots that were meant as an homage to the classics but were misplaced with the bland, uninteresting characters.The sci-fi side was introduced later in the movie with no build-up or mystery. They just turned up in plain sight. Also, plot devices such as Craig's alien blasting bracelet was never investigated and how it managed to fit his arm with him being able to use his brain to control it was just plain dumb and lazy. Harrison Ford offered the most character in the film with his steely determination and reserved but clear emotions that gave his character a reason to be there(unlike Wilde's).Cowboy's and Aliens is ultimately a bad, expensive film that succeeds in neither genre that it tries to combine. It also includes many unnecessary shots of horses being brutally killed, which seemed out of place for a movie with such a daft title.</fullReview>

Yet, your movie was not one bit funny as the title or ads suggested. You did not try to make this comic of yours a comedy. Instead, you went with some dull cowboy concept that anyone who liked John Wayne and Clint Eastwood movies has seen and you added aliens too. This in unacceptable behavior from a "writer."

		<shortDescription>Another comic to film tragedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being an avid comic reader and a religious follower of Western themed films, this movie was designed for me. Based off the graphic novel of the same name, Cowboys &amp; Aliens is a Sci-fi cross Western Action movie which follows the story of the amnesia ridden criminal named Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) and his quest to recover his memory. The story more specifically starts with Jake waking up in the middle of the desert with a metal bracelet attacked to his hand, irremovable. After beating some random men, he heads to the city of Absolution. It is revealed to Jake that he is a known and wanted criminal and the sheriff takes him into custody. An unknown race of aliens attack and kidnap more than half the town's population and in the spur of the action, Jake's bracelet reveals itself to be a dangerous and effective hand cannon, resulting in the destruction of one of the alien jets. The alien pilot gets away without anybody glimpsing it and they gather a posse to 'find their people'. Thus begins their journey across the Arizona desert. Jake Lonergan, Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) and a gathering of minor characters such as Doc, Meacham, Emmett, Nat and some others are part of the posse. Jake Lonergan is the only name you will really catch onto, because this is one of those movies where storyline focuses on one character's back story and giving the finger to the rest of the characters. Being the Western fan that I am, I expected a Western movie with Sci-fi elements, but all I got was a Sci-fi movie with little-to-no Western at all. It was rumoured that the film went through many story writers, which isn't expected of a movie that's based off a graphic novel, with a story already written. However, the events of the graphic novel have nothing to do with the film. The events of the graphic novel have the aliens (with a name, 'The Caste',) wanting to enslave the human race as they have done to many other races before. A group of gunslingers and a tribe of Apaches join forces and scavenge technology from a destroyed ship to create weapons of their own, such as a microwave emitting pistol, an energy whip and x-ray goggles. A blacksmith also crafts horse-shoes that allow their horses defy gravity to a certain degree using engine parts from the ship. Using this technology, they defeat The Caste with many casualties and for their bravery and valour; they are added to the forces of many other extra-terrestrial races standing against The Mighty Caste. Now that's what I call a story! Instead we get this. Amnesia, faceless characters, horrible back stories and more.I feel that the graphic novel story is much better than the movie's adaption. Basically, we are told that the aliens want... Gold. Yep, gold. That's all they want. There's no reason why they want gold, its just said it's a rare to them as it is to us. But we use our gold for jewellery and other useless items. And by the look of those aliens, jewellery is the last thing on their list of things they would need. Now this part contains spoilers for the film, but it's what ruined it for me the most. During a flashback induced by Indian herbal tea, Jake witnesses his wife turned to ash by the aliens and he is next. The alien conducting the 'live autopsies' takes his weapon bracelet off (even though he kept it on for the previous experiments on Jake's wife,) and puts it right next to Jake's hand. Oh, I wonder what will happen next. Well, Jake uses the Alien's 'plasma scalpel' to cut half of it's face off and accidentally gets the bracelet caught on his hand. He then escapes, completely without any resistance and then mysteriously loses his memory... During the strategic attack on the alien ship, Jake gives his bracelet to Ella to self destruct in the ships core, leaving him with a pistol which is about effective as throwing small pebbles at the aliens. In his second escape from the ship, he is captured again and strapped up to the operating table once more. Now what happened now, could have been seen a mile away. It's the alien with the scarred face! And he wants revenge. Though, what kind of a movie would it be if the hero was captured, tortured and then murdered, leaving all the others fighting against the aliens to be overwhelmed and killed? Well, it would have been better than the actual ending, that's for sure. And so the inevitable happens, Jake escapes, kills the revengeful alien and escapes, just as Ella self destructs the bracelet in the core of the fleeing ship. BOOM, BANG, a bad reunion scene between the characters and the movie has ended. Thank God. 118 minutes of horrible story, horrible characters, horribly thought out aliens and a HORRIBLE ending. I wasn't aware of who directed the film until after I had seen the movie. Jon Favreau? The same guy who adapted the Ironman comics into a movie and successful sequel? But those movies were actually good. I guess a bad movie could happen to anybody.I'm aware that movie reviews are for opinions and thoughts on the movie, but all I can think of is the words; horrible and bad. Maybe it wouldn't be AS horrible for me if I wasn't such a fan of Western films and the graphic novel. But I just can't imagine a movie such as 'Once Upon a Time in the West' with aliens coming in half way through actually turning out as a well balanced, good storied film. Just another movie in a series of comic-to-film tragedies. Now to wait for the next two ruinations; 'The Amazing Spiderman' and 'The Avengers'.</fullReview>

Well, it was a very intimate movie session: the whole audience was a grand total of 3 couples.Bottom line: unless you are a hard core aficionado of one of the actors, go spend your time with something else. None of the actors makes a big role. None of the actors makes even a medium role. Everything is just a large mumbo-jumbo, neither SF nor western.

It's annoying to watch until almost over where you finally get to see high powered aliens actually having a hard time with 1800's cowboys, who, remarkably seem to adapt to their circumstances.Contrived and a waste of 163 million that could have been given to Bono so he could feed Africa and stop bitching about how little Canada gives to world poverty..some action of course and a few well acted lines by Ford, but really what did you expect?

I confess that I am not a big fan of films where aliens are involved, but i don't jugde a movie without watching it for myself, and even though i might not like the premise, I can give credit to the direction and acting. After seeing this movie, I had to put aside my oath of not giving bad reviews, because the constant yelling of OMG's in my head just couldn,t remain there anymore. The cast seemed great, starting with a the awesome blue eyed Daniel Craig in the middle of nowhere, with no recollection of how he got there, and why a strange device is locked on his wrist. Arriving at a small town, he finds out he is wanted for theft and murder. Captured and while waiting to be transported, the aliens arrive in these futuristic space crafts, shooting everything and pulling humans for whatever purpose they needed. Sadly only the aliens know why they want humans, as we audience can only imagine!Oh, something about our weakness. Why??? If their purpose is to then destroy everything! The device on Craig's wrist suddenly begins to function, and as it seems, is the only weapon that can kill them more effectively. We have a curious Olivia Wilde, and a grumpy Harrison Ford, while others gather around one of the space crafts that has been shot down. These people are cowboys, never seen anything fly other than a bird, yet alone seen an alien, but do they question its origin??? Are they amazed by the unknown, and try to figure out just what happened?? Do they question the device on Craig's arm and how he got it??? No!!! Lets all gather supplies and gun down these unknown demons that have stollen our people! Hell Yeah!!!! Daniel Craig is disappointing. Always with that cocky bad ass look, and clinched lips that just worked fine for me, but only when he was playing James Bond. Olivia Wilde turns out to be from another planet, explaining that the aliens want gold. For what? Do you know? Neither do I! Harrison Ford is OK, but the script doesn't help him. Then comes the battle, nothing new. The aliens are nothing original, and the fighting scenes are boring. There was no story here, why waste their money!!! The movie lacks character! It is boring and sometimes dumb and ridiculous. Olivia Wilde's character is pointless, as she knows much about the aliens and fails to help. Oh, sorry she does give Daniel Craig a kiss for the device to fall off his arm, (his mind had to be free from thought- just saying this sounds ridiculous), so she could use it to blow up their layer!! That for me was the last straw. Stupid, stupid scene! Poor acting, poor story, waste of time people! Oh, but the aliens were pretty ugly, does that count for something??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth thing to ever happen to Harrison Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have to say I could have used the 15 dollars I spent watching this movie and wiped my butt with it instead and I would have been more satisfied with the use of that money by far.Okay. Im being harsh... The action scenes in the beginning of the film when the first group of people are taken is pretty good. The aliens are pretty gross and scary. Paul Dano, Harrison ford and Sam Rockwell all did good performances despite some really awful dialogue. I would have to say my biggest complaint was our leading lady, Olivia Wilde. Had she changed her facial expression maybe more that 3 times the entire movie and looked like she was at least trying to act, I could have maybe forgiven her, however, she stood there as a pretty face with no depth to the character whatsoever. The best thing to happen to the movie was when she died... Until they brought her back in a tribal ceremony with the help of some local Indians. Her blank stare was back and she reveals(big spoiler)Shes an alien too! All in all, this movie was pretty ridiculous, but had potential to be pretty fun an entertaining if not for the cheesy dialogue and horrid acting.Wondering why I haven't mentioned Daniel Craig's performance thus far? Because there was none. Another hard body with no talent. Very disappointing. The movie could have done just fine without the duo and in fact, I think it would have made it just that much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will we ever reach the end of King Kong vs. Godzilla, Mothra vs. Caterpillar, Freddie vs. Saw, Halloween vs. Christmas, Scream vs. Scary Movie, Frankenstein vs. Payton, and such stuff. I will never see another stupid category of Earth vs. Mars type stuff again.This movies premise will be forgotten within a month. How this script got green lighted is beyond me and shows desperation on the studios part. I bet Harrison and Craig owed the studio a big favor and appearing in this mess was the deal with the devil as they are both wasted talents in this debacle.Movie Highlights:No memorable dialogue. Little memorable action. No characters to care about. Forgettable overbearing music track. Poor plot. Terrible "monster" recycled animation lifted from other monster movies.You know, when you do a space/time disjunction movie you have to account for "technology" shock. You mean cowboys find the aliens just another "army". Craig learns how to use a thinking arm bracelet in seconds. Those cowboys were sure quickly adaptable to flying machines, thinking computers, horrible quick and deadly monsters and an giant alien spaceship. Come on!Hmmm. Just another day in the desert, huh? Not one, wtf is this?Totally unrealistic. You need for the locals to adjust future "techno shock" and some interesting/funny/weird adjustments to the future trying to figure out what is happening.Maybe if the cowboys were in shock and awe a little, it might help. Luckily a friend paid my way for a favor or I would sue to get the $10 back. Go rewind the tape and watch Alien, one of the best sci-fi movies ever, and Day the Earth Stood Still and 2001: A Space Odyssey.Family Guy presented a much better space/time disjunction when Stewie invented a time machine and he visited different universes with Brian. It was great! I am going to check out Pleasantville again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-fi western might seem like a good idea but this is pretty dull and boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a disappointing movie. This movie has been getting hyped up for a very long time. But the movie overall was very dull and is probably a rental at best. I like Daniel Craig but all he does is stare people down for the most part and he just didn't really stand out. In fact no of the characters really stands out. A mix between western and sci-fi might seem like a okay idea and would have been good if the script was better. But the script is just so darn dull and predictable. Now I like western movies but I didn't enjoy watching this, I mean it has the western cliché but just doesn't have that good western feel to it. I mean there is probably more action and things blowing up more than most western movies, but this still comes off as dull. I even checked the time multiple times because I was anxious for this movie to end. It has a very slow and boring build up, boring climax and ending. Some of the older audiences in there 50's seem to enjoy it. Maybe it brought back the feel of those types of movies back in the old days which is fine. But do that while at least also trying to match today's standards and not just with special effects.3.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Call it my guilty pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read no reviews by anyone until after I saw the film, which I rather enjoyed. I now see that I should not have enjoyed myself. Oh, gosh, I am so ashamed. Let me retroactively have a bad time. Oh, well; oh, WTF.If we are going to willingly pay to see alien-invasion films, might not that have occurred two centuries ago? So I don't know of any problem with cowboys dealing with aliens, any more than Sigourney Weaver dealing with them. Or Arnold dealing with them.What I saw was an alien invasion with most if not all of the cinematic western clichés thrown in. Starting with the loyal dog who easily switches loyalties depending on who survives a particular fight. And the hero being an enigmatic Man With No Name--so enigmatic he can't even remember his name. A man of few words, but with superhuman abilities in combat. Did he have those abilities before he got that strange bracelet? Well, of course. And the little kid fixing on a hero who is not a family member.Even the very touching scene of a reconciliation of bigoted Anglo cowboy and non-white "son" is traceable to the interaction between the John Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter characters in "The Searchers." There are probably many more parallels, and I've not taken the time to think over and list them all. If you can think of a western cliché, it is probably in this film. And carefully mixed with Invaders From Mars clichés. Such as the riverboat (compare "Close Encounters"). Such as the alien opening its body (compare "Aliens"), and a suitably pre-Mechanical Revolution thing emerges--manual rather than mechanical.The addition of the "Indians" was also very interesting. The Native Americans were the traditional movie opponents of the cowboys. Here, they have common cause to oppose the aliens.On a scale of believability, could the Cowboys ever have defeated the Aliens? Even with the "Indians" helping out? Not really. Not even with the assistance of a Sister From Another Planet.But in Movie World (kind of like Bizarro World, where everything is backwards), here we have James Bond and Han Solo plus Tonto and Lassie and maybe Princess Leia, versus the other guys. And could anyone be surprised at who would prevail in that contest? This film will not live forever in history as a classic. But I thoroughly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking from Faveraux!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK I'll make this quick. This was the letdown movie of the summer. The only time this year, where both the trailer and movie were crap! Faveraux's comeback after the wasteful Iron Man 2 is a load of nonsense. Here are a number of reasons why. Serious miscast, casting Daniel Craig as the main protagonist. Craig has presence, but every time he opened his mouth I cringed! His American accent is so poor, I was couldn't wait for the film to end after hearing him speak. He did so well in Road to Perdition, what on Earth happened here? He looked so lost and out of place, it became uncomfortable watching him. This was a shocking performance from my favourite James Bond. Olivia Wilde is a beautiful woman and a good actress. Her character here doesn't make any sense. There's one scene where (well watch it and see for yourself) no explanation was given how she was able to do what she did. Her performance was decent, but you'll know nothing about her character other than what she did in that scene I mentioned. Sam Rockwell and Paul Dano, wasted! Two top character actors, given menial roles with crap dialogue to keep them going. The fight scenes are decent, but nothing special. The set piece finale at the end has to be the most unimaginative action scene ever committed to film. Yeah, its Cowboys fighting Aliens in a movie called Cowboys and Aliens, which is still a crap title and I don't think I'll ever get used to it. There are only three reasons why I was able to hang on for two hours. The aliens look great! They looked big, ugly, seriously scary and ready to tear your head off! So props to the alien designers, they did a good job with that. Next, Adam Beach who plays the Indian scout should've had more screen time. I really liked his character and his performance in this. Great actor, watch Flags of Our Fathers and you'll see what I'm talking about. Finally Harrison Ford was just great in this. He's finally playing roles that suit his age. Every scene he was in, he reminded me why he deserves top billing with Daniel Craig! The man owns every scene and showed he is still able to handle himself when it came to the action scenes. Perhaps if he was given the Daniel Craig role, it would've made for a better film. Guess we'll never know. As for Faveraux, I'm not a big fan, but the first Iron Man film put him on my radar. But his direction with this is just aimless. Nothing memorable and there isn't anything in this to get excited about. And the fact that the crappy Smurfs movie is doing better in ticket sales should tell you something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scenery was beautiful, costumes and western decor were authentic but greatly laking story detail!! Movie tried to have emotional build up so you could bond with characters but it just wasn't there. Missed the mark. Lame copy lines such as "Just use your mind but don't think". I left with a lot of questions about the plot. Aliens were out dated. Spielberg needs to step it up to modern times and come up with something new and cool. Did not believe in Harrison Fords character. He starts out as this mean bad ass and then becomes extremely soft. Weird. I love Harrison Ford but not in this movie. I think director focused on the authentic cowboy feeling rather than directing the plot</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Glad I didn't pay extra for the 1201 showing on Friday morning because Cowboys and Aliens is the biggest disappointment of the Summer. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie since it starred a few of my favorite people, Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Clancy Brown and Sam Rockwell. It was directed by Jon Favreau. I guess it's hard to translate some graphic comics to film. A history of violence did it well but Cowboys and Aliens is not humorous enough to be fun and not dark enough to be so serious. All of the actors try to do their best with the material but the dialog is so bad that it makes you cringe. Favreau should have paid more attention to older westerns instead I think he saw the recent remake of True Grit one too many times as the film reminds me of that film. The aliens were scary, whoopie. We've seen so many aliens on film we're immune. Its the cowboy story we were more interested in and that failed to live up to our expectations.One final note, I got a chance to review the synopsis of the comic book story. Like the Prince of Persia too bad the writers didn't use the original storyline which of course is much better than the mess they came up with for this movie. When will Hollywood writers learn, its the story your fools.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very special movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I mean special as in special education. When you read a title like Cowboys and Aliens you just know it's gonna end badly. However, the actual movie is not as bad as the title - it's a lot worse. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it builds the immune system, much like a disease. Throwing your money out the window or giving it to charity would be a far better investment of both your time and money. When people start calling no talent bums like Daniel Craig and Olivia Wilde actors it's like an invitation to steal. Please, if you absolutely have to cast a chick, at least cast one that is easy on the eyes. I didn't even realize Harrison Ford was in this movie until I read the cast list. Well, I can't be expected to recognize every old geezer. I thought Harrison Ford has been dead for years - wait, that was his career! But the most disgusting part is the writing. It's not just Sci-Fi Channel bad, but downright retarded, like it's been written by a monkey with a typewriter, or a politician. I'm not talking about minor inconsistencies or plot holes. This flick is full of scenes that make no sense whatsoever.Scenes like the following:- why would this alien take off his weapon and put it right next to Craig, who wasn't even sedated? I guess the alien didn't expect Craig to resist anal probing.- Craig, totally disoriented, manages to evade dozens of aliens and keeps pretty much the most powerful weapon of theirs. And this weapon is pretty neat: anyone can use it, it has no safety switch, doesn't need batteries (so even women can use it, I guess), it warns when other aliens are nearby (but apparently cannot be detected itself) and can disintegrate a big-ass spaceship..... except it's a bracelet. Guess the aliens come from a planet that's big on Show Tunes...- of all the possible reasons like colonization, extermination and slavery the writers picked the dumbest idea I can think of why the aliens came. They came for the gold. Not some rare element that exists only on Earth, or water or even oil. That is beyond lame. - why would the aliens abduct those humans? They were not used as slaves or food, just hooked up to some green light floating above them and staring at it like zombies (alien version of television?). Wilde said the humans were abducted so the aliens could learn their weaknesses (through invasive medical procedures). Except the aliens seem physically superior to humans. Combine that with weapons that can blow up a mountain and you don't need medical experiments, just a general idea on which continent your enemy is.- Wilde's character, Ella (yeah, that's an alien sounding name) claims she is the only survivor of a civilization that was destroyed by the aliens and she came to warn humanity (the only time I buy the sole survivor crap is in Mass Effect). So she traveled from some unknown planet in an unknown galaxy by unknown means. Yet she doesn't warn anybody, just uses the humans to take revenge on the aliens by blowing up their ship.- Wilde dies in Craig's arms shortly after being mistaken for an organ donor by a crashed alien (I'd like to see Craig carry her for real a few miles. Hope the poor guy didn't sprain his back). Back at the camp the posse gets captured by Indians and taken to their village. As soon as they arrive, some Indian tosses the cadaver into the camp fire. What the hell? Their women were probably cooking dinner over that fire just minutes ago! Or did they keep it burning in case they happen to find a corpse? Did Indians even do that? I mean they're Indians, not Vikings. Why would Indians drag the body of a dead white chick to their village and then cremate it? Next thing you know there's a lot of CGI, I mean flames, Wilde takes human form but clothes are evidently not part of the deal (don't worry, you won't go blind or anything, it's just her back).- the aliens mastered spaceflight yet they avoid daylight and make almost no use of their technology. Their ship has no sensors inside or outside, no security cameras, no guards, not even a freaking window. The humans had to blow up half their ship so the aliens would notice them.In conclusion: don't watch this train wreck - unless you're a glutton for punishment and have eaten at least half an hour before the movie starts.P.S.: you might wanna take a bag (preferably plastic, paper soaks through) with you, nothing too fancy, just big enough for, say, your stomach contents. And maybe a friend if you have long hair...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Stupid It Makes Your Brain Bleed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cowboys &amp; Aliens is perhaps the worst movie of 2011. Or perhaps only the stupidest movie of 2011. With some of the worst acting of 2011. Although it apparently was based on a comic book, this movie might well have been written by a dozen monkeys with typewriters, or more accurately, half a dozen screenwriters desperate for a dumb but potentially lucrative idea to pitch to some greedy Hollywood producers with very, very low opinions of their audience. In other words, a "high concept" idea perfect for low, low IQs. But what results is, of course, an insult not only to the audience but to both westerns and science fiction movies. On top of that, there is so much glorified gun violence--even the preacher (a "whiskey preacher," naturally, for no cliché is left unturned) advises everyone to get a gun--that this movie could well be a two-hour commercial for the NRA. (Although sitting through the movie seems more like TEN very, very excruciating hours than its nominal two hour run time.) Well, did you ever expect Steven Spielberg, who produced this pile of horse manure, to be working for the NRA? And are we truly expected to care that human scum is marginally better than alien scum? By the end of the movie, I was rooting for the alien scum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien Invasion At Its Boring Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Jon Favreau directed Cowboys And Aliens we have Jake played by Daniel Craig wake up in the middle of nowhere with a metal bracelet attached to his wrist.He does not remember his name and also don't know where he is.Harrison Ford now comes into the picture and he plays Dolarhyde,a local cattle baron.There is also a lady played by Olivia Wilde who follows Jake wherever he goes.And as the movie title suggests aliens are soon introduced.When it comes to the genre of alien invasion,Cowboys And Aliens have nothing new or spectacular to provide the audience.This is somewhat shocking as about 5 writers are credited to the script of the movie.With the likes of the latest James Bond star and the Indianna Jones one would expect at the least a half-decent movie.But Cowboys And Aliens fail to match even that standard.In a crucial scene in the film when a character explains why the aliens themselves got here in the first place you will be forced to think why you are sitting in the cinema hall watching this movie.The reason behind the entry of the aliens is so stupid and absurd that it looks like the half dozen odd writers inserted it into the story to provide the flick a novel touch.As far as I am concerned this inane reason played a major part in making me hate this movie.In the end Cowboys And Aliens makes a terrible waste of its big star cast.For Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford,this is one of their worst movies till date.There is also nothing worth mentioning about the special effects and we have seen them already in countless movies.The chances are slim that Cowboys And Aliens will appeal even to the die hard fans of the two stars.To me the film was a complete waste of money and two hours of my life.VERDICT- 2/10(POOR STUFF)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What else can be said about a movie titled, "Cowboys and Aliens?" Not since the days of our dear Bella Legosi have we been forced to encounter a title so humorous and energy draining. The title itself was a draw back from the rest of the film; it would have been much more suspenseful if the title of the film had not revealed to the viewer right away that aliens would be featured. My dear wife summed up the entire plot of the film, "Take the bracelet from the "Scorpion King," put it on James Bond, marry that to "Red Dead Redemption," and add a few blood- thirsty aliens." The plot was very predictable, the dialog was cheap, corny, and amusing, and the effects seemed to hearken back to the days of the Playstation 2. Characters seemed flat, dull, and boring, while the only redeeming point about this movie was the performance of Clancy Brown (who played "The Kurgen" in the first "Highlander" movie), which really brought the whole B-movie experience full circle. My advice, invest your time and money in a more well deserving summer movie. Or better yet, go to the video store and rent one of the old Legosi or Carlof movies. You will get as many laughs from the ridiculous story and cheap dialog as you could from this movie, for a mere fraction of the cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting despite the fact it makes no sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cowboys &amp; Aliens is an outrageous and unprecedented melding of the western and science fiction genres that has all the ingredients for a first rate popcorn movie except for one thing...a story that makes sense.The 2011 film opens with us encountering Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig), a cowboy who wakes up in an 1873 Arizona desert with no memory of who he is, a serious wound on his side, and a futuristic looking weapon attached to one of his wrists. Jake travels to a nearby western hamlet called Absolution where it is revealed he is a wanted man on multiple charges. En route to facing a federal Marshall, the town is attacked by a group of alien space ships that snatch up several citizens in the town, but Jake is somehow able to fend them off with his wrist weapon. Jake then teams up with a group of Absolution citizens, led by a military colonel/cattle baron (Harrison Ford), whose son (Paul Dano) was abducted by the aliens. Throw into the mix a mysterious prostitute (Olivia Wilde) who claims a vague connection to Jake and her own agenda regarding these bizarre events.The story also involves a woman from Jake's past whose death he feels responsible for and a large cache of gold and a large gang of criminal cowboys who apparently were led by Jake who are torn by Jake's alleged reappearance in their gang, though Jake seems to have no recall of his association with them.If this sounds confusing, it's because it is...this story is a valiant attempt at trying something off the cinematic beaten path, but there is WAY too much left unexplained. We're never sure if Jake is really from the 1870's west or from the future, where the gold came from and if it is real gold as we see it morph into an explosive device that blows a roof off a building or why a group of futuristic space aliens want control of an 1870's western town. I kept watching and waiting for that one scene or moment in the film that would pull everything together for me, but that moment never came, not even after the bloody and terrifying final act where the wild west and outer space have their final showdown.As confusing as I found the story to be, I kept watching. I found this film absolutely riveting and could not take my eyes off the screen. Steven Spielberg and Jon Favreau served as executive producers of this film and Favreau also took on the mammoth directorial responsibility involved in the mounting of such an elaborate story, though Spielberg's touch is all over this...this is the kind of fantasy/adventure that Spielberg likes to produce and I'm sure he had Favreau's ear throughout production.This film is expensively mounted with a great deal of care and detail and the casting works for the most part. Daniel Craig is the most durable action hero since John McClane and Harrison Ford shows he still has the chops to command the screen. Olivia Wilde makes the most of her most substantial screen role and there is also a solid supporting turn from Sam Rockwell as a saloon owner whose wife was also abducted by the aliens. There is some entertainment value to be gleaned from this film, as long as you don't think about it or try to figure it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As long as Craig kept walking away from the camera I was in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout watching this strange Sci-Fi-Western mash up I was left waffling between this is ridiculous and its just an okay movie. I never did fully come to a conclusion. Its kind of a mix of 'True Grit' meets War of the Worlds' and the combination didn't work for me. I will say that I enjoyed the movie as a Western (even if that storyline was pretty generic) however once the Aliens showed up it failed.Daniel Craig was probably the sole reason I saw this to its conclusion, he takes his role seriously and looks damn fine as a cowboy in 'those' chaps. I wasn't all that impressed with his American accent but as long as he kept walking away from the camera I was in.The movie is action packed, fun I guess and I liked that the story wasn't fully revealed right away so that I had to figure things out, like who 'Jake' is -good or bad, what is the purpose of his cool bracelet, and who the "demons" are.The movie opens with Craig waking up in the desert, he is an amnesiac with no memories of who he is or how he got there. After a bit of a dust up with some outlaws he heads into the nearest town, where according to the sheriff he's a wanted criminal. This becomes irrelevant however when aliens attack and abduct several of the townsfolk as Jake and his gadget turn out to be their only hope.Harrison Ford is his usual grumpy old man self, maybe even more so here and for the most part I found his character annoying. I enjoyed Adam Beach in a pretty useless role, was very happy that we saw the dog again and liked Sam Rockwell as Doc. The ending was dumb as was Olivia Wilde's character (what?!) and her thrown in romance angle. 9/28/15</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cowboys and Aliens (2011): Dir: Jon Favreau / Cast: Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Olivia Wilde, Sam Rockwell, Paul Dano: An intriguing combination of past and present, old and new that works from a visual standpoint while the plot is corny. Set in the old west, alien spacecrafts appear and abduct everyone in sight save for a few gun wrangling survivors who set off to rescue their loved ones. Jon Favreau previously made Iron Man, which places this project in good hands, but that film is much better plotted and a lot less ridiculous. The visuals here are good with hulking nasty aliens on the attack in search of gold. Daniel Craig plays the hero who awakens in the western desert with a strange mechanical bracelet on his arm. It will later be learned that this is a weapon. He has no memory as to who he is but he comes to realize that his past was riddled with criminal activity and the death of the woman he loved, which lands him where he awakens. Harrison Ford plays a wealthy cattle rancher whose son is arrested due to foul behavior. He begins as a threat to the town until the alien visitors have him joining in the search. This all concludes on a big pow wow shoot out against the aliens, with Olivia Wilde playing a mysterious woman who adds to a great plot twist as well as the plot solution. It is also obvious that sissy bartender, played by Sam Rockwell will grow a pair. Paul Dano plays Ford's ignorant son who ends up being beamed to life in space.

		<shortDescription>Could have been a classic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have apparently been a member of IMDb for 3 years and 8 months during which I have never felt the need to write a review. I enjoy reading the reviews on here very much and for me that was enough, until now.Having avoided watching Cowboys and Aliens for over 3 years(due in no small part to the reviews), I came across the extended version for a $1.49 and thought what the heck.I was not expecting much to be frank but during the very first scene a man grabs a small shotgun type weapon from his holster, the gun is made of polystyrene or other cheap plastic and almost flies out of his hands for being too light. You could say it's bad acting and god knows who teaches the doctors on Greys Anatomy to carry those disposable paper coffee cups that are so obviously empty but this is just a different level. It caught my eye so completely that I started to look at the set and props. Spoiler.Then next up is Big Dan's Alien wristband, that is clearly and undeniably made of plastic, not even a mystery metal look is available from the prop man. A trip to the 99 cent store to buy a He-Man (and the Masters of the Universe) children's fancy dress pack is all that is necessary for $163,000,000 budget to be utilised effectively. Needless to say that when Big Dan arrives in town for the first time it is clear that the town is the cardboard cut-out one from Blazing Saddles. At last I realise this is a spoof comedy, stop taking it so seriously...Spoiler; The Indians who do and don't understand English are hilarious and I think the writers got the ideas from that Clint Eastwood film with the funny Indian who can't sneak up on anyone. There are so many just unbelievable one-liners that this film (even "Whisky" is so funny) may achieve a cult status some day.This film was supposed to be an Airplane! meets Blazing Saddles meets Men in Black. Personally I was more concerned the Men in White were going to take me away I was laughing so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Sci-Fi meets a Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this movie, I was not sure it would be a movie I would like. If a movie has a "far-fetched" premise, it has to be well written and well acted to make it believable.Essentially, the story is about aliens coming to a western US desert town in the late 1800s. The aliens are intent on taking over the earth. The local townsfolk with a tribe of Native-Americans are intent on stopping them.The movie is violent with a lot of spectacular explosions. The writing is just enough to make the movie entertaining while the acting is great providing most of the value of the film.This movie is OK, but not one that I will probably watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clichés &amp; Derivations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jon Favreau's Cowboys &amp; Aliens isn't a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, but his mixture of what Roger Ebert called "the most cockamamie plot in recent memory"--that of a group of cowboys, criminals, and Indians joining forces to defend Earth against an invasion of nasty, extra-terrestrial gold miners--with the sturdy hands of Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde makes for a cheerful waste of two plus hours on TV. Maybe the best compliment I can give C&amp;A is that I watched it last night with the lights off (to reduce the glare) and I eventually had to turn them back on because this goofy, mediocre-in-so-many-ways, cockamamie monster flick was starting to get to me. Yet, I am irritated with Steven Spielberg for producing a movie that has too many similarities with his tedious War of the Worlds (and the aliens here are big, nasty critters that move like the concrete-come-to-life, horned, glowing-eyed dog-thingies in Ghostbusters). There are enough clichés and derived bits from other monster-movies to give you a weird, slight sense of deja vu. But I quibble. Taking the time to watch Cowboys &amp; Aliens might seem wasted, but any time one walks away from a motion picture with a pleasantly satisfied feeling--and a reluctance to turn the lights off--can't be too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, being in Saudi Arabia, where no cinemas are allowed, keeps the movie maniacs (like me!) waiting most times for a couple of years, just to get the opportunity of watching a fresh movie on TV. I know, it's horrible!Anyways, only today I watched the subject movie (i.e., after 2 years &amp; 7 months), and honestly I was eager and waiting for it, as I still remember it was amongst the 'Top 10' in the 'US Box Office' for several weeks. But unfortunately, the movie - as a whole - was so disappointing...Moving down to our main topic; the story has no solid structure, and basically, similar to a dozen of other movies, where the 'Aliens' are usually evil intruders, trying to takeover the mother earth, however the only difference here is the time; it's happening in 1873, while the rest of events are almost the same.Needless to mention that the insignificant performance of most - if not all - cast, was the main factor to find this movie, an absolute waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is awful and extremely predictable so I will write about the twist exclusively: I admit I'm a sucker because the twist is about the only thing in the movie I hadn't anticipated. But it makes sense. Imagine being an alien with the ability to shape yourself into anything, what would you do? Would you appear as a homely, fat-as-a-walrus person with skin disease or would you rather buy a fashion magazine and appear as the hottest model with a great body? I'll be honest with you, I would appear as a model admiring my naked body in the mirror for hours, I would then start playing with my assets to see how they feel in my hands. After that I'll find the latest James Bond and...no, wait, I was a male in my last shape, I don't know if I'm attracted to guys.And the above nonsense is about the only thing I can say about the film, the rest of it is nothing you haven't seen a thousand times over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a disappointment, but still worth seeing (if you like this sort of thing)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For my money, "Firefly" (and the movie finale "Serenity") did a better job of combining the old West and Science Fiction. And that hadn't come first (and set the bar so high), this movie might have gotten a better reception. I read the original graphic novel a few years back, and while the art wasn't anything special or slick, the story worked very well on a comic book level.To me, "Cowboys and Aliens" is a great idea. A title (and concept) that shares the archetypal resonance of the timeless childhood role playing game, but takes a quick left hook and leaves me going: ""Oh yeah? Heh!".And the movie looks great, even spectacular. The special effects compare well to other state of the art affairs (like the remakes of "Total Recall" and "Clash of the Titans".) The old West backdrop is gorgeous and epic, a fit backdrop for the potentially world shaking events being stage on it. Most of the dialog has the proper dry fatalism and "old time tough" give and take to it, especially when Clancy Brown delivers it. But somehow, the end results miss the mark. I dunno - maybe the idea of the townsfolk and cowboys all going on a quest to get their families back from bad guys was still too played out. Or the character arcs were too pat and predictable. Also, I'm a fan of Daniel Craig and his roles in Bond movies and challenging stuff like "Layer Cake" have been intriguing and satisfiying, and heaven knows he's in spectacular shape here...but he just didn't satisfy as an amnesiac cowboy/Man With No Name. Might be the fault of the character murky motivations and very limited dialog.As I said, the movie isn't "bad", it's just a disappointment. There is plenty to like about it, but it just doesn't feel epic and amazing. That puts it firmly in "7 out of 10" territory for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original But Unnecessarily Downbeat Movie Of Gold Mining Extra-Terrestrials</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Old West times, a man wakes up in the middle of the desert with a wound in his chest and a strange bracelet on his arm, with no idea who he is or how he got there. Stumbling into town, he suddenly finds himself in a battle with forces from another world ...This movie has a great title, the terrific casting coup of Craig and Ford as the leads, an intriguing western/science-fiction hybrid storyline and a good score, but for me is a bit of a disappointment. Surely this sort of film should be lots of fun - jokes, witty lines, thrills and spills, romance, goofy moments. I should be laughing and gasping. Instead, it comes out as almost unremittingly dour and unpleasant. In the opening scene, Craig kills three guys (including an old man) indiscriminately, and his and Ford's characters, rather than square-jawed heroes, turn out to be a cold-hearted outlaw and a miserly cattle baron, with few redeeming qualities. The aliens are uncharacterised sadistic butchers, there's very little humour, and the ending is kinda downbeat too. Gee, what a great Saturday matinée ! It isn't all bad though; some of the individual story threads are good (such as Bronc, the Indian brave who wants to be a surrogate son, and is the only guy I can root for), Roger Guyett's visual effects are great and the locations are nice (it was shot in New Mexico). Best of all for me is the Ella character, very nicely played by Wilde (who's also terrific in Tron: Legacy) - she provides some genuine intrigue and turns out to be the lynchpin of the story. This movie is okay, but suffers the usual Hollywood six-writers-ten-producers lack of direction - its makers could really do to look at the old fifties sci-fi classics (or the films of Joe Dante) to realise how much fun material like this can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cowboys vs. Aliens: Who is smarter?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Summary: Though he wakes not knowing who he is, Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig, "Skyfall") learns soon enough of who he can be. Running into an old acquaintance he doesn't remember (though not necessarily a good one), Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford, "Star Wars") helps find the aliens. Without a choice Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde, "Deadfall"), joins the crusade as well to look for someone she lost, or so she claimed. Lonegran has no idea who is but he has an idea of who can, the woman in the picture. Together they ride off along with others to help and search for their lost loved ones. Long story short it is about "Cowboys &amp; Aliens".This movie was directed by Jon Favreau, "The Avengers" and written by Roberto Orci, "Star Trek Into Darkness".My Review: The quality of sound is my biggest complaint. It was hard to follow the movie/plot without hearing what was going on. The visual however on our wonderful HDTV was amazing. The plot was pretty straight forward. Cowboys and their guns getting in trouble with the unknown creatures that followed our" James Bond" leader. I like that "Indiana Jones" was his partner in taking down the Aliens. To describe the aliens (which now would be the time to skip this SPOILER), look like a swamp thing's head with the body of an alien body on steroids. There is more action than anything in this movie. I would say the movie is 50% action, 50% talking. It's a fun movie to watch. One that I own (thanks to his g'rents) and would probably watch again.</fullReview>

This takes place in 1873 Arizona where we meet injured stranger, Jake Lonergan (Craig) who can't remember who he is or where he comes from. Soon, he meets a mysterious woman, Ella Swenson (Wilde) who helps him try to get his memory back and also meets businessman, Woodrow Dolarhyde (Ford). After they encounter deadly aliens trying to take over the west, Jake begins remembering images of what happened to him and works with Dolarhyde and others to stop them. This is pretty good and Craig and Ford are good together. I recommend this.</fullReview>

That's the oldest Sci-Fi cliché in the book! Its mind boggling that it took eight writers to come up with this rudimentary script. The acting is passable, considering the dialogue they had to work with. Mixing spaceships with the Wild West doesn't make the look of the film appealing either. The SFX is generic, it's like they copied and pasted the aliens from STARSHIP TROOPERS.

		<shortDescription>Not Especially Original, But Some Exciting Battle Scenes Against The Aliens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic premise of "Cowboys and Aliens" is all right. Aliens have arrived in a New Mexico town in the 1870's looking for gold and willing to do whatever it takes to get the gold. I suppose there's no particular reason to believe that aliens from another planet wouldn't consider gold a precious metal that they'd be willing to kill and possibly die for, so why not? As a vehicle for moving the story along it's fine. So right off, the movie blends a couple of different (although certainly not unique) themes: the western-sci-fi hybrid (which has been done before, for example, in "Wild, Wild West") and the greed and violence that ensues when gold fever strikes (any number of titles could be used as examples, including a number of sci-fi movies which involved the idea of aliens wanting something out of the earth.) So this isn't especially unique in any way. In the end, I suppose, the lack of uniqueness is the biggest weak spot of the movie. It's rather predictable. We can easily guess that the story is going to lead up to a climactic battle with the aliens, and we can easily guess who's going to win the battle. The predictability of the movie makes the movie as a whole seem rather long. We know where it's going. We really want to get there.The battle scenes are well done, though. The special effects are great - again, though, nothing especially that makes you sit up and take notice. While well done, they're also pretty standard for the genre. The alien creatures are interesting as well. There's a rather subtle message of reconciliation going on here. Various folks who don't like each other (maybe, most notably, the cowboys and "Indians") are forced into co- operation and a certain degree of mutual understanding because of the common threat they face. I didn't think any of the performances were especially noteworthy. No one was bad or out of place; but no one was outstanding either.There were a couple of plot points that bothered me. I wondered throughout the movie how and why Jake (Daniel Craig) came into possession of the bracelet that was also a deadly weapon? If it was explained I missed it. The other thing that made little sense to me was the vision of the aliens. We were told by Ella (Olivia Wilde) that the aliens couldn't see well in daylight. For creatures that had poor day vision, they seemed to do well enough in battle with the sun overhead!There's certainly nothing in this that's comes across as spectacular. The story (with a couple of twists) has basically been done before. But the battle against the aliens is pretty exciting in the end, and the theme of reconciliation works as a kind of subtle subplot.

		<fullReview>the film was a convoluted mess of a picture. I am a big Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford fan so I had big expectations. This coupled with the fact that it was supposedly based on a graphic novel of some renown and was being directed by Jon Favreau led me to believe it was going to be something worth watching. I mean who doesn't like cowboys and who doesn't like aliens, they should go together like chocolate and peanut butter. However, they ended up going together as well as pop rocks and coca cola. Also they had a lot of Indians in this film and that wasn't mentioned in the title or the previews. Maybe if they called it Cowboys, Indians and Aliens it would of have been a better film.Check out our full review at 3guys1movie.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>action film, seriously?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cowboys and Aliens seriously failed to be one of the best action films of 21st century, not even close to becoming a real action movie. It is all costumes, scenic locations and unintelligible dialogues.The movie started out with the mystery of the amnesiac guy and as the story progresses(very slowly),learned of his cowboy identity and alien's hideout. Everything in between are dusts, blastings, horse riding, and more dusts. The plot is boring.It would have beautifully unfold into an Oscar-worthy Western film if they took out the aliens and evolved the story around the unique characters like Percy, Nat Colorado, Dollarhyde, Doc, the boy Emmett. They have stories to tell, they have dramas to share. BUt since, this is based on a graphic novel, they can't take out the monsters.Surely, they could have developed the plot by adding more exciting elements. What about the cowboys having improved weapons due to an alien like Olivia Wilde's character, who taught them an advanced technology? Then the war could have ensued better, making it a real action flick with all the special effects. (What is Olivia Wilde doing there again, aside from being the representative of the female population and seducing? Didn't she burn in the fire and arise like a phoenix, back from the dead, but died in the explosion of the towership? Weird.)The characters didn't connect much due to the boring plot. They have promising introduction with no development. There are interesting scenes though like Percy's bullying of the townspeople, the Indian rituals and the encounter with thieves.All in all, this is a great movie to watch if you want to fall asleep in a beach or on a plane. I expected too much from its title, that's why I got very disappointed.</fullReview>

Ranchers and cowpokes, led by a mysterious gunslinger Jake Lonergan(Daniel Craig)are fiercely feuding with the local Apache Indians. Having the most at stake is cattle baron Woodrow Dolarhyde(Harrison Ford). A spacecraft lands carrying some odd looking creatures with full intent of making slaves of the human race. Cattle rustlers, six-gun-shootin' cowboys and Apaches agree on a truce long enough to fight a swarm of uninvited extraterrestrials. Some nice special effects, actually filmed in New Mexico. A well rounded supporting cast includes: Keith Carradine, Sam Rockwell, Clancy Brown, Adam Beach, Buck Taylor and the ever fetching Olivia Wilde.

		<shortDescription>An Odd Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this movie when I first saw the trailers. The juxtaposition of cowboys and aliens seemed fresh and engaging and equaling appealing was the casting of Craig, Ford, and Wilde. Unfortunately, it failed to live up to the hype of my mind.The more I think about it, the more I realize that the most disappointing thing about this movie is how generic the aliens are. At one point Olivia Wilde's character comments that the aliens thinks humans are nothing more than insects. Yet, the irony is that the aliens are the bug-eyed ones. And you will get lots of interesting looks at what this director thinks aliens look like. I am fairly confident that if aliens ever did land here, they would be incomprehensible to us.It seems that alien movies more than any other suffer from an acute case of deus ex machina. This is a little different in that the movie begins with one. Yet, for some reason these aliens seem to lack any judgment as they rush headlong one after another into Craig's sniper accurate shots while they themselves never seem capable of hitting a thing. Cliché anyone? The movie tries real hard to inject back story into the main characters but fails rather miserably in being convincing and neither does it seem relevant in what is ultimately a shoot 'em up adventure.So if you want to watch a movie with some action and appealing visual effects this is it. If you recoil at old clichés then I suggest watching something else.2.5 out of 4</fullReview>

I haven't really seen any, the only one that I think I've seen is Back to the Future part 3, and even though I like it, that's my least favorite of the trilogy. So I went into this movie pretty much hoping the sci fi would keep my attention.Well the sci fi was by far the best part of this movie, but I still didn't really like it. For me it's way too slow and focuses much more on the western stuff than the sci fi stuff. It also took itself a little too seriously, there were some times where they lightened up, but most of the time they just seemed so down.The acting is good, even young Noah Ringer who's improved a lot since Last Airbender. But the movie just wasn't made for me, it didn't mix western and sci fi well, I didn't really care for the characters, and only some of the action scenes were exiting. If you love both sci fi and Westerns, you might really like this movie. Just not really my thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cowboys &amp; Aliens is directed by John Favreau and collectively written by Damon Lindelof, Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby and Steve Oedekerk. It stars Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Olivia Wilde, Clancy Brown and Sam Rockwell. Music is scored by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Matthew Libatique.It's 1873 in the Arizona Territory, and an unnamed loner (Daniel Craig) awakens in the desert bleeding from an injury, with no memory, and with a strange metal bracelet shackled to his wrist. Making his way to the nearby town of Absolution, he discovers his name, what happened to him and finds that soon, he, and the citizens of Absolution, must engage in a fight for friends and family against an alien race.Silly title, it really is. More so because it has been proved to be misleading as to the content of the actual film. Oh there is cowboys and aliens in the film, and great fun at times it is to see two genres spliced into one big money backed movie. But the title does lend itself to an expectation of wall to wall froth, a world where tongues are in cheek and explosions surround a bunch of jovial Western characters as they face off against an alien foe. As anyone who has seen the film can attest, Cowboys and Aliens is anything but frothy. It proves to be an uneasy blend of genres, a task that director Favreau and the ream of writers involved in the project, don't fully complete. You have to wonder if the number of writers involved lost sight of a collective goal? Because the film at times comes off as a gnarly, grizzled machismo piece, taking its story seriously, only to then stop taking itself seriously to bring the no brain thrills for the popcorn crowd. It's no wonder that it has failed to find an audience since it's not sure how to find itself!Money makes you soft.However, a second viewing of the film can bring better rewards once armed with the knowledge of what type of film it is. There's much to enjoy, from a mostly agreeable cast to the excellent Western visuals; and from the well constructed action set pieces to the outrageousness of the premise, Favreau's film has plenty of guts, grandeur and gunnery to keep the undemanding entertained. The flaws remain (cliches, stereotypes, logic holes), and in fact the weak plot and reasoning for the alien motives is even more annoying second time around. But it's never dull and the visual effects are more charming than most other big budgeted blockbusters. That the effects are not swallowing the film whole is a big plus, it puts the human characterisations front and centre, where the likes of Craig, Ford (both mean and broody), Rockwell (excellent) and Brown (likewise) come to the fore to at least keep us interested in how it all pans out before the inevitable battle provides the answers. While from a red blooded guy point of view, more of the lovely Olivia Wilde instead of showy alien effects is fine by me, even if her character is pretty much a token one.Second viewing brings better rewards, yet it's always going to struggle to find a fully committed fan base, but it's far from being the disaster some disappointed first time viewers proclaim it as. Not a great film for sure, but it is a good one. 7/10 Footnote: It scrubs up real well on Blu-ray, the work of Libatique comes shining through as the Western vistas please the eyes with their detail, while the low lighting for the interiors gives off a nice Wild West hue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First dinosaurs, now aliens. What will they come up next?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a match-up that's just totally unexpected. Sure, cowboys fighting dinosaurs in "The Valley of Gwangi" was crazy enough, but now we have Westerns taking on extraterrestrials that came to Earth with a realistic but odd motivation: gold! Throw in a big cast and you got yourself one heck of a hoedown. This is Cowboys and Aliens.Like so many movies nowadays, this one is based on the comic (which I never read). You have this stranger (Daniel Craig) who wakes up with little memory of who he was with a strange device on his wrist. He gets into a town inhabited by misfits (Harrison Ford, Clancy Brown, Olivia Wilde, etc.) and suddenly war-like aliens come down and terrorize them. Everyone's gotta team up despite their differences against these creatures.Emotions are conveyed well enough and the themes are quite substantial. There's good comedy here and there as well throughout the film to keep a smile on your face. The aliens are pretty creative, almost like a cross between a frog and a crab. They're powerful as well as really menacing. The action scenes are pretty impressive; they keep you guessing on what's gonna happen next.I do have some problems though. I think that aliens coming for gold, while interesting and realistic, felt like something's missing. They could have gone after other precious metals like silver and it seems slaughtering the local population is unnecessary. Also, the movie came out at the same time as so many other alien movies, which makes this one seem to bend in with the crowd. It's a bit of a buzz kill and it takes away a point or two.Overall, decent but nothing special. I expected a little more but there's nothing I can do. It all makes me think that they should do a remake of "The Valley of Gwangi." Wanna see cowpokes fighting crab-frogs from space, then check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One expected a lot from Jon Farveau (director of IRONMAN). The movie itself was marketed like that but Cowboy &amp; Aliens was a decent movie with one or two exciting scenes which was good enough for a one time watch. That's it.The Story :- The film starts with Jake (Daniel Craig) waking up from a sleep with an armor on his left hand. He has no clue as to how he got into this and his where about . To find the clue , he reaches a town where he meets (Olivia) . She also trying to seek the truth and questions him. All of sudden , the town comes under attack by bunch of alien spaceships. What follows next is series of kidnappings by aliens. Jake and other people of the town indulges in the counter attack .Harison Ford's son is also abducted in the process and everybody in the town blames Jake for the attack. What follows next is how the people along with Jake fight with aliens and retrieves the people of the town. The review When I first saw the trailer of the movie , I was kind of dissatisfied with it. The trailer itself did not have the spark in it. Since Jon Farveau( director of Ironman) was behind the director's seat , I had some hope left for the film. So the movie was just a decent with nothing new to offer. The concept of Cowboys fighting off with aliens did not excited me at all. The story was just about OK. The direction was feeble. The performances were average. Since this was a sci-fi flick, one expects ample of visual effects to be used but hardly it is worthwhile . Overall, the movie is only a one ?time watch. You will watch it and will soon forget about it. Average ? 2.5 / 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Cowboys &amp; Aliens"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A spaceship arrives in Arizona, 1873, to take over the Earth, starting with the Wild West region. A posse of cowboys and natives are all that stand in their way.Cowboys and Aliens is just another Hollywood movie. Now yes, I could make zillions paragraphs describing and how and why the movie fails, but I don't need too. Sure, the visuals and directing is all good, but the formula has nothing to it. It's just pure action, nothing new in between it. It has no twist, no memorable dialogue, no anything of that nature. So I wanted the review to be simple and to the point, because the movie did the same to me while watching it. It's been done before, thousands of times, and I didn't need to see it yet again. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could be awesome if they have added real fight between Alein and Humans.. When i watched this movie, i thought that there are more action series on TV Channel rather than this movie.. Daniel Craig is Handsome guy, but story is so limited.. sometime it was comedy showing aliens flying over the village, and to see them in their typical Alein base, Movie Doesn't have more locations,less Fantasy Realism, and many loop holes, and many things which are easily can be seen by an Alein Movie Lover.. This is just a sci-fi TV serial not a Bigscreen movie.. While watching movie we can see that also, that they didn't wasted money and time in building this movie, then why should we also waste our time and money..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Bond feat. Indiana Jones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As all u can see from my summary title above, this film maybe THE WORST usage of 2 great star whom these 2 were formerly play as an iconic figure in movie history.. the first time we heard the name movie title, we thought " dough" "huh", etc. and then after we saw the trailer + the list of the cast in this movie we thought "hmm this maybe will not a bad movie". after saw this movie, i bet 60-80% of you felt disappointed. why not...? there's a good reason why Cowboy &amp; Aliens fail to fulfill people's expectation. first of all the there are many plot-hole in the script that makes people feel confused when watching this movie. it takes a little bit too long to explain the Daniel Craig's past character. but the most important thing is: just like my summary title said.. when we heard Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford cast in this movie together (again i bet) all of us would expect that there will be a some great action by these two stars.. but then again what do we got...? a very so-so action quality. although in my view Daniel &amp; Harrison did a very hard &amp; try to make as exciting as possible but still the action was just like that. Daniel was the only man who worked his a*s off in this film so it makes Harrison look like a cameo rather than a supporting actor. the best "James Bond &amp; Indiana Jones together" is in Harrison's iconic movie: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade which Ford teaming up with the original 007, Sean Connery. Olivia Wilde in this movie did everything she could but then again it also went flat.The Alien also looks ridiculous that could make E.T much..much better (maybe the sexiest alien ever LOL..!!) the 1 thing (in my view) that make people want to watch this movie till it's credit title is the past of Daniel's character. but then again just like i said above it takes too long although fortunately, in the end, we understood his character's past clearly. but overall this film just so-so there's nothing special about it. so the lesson that we can take after watching this movie is don't always expect a big satisfying result in a big satisfying process..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cowboys and Aliens- A Very Fun Popcorn Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cowboys and Aliens is about, well, cowboys who fight aliens. Happy? Okay, sure, there is more to it, but do I really have to go into detail? Fine. A man named Jake wakes up and has no memory of who he is and he ends up getting himself into big trouble. Oh and when he woke up, he found a brace around his arm that reminds me of the Pip-Boy 3000 from Fallout 3 or Ben 10's omnitrix. The plot then turns, as we all expected, into an alien invasion movie. How exactly can cowboys beat aliens? This movie actually does this pretty realistically. It also has a great cast. Two of my favorite actors, Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, star as a duo in this movie and the beautiful Olivia Wilde also stars with them. So we get James Bond, Indiana Jones (and Han Solo, musn't forget that now shall we?), AND Quorra from Tron Legacy??? Sweet! And everyone does a great job and do really great in this western setting. There are some people out there who said the aliens ruined the movie. Well, I don't think those people get this movie. It is simple, fun, and a good movie with some great performances. It tries to blend genres and it does it well. The movie is a western from the beginning and it stays that way until the end. The movie is also a science fiction movie from the beginning and stays that way until the end. Nothing wrong with trying something different.Cowboys and Aliens also has a great amount of cool action scenes. Seeing these cowboys (and cowgirl) fight for there lives against a foe with technology they can't even dream of at the time. It is all great fun.I know I have made it seem as if this movie is a pure masterpiece, but again, it is a popcorn flick. Sit down and watch it with a friend. Watch it in your spare time. It is just good fun. There are problems I haven't mentioned because they don't bother me much. The movie can drag a bit and some of the CGI is unimpressive, but really, none of this detracts from what Cowboys and Aliens is. A fun film. I give Cowboys and Aliens a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The gimmicks in the title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cowboys &amp; Aliens is a mash-up of two B-Movie staples that takes the clichés of both and brings little of the fun the title might promise. The film reeks of being a cool idea a producer thought should make it onto the big screen. In fact this is just the case as the comic book creator put the comic together as a comic/film tie in. The sad truth though is that the film never really gets beyond the gimmick of the title. The aliens are so vague as characters, the film could be Cowboys &amp; Vampires with little changed in the plot.The stellar cast of lead actors do their best with the roles, and Craig and Ford seem perfectly cast as the man without a name (well forget his name) and the rough ex-soldier turned rough rancher. Wilde seems destined to be the leading lady in many a film to come. Also standing out is Adam Beach as Ford's loyal native. There a moments where these actors do get a chance to develop their characters and Favreau plays his part here too. However these moments are few and far between and mark the moments of pause and consideration before the nonsensical alien gold looting, kidnapping and experimenting plot line takes hold.Cowboys &amp; Aliens should not work, yet Favreau in his blockbuster manner makes it appear as though is its fused seamlessly. The two genres do co-exist and to some degree the audience buy it. But never do you care, not for the characters, not for the outcome, especially not about the bug-eyed aliens who stand to threaten the unlikely posse of outlaws, cowboys and apaches to stand against them.For more reviews visit lookbeyondreviews.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Little Better than Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read some poor headline reviews of this movie and decided to take the dive despite them, and to my pleasant surprise, I was happy to have watched the film. Granted there's nothing of strong content or originality really. (Major Spoiler) The Aliens are after gold (?), and they're more-or-less like lots of other cheesy creature flicks - just killing machines. But the creators and S/EFX department have done a competent job with the Aliens look. Despite that, the movie is riddled with Western Clichés - Cowboys and Indians, bar-scenes, adopted Indian sons and the like. And You know, Harrison Ford should probably just hang it up from the action genre as hard as it is to write that. Ford in his heyday has made plenty of better movies anyway. If you're willing to let all the clichés slip by and the plot devices that were the Aliens be, you might have a good time too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two average movies mixed together = One bigger average movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cowboys and aliens" is a great idea in theory. I don't think I've ever seen any other movie set in the old west where aliens turn up (Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong) and it stars James Bond and Indiana Jones, as well as having a dream cast off character actors in there too. It should really be an ace movie. So why am I struggling too think off a reason why it isn't? Maybe its because the title pretty much tells you the whole story, leaving no room for surprises. A stranger walks into town (never mind being the man with no name, this one can't even remember his own name) and proves how tough he is, only for UFOs too come along and steal some off the town folk, leaving them looking for someone too lead the way into saving them.Daniel Craig is basically James Bond with an American accent, while Harrison Ford is a bit meaner than he is as Indiana Jones but is still wearing a hat. Everyone else is in the parts you usually see them in too, with Sam Rockwell leading the way as the funny one (Though not too funny eh?). Even the aliens are forgettable in what is a good movie in that it's a combination off things we've never seen together before I guess. Problem is its still lacking a memorable story, the action you'd expect from a western, or the horror you'd expect from an alien movie."Cowboys and aliens" is balancing just above average for at least trying too be something new, but would off probably been better sticking with one thing or the other. Probably sticking with the Cowboys would be best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the title might suggest...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I was intrigued by this one when I first heard about it almost a year ago. In recent weeks I have seen the trailer several times and this has only intensified my interest. Despite a few poor reviews from across the pond I was still determined to make my own mind up (as I do with most things) and so when it came up at my local cinema I was there. While it's neither the greatest Western ever made, nor the greatest Sci-Fi film ever made, I still found it very entertaining, exciting and just about everything you'd want to fill a damp Saturday afternoon. I will give you my thoughts after this brief summary.When a man is found in the wilderness with no knowledge of who he is or how he came to be there, it intrigued me. When this man finds a strange metal bracelet on his wrist and defends himself with great skill against a group of drifters, I was hooked. The man, who we later find out, is Jake Lonergan, rides into the local town only to find he is a wanted man. A mysterious woman, Ella Swenson, keeps asking him questions that he can't answer. A local rancher, a powerful man, Woodrow Dolarhyde, comes into town because Lonergan had had a run in with his son, Percy. Just as Lonergan is to be taken away by Marshals, there is an attack by a group of aliens in strange flying craft. Lonergan manages to bring one down using the bracelet, which appears to be some kind of weapon. Its occupant, however, escapes into the dark. During the attack several of the townsfolk are kidnapped, including Percy, and it's now up to a small band, put together by Dolarhyde, to track the alien and bring back those victims. Many secrets are revealed on the way about Lonergan's past and Ella Swenson's secret, but I cannot say more or the alien branch of the Spoiler Police will have me abducted (again).A very well made film with some excellent CGI. All of the battle scenes were outstandingly choreographed with some great stunts, hats off to those guys. Performance-wise, everyone was very good; Daniel Craig did a decent job as Jake Lonergan, although I felt the role didn't come all the naturally to him. Harrison Ford was excellent, as ever, as the crotchety Woodrow Dolarhyde. Olivia Wilde was great as the mysterious Ella Swenson and Sam Rockwell played the barkeeper Doc with his usual skill.If I have one criticism of the production, it's that a lot of the action took place in the dark, which made it difficult to see just who was fighting who (or what) half the time. It's lucky this one wasn't made in 3D or the 3D fans (who don't include me) would have had a hell of a time! The aliens were suitable scary, well designed, if I was younger they might have given me nightmares. Over all though, I found it a much more entertaining film than the title might suggest? Recommended.My score: 6.8/10.IMDb Score: 6.6/10 (based on 14,756 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 45/100 (based on 209 reviews counted when this review was written).</fullReview>

Harrison ford is also very cool in it and i enjoyed his performance. the other actors in it didn't really stand out to me in this film although some were good. the film itself is OK but not brilliant to be honest i was a bit disappointed because i love most cowboy films. this film was a bad merge i think of true grit and alien which are both very good movies. the story line didn't really grip me until the end but i still came out of the cinema thinking would i see that again i dunno i think there are better films on offer although this is one to see but not brilliant don't expect too much. i give this film a 7/10 because it does have it's good witty moments in it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>COWBOYS &amp; ALIENS (Jon Favreau, 2011) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had intended watching Terrence Malick's THE TREE OF LIFE (2011) for my birthday but its local theatrical release has been postponed by some 3 weeks, so I ended up with this unlikely Western/Sci-Fi hybrid instead! The film was inspired by a comic book, but the expected sense of awe and fun is not always communicated to the audience (especially since its two leads/heroes ? Daniel "James Bond" Craig and Harrison "Indiana Jones" Ford are depicted so dourly)!; besides, the mix-up of genres is not really thought out (despite the involvement as producers of such fanboys like Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard), and mostly it just feels like two different films slapped together to make up the required 2-hour duration! The opening is intriguing enough, with the wounded Craig waking up in the desert an amnesiac and who also has a strange bracelet attached to one wrist (which he later discovers can 'shoot' rays that prove far more deadly than your typical pistol!). When he rides into the nearest town and after being patched-up by preacher Clancy Brown, he is recognized as the leader of an outlaw gang who had abandoned (and double-crossed) his cohorts, apparently for love of a woman who has in the meantime herself disappeared without a trace! Thus, he immediately attracts the attention of sheriff Keith Carradine but also falls foul (by protecting meek bartender Sam Rockwell) of the spoilt-brat son of grizzled cattle-man and town patriarch Ford. The two, therefore, end up in prison with the kid promising his dad will make the 'newcomer' pay for what he did to him ? but Ford already has his hands full as his cattle is wiped out by what, according to the sole surviving cowhand, was a fire come out of the sky! Indeed, when he does get to town himself and is about to face Craig (after giving the trouble-maker son a piece of his mind), the town is invaded by flying saucers and a number of the townspeople are abducted in the ensuing mayhem; as expected, normal gunpowder is useless against the 'metal-ships' but Craig's bracelet, once activated, manages to bring down one of the alien craft! Incidentally, since his arrival, Craig has been bugged by a woman (Olivia Wilde) who claims she knows him and, consequently, can shed light on his current predicament ? the revelation concerning her character, which also has her taking up Native American speech so as to communicate with an Indian tribe that turns up along the way and rally them to the 'cause', is unconvincing to say the least. Anyway, it turns out that gold is a source of fuel for the aliens so that, when Craig flashes it in front of his wife, they come down on their house, literally evaporate her but, despite having torn into his flesh (hence the gash in his side), Craig manages to break free and escape (even if there is a quasi-subliminal suggestion that his 'time-out-of-mind' period was somewhat longer than we have been led to believe!).As inferred by the title, then, Cowboys face-off with Aliens before long and, in spite of the latter's obviously superior resources, the former are not about to let them have a run of the land without a fight (though they rely on Craig's gizmo to do much of the damage to the enemy!). Complicating things further is the introduction of Craig's understandably irate former mates?while Ford has to contend with the adoration of an orphaned Mexican he had raised as his own but thereafter merely kept as a general-purpose boy around the ranch ? likewise, he is entrusted with the care of Carradine's grandson after the sheriff is shanghaied to be studied by the aliens. For what it is worth, this potentially sentimental but undeniably affecting subplot emerges as the film's most unexpected yet rewarding aspect (apart, that is, from the sheer joy of watching veterans Carradine and Brown in a prominent theatrical feature in what seems like a dog's age). By the way, among the other victims are Ford's genuine flesh-and-blood and Rockwell's nagging wife, which he loves regardless and so has learned to defend himself in the interim and now tags along for the ride to save humanity from extinction.To get to the design of the extra terrestrials themselves, the film-makers have come up with nothing more original than the 'monster-within-a-monster' concept popularized by the ALIEN series but, then, these are given no personality whatsoever ? they are just there to kill and be killed ? nor is an attempt at communication ever made?which brings us to the baffling fact that not even the cowboys are made to question what is really going on, except from a simple "what the hell?!" initial reaction when they could have had but the rudimentary knowledge of the universe and just what lies beyond the Earth!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does what it says on the tin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Concept doesn't get much higher, "Cowboys and Aliens" just about covers it and leaves little to audience imagination, although a dog is also involved.In a summer brim full with remakes, prequels and sequels, it is a refreshing change to actually see a movie that is new or newish, the film is loosely based on a comic.Daniel Craig (No Name to start) wakes up in the Wild West circa 1873, looking craggy, sun-baked, wounded and confused. A large futuristic bracelet on his wrist, which he cannot remove despite repeated efforts, he swiftly deals to anyone that messes with him as he attempts to regain his memory.Stumbling into town, he encounters the usual Wild West characters.The sturdy doctor/priest (it's a small town), who graphically stitches his wounds, the local downtrodden saloon owner/doctor, (Sam Rockwell), with the improbably hot wife, a principled lawman and a weak, feckless bully (Paul Dano) the son of the feared local head honcho, Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford).Throw in the otherworldly presence emanating from "Ella" (Olivia Wilde), a cowgirl with piercing blue eyes. Add the advertised aliens, complete with grungy steam punk style spaceships and you have a curious mix indeed, think "Firefly/Serenity" with a larger budget.Craig continues to impress, intense, brutal and looking every inch like he damn well would hurt anyone getting in his laconic way, more than adept with his sturdy bracelet, when it finally throbs into life.Mixing Aliens with Cowboys is a commercial risk, recent films daring to use the western genre have not all been successful (True Grit withstanding), throw in a Alien "mashup" and what do you get? Actually, a lot more fun than some have led us to believe. Whilst undeniably not perfect, some effects are more LowFi rather than SciFi and some supporting characterizations are paper thin, Dano and Rockwell get criminally underused. Overall, perhaps the opportunity to play Cowboys and Indians with this cast was too good to pass up, even for great actors with bit parts.Quite where a budget of US $163 Million went, is more of an indictment of modern blockbuster film making than a criticism of this particular project. However, there remains plenty of entertainment up on the screen.The action and jump scares are more down and dirty than you might expect, kids with knives stabbing aliens in the heart, Alien torture chambers and characters being incinerated before your eyes, this is certainly no "Wild Wild West".It is good to see Ford back in a summer movie, he gets some good lines but the focus of the film clearly falls to Craig, who does not disappoint.Yes, there are plot holes but again, this is Cowboys and Aliens in the same film, reality expectations should wisely be left in the foyer.There is a high body count, every one is fair game, especially disposable and certificate friendly CGI Aliens who can be eviscerated at will without troubling the censors. Crucially, the dog is of course kept safe at all times.The plot is thin - loved ones get captured by Aliens, posse try to get them back and prevent even worse stuff happening. Interestingly the Saloon owner certainly seems fairly non plussed that his wife has disappeared.Good fun and any movie that dares to be at least mostly brand new with no built in audience and brand awareness, needs to be appreciated.Director John Faverau of Iron Man fame has done a fair job with workmanlike direction, whether this finds an audience and we get to see more, remains to be seen.Summary Does what it says on the tin.Indiana Jones and James Bond playing Cowboys and Indians, whilst fighting Aliens, what's not to like?

		<shortDescription>Harrison Ford....more Ford Prefect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was more of a case of Cowboys and brief incidents of excitement. What they should of done is either kept the film as a cowboy film or not bothered at all. I get the impression that the production team just made this film as test to see if they could still make a cowboy movie and they had nothing better to do.The film just didn't gel together, there were some very bad errors in the film from the stupid "scout ships" and the size of the aliens. It was rather like trying getting an elephant into a milk bottle. Also there was that cringing scene with Craig chasing a alien ship on a horse, come on lads I am sure their space ship could out run a horse. There were glimpses of Stargate (ending), Unforgiven and Aliens albeit on a comical level.Of course Craig and Ford are still a force to be reckoned with although there are lapses where Ford reverts back into "Air Force One" mode and thinks he is the president, however looking at him in this film he could easily be the next Clint Eastwood. Craig on the other hand always gives it is all although I sat there in the cinema and expected Bond to pop up at anytime but also think of the epic performance of Lee Van Cleef in For a few dollars more.They were however let down by a poor support from other actors and you could clearly tell that Craig and Ford have really been there, don't it and got the T-Shirt.Also there was no explaining of the connection with the aliens and Earth other than the mention of they needed gold. The interior of the mother ship was useless and looked like the interior of a disco and was ill conceived. If you are going to make a scary interior of space ship, leave it to Cameron.The filming and locations are superb with broad vistas of yesteryear cowboy films and the cowboys were realistic and looked as if they have really been there. If only these two would make a real cowboy film I am sure it would sell a million as you need gritty, dirty looking and actors who can pull it all off. I loved the filming technique with the slight over exposure of the film in places.In all honesty take it for what it is, a good yarn and the kids will love it along with most adults. But I do hope the film makers don't do this again, although entertaining it didn't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bad Ass Western with a Boost of Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE GOOD The special effects were excellent. Some of the crash landings and explosions were quite spectacular, and if I didn't know any better I'd say Michael Bay had a stake in this aspect of the film's conception. Regardless, I found the design of the spacecrafts to be quite unique and creative, and different from other extraterrestrial-themed films. Oddly, they didn't seem out of place. It was somehow believable to have spacecrafts in a setting where people are typically on horseback, which I think is an interesting take and a true testament to Jon Favreau's directing style.The spaceships initial arrival reminded me of War of the Worlds, but with a Western backdrop. That entire impression changed when the aliens operating those spacecrafts began appearing in hand-to-hand combat, and I realized that this was going to have more of a darker Alien vs. Predator kind of tone.On the acting front, I think Olivia Wilde really stood out. She has really come into her own and I think she has amazing star power quality. At first, her character, Ella Swenson, would appear just in the background, creeping behind the shadows away from the action, and I liked that initial mystery and allure of her character. In time, she rises like a phoenix from the ashes and settles into a major role, guiding the posse through the desert in pursuit of the demons while carrying the weight of the story on her shoulders to the very end. She is the voice of reason and logic that helps the others understand the nature and presence of the extraterrestrial beings that have caused so much turmoil in their town.The title alone implies a brand new rival, so it is safe to assume at this point that the Cowboys and the Indians have resolved their issues of the past, and the cowboys have set their sights onto bigger things. Of course, it's not a true Western unless there's a saloon and at least one bar brawl, and this film more than lives up to the cliché.THE BAD I understand that they wanted the aliens to look as menacing and threatening as possible (imagine an alien resembling the one from Mac and Me, and then picture the complete opposite of that) and you should arrive at something fairly accurate to Hollywood's current schema of what an alien looks like. They are the villains, the antagonists, the intruders, and as long as they're invading earth, they may as well be portrayed as perpetually evil and constantly snarling, just so there is no confusion as to which side the audience should root for. Based on the title, I did not expect the aliens to be so horrifying and graphic or the fighting to be so brutal. That was obviously Jon Favreau's vision, and it's not to say that it was bad. It was just unexpected, and that's what I think its drawback was for audiences.Daniel Craig pulled off the suave, calm and modest role very well, something he's well-versed with by now, given the roles that have made him famous. But he was not overly engaging, and kept the audience at bay for most of the film just as he had done at first with the characters riding alongside him. His dialogue is very limited, almost as short as Ford's temper. Ford's voice is a bit overdone and forceful, a lot like the effect the bat suit has on Christian Bale in The Dark Knight. I'm sorry but I'm convinced that his suit comes equipped with a voice box or something to darken the tone of the film and give it a Chris Nolan twist.Ford's lines are delivered in a snippy, grumpy, gruff sort of way, and at certain points, (you will recognize them when you see them) the viewer can easily make the distinction between simply reading a line versus playing a part naturally and convincingly. Then again, it's difficult to blame him for his vile temper, what with the hardships of having such a nuisance for a son. His son, Percy, was likely meant to harbour a sense of comical relief, as an irresponsible, spoiled boy who talks a big game but is nothing more than a good target for physical abuse. In that case I guess he was useful in a comical sort of way, or at least as a simple means for the other characters to relieve pent up anger.It had a decent story beyond the inevitable conflict between the cowboys and the aliens, but I don't think it was as strong as it could have been. The emotional scenes were a little weak and I did not feel entirely engrossed in them. The potential romance between Jake and Ella develops almost passively before our eyes, and for obvious reasons it does not persist.OVERALL The old adage goes, you strike while the iron is hot. Hollywood plays off of current trends, and Cowboys and Aliens, as separate genres, have always been hot and trendy subjects on which to base movies. Based on its numbers, the poor reviews and sour word-of-mouth, somehow 'Cowboys &amp; Aliens' didn't translate well on screen and failed to strike a chord with audiences. The genre is daring enough, merging science fiction with Western, and I would have thought that that in itself would have drawn teens and young adults to the theatre.As is evident by its title, this was not a conventional sci-fi thriller, which is what I liked most about it. It possessed a certain historical integrity with a boost of modern sci-fi. Favreau insisted on not implementing 3-D technology into this film to maintain that true old Western purity, and I am glad he stuck to his guns. Overall, I found it to be a fun film myself, not without its flaws, but easily enjoyable if you can accept it for what it was.I give Cowboys &amp; Aliens a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great but not that bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kind of enjoyed it. Plus points: Olivia Wilde is quite bewitching. Daniel Craig is an alright strong silent type. First of all you get a lot of different things, cowboys &amp; Indians and aliens. You don't really get bored because it's like a large spread buffet. After the recent rather serious Westerns like True Grit there isn't much more they can do with the genre without going in another direction. It's not too violent and doesn't rely too much on CGI. Jon Favreau's direction is a bit more lucid than Ironman. Minus points: Harrison Ford looks a bit stiff, getting a bit old for the genre. The alien vs human combat is a bit Starship Troopers ie a bit deja vu. There isn't enough humor. Although there is some tension in some scenes, you don't get too involved with any of the cast of characters.Overall: You get a half Western, half alien movie. Although neither is great on its own the combination keeps things from getting boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Awesome Fun Ride!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a lot better than I was expecting it to be. Mixing the Western and Sci-fi genre was a fun and smart idea. It had fantastic action, and very interesting characters. Daniel Craig stars as a mysterious man named Jake Lonergan who has no idea what happened to him or why he has a metal bracelet on his arm. After running into Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde(Harrison Ford), the town is attacked by aliens and take their kin. The survivors decide to take a stand, fight back and track the aliens down to save their loved ones, or die trying. If you want a different style of Sci-fi/Western, you'll love COWBOYS &amp; ALIENS!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was excited for Cowboys. I thought it might be fun and have an interesting story. It really doesn't. What I liked about Cowboys is that it has a decent blend of Sci-Fi and Wild West. Overall the cinematography looks good, and the movie has a nice look and feel. Also Olivia Wild, and Daniel Craig and fill their rolls very well. This is why I see a lot of great potential in Cowboys and Aliens. The script is also good to start, but loses depth further along in the film.Normally I would give a movie like this an 8 on average. The reason I gave this a 7 is because of two things. Adam Beach, and Harrison Ford. Both great actors in their own respect. They simply clashed with this film. The producers probably chose Beach because he is Indian, and his character is Indian. The problem? That doesn't mean he's great for the roll. I could get over him though. Harrison Ford just doesn't fit. He's not dark, or scary enough, and his voice has to much 70's jive in his mouth. People in the wild west, in his position were much rougher. They should have made him chew on barbed wire before each shot ;)Lastly the aliens. Come on? They just weren't scary. Does everything have to have two eyes, ears, and a nose? Creativity says otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The preacher looks the saloon-keeper in the eye and offers him friendly advice:get yourself a gun;learn how to use it. That's the Old West,put briefly. Then he teaches him. He tells him God wants him to mind his business. People are practical here,not even talk of demons lasts long. Maybe fighting evil should have been it,though,because Harrison Ford tells us manliness requires killing people who get in your way and putting people out of their misery. Love of one's own makes one as harsh as the wilderness.Cowboys,as seen in Westerns,must be paradigmatic of the human beings for the story to make sense. Bloodshed requires men;in battle,Harrison Ford charges an alien like a jousting knight. Then it emerges criminals and Indians will do,too. They all share in lawlessness and war. Our outlaw protagonist steals alien weaponry and follows his inclination to war. The woman,typically treacherous,turns out to be an alien. Apparently,the look and the being are very different. She looked beautiful,or else she would have been uninteresting,unpersuasive;but she has self-sacrifice on her mind,to save mankind. It seems that men's inability to understand the truth about her being goes with their need of her. But she is uninteresting,like a goddess in the machine.The aliens apparently want gold and experiment on human beings. They carbonize humans;and they also make them stare into a mesmerizing light that steals their minds,which helps Ford's bully of a son turn into a decent fellow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cowboys &amp; Aliens FILM DEBATE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE UGLY: So, to begin my criticism of this movie, I shall start with the aspect of the movie that confused me the most and I shall add my other complaints and such during the discussion. What the heck was with Olivia Wilde's character? Ella? I don't even remember her mentioning her name at any point. Where did she come from? (SPOILER ALERT!) Why did she martyr herself? The other aliens obviously don't have miraculous healing powers so why does she? How the heck did Daniel Craig (aka: Jake) understand and accept her origins without further explanation? It seems to me, that if the ignorant townspeople could only explain the aliens as being either demons or whatever else that he would definitely need more explaining: I did.THE PROFESSIONAL: Hard to say if this is an editing issue or a screenplay issue, but? agreed. "They destroyed my world. I came here to make sure they would never do it again." Really? How did you come to this world? And what was your plan? Do you have access to any alien technology whatsoever? Then again it could be partially a problem with the casting. Olivia Wilde definitely seems like a TV Actress in every sense ? no range. I thought she did well in Tron: Legacy but in hindsight I can't differentiate her acting from an episode of House M.D., Tron or this movie. Her lack of gravitas may have overall diminished the believability of her character.Note: This is director Jon Favreau's third consecutive film where a protagonist shoots energy blasts at bad guys from a high-tech weapon attached to his arm? THE FUGITIVE: I missed the very beginning of the movie, but started watching with Daniel Craig walking into town. I thought it was good from here up to the first alien attack; it was like a classic western suddenly interrupted by our modern day supernatural; the alien. The aliens sure made a good entrance. I agree, Olivia Wilde was pretty boring and the movie did start galloping down hill when she used her alien magic to come out of the fire. This is also where the movie became Cowboys, Indians, and Aliens. Daniel Craig even gets a mystical spirit-animal hummingbird to help him out. Perhaps the hummingbird is really an alien! It was a trick! I did enjoy the cranky Harrison Ford, however. "I didn't kill my wife!" ?I don't care? ..... CONTINUED AT FILMDEBATE.WORDPRESS.COM .....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Cowboys &amp; Aliens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what was the point about making Cowboys &amp; Aliens besides the potential of raking in millions from the box office thanks to a mash up of the Western and Alien Invasion genres? Hardly anything other than to showcase some nifty special effects (though not groundbreaking in any fashion), and having director Jon Favreau show that he has more up his sleeves than Iron Man in making a big budgeted, B-graded summer popcorn entertainer. Other than that don't come to expect a lot from the plot which was pretty straight forward stuff, boosted by its ensemble cast who add plenty of star presence.Many would be pumped by the combination of Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, both charismatic action men in their own right, each having a franchise, or franchises in Ford's case, under their belts. Putting them together in collaborative fashion seemed to make perfect sense, and many out there can fantasize about James Bond meeting Indiana Jones/Han Solo, but that's about it - it stays as fantasy as the two don't do too much when they get on screen together. Craig plays Jake Lonergan, a mysterious alpha-gunslinger who is blessed by the inability to get injured by adversary no matter what they throw at him, though for the most parts of the film he spent walking around without a firm identity, adding a simple mystery to the film as to his background, like a Western Jason Bourne.Ford plays Woodrow Dolarhyde, an ex-Colonel turned rancher who owns the town, with a good for nothing son Percy (Paul Dano) who soon gets abducted, along with many others in town, when strange spaceships descend upon them, bombing everything in sight and abducting in classic alien movies, humans for various experiment. So the story's pretty much about a rag tag team being assembled together, which included Sam Rockwell as a peace loving bartender, Adam Beach as Woodrow's servant whose character adds much needed gravitas and drama to the film in addition to being the translator with the Native Americans, and Olivia Wilde as Ella Swenson, a gunslinger herself who is more than meets the eye. To a certain degree having watched the film from start to end, the narrative ran pretty close to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, which dealt with a reluctant Indy having to rescue the village folks' children who are taken into slavery. Replace children with townsfolk of all ages and aliens with the voodoo worshippers, and you have Cowboys &amp; Aliens, written by so many writers adding their two cents worth to the story, it's pretty amazing how everything turned out making some sense, despite its average plot riddled with loopholes and clichés, with the most glaring happening in the final third of the film where characters can locate each other in a labyrinth with convenient ease.For instance, some of the stuff that got to me was a gaping absence in the treatment of the alien fleet attacking the cowboys on horseback, which you get a glimpse of in the trailer, cleanly forgotten when the plot decides to track Jake and Ella in their two on one tussle with an alien combatant. Or how about the inconsistent numbers that make up the human warriors, with 30 thieving gangsters and a group of Native Americans falling in a massive assault, only for their numbers to stay rather consistent by the time the movie's done. If there's some alien ability here to respawn their adversary, tell me about it, otherwise this reeks of lazy continuity gaps, or with scripts being revised constantly, or editing room manipulation, everything got cobbled together haphazardly just to hope for the best from the messy end product.But on the whole, as an action adventure trying to combine elements from two genres together, Cowboys &amp; Aliens did the job it set out to do, so don't expect too much from it other than being yet another loud action blockbuster that you can't milk anything of value from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Afternoon and $13 well-enough spent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading some of the reviews here I wonder what movie the reviewers saw. I had no high expectations, although I like Jon Favreau's work and both Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford have pleased me before. Oh, and I love Westerns and like Sci-Fi.While in retrospect -- and after reading some of the reviews -- I can see plot holes that didn't appear during the movie -- there were things that didn't entirely make sense I had no problem staying with the flow and as things were revealed understood what was happening. But I was in the moment from the first shot of Craig, waking up in the desert -- often sited as Arizona but actually New Mexico -- through his encounter with the scalp-hunters,his rather distracted manner -- he doesn't know who he is or where he came from, which would probably distract any of us -- and all the way through to the end. Favreau obviously gets westerns and quotes brief snippets from several, including "The Searchers." The costuming was good enough that it didn't take me out of the moment and the guns were period correct, which often can ruin a movie for me. Ella (Olivia Wilde) wasn't corseted, but she turns out to be an alien who has taken human form, so she can be excused.The aliens were mindless battle-beasts and I suspect that there might have been a higher intelligence somewhere on that ship. They were a bit derivative of earlier movie aliens, but just different enough to serve the purpose.I liked the journey of discovery Lonergan (Craig) takes, learning bits of his history as he goes along. Dolarhyde (Ford), too, has some redemptive moments, and both of them at the end, in typical western fashion, are different men that when they started.I enjoyed my afternoon. My wife enjoyed her afternoon. And, we both liked seeing the familiar New Mexico sky and mountains and the ever-present dust. The look of the film -- night scenes were dark, muddy and believable and you saw anything you needed to see -- was excellent. People looked as if they actually populated a desert town in the Southwest.So I don't know what the nay-sayers were watching. It didn't sound like the film we watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supporting Players Are Better Than the Leads!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not the best film. It was different. But still, it was a Western that had a sci-fi tone or vice versa.With a cowboy named Jake who is gotten a thing around his arm, that helps him fight off people that get in his way. And with no memory of his own. He later learns he is a criminal wanted by authorities. Plus, he remembers a woman from his own past.Ford's character a former Civil War Colonel, owns the town where Jake comes in as a stranger. As the town doesn't like strangers. Both of these men don't like one another. But are forced to work with one another. As aliens come to their town and abduct their loved ones. And have to fight those aliens. Plus, Jake wants to know who he is and why he has the thing around his arm.IMHO, the supporting characters are the ones that carried the film. And people like character actors Clancy Brown, Sam Rockwell, Adam Beach, and young child actor Noah Ringer should have had bigger roles. As they had the best lines.Harrison Ford is the new second banana hence "Extraordinary Measures" and "Morning Glory!" As despite his star power, he is still a good actor but is getting up there in age. And can't carry the lead role. His character is a bit of a jerk. But he means well as one character says. Along with being the grump in the film like those two other films.Daniel Craig is really a good actor. Despite not getting the credit where credit is due. And stands out despite not having a lot of lines. Despite him being brooding and the silent type. Once his character develops, you begin to like him and feel for him.Olivia Wilde who will leave "House" very shortly. As she has a blossoming movie career. Really doesn't have much as she is just there as eye candy. And the producers and directors don't give her a lot to say.Again the lead actors are the weak link in the film. As it is the supporting players that are the ones. That I really liked and really thought were the likable characters in the film.Different kind of movie though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>COWBOYS &amp; ALIENS (2011) *** Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Olivia Wilde, San Rockwell, Paul Dano, Adam Beach, Clancy Brown, Walton Goggins, Noah Ringer. Cosmic oater set in the American Old West circa 1873 Arizona, where an amnesiac cowboy (Craig exuding a McQueenian stoic vibe) awakens in the desert of a dying town when aliens invade, kidnapping its citizenry, forcing him to regain his memory in the process of a rescue posse with a motley crusading group including an ex Civil War colonel/cattle rancher (Ford at his gruff best) and a mysterious beauty (the beguiling Wilde). Director Jon Favreau mixes all the popcorn crowd guilty pleasure with his comic book adaptation of Scott Mitchell Rosenberg's graphic novel in spite of six scribes involvement, the film comes on like gangbusters and is an enjoyable B-movie with A production thanks to the cool visuals and particularly Matthew Libatique's sweet cinematography. And the geeky pleasure of seeing James Bond &amp; Indiana Jones kicking alien ass!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you like Westerns? Do you like Science fiction? How about good acting? This movie takes a chance and succeeds. One line in the movie: "Good people do bad things, Bad people can do good things." This movie is about redemption, hard times, and people coming together against a common enemy. Is it great? No, but if you are looking for an adult version of Super 8, or a classic western with a bit of science fiction, and you enjoy being entertained, this is well worth seeing.This is one of the better movies to come out in 2011, and most of the year has produced horrible movies. Harrison Ford &amp; Daniel Craig elevate the movie and make their characters believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure escapism that could have been more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Depending on whom you asked, the premise of Jon Favreau's latest summer tentpole movie sounded either brilliant or ridiculous: cowboys band together to fight invading aliens. The title pretty much said it all. Regardless, it was a nifty idea to capitalize on the latest out-of-nowhere geek fascination with cowboys and aliens (which is topped only by the ongoing pirates-v.-ninjas debate), and, especially coming from the director of Iron Man, it seemed all but guaranteed to work, at least in terms of box office. If nothing else, it was going to be fun, a high-budget Syfy original. The real question was whether it would transcend its gimmick and prove that high-concept genre mash-ups could be legitimately thoughtful and fresh or become just another example of the disposable escapism that currently dominates the summer movie season. It starts out promising. Like the ubiquitous trailer, the movie opens with our unidentified hero waking up in the middle of a desert, a mysterious device strapped to his wrist. He is confronted by a band of suspicious cowboys, all of whom he takes out with Jason Bourne-like ease, and he silently rides away on a horse taken from one of his unconscious foes. This exchange, set to a beautifully atmospheric score by Harry Gregson-Williams, demonstrates the taut simplicity that embodies Cowboys and Aliens at its most engrossing because, as pretentious as it may sound, the movie is best when nothing much is going on. On the surface, Favreau and his screenwriters, a group that includes Alex Kurtzman and Robert Orci, who somehow managed to pen both the 2009 Star Trek reboot and Michael Bay's Transformers movies, seem to understand the key elements of a Western. The locale is suitably barren and dusty, the dialogue is blunt and to-the-point, and the pacing is brisk. The characters never quite rise above traditional archetypes (the man-of-few-words, the mysterious dame, the determined lawman), but they're likable and interesting enough that we feel invested in their fates. Some viewers may be surprised by the lack of humor, but for me, this was the right approach. How could we take the movie seriously if it didn't take itself seriously?Unfortunately, that is the high point. Once the aliens arrive, kicking off the main plot, the movie forgets what made it charming in the first place. Sure, it's entertaining, and the action sequences, while still on the unremarkable side, are infinitely superior to those in the Iron Man movies, but when the credits roll and the adrenaline wears off, it's obvious that something is missing. It took a while for me to determine what exactly that something was, yet writing this review, it's becoming more and more apparent: in the end, why should the audience care? Although some may argue that Favreau accomplished what he set out to do, which was to provide a fun way to consume a couple hours, Cowboys and Aliens had the potential to be so much more than that, and something tells me that the film-makers had more in mind than diverting fluff. In interviews, Favreau has insisted that one reason, if not the reason, for making Cowboys and Aliens is a desire to revive the western, a once-beloved genre that now struggles to stay relevant. It's certainly an admirable goal, but I can't say their efforts pay off. While all the tropes are there, from the prostitute with a heart of gold to the minor plot line involving settler-Indian relations, the movie ignores one crucial fact: westerns aren't about gunfights or gold; they're about people searching for meaning and order in a chaotic, unforgiving landscape. At first, Cowboys and Aliens seems to acknowledge this, but after the science-fiction aspect takes over, the characters and the conflicts presented at the beginning are pushed aside in favor of a mediocre monster story, and the tension dissipates. The instant the cowboys unite to fight the aliens, apparently ignoring their personal rivalries and grudges, all signs of internal struggle and moral ambiguity vanish. The best westerns are defined by engaging, often unpredictable characters and their interactions as well as the sizzling chemistry between the actors who portray them. If Cowboys and Aliens possessed either, it's not evident by the end of the first hour. The casting of both Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, James Bond and Indiana Jones, respectively, promised hostile confrontations and scenery-chewing, but they share so little screen-time that you don't even remember that they're supposed to be bonding with each other until the very last scene. For what it's worth, Daniel Craig is the only member of the cast that stands out. I'll admit that I'm not a fan of his James Bond ? or any James Bond, for that matter ? but he is enthralling as the brooding Jake Lonergan, lending his rather dispassionate character a discreet yet touching vulnerability, and his screen presence is formidable. Otherwise, the actors are merely solid. Harrison Ford doesn't have much to do besides scowl and grumble, and Sam Rockwell (who was, by the way, easily the best thing about Iron Man 2) is woefully underused (again) as the mild-mannered doctor. The main rough spot is Olivia Wilde. Despite, or perhaps because of, her exotic beauty, she is never credible as a tough, enigmatic rebel out for revenge; even though the movie takes place in the wild west, it's hard to believe she could hold her own against her more rugged male counterparts. From the beginning, it's obvious who's going to win, and maybe that's part of the problem. Without any compelling character-based conflicts, the stakes feel almost nonexistent. The lives of loved ones hang in the balance, yet for some reason, the aliens come off more as nuisances than legitimate threats; not once can I recall wondering whether our protagonists will survive. Ultimately, as the anticlimactic finale dwindles into an unrewarding conclusion, you're left wondering what the point was. Yeah, the ride was pretty fun, but really, so what?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining combination of genres</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a title like Cowboys &amp; Aliens, you might assume no basic plot summary is needed. And to a point you are correct. The recent release from director Jon Favreau and producers Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard is indeed about cowboys and aliens. Some have compared the title to the overly simplistic, matter of fact title of Snakes on a Plane, but in that case it was announcing itself as a farce, here I don't quite get that same vibe. Nonetheless, Cowboys &amp; Aliens does deliver on its title, but along the way provides a decent merging of the two disparate subjects, albeit the film feels a little more cowboys than aliens most of the time.Opening in the old west, we are treated to a lone man awakening in the desert (Daniel Craig), who, after putting down some individuals who stumble upon him with less than noble intentions for the stranger, he confiscates a horse and makes his way to Absolution, a desert mining town that doesn't appear to have produced much gold. The stranger lacks memory and an understanding of why he has a strange metal bracelet on his wrist. After an altercation with Percy Dolarhyde(Paul Dano), the son of a powerful local cattle rancher, the local sheriff (Keith Carridine) intercedes, and he recognizes the stranger as the wanted stagecoach robber Jake Lonergan. As Longergan and the son are about to be shuffled off by stagecoach, the father, Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) arrives demanding the release of his son and wants Lonergan also for personal reasons. However, at that moment, the aliens of the title make an appearance, and capture a number of the townsfolk, after which Longergan, Dolarhyde and others decide to follow to get their loved ones back, and Lonergan hopes to find his memories. They are accompanied on their trip by a loner named Ella (Olivia Wilde) who shows a great deal of interest in Lonergan's missing past.For a great deal of its early running time, Cowboys &amp; Aliens has the appearance of a fairly standard, full bore western. We are introduced to a strong, silent loner in the visage of Craig, there is a brawl at the saloon, and it is discovered that the local town cow-tows to Dolarhyde, a man who isn't the nicest of people and wields his influence to get things to go his way. And, actually, once the aliens first appear in the picture in the guise of spaceships swooping out of the sky and capturing various individuals, it still isn't too different from a scene from most any other western, just replacing Indians or bandits with extraterrestrials. It isn't until later that the path from a typical western deviates a bit more, but with generally entertaining results.Despite the fact that the film is working within the confines of its standard genres, albeit a bit mashed up, Cowboys &amp; Aliens proves a fairly effective combination. There is a sense of mystery to the proceedings, and when the action scenes kick in, they are engaging, and the film doesn't completely skimp on fleshing out its characters. It is somewhat notable that both of the leads are not the nicest of people: Lonergan is robber and Dolarhyde is mean and off-putting at first. Still, both characters are allowed some room to grown and thanks to the actors inhabiting the parts, we begin to feel for them towards the end. Craig fills out the Clint Eastwood-esque role appropriately, making Lonergan stoic, but with a bit more humanity showing through than in other roles of this type. Ford makes Dolarhyde a hard case and isn't afraid to turn off the charm that made him a movie star with this part. Olivia Wilde, with her gorgeous angular face, provides just the right degree of unusual to Ella, which serves the character well.Favreau, and especially his cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, have certainly made a film that looks good, shot largely in windswept exteriors for much of its running time that actually manages to not get caught up in the grimy, downbeat appearance of the modern western. And when the titular aliens do make an appearance, while they are not revolutionary, there is a degree of menace to them.Cowboys &amp; Aliens is certainly not pushing any boundaries of creativity here. The film sticks to the traditions of its inherited genres but that doesn't mean familiar can't also equal entertaining. For the most part, Cowboys and Aliens delivers a decent action film that proves more than diverting. Saddle up the horses and ride on down to the multiplex for good time at the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this from a bin of cheap DVDs in my local supermarket, intrigued by the title. The fact that Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford were in it also prompted me to take a risk: after all, cheap DVDs are often so for a reason.I must say, I was very pleasantly surprised. I wondered if cowboy and "alien" sci-fi genres would mix very well, and I think in this film they in fact do so. There's intrigue in the story right from the start, when Graig's character wakes up in the desert with a strange device clamped round his wrist, and the pace with which the story unfolds from there is just about right. There's a certain amount of hokum, but not much, and certainly not enough to distract or detract.The production values are very high and the special effects very convincing: not least because, as the special features make clear, they aren't all CGI. Some of the scenes where alien craft fly overhead and yank people on cords up into the sky were done with models going at 70 mph along high wires, and some of the actors did their own stunts, including Olivia Wilde, who is apparently an accomplished horsewoman.The test for me is whether I get absorbed and am able to suspend belief. This film did the trick for me, and I'm sure I'll be watching it again. This time, the bargain bin really did produce a bargain. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi films with decent plot, acting, and effects. 9/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Common sense is not welcome in a movie called "Cowboys &amp; Aliens". No other non-sequel title in 2011 has given a more tempting wink to the Summer Movie Audience. It presents a preposterous yet enticing idea that feels destined to be a silly, dumb, fun action-comedy. Led by "Ironman" director Jon Favreau, and guided by familiar names like Ron Howard and Steven Spielberg, we feel confidence in its production.We tone our brains down in eager wait, only to be left wondering in the end why a concept ready for fun was treated with a large and unnecessary amount of seriousness. It forces upon itself a certain level of depth, which the movie has no time for. The attempts at a heavier story prolong "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" to a running time of 118 minutes, where much of it is composed of overlong explanations and faulty, predictable drama. The bossy jerk learns to cooperate, the useless son learns to practice obedience, and the angry rebel learns to smile. Haven't we seen all of these before? Do they really have a place in a movie called "Cowboys &amp; Aliens"?The film opens with a wanted criminal, Jake Londergan, waking in the dry desert. Besides the fact that he's suffering from memory loss, Jake is battered, bleeding, and without shoes. (Jake is having a bad day.) On his left arm, is an alien bracelet precisely made to blow stuff up, like the Predator's! How did he come into possession of such an item? Did he trade his shoes for it?Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/cowboys-and-aliens-movie- review-2/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Sci-fi Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite a title that suggests a very bad comedy, Cowboys and Aliens is actually a very entertaining action film that stays surprisingly true to the classic Western genre. Yes, the plot does require a pretty generous leap of faith to accept, even in terms of movies, but think about it?is the basic concept really any more far-fetched than Independence Day or War of the Worlds? But still, the story does sound a bit bizarre at first blush. Daniel Craig plays a man who wakes up in the Arizona desert with no memory of who he is or how he got there. A strange metal bracelet is fastened on his wrist, one that doesn't look like anything fashioned by mortal man and won't come off. Looking for answers, Craig's character rides into the nearest town, one where Woodrow Dollarhyde (Harrison Ford) lords it over the townsfolk with his money and fearsome reputation. But there's also a strange, alluring woman named Ella, a woman who knows something bad is coming, and who may hold the key to the benighted cowboy's past.And something bad is coming?strange flying things from the sky, things that have weapons no Earthman has ever seen before, things that grab people from the town's streets and take them up into their depths. What are these strange invaders? Are they demons? Beings from another world? And how can they be defeated? Somehow, Craig's mysterious cowboy holds the key.It's an original take on a couple of old Hollywood standby's?the Alien Invasion flick and the classic Western. Amazingly, the two polar opposites come together quite well. The Western setting is gritty and unforgiving, while Craig and Ford play their characters with a sincerity that makes suspension of disbelief a little easier. Olivia Wilde is her usual gorgeous self, and her character remains full of surprises all movie long. The alien invaders themselves are extremely vicious and rather imposing creatures, the perfect movie villains. Special effects are outstanding, and the action nearly nonstop.Director Jon Favreau fashions a fantastic but not altogether unbelievable tale out of it all, and even if the combo of sci-fi and gunslinger shouldn't work, it does. Don't let the concept scare you off?unlikely as it seems, Cowboys and Aliens is a marvelously entertaining flick that's guaranteed to be unlike anything else you've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable but rather long film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- 2011, An old West stranger stumbles into the desert town of Absolution with no memory of his past or identity and a futuristic shackle around his wrist. With the help of a mysterious women and a iron-fisted cattle boss, Colonel Dolarhyde, the stranger finds himself leading an unlikely posse of cowboys, outlaws, and Apache warriors against a common enemy from outer space bend on taking over an area of the early Western USA.*Special Stars- Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, Keith Caradine, Clancy Brown, Adam Taylor *Theme- In the Olde West, community involvement and neighbors is the saving grace of all.*Trivia/location/goofs- Filmed in the high desert New Mexico, USA. A film 'plot hole' is how and why the beautiful women mysterious alien constantly follows the 'stranger' (D. Craig) through this film and in the early flashback sequences. Watch for many enjoyable and very capable supporting character actors in the town's people, cowboys, outlaws and Apache roles.*Emotion- An enjoyable but rather long film. Incessantly long scenic establishing shots make this film slow plodding and hard to sit through. The film was an interesting plot line to combine the alien abduction matters in a western. It was enjoyable to see Harrison Ford team up with Daniel Craig.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i think the idea of this movie is much better than the movie it self... i mean the idea seemed to be original; well... not totally anyway i mean the idea of cowboys &amp; guns Vs. Aliens &amp; laser beams &amp; hoover crafts is pretty much appealing but when you sit down and watch the movie you cant help it feeling that there is something missing! the glitch that makes a movie "big hit" or "big block buster" is just not there... first of all the movie has not dialog (ghee the script must have been really short for this one) nothing that anyone could remember anyway, also the movie comes just to knock one the same door that others used in there films; i mean Aliens abducting humans to experiment on there bodies... give me a break will you ? and the aliens there is nothing interesting nor original about them in the first place and i could not hep it feeling that Danial Craig whom i love by the way did not match Olivia not that i don't like her and all but she did not fit nicely in the role... also the movie started pretty well but did not manage to finish it as well as it started; meaning the big finally was not so big as we expected i think this movie could have been much better if it had some humor on Wild wild west style or more "mysterious" factors and as i always say: one kiss in the movie only!!! come one ....Muhannad Kaaji</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cowboys and Aliens takes itself way too seriously for a movie entitled Cowboys and Aliens. Thats even more surprising when taking into account that this is a Jon Favreau movie. Unfortunately he brings very little merit to the project. What should have been a light breezy early summer blockbuster instead feels broody, lumbering and overlong.It doesn't help that nobody in the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves. Daniel Craig is no cowboy and his accent is very challenged. Olivia Wilde has no business being in this movie; and not surprisingly, she looks way too clean for the wild west. Paul Dano meanwhile can't decide what he's doing. Harrison Ford is the only memorable performance in Cowboys and Aliens. He has reached an age, where he can convey a little bit of John Huston robustness, when he so desires.As an action movie, Cowboys and Aliens is not incompetent. Its coherent, it's just not that interesting. The battle scenes are spread out across a very confused plot line with an overlong middle section where nothing happens. It's a shame that none of the characters ever become enjoyable company given the amount of time we have to spend with them. Cowboys and Aliens leaves you with a flat feeling, and I can't think of any reason to recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Twist on the Alien Invasion Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can almost see the smile on the face of whomever had the idea for this story as they shared the idea for the first time. It does sound a little ridiculous, but I actually like the concept. So many movies are really just the same thing with different actors: humans battle invading alien forces. I like thinking outside the box: what if the aliens invaded back in the 1800's? It's really interesting to think about how people of that time would view them &amp; try to fight them. The story didn't exactly go like I thought it would but that was good, it wasn't totally predictable. There a few things I would have done differently, for example, have the cowboys &amp; Indians beat the aliens based on their own strategies &amp; methods rather than using the alien's own technology against them (that way there is good reason for the setting). All in all the movie was entertaining &amp; not just another alien invasion movie.</fullReview>

Daniel Craig plays the kick-ass cowboy that everyone wants to be, the rowdy, tough, bad-ass that doesn't take no for an answer. All in all, the movie has it all, gunfights, saloons, and half naked woman. It's a must see if your a big desperado and sci- fi fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great (especially compared to Super 8)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike Super 8 (which I was very, VERY disappointed with), this was a real alien movie. It's completely different as far as overall plot and feel of the film, but since they both have aliens, I'm drawing the comparison. It's no District 9, if that's what you're looking for. If you're looking great Action, campy Wester, Sci-Fi, or a mix of all of them then you're watching the right movie. The name says it all. Good acting, but again, GREAT ACTION! For what it was trying to be, it exceeded expectations. Daniel Craig does not disappoint and Olivia Wilde was cast well for her part. I don't normally write reviews, but seeing of the less than generous reviews on here, I felt very compelled. I feel that the other people writing reviews watch every movie and look for Oscar worthy content. That is no way to enjoy the movies and this film is the best example of that. I watched this film because I love alien movies and knew there was going to be a ton of action (which there was). Also there was a twist or two thrown in for some errs and awws. I stand by my original rating of 9/10. Again, Jon F. did not set out to get an Oscar nod, he set out to make a great Sci-Fi Action Adventure. This is what this movie is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You, you're going with us. You're gonna use that weapon - it's the only thing that counts. I figure you owe me." Jake Lonergan (Craig) does not know who or where he is. He is also confused by the strange item attached to his wrist. After fighting his way to the town of Absolution he meets the local cattle baron Col. Woodrow Dolarhyde (Ford) who does not like Jake and wants him out. When a machine nobody has seen before attacks the town and the strange thing on Jake's wrist stops it they all realize that Jake is the only hope. I will begin by saying that this is not what I expected. I thought this was going to end up being a sci-fy comedy or a comic book type movie. This was actually a serious western with aliens thrown in, and I really liked it. This is one of the few big budget movies that I have seen that is made better by the casting. Harrison Ford pretty much makes any movie he is in better anyway though. I do have to say that the hype this movie received was too much and had a hard time living up to it, but it did come close. If you are looking for a light-hearted type movie this is not it. This did have a couple slow parts in it but overall this was very entertaining. It may sound strange but this is one of the best westerns to come out since "Open Range". Overall, a very good western with a sci-fi twist. I give it a B+.</fullReview>

That alone puts this well above many others that touch sci-fi. Western and sci-fi do not mix, Wild Wild West made that painfully clear. Cowboys and aliens is actually a pretty serious movie.

		<shortDescription>Summer hit that destroys cinema heritage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a western genre fan, I found this title very controversial and unlikely to watch at all. With such a high production involvement with 4 major production companies as well other well known it is very expensive project, and with also so many involvements in making the script. Well known director and list of famous actors simply put you on state to at least watch it.With the start of the movie, it was obvious that it was made in traditional western genre, and for that I am pleased, but still I can't manage to accept Sci Fi mixed with it. No matter how good is made or how good script is. The script is good, but nothing new or original as from the few sequences from the start you realize how it will end.I must admit that movie is made very well and probably had an intention to be a one summer hit.I did not see it in complete, but as much I saw, the CG were very good, acting were not such great from main actors, but overall as a blockbuster movie I think it hit the spot.No matter how good everything looks I just can't accept it, probably because it enters very sensitive area, and it is classic American cinema genre which simply can't be mixed with something like Sci-Fi.Maybe for someone it is an open eyer or something amazing, but not for me. I am maybe to controversial myself, but I like it that way.</fullReview>

He is a bland actor, the way he looks so casual and smug after beating up a bunch of cowboy's in the first scene just proves he is not suitable to be serving anyone but MI6. Wilde gets reincarnated and saves the day, turning out to be an alien fighting aliens? As the plot unwraps so does your frail interest, first time round pretty good but why bother watch it again when the whole movie leads to one big concluding ending? I am someone who believes tat good movies can be watched multiple times but this, all the questions are answered and i see no need to buy the film when leaving the cinema with not one in my mind.Ford's performance is somewhat of a comfort to most of the underdeveloped actors but it's nothing remarkable.If you haven't seen it, i don't say not to just don't expect a sequel or to feel like the conclusion left some questions lingering in the back of your brain.

		<shortDescription>Should've been called Indians &amp; Aliens. Where were the Cowboys?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, seriously where are they? There are more Indians or Native Americans in this movie than cowboys. The only cowboy I saw was Harrison Ford. All the other non-alien characters in this movie are just wearing western clothing but act like a modern American. Where's the western accent? Not that it would've improved the movie but I'm making a point that the selling point did not work. This is not a western.The opening was one of the greatest openings I've seen in a movie. It's right there with 'Predators' and 'The Half Blood Prince' in terms of movie openings. It begins with a lot of energy as we're quickly introduced to the main character who wakes up in the middle of nowhere. Perfect. Some bad guys appear with guns and Daniel Craig doesn't hesitate to kick some butt. Sadly this is one of the few good things about this movie.The biggest problem are the characters. I'm fine with Daniel Craig. I'm one of the few people I know to like his performance in the 007 movies. But why is he still playing James Bond in this movie? What's Olivia Wilde doing here, she just stood around in the background. Wilde can be confused with other women in this movie at various times. Where are the characters? I see one: Harrison Ford. He's the only one actively pursuing something. There are no explanations whatsoever in this movie. It's almost as bad as 'Vanishing on the 7th Street' in terms of explaining plot threads. Why are some characters able to save themselves from death and others not? Why can't they do it the second time? And the amnesia Daniel Craig is suffering from is so plot convenient! The memories can come back any time the plot needs it to.This movie reminded me so much of 'Terminator Salvation'. Some action scenes in fact are very similar. These scenes are great eye candy and they present good special effects. But there are lots of things going on but we're not entertained.To break it down, here are the things I liked about this movie. I liked Harrison Ford and Sam Rockwell. I liked the aliens and their technology. I liked the opening and the concept of this movie.It seems like the movie was just made for the sake of its creative concept. Nothing is really developed here. I haven't seen the source material but I've heard it's nothing like the movie and in fact that the movie was better.This is not a terrible movie but I didn't leave the theater satisfied. This should've been the 'Predators' of this year, a fun action flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cowboys and Aliens begins as a msytery. It begins with Daniel Craig and a violent scene before moving to a small village. Until the villages are snatched the movie plays along quite nicely and remains full of promise. As the rag tag bunch of villagers engage in a quest to free their captured loved ones the appeal of this film sadly withers and dies.It's too long, it's slow and it doesn't do very much. Mystery is added by only glimpsing the aliens for a good proportion of the movie. There is a distinct lack of characterisation for all but Harrison Ford's character and that character's son.The coolest moment in the entire movie is when Olivia Wilde's character springs to life from burning flame. it's not that much of a shock when you see it either - it just looks really cool.All and all the movie is pleasant enough but unable to maintain a heightened interest for long.</fullReview>

They're given almost zero space to show their acting talents, especially Harrison Ford, who only talks like ten times. And then there's the ridiculous plot, which isn't really a plot at all, more like a mash-up of Alien and The Good, The Bad And The Ugly. Not that those aren't good films, they just don't fit together. Conclusion: Don't waste your time and money on this film.

		<fullReview>Daniel Craig wakes up in the desert with no memories, and is soon found by fellow resident badass, an aging Harrison Ford(who's still got it... if not as much as Tommy Lee Jones in Captain America), a former officer who has issues with him. That will have to wait, however, as the area is attacked by extra-terrestrials who abduct(using decidedly low-tech methods, considering they've mastered interstellar travel - grappling hooks. I'm not kidding. They also don't go after any cattle, they just... blow it up) characters chosen by a pathos-meter(that is a tad off, because as it turns out, we don't care that much), and an unlikely band of people, including the aforementioned two, have to go look for them. Not Quite Salma Hayek, the wife of Sam Rockwell, the local bartender who gets no respect(insert Rodney Dangerfield joke here), the sheriff who lives with his grandson, Indiana Jones' son(no, not Shia... although Paul Dano plays the role as an equally big jackass), etc. This employs remarkably good casting, such as Clancy Brown as the small town's preacher and the already mentioned great actors(and on that note, everyone does nice work). The mix of genres is an odd one, but it does come out surprisingly well. It feels more like a classic Western(complete with atmosphere, relaxed pace and dialog befitting it) than an alien invasion flick, though it does contain, and do well on, both. The creatures are well-designed, as are their craft and the like. This doesn't go as wild with the core concept as it could(and should), if it can be really fun and exciting(not entirely as much as it should, for what it contains). It takes itself too seriously, and it doen't balance being a part parody(in spite of all the clichés it, clearly intentionally, fits in) and part straightforward movie as well as Scream does. The FX are marvelous. I recommend this to fans of sci-fi adventures. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Cowboys &amp; Aliens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally my prayers to the Hollywood top dogs for a bit of originality have been answered in the form of Cowboys &amp; Aliens, a sci-fi thriller (which puts me in even more of an optimistic mood due to it being one of my preferred genres of choice). Yes it is based on a graphic novel and yes technology in the wild west has been implemented before but this isn't a sequel/prequel and as a concept is very fresh.Daniel Craig plays Jake, a cowboy who wakes up in the middle of nowhere with no recollection of who he is, where he has been or how he got there. In fact the only clue given to him is a strange metallic bracelet that he is unable to remove from his arm. After making his way to the nearest town he soon makes himself known to the locals and is identified as a dangerous and wanted man guilty of several crimes including stealing gold from local rancher Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). After being arrested and readied for transport, alien spaceships appear out of nowhere and start snatching people away and blowing up the surrounding countryside. Jake's bracelet transforms itself into a weapon and he is able to drive the aliens away.Now forced to work together to save the people who were kidnapped from them, Jake and Woodrow team up with the other remaining survivors from the town and set off to find out how to put a stop to their common enemy.The greatest emotion I felt while watching this was one of indifference, mainly directed towards the plot and structure of the movie. Favreau couldn't be more obvious with his intentions for the film as hinted at by the title. Cowboys &amp; Aliens merges the two separate worlds of the wild west with gun-slingers, bandits and Indians with the technologically advanced alien species resulting in no more than a series of confrontations between the two which climaxes in, well, a final confrontation between the two. Where is the interest for the audience with this concept that can only be taken so far?The story never developed and just had the characters running around with horses doing cowboy things leaving them to remain as two dimensional as the drawings they once were. This is despite the best efforts of Ford and Craig to draw me in. The most impressive part being that as well known for other characters (Jones and Bond) as they are, the two are still able to make you forget this fact and make the characters their own, even when Ford dons a Indiana-esque cowboy hat.This is a perfect example of the money men of big studios backing the concept rather than the actual story. I'm sure like most of you initially this film sounds like a movie with promise but come the end I didn't feel as though I had been taken on an adventure more rather led from scene to scene as a means to an end. In addition, the CGI could have been better when considering the other films that have already been released this year and the budget that Cowboys &amp; Aliens had to play with but instead they also fail to impress.I can't emphasise how disappointed I was with this. Given the plethora of talent in the writing department (Orci, Kurtzman, Lindelof etc. think Star Trek, Iron Man, Children of Men, Lost (TV)) for this movie it came up well short of what it should have. Turns out originality may not have been what I was looking for after all! Rating: C-For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you go to the cinema with little or no expectations (other than what's been set by the trailer which actually promised at least a fun movie) and you still end up disappointed, it's not a good sign.The movie's actually a typical blockbuster in that that it risks nothing with the script, the characters or the concept development even and thus you feel like watching the same typical alien invasion action movie albeit with unexciting action scenes and in a bit of a different setting - very bland, very predictable and VERY boring. I couldn't care less about what happens in the movie, who dies or not or what will happen in the end, I just wanted it to end.Instead of actually taking a new concept and developing it, this was taking the "Independence Day" concept and adapting it to a traditional Hollywood Wild West setting (not that "Wild" at all). So the idea is wasted. Since the characters are trite and shallow, I'd call the cast a waste, too (especially Sam Rockwell), but it's not a great cast to begin with. Ultimately, it's a waste of money as I guess you could make several decent movies with this budget, but I fear the producers will profit from it and be encouraged for more of such "entertaining" products.3/10 (I'd give it less, but I feel bad for Harisson Ford who doesn't put a decent performance, but is likable anyway).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw film today and thought it very good!With all the good films coming out this summer this is one that I think will stand out! It has everything, action, adventure and a good story line. You feel as if you are the same type of character as Daniel Craig, you don't know who he is or where he came from. All is explained towards the end of the film, like Daniel Craig's alien wrist watch that snit his but that he stole it from the alien who was about to probe him, which comes in handy to know right at the end of the film! Overall this film is very exciting and jam-packed with action scenes. Although boring whilst the cowboy's are tracking the alien this all gets made up for when they finally find it, before this all you see is Daniel Craig hit Harrison Ford in the face and beat up some other guys, but after finding the alien a thoroughly enjoying film!!!!! Jon Favreau does not fail to impress!!!!! Also there is NOT a bit at the end of the film, I checked, just trying to help!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't feel like going home today after church so I absconded my mom &amp; brother to KLCC to catch Cowboys &amp; Aliens and I expected a B-grade-ish kinda watch. With a title like "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" what would you expect? I'm glad I gave this one a spin cos' it was a really really good mix of sci-fi &amp; western action.Daniel Craig &amp; Harrison Ford made for a strong pairing and it didn't hurt that Olivia Wilde is sight for sore eyes. The pair of Roberto Orci &amp; Alex Kurtzman did a bang up job with the screenplay and kudos too to Jon Favreau for actually topping Iron Man in this one.The movie starts off with enough mystery &amp; viewers to lead viewers into the story and from that point onwards it's hook, line &amp; sinker! Cowboys &amp; Aliens had it all! Great action. Great characters. Touching moments. And of course let's not forget pretty cool special effects.I really enjoyed this one and IMHO it's a sleeper hit. The only problem is that it'll probably only be watched by those who can get beyond the corny &amp; deceiving movie title. Cowboys &amp; Aliens is a must-watch!!! I give this one a gun-zapping and lasso-tossing 5 out of 5!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so let me get down to business like a 13 year old boy and finish quickly. In my opinion this movie was a tad BORING, but I think it's because I went in with such high hopes. There are very ENTERTAINING points (oh boy, how I love Olivia). Honestly, this movie is what you'd expect from it. Ford and Craig together didn't match though and the way the movie was put together seemed almost passionless or rushed. Don't go in expecting an EPIC movie that's well written and leaves you thinking WOW. Go in expecting mediocre and you will get good. I went in expecting good, and came out with mediocre.BTW-Even though I hint towards Olivia above, the nude scene was...let's just say VAGUE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the movies that made beat my heart faster when I saw the trailer, but when I saw the movie, I just was bored during 1h20m. The last 40 min are good; the rest is protracted too much.Our cowboys meet everything you can meet during a journey in the wild west: redskins, gangsters, attractive women, initiation rituals, etc.Harrison Ford became one aggressive liverish old man. I really think he is not just acting. As for Olivia Wilde: she just looks good, specially her eyes. And Daniel Craig: I never liked him, he ruined James Bond.So for those who didn't see the accident form the challenger space shuttle in the 80's live, here is another chance to see it at the end.The idea to combine cowboys with aliens is original, but not good, as you can see in this movie. So it is for genre fans only, but here is the main problem: People who like Sci-Fi usually do not like Western.</fullReview>

It's one of those movies which they will play over and over, like Independence Day, during the summer months. It won't win any awards and it will make enough money to give some executives a smile on their face.Over all the plot was OK. Acting saves the movie along with the special effects. The actors in the movie are actually some of my favorites.But I couldn't stand to sit through the entire movie because it was too predictable. I actually left about 2/3rd through and went to go see The Smurfs in an attempt to cleanse my mind.I figured seeing an even worse movie would enable me to view this movie in a better light and it sort of worked.3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfyingly reinvents the Western for the 21st Century but disappointing in its marginalization of women and minorities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes my expectations for 21st century culture inhibit my ability to embrace entertainment on its own terms. So my response to Cowboys and Aliens is positive but mixed.The preponderance of marginalized women and minorities in film is a sticking point for me and I must begin with my reactions to the unthinking but evident sexism and racism in Cowboys and Aliens.There are very few women in the film at all. There is one minor female whose fate is key to the plot. She is established early on as a former prostitute. Yawn. There a Mexican woman who has no purpose but to stand by her Anglo husband and SPOILER ALERT! she is spirited away by the spaceships so early in the film that, as a Chicana, I couldn't help but wonder if, in fact, the bad guys were not ETs but rather La Migra. . . did I misunderstand the meaning of "Aliens" in the title??? Granted, there is a major female character who is courageous and intelligent. To say more is to give away too much of the plot. So draw your own conclusions once you have seen her character arc.There are virtually no Black people in this movie. I must temper my criticism with "virtually" because eventually we get to see one. Uno. Bound and subjugated, might I add.There are lots of Native American Indians in the film, and Adam Beach is notable as another primary character and a refreshing infusion of diversity - to a point (again, to elaborate too much would be to reveal too much; let it suffice to say he expresses much more appreciation for the conquistador than for the conquered.) Ultimately, the treatment of indigenous peoples by the story is fairly encouraging in a Dances with Wolves kind of backhandedness. The juxtaposition early on of White people collecting scalps is historically correct and gratefully received.The only other Mexican character with a speaking part, by the way, is clearly portrayed as an Idiot among idiots. Mi pobrecita raza? Now that we have the political responses out of the way, let us approach Cowboys and Aliens on its own terms.Despite my criticisms above, as a western fan I enjoyed this ride. I am not opposed to strong males ? White or otherwise ? in and of themselves, and the lead actors here are cowboy gold.Since the new Bond incarnation debuted, many have believed that Daniel Craig is a worthy successor and is hot hottie-hot hot. In this film he proves both his appeal and his versatility. Unlike other Europeans before him - Yul Brynner, Stewart Granger, Alain Delon, Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan, to name just a few - Craig seems comfortable and is believable in the Western genre and the American accent, channeling the compact power of Alan Ladd as Shane with the hint of an Eastwood squint to bind with his own impressive chemistry and conjure a fresh incarnation of the frontier loner archetype.Harrison Ford is a revelation in this motion picture. Has any other actor, so celebrated initially as a swash-buckling sex symbol, ever worked the grizzled thing to such effect as to elevate it to equal sexiness? The only equivalent to Ford in C&amp;A would be if Gary Cooper had decided at some point to take the Walter Brennan role. Film buffs may cite a parallel with Humphrey Bogart in African Queen, but, due respect to the power of Bogart on screen, he was never a swash-buckler and was a lousy cowboy. Others may point to Cary Grant and Father Goose, but to view Father Goose without the fog of nostalgia is to recognize it as an unsuccessful effort. Thankfully, Cary Grant never even tried to be a cowboy. No, Harrison Ford has set a new benchmark here.Director Jon Favreau elegantly finesses a hybrid of graphic novel grit, sci-fi thrills and frontier comfort food. From Swingers, to Iron Man, to this film, Favreau has proved that he can create guy movies with universal appeal - small and thoughtful or big and macho, his films retain at their core a compelling human story. One of the most refreshing qualities of C&amp;A's script and direction is that while it obviously reinvents the western and its conventions, it also acknowledges and pays tribute to them, including the likes of Rio Bravo, The Searchers and the aforementioned Shane among its touchstones. The high tech outer space action is thus wrapped in classic western elements that give comfort and satisfaction to generations for which this motion picture otherwise would not be intended. While true to its comic book roots, C&amp;A retains, from its spot on score by Harry Gregson-Williams, to the sublimely subtle Searchers reference in its penultimate scene, the essence of iconic westerns. In weaving together the look and feel of modern comic books and graphic novels with classicism, incorporating great humor, but with nary a snicker, nor a trace of irony, C&amp;A has the potential to revitalize for this century a genre presumed dead more often than Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction.Of the three developing Wyatt Earp projects known to this author at this date, it will be interesting to see which, if any, come to fruition and attract the cross-over audience of movie classicists and comic book cultists that will be vital to box office success - an audience effectively addressed by C&amp;A.Hope persists that the problematic characterizations of gender and race can be resolved as the Western continues to evolve. Women, African Americans, Native Americans, Asians, Mexicans and other Latinos all contributed to the history of the American frontier in a variety of ways which increasingly are documented. Yet their stories are seldom, if ever told. If audiences can accept aliens in the Wild West, will they not accept heroes and heroines of color? Jon Favreau ? you're good at this ? see what you can do!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Western and sci-fi together at last, to many this is an odd fit. But who says aliens only visited our planet after the American industrial revolution? That being said, I went into the cinema with moderate expectations, and it moderately delivered. The movie had an intriguing opening. Daniel Craig wakes up having no memory of his life or knowledge of this gauntlet locked on his arm. He comes across the tiny town of Absolution where trouble seems to find him. Then from the movie title you can figure out what happens next. Classic to Jon Favreau movies the situational humor is really good, particularly with the town doctor and Han Solo's son. Daniel Craig gave a fine performance in his gritty cowboy role whose moral compass is to be a provider the best way he knows how. The fragmented revelations and the visual effects from Craig's flashbacks were great. Olivia Wilde and Harrison Ford made for an entertaining trio to watch. Unfortunately, after the first alien attack on the town the plot freezes in carbonite. The Aliens have discovered the great American gold rush on earth, so they must exterminate humanity in order to harvest it. But we are never told what they actually use the gold for. The aliens looked disappointing and resembled human form too much. Then while Craig is vaporizing aliens with his gauntlet laser, the aliens prefer to fight back with their fists! Apparently the aliens drank too much slurm and forget all of their gauntlet laser's back on the mothership. The Final Say: Cowboys &amp; Aliens is a fun summer action flick, but had left some potential in the dust. (7.5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I disagree!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Folks in this forum are either saying they dug it as a kick a55 action flick, or deride it as, basically, shallow.I enjoyed the heck out of it, as a story, all along the continuum from concept to pacing to writing. I think it was a noble and courageously executed piece that works to meld these themes together in a powerful way: It's the idea that we had a malign visitation from ETs, but way back when. It's a great idea, and certainly called upon the story folks and writers to give it their full, loving attention. Drop the ball, and indeed it would be a sad waste.Well, I don't think the product was a waste. I found it entrancing and compelling. The writing was direct, rising to pithy at the right moments; and I truly do insist on good writing in the movies I watch.There are certain hurdles the scenario folks and writers had to clear which are the stuff of theatrical writing. For instance, they had to convince us of the notion that Jake, a robber, is a morally salvageable character. That's a tall order, and somehow they pull it off. Maybe it's an illustration of how a lot of what we think of as character structure is merely ego. Deprived of his ego, it turns out Jake isn't such a bad chap after all. That's timely and profound; and the writers manage this (and other) complexity in a wholly satisfactory way.And another challenge: They end on a redemption note. Do you believe in this redemption? Will this work for you? It did for me.I also enjoyed much else in the production; the balance of daylight and indoor and/or night lighting (which was nuanced in a way I found reminiscent of Kubrick) gave a wonderful ebb and flow to the visual aspect.There was one thing I found a little distracting: The lush orchestral score seemed a little, mm, out of place. I found myself wondering if they could/should have done what the Coens did with "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou" and give it a soundtrack foundation on a down-and-dirty period musical score.Just watch and listen. Open your mind, and you might even be touched!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cowboys work / Aliens don't!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'COWBOYS &amp; ALIENS': Three Stars (Out of Five)Jon Favreau directed this film adaptation of the 2006 graphic novel of the same name. The movie was in development since 1997 when Universal Pictures and DreamWorks bought the rights to the idea from the comic's creator Scott Mitchell Rosenberg. Steve Oedekerk was originally hired to write and direct the film but after writing the first draft he abandoned the project in order to work on another Jim Carrey film instead. Favreau was later brought on to direct, by his 'IRON MAN' partner Robert Downey Jr. (who was set to star). Downey Jr. left the film to do another 'SHERLOCK HOLMES' movie and was replaced by Daniel Craig. Harrison Ford was later hired to co-star and Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby all contributed to the screenplay. Considering all the project's contributors and changing of hands it's no wonder that the film turned out a bit of a mess. It had a promising premise and decent talent attached but ultimately it's a slight misfire. If you like westerns and or sci-fi films though it still might be worth your time (for mild amusement at least).The film is set in a desert town, named Absolution, in Arizona in the year 1873. Craig plays Jake Lonergan who, as the film opens, has no knowledge of who he is or memory of his past when he stumbles into Absolution. He soon discovers that he's a wanted crook and is arrested by the town's Sheriff (Keith Carradine). The real man that runs the town, Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford), wants Lonergan handed over to him but they're interrupted when viscous alien monsters attack the town from the sky. They snatch up several town citizens, including the Colonel's son Percy (Paul Dano). Dolarhyde soon finds himself teaming up with Lonergan, who also has a device wrapped around his wrist that can blast the aliens out of the sky. The two join forces with a saloon owner (Sam Rockwell) also looking to rescue his wife from the creatures, a mysterious but beautiful woman (Olivia Wilde), a young boy ('THE LAST AIRBENDER's Noah Ringer) and a team of cowboys. The unlikely band then sets out to hunt the aliens down.I was really in to the beginning of the movie. It starts out like a classic 'old school' western with Daniel Craig playing sort of a 'Man With No Name' type. Once the aliens enter the movie though it kind of goes downhill. I have nothing against the genre mash-up, I like the idea of crossing westerns with sci-fi, but here it just doesn't work. Mostly because the sci-fi elements are so ineffective compared to the western elements of the film; the aliens are clichéd and unoriginal and not the least bit frightening. If the creatures had worked at least somewhat better it wouldn't have taken away so much from the rest of the film (the western). While Craig and Ford are good in the movie, and the rest of the cast is adequate as well, the script is too weak for them to play off of and Favreau's directing is somewhat uninspired. I like most of Jon Favreau's other work (especially the 'IRON MAN' films) but here it just feels like he was going through the motions. Despite all it's weaknesses the film is still mildly amusing and entertaining to a certain point. It's not a waste of time if that's all your looking for and fans of the two genres represented are bound to be amused as well.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nse6Wm1EtZU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>5 out of 10 because I really enjoyed it... and you will too if you turn off your brain for a couple of hours. If you really think about it, it does miss the mark... It could have been SO great but there was really no plot... or rather the plot that was, was so simple it ended up being silly!! Good actors, who embody their characters really well, wonderful CGI effects and rather unique and cool looking aliens with sharp teeth and bad intentions... if only there was a good story there.I waited so long for this film to come out in cinemas, I was giddy with excitement but the film falls short of the mark. When I walked out of the movie I was all "yeah, nice!!" but after I read a few reviews and thought is over and memory of the cool effects is fading, I find myself disappointed at the lack of a plot. It's like the writers/producers said "Yeah! Cowboys AND ALIENS!! This will be cool! Let's do that..." and then set off to shoot some cowboys and aliens together... with no real purpose.Why are the aliens attacking humans in a remote desert area? Because there is gold underground... and aliens want the gold. For what, they don't say. It would have been cool if they wanted it let's say because their planet's survival depended on it or they ate it or something. But it doesn't specify... they just want gold. And the aliens we do see in the movie, are just one ship, one scouting party. They are taking humans and torture them and kill them (with ease I might add) to "find your weaknesses"... uhm, they are 7 feet tall, with pinchers and sharp teeth.. surely they have understood by now that one blow and a human dies... why keep taking more? And apparently we never saw them again because at the end their ship gets blown up so that sends a signal to the other aliens that the gold on Earth is not worth their trouble.Olivia Wilde, is an alien too... she took the human form to walk among us... her people were killed off by the aliens. How did she come to Earth? What does she look like as an alien? Where is her ship? Was she the sole survivor of her race? These are just a tiny fraction of all the unanswered questions and plot holes in the film. Seriously, don't they know by now, we, the audience, hate it when things are left in the air or when the explanation is ludicrous at best?? If only the story was better it would have been a wonderful, fantastic movie. Heck it had everything else going for it!!! Maybe if I was 15, "trivial" things like a good plot and character development wouldn't have mattered because... COWBOYS!! And ALIENS!! IN ONE FILM!! But, I am 33 and things that go "boom" fail to fascinate me these days...Still, not a waste of your time or money... if you can turn your brain off for a couple of hours, you will enjoy it, it is well made, with killer CGI and a whole lot of scary looking and unfriendly aliens... not too bad at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before i start let it be understood that i did not go into this movie with overly high expectations, i expected a fun perhaps clichéd action movie with the standard save the world plot in maybe a fresh context....It wasn't.It was predictable, 2 dimensional and if it had a proper form of a plot, i guessed i must've sneezed during that part. From the get go, questions are thrust into your lap, you're curious what happened, how it happened and why, 30 minutes later and enter the female protagonist, (Olivia Wilde) rather then her clarifying any answers, she instead just chooses to mind f**k you a little more.Not much is answered. The resolution for me just wasn't there. I left feeling like i wasted 2 hours.As usual of late, it had spectacular special effects and very well done stunts, and wasn't entirely void of emotion.Maybe i've been quite harsh, i think it's justified but perhaps not, if a bunch of ragtag cowboys chasing aliens across the desert only to shoot at them sounds good to you, then it may well float your boat.If you like Harrison ford and Indiana Jones, you may well like this. If not, bring a book to read.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very good, but a little more serious than I was expecting just from the title... It's well cast and it looks great, though. Sure, it was a bit po-faced - especially given the title - but I got over that once the tone of the film had been established. The Western isn't a genre one usually goes to for knockabout romps, and this is a straight version that just happens to have aliens in it.Westerns are built on archetypes. Rarely are they character driven. This one occasionally stuck a bit too close to the lines, but it's fine if you grasp the mood early.Maybe first choice Robert Downey Jr. would've had a bit more fun in the lead role, but Daniel Craig is all business and no frivolity... I don't have a problem with that, though, if proceedings are handsomely mounted - and they were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new idea that eventually got plagued by old concepts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought it was interesting that someone decided that these two could mix and thought done properly could end up becoming a modern day classic. While this film builds a great deal of tension in the beginning with our protagonist and wanted man Jake (Daniel Craig) showing himself to be ruthless cowboy unafraid of taking any action he pleases. He has also lost his memory unaware of any crimes he has committed. Something in which I am glad they did as I was afraid that they would make him out to be too much of a law abiding cowboy with a slight dark side. We know what he is and we are supposed to root for him but there is a large villainous side to him. I am glad they took this approach. Anyway while at the start they took this approach I was expecting a fairly dark film. Although later on there are pockets of humour inserted in. I minded this at first but as the film progressed I realised it was a good thing it didn't take itself too seriously. Craig does do well in the role and the rest of the characters do play off him quite well. When the aliens do arrive while the action scenes were fairly standard the effects were brilliant and didn't look like plain Computer Generated Images. Due to this the action scenes looked very good on screen. Harrison Ford was the most memorable character in my opinion though with a performance only he can give really stealing the show in many scenes. Olivia Wilde was okay I just wish they'd written her character better then we might have had a more dynamic female lead, something which this film was sorely missing. The inevitable romance between her and Jake played out as standard but fortunately didn't drag the story down. Going back to effects the aliens themselves looked brilliant and quite unique managing to look genuinely scary bringing some frightening moments. Not to mention being looking very realistic. The reason I say old concepts about this film is because it plays out just how you would expect it too. Maybe I was expecting too much but it needed something more in order to make it memorable and be a little less predictable. On paper it looked like it could be really dynamic and deliver as it turns out it failed to. On the other hand it is enjoyable despite sliding between slightly light hearted and taking itself seriously. Thankfully though the film is entertaining with some fantastic action scenes and suspense. If you are looking for a decent film to enjoy without being too up itself give this a try.</fullReview>

I think the worst thing, apart from the acting of the three leads (Ford should quit, Wilde does no more than pout about the desert like a constipated cat and Craig spends the whole film trying to out pout her)is that the film is credited with nine writers, nine! My as yet not fully formed and yet highly imaginative six year old brain could do better than that with an assortment of broken toys and a lighter.

		<fullReview>To answer the question I've heard repeatedly - it's a western, it does have some sci-fi elements but in fact it's closer to horror movies in the style of Alien and it's sequels than to real sci-fi. Namely, the sci-fi elements are here to extend the range of the action and to up the challenge faced by the heroes not to set the moral core of the film. It's well paced and well shot. The cast is impeccable, in fact it's the best role I've seen of Harison Ford in a long while. and it's the best movie I've seen from Jon Favreau, despite liking his Iron Man. The man has a knack for comics adaptations, and he bested himself here (yes I know it was a graphic novel, from the movie's viewpoint it's the same thing). The only real problem I had with the film is the fact that most of the secondary roles were too "cartoonish" - that is flatI liked how it gathers all the elements of the western cliché to reach the movie's climax. That's what a homage is all about. And if you still have your doubts, wait for the very final scene and you'll realize too - this was a western. It does call for some suspension of judgment, but what sci-fi or comics adaptation doesn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about cowboys and aliens?! Not as bad as it sounds!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie involving cowboys and aliens? I couldn't have been more skeptical about a film! I came into the movie theater with low expectations and was very much surprised with the quality of the film! "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" was intense, full of action, had a good mix of comedy and drama, and was just all around great!I was surprised at the intensity of the film. During the high powered action moments, I found that I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. What I liked the most about the film were the characters. They were never clearly defined as either good nor bad. The characters were human beings. Like us, they had both good and bad qualities. I found myself tearing up at at least two of the scenes involving the background characters. The actors were brilliant. Enough said.It's disappointing to see that it's mostly the negative reviews that are being featured on the IMDb page. I mean, really? Aside from the choppy transitions, this was great! "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" really is a super intense film! I didn't even notice the time passing! Don't miss out on this one! Who knew western and sci-fi could mix really well together!</fullReview>

In other words people I would wait for the DVD release! wait scratch that just don't see this movie at all 2/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How you like the movie is all based on you. The movie has more haters than lovers, but that shouldn't keep you from watching this epic film because you may end up loving it. I had friends who went to go see it who loved it and I had family members who went to see it who hated it. When I first saw the trailer of this movie before I saw Green Lantern I was iffy if I wanted to go see it, but the time came when I just had to go see it. To my amazement I was dazzled. I pretty much loved the movie. Yeah it is no where compared to the graphics and action of Transformers, but this movie was great in it's own way. After I saw the movie I read all the critiques on this site and they said the plot is confusing or is missing, but that is not true. This was a very realistic plot. It is the story of war and survival like many others. Acting: 10/10 Action: 7/10 because the aliens were really subpar characters. they could have done a better job. Story: 7/10 Morals: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not awful, not good either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cowboy parts were OK, filmed beautifully. The plot rules change every 15 minutes, which is unsurprising, because there were about 8 different writers, so figure on a complete huh? with every change of writer. Characters who knew nothing the first third of the movie turn out to be experts on the situation. The aliens are silly. Their motivation for being here is pretty bland, and given how powerful they are, there's no reason for their human research hobby. Took itself much too seriously to have so much inconsistency. Made me miss Firefly, where at least the world worked in an internally consistent way, and where the enemy was us, which is a lot more believable. Craig is pretty good, but underused, Ford plays a guy that he apparently (and obviously) changed the character of midstream, Favreau has done much better, but the dog is just great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fresh idea of this movie is what brought a couple of friends and I to watch it a few days ago, and we left feeling very satisfied. I had been counting down the days until C&amp;A was released since I saw the first trailer, and in my eyes it delivered.Despite a few plot holes, it had pretty much everything you could ask for in a summer movie: persistent action, characters that you came to care about, realistic western environment, terrific acting from top to bottom as you would expect from the all-star likes of Craig, Ford, Rockwell, Wilde, as well as an almost scene-stealing performance by Dano, but the lesser names also were very solid.Daniel Craig pulled of a terrific American accent when needed, although the "strong and silent" approach fit his character perfectly, he came across as a total bad ass.Harrison Ford was very believable as the gruff, weathered old colonel, in what is his best performance that I have watched.Olivia Wilde. Need I say more? She naturally pulls off the sultry, soft-spoken demeanor that was required for her part, yet still manages to be someone who's bad side you wouldn't want to be on. And of course, she looks ridiculously sexy even while dressed from head-to-toe in a tablecloth of a dress.Overall, as long as you don't go into the cinema expecting an extremely deep and brooding plot, you will come out feeling as though your money was well spent. It doesn't out-stay it's welcome, and the great acting and well paced action will leave you wanting more. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lackluster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pretty excited for this movie cause it had two amazing things for a movie: Cowboys and Aliens. And I love Harrison Ford. But after I saw some lackluster reviews and Ford's angry review rant on Conan, I was a little wary of spending money on it.I went and saw it and I can't say I regret it cause there are some amusing parts and Paul Dano is crazy good as the whiny son of Ford. But it seemed like just a summer movie with a simple plot but a convoluted back story. Nothing is ever really explained and there are plot strings waving in the breeze by the end of the movie. It also seems to be torn between a action film and a geek fest with its huge action scenes and snippets of information. Its like they couldn't decide what audience they were going for and, in the end, didn't really capture anyone's attention.About the actors: Daniel Craig can't act apparently cause he doesn't in this and he's almost too cool like it would be nice for him to lose at something. I felt it was a bit annoying and compared to Harrison Ford's depiction of a flawed cattle rancher, it was unfortunate. Another disappointment was Olivia Wilde. I watched her on House and I liked her there. In Cowboys and Aliens, she follows Craig around like a puppy and its kind of creepy how little acting she actually does. And the thrown in naked scene is sadly very short and not very explicit. If naked back turns you on then go for it but that's pretty much it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. With such a wonderful title, stellar cast, the director of Iron Man and Elf, and the collision of two distinct film genres - Westerns and Sci-Fi, we had every right to expect cinematic genius. Instead we get OK, just fine, and kind of interesting. I believe that qualifies as a letdown.My view of the film is that the western/cowboy portion is outstanding. The setting and characters are realistic and intriguing. Heck, there is steely-eyed Daniel Craig as the outlaw Jake Lonergan; grumpy Harrison Ford as Col. Dolarhyde who runs the town with iron fist; loony tunes Paul Dano as Dolarhyde's son who is itching for respect; bespectacled Sam Rockwell as a barkeep called Doc; porcelain Olivia Wilde as the not-from-around-here beauty whose presence no one seems to question; and Keith Carradine as the Sheriff trying to do the right thing. We even have the obligatory kid (Noah Ringer from The Last Airbender) and a loyal dog.The weakness of the film is with the aliens. Many have said the film would be better without the aliens. Well, wouldn't that make the title a bit ridiculous? We just needed BETTER aliens. These aliens are smart enough for intergalactic travel but they can't outsmart a bunch of rustlers? And how many times did they capture Daniel Craig just to have him escape? Not to mention that their power seems to come from gold ... and there is a shortage on their planet and ours! The beginning of the film is really, really good. It's 1837 and Lonergan wakes up in the middle of nowhere, just outside the unfriendly town of Absolution. He is wearing a metallic bracelet/shackle around his wrist and no memory of who he is or where he came from. Although there are some terrific scenes, the film kind of drifts downhill after that.All I will say about the story is that the aliens attack Absolution by kidnapping a few residents and stealing gold. The cowboys fight back with six shooters, Lonergan's bracelet, Wilde's knowledge, and some help from the Indians.What really bothers me about this one is that it should have been so much FUN! Instead, it's mostly bleak with only a few comic lines tossed in. My guess is having NINE writers associated with the film was a real problem. Each of the characters holds some interest, but the story just kind of meanders with little direction.A couple of minor irritants for me: Lonergan wakes up and mugs three crusty old cowboys and winds up with perfectly tailored chaps, pants, shirt and vest; Olivia Wilde wears the same dress all the time but never really gets dirty; the cowboys shoot the aliens with guns, arrows and spears - sometimes they die, sometimes they don't; and supposedly the aliens don't see well in daylight. Tell that to the numerous cowboys and Indians who get slaughtered in the climatic battle. Lastly, Olivia Wilde's character is the only one of her type. Where were her fellow "countrymen"? As I said, the cast is spectacular. It's always nice to see Buck Taylor in a western. Clancy Brown plays the preacher. You will remember him as the prison guard in The Shawshank Redemption. Mr. Brown maintains his top position as the largest head of all actors. Walton Goggins (Justified) plays one of Lonergan's old gang, and brings a touch of humor. And the fiddler is played by first time actor Rex Rideout. Nothing to say about that other than congrats on a terrific screen name! The film is entertaining, but just falls short of what could have been, even what should have been. Watching Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford match wits in the old west is almost enough!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a WESTERN before it is anything else: The Searchers on Steroids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And as a western, it follows ALL of the good structure of any John Ford piece. Just because it has Aliens in it, does not make it a Science Fiction movie. So, I understand the disappointment of certain so-called Eberts who think they know anything about movies, who posted here how bad this film was. No, it wasn't - But all of their pompous reviews and negations of this film were odious. This film can simply be considered "The Searchers with Aliens in it". What makes this film great, is that this takes place after the Civil War, During the Indian Wars, and right before the Railroad boom.We have two guys, two Protagonists: Daniel Craig, Looking VERY MUCH like Nevada Smith aka Steve McQueen - the Man with No Name, rolls into town and trouble just seems to follow him in, yet the preacher (the great Character actor Clancy Brown) yet still takes him in. The Sheriff, Keith Carradine, is just doing his job, and the Rancher Harrison Ford wants payback for a past injury. Said Rancher has a son, who is the bane of the town, always stirring up trouble from which his Pa has to bail him out- played by Paul Dano, and his sidekick, Adam Beach, who is of First Nation descent, and looks up to his boss Ford as a father.Then there is the mysterious Girl, Olivia Wilde (Qorra from Tron Legacy) who just happens to tote a large gun over her pretty dress - Which is very out of place but it works here. And then the Bartender, Sam Rockwell, who is actually a doctor. And a band of about 40 ravening Gunfighters and Train robbers who Daniel Craig used to lead like a pack of Dogs, And a band of Chiricahua.This film is The Searcher on Steroids: we have several disparate groups of people, Ranchers, Outlaws, Townsfolk, and First Nationers, under normal circumstances natural blood enemies. They all work together here and earn each other's respect.I see this film ONLY as a western, and it has John Ford elements - Especially, the Locations, where you almost cannot distinguish the Alien Spaceship from the natural surroundings, it looks very much like an Anasazi structure found near the SouthWest, reminiscent of Louis L'Amour's "The Haunted Mesa" L'Amour's last book which also mixed Science Fiction and Westerns.Where the critics fail is that they are expecting a Science Fiction film akin to Orci/Kurtzman's Star Trek, which proceeded at Warp Nine. THIS is a Western, they did not have Warp Drive, let alone Automobiles, they had to depend on Horses to travel from one place to another. This is actually Star Trek on the scale of the old Southwest area of the US back in the 1870's. So this film does follow the tenets of a Star Trek film only at a pace more befitting to Horses than to Warp Nacelles.This was the Old West, things took time. Searches took time, days - Weeks. And the Old West Frontier, was akin to the Gamma Quadrant ? The people who rode in Conestoga Wagons from the East to the West, are the same people who don Starfleet uniforms and travel in starships to all points west of Federation Space.The Aliens in this, are ruthless killers, with no regard for Human life, only for the Gold they are extracting from the ground and anywhere else they can find it. They don't like to handle coins, so they just liquefy the stuff. These things are like, they have Frog's Heads on top of four-limbed bodies, and an extra pair of arms in their chest - This is a weakness, can't tell you more though.My suggestion is to ignore most of the bad reviews - I myself do not go to movies to pick them apart, either I enjoy it, or I don't. This film should have been Jon Favreau's masterpiece- It IS his masterpiece. It's a GOOD FILM, by any standards of John Ford and Cameron/Spielberg/Jackson. This film shows how the characters of men can be changed for the better when they are forced into a situation where they have to live, work and fight side by side with people groups they normally would not associate with - When there is a common threat, it brings these natural enemies together, and who knows, sometimes, they end up not being enemies after that. But that is just the normal way of how friends meet sometimes, many good friends were enemies when they initially met. Unfortunately, this is a fact of life, it should not take calamitous events to bring people together, but that is just how this world works, and even more so in the times where there was no Technology.And it is due to the lack of Tricorders, Phasers, Quantum Torpedoes, Disruptors, Cloaking Devices, AntiProton Beams, Sensors, Radar, Radar Detectors, Metal Detectors, Cars, Toilets, and Strip Malls that this movie is a great Western - A modern Sci Fi movie will use gadgets to move the plot along, sometimes many times the speed that light can flow from the Movie Screen into your Eyes. But the lack of technology in this film is befitting to the plot - And of course, the only man who has access to advanced Tech is Daniel Craig's character - And it is not necessary that he should know what it is, or how it works, or even how to use it! And so, it is that LACK of Tech that is precisely why this is a great Western- And the Relevant Conundrum of this Film is not solved by Gadgets, it is solved by sheer Human Ingenuity and Bravery.</fullReview>

I mean it is very interesting how they will fight them with no modern technology, only old guns and pistols. This movie worth every minute of it. I rated it 10 out of 10 and it worth it.

		<fullReview>Cowboys &amp; Aliens. Cowboys... and... aliens. On one side cowboys, on the other side aliens. How could this not be the best motion picture ever? By being treated with such heavy handedness and seriousness by all involved, that's how. Jon Favreau, the filmmaker responsible for the fun (and funny) Iron Man films, has approached this seemingly bonkers concept with a misguided sense of importance and the two heavyweight leads miss their mark entirely. Daniel Craig's amnesiac outlaw is as emotive as a rock and Harrison Ford's terse ex-Colonel is, well, just plain old cranky, which unfortunately becomes tiresome quicker than you can say "geriatric Indiana Jones". Even the creatures from outer space are underwhelming. Thankfully Sam Rockwell is on hand to liven things up a bit as the town's snarky doctor.</fullReview>

What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Dolarhyde.It's a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky.Screaming down with breathtaking velocity and blinding lights to abduct the helpless one by one, these monsters challenge everything the residents have ever known. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation.As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been, he realises he holds a secret that could give the town a fighting chance against the alien force.....And it started off so well. The first twenty minutes of the film, is as good as any western can be, and you can see the influence of Unforgiven a mile away. Then we meet Ford, who who should wear a badge saying grizzled, because he is so over the top here its almost farcical.And then the aliens attack, and sadly, it all goes downhill from there.From so many prolific people on board, I was expecting something special, not a boring destination movie, where the cast bump into bad guys, have a fight, bump into aliens, have a fight and so on and so on.Craig has to be really careful if he wants to stay A-list, as this is truly his worst performance. If you see the guys efforts in Layer Cake, Enduring Love and Love Is the Devil, you will know he isn't putting any emotion into this, which makes the film seem even worse.In a summer chock full of disappointments, this could have had the quirkiness of Men In Black, but plays like a dull Wild Wild West.Rockwel and Brown easily put in the best performances, and when they are screen, it's worth watching. But it's just the fact that so much more could have been done to make this the film of the year, rather than one of the biggest disappointments.And i'm not surprised Favreau didn't give himself a role in this movie.An action Sci-Fi thats dull? Unforgiven indeed.</fullReview>

Clint Eastwood had such charm , even TV series Lonesome Dove show so much about the Old west. YOU like it right! Aliens yes, i like being scared by such monstrous human eating savages that creep on you when you expect them not to. Remember Alien series that got your heart racing like a wild dog!! But sadly, this is not any of the above. Movie fails to capture either of the above scenarios , cowboys and aliens is a poorly directed low budget movie. If a sound director (Christopher Nolan) my favorite would have thought of making something like this it would have been spell bounding!I would advise anyone not to waste your money rather watch Lonesome Dove if you haven't or the old alien series with your friends drinking beer your DRY throat!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At its core is a silly premise, but the presentation is phenomenal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Verdict --------------- As summer 2011 comes to a close Cowboys &amp; Aliens stands alone as the last blockbuster of the season. If you were somehow unable to glean from its title, C&amp;A strives to blend the best elements of both the Western and Sci-fi genres while trying to maintain a serious tone through it all. Expect as much surprise in the plot department as when you saw the "&amp; Aliens" next to "Cowboys" in the title of the movie; the plot is sadly dull and predictable and limps along with the fast-paced action hoping to throw out some redeeming twists and turns, but nothing heals a fractured story once it's out there. Nonetheless, I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie! It was an entertaining and ridiculously action-packed ride that successfully relied on the meeting point between Sci-fi and Western to keep things interesting. C&amp;A is the most thrilling movie of the summer, and a worthy blockbuster to close out the season, but there's nothing in the script that will change your life.The Rationale ----------------- Aliens' first layover on their way to conquer the world is the American wild west, so they abduct the loved ones of everyone in sight, and in turn the lovers of the loved ones unite to track down the extraterrestrials and get them back. That's the entire story in one sentence. Was it a spoiler? No, but that does give you an idea of how one-dimensional the premise is. Cowboys &amp; Aliens takes its name and core idea from an earlier graphic novel made in 2006. Director Jon Favreau argues all other content is original. The film does not claim to have made the ultimate cross-category combination but instead revels in the fact there are both aliens and cowboys, two all-time Hollywood staples, on the screen at the same time. So is C&amp;A simply original, or originally simple? I'll have to take the latter route. C&amp;A mushes together the old west and invaders from outer space, but does nothing spectacular beyond that. The only plot twist in the film is completely expected and is merely a spark from a dying fire. While flaws in the plot are a shame, the blend of the two genres is amazingly seamless. Favreau was absolutely right when he said western and sci-fi just nicely fit together when both are taken seriously. I thought the only possible way I would enjoy this film would require a massive suspension of disbelief on my part, but to my great delight the movie was mostly very fluid. Unfortunately I can't shake the comparison to this summer's earlier film Super 8, also a genre-bending movie of sorts. I can't deny that the sci-fi aspect of the film looked and behaved exactly as it would under JJ Abram's command; even the aliens look like the ungodly offspring of a beetle, crab, and the Super 8 monster. This is why I came to the conclusion that the Western half C&amp;A was crafted much more solidly and carries the weight of the film. Now if anyone can make an on screen battle of revolvers and laser- blasters happen, it's Olivia Wilde, Daniel Craig, and Harrison Ford as a team under Favreau's watchful eye. As a whole the acting is fine and the directing impressive ? the blemishes come from elsewhere. Daniel Craig's character wakes up at the start of the film and suffers from amnesia, an interesting propellant right into the heart of the action and a way to keep things interesting. But his intermittent flashbacks develop his character so blandly that by the time he's ready to remember his identity, no one really cares. Everyone knows Ford is no stranger to the cowboy hat either, so here the script is to blame. Ford's character is supposed to have an inner struggle with who he is and how he acts from scene-to-scene? but rather, he flops back and forth so bluntly from sympathetic-but-aloof, noble warrior to cold-blooded killer that he appears to have a drastic case of bipolar disorder instead of a complex character. Everyone else, be it the adopted Indian tracker or the gang of trainrobbers or the gunslingin' preacher man, fall into their respective, heavily stereotypical Western roles. In some cases that would make a film mundane, however I think it adds some good strength to the Western part of C&amp;A. Where Cowboys &amp; Aliens really shines is the action, and if you're intent on seeing it for any other reason then you are misled my friend. In keeping with his tradition of minimal CGI, Favreau crafts some of the most incredible explosive sequences of the summer. Where it is used, the CGI looks more than great and special effects will wow and amaze. C&amp;A has arguably the best action of any movie this summer and, simply for that, warrants a trip to the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Escapist Fare; Exceeded Low Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, don't let the goofy title keep you from at least renting it, because it is a fun trip and good escapism fare. It also helps to have low expectations! Yes, the title and some of the previews made this appear to be another cheesy over-the-top action film of today.....but with Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig in the lead roles, it had to be more than just some corny B-film....and it was. It was fun to watch. Sure, it's goofy, especially in the last 30 minutes, but it's definitely a fun ride.Craig, as "Jake Lonergan," was the star, and the most interesting person, probably because his history and character (and the strange device on his wrist) weren't revealed right away, just in bits and pieces as the story evolved. He did a nice job with the American accent, too.The aliens and their ships were kinda cool, too - not the best I've seen, but not bad. I'd say the same for the special-effects, overall, too. The sound was outstanding, with good rear speaker contributions.Like Craig, Olivia Wilde as "Ella Swensen" also was a mysterious character and her nature wasn't revealed until 3/4ths of the way through, either.It was shocking to see Ford as a "bad guy" but "Woodrow Dolarhyde" slowly changed his attitude and became more like the "Indiana Jones" guy who we all know and love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can read the plot on all the other reviews so I'll just stick to the point. This movie was very well done. Daniel Craig is believable and likable in his role, even though you don't like what it appears he might be. Harrison Ford plays a cranky rotten mean turd and does it well, but he starts to grow on you and he plays the part well. It is wonderfully authentic as an old western and then gets interesting when the aliens appear. Despite the incongruity of the two, hey, who's to say aliens have to wait for our race to get to the point of computers and jet planes before they can invade? It's mostly serious and intense, but with some really funny moments too. The reason why the aliens are here is a little lightweight. There's also one other moment, you'll know it when it happens, when I turned to my husband and said, "Ok, I was really enjoying it but this is just stupid!" and it is, but then once it explains, it's a bit less stupid. Sure, the background plot with the aliens is again, kind of lightweight, but who cares? All the interesting plot is with the people fighting the aliens and their interaction and it's worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of fun, and less filling...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before completely digressing, "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is a lot of fun. I enjoyed it, and you got to love the title. What is astounding about "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is its pedigree. Steven Spielberg is the Executive Producer. Ron Howard and Brian Grazer are the Producers for their Imagine Entertainment. Jon Favreau (of "Iron Man") is the Director. The screenwriters of "Transformers" and "Star Trek", Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, along with Mark Fergas and Hawk Ostby wrote the screenplay based on the comic book. Daniel Craig ("James Bond") and Harrison Ford ("Indiana Jones") are the stars. Stunning Olivia Wilde, who was the best thing about "Tron: Legacy" costars. The movie is genetically engineered as the summer blockbuster?you can tell all involved had a blast making this movie. Surprisingly, "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" barely edged out "The Smurfs" in the weekend box office. Go figure.Anyway, veering back on course, "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is a great summer movie. It plays like your traditional western with vermin extraterrestrials at bay. Daniel Craig is awesome, and looks amazingly shredded. He fights with explosive martial arts style?not typically Western, and is deadly with guns as well. He wakes in the desert bearing a futuristic metallic bracelet on his forearm capable of dispatching alien spaceships at will, and vicious wound in his side. Craig is convincing as outlaw cowboy, without a trace of British accent. He even has one over Clint Eastwood's "Man with No Name": He doesn't remember his own. You don't mess with him either, as three scoundrels discover in the opening scene.Harrison Ford is grizzled patriarch rancher Woodrow Dolarhyde. At first glance Ford seems imprisoned in caricature. However, Ford embodies character in Dolarhyde. Dolarhyde's son Percy (clumsily arrogant Paul Dano) is aimless and constantly running afoul of the law. Percy mistakenly crosses Craig. Inevitably Woodrow and Craig's amnesiac shall intersect paths.Disoriented Craig soon encounters more trouble in town. Ella (Wilde) gazes with haunting familiarity into Craig's steel blues with her own. Wilde is the beauty with mesmerizing eyes, eliciting both transparency and mystery. She is the perfect match for Craig's brooding charisma and physicality. During a fight Ella blindsides Craig; thus, saving the lives of the town's deputies. He lands in a jail cell, next to Percy. Apparently, Craig is Jake Lonergan, who is wanted for robbery and murder. Lonergran is accused of murdering his lover Alice (beguiling Abigail Spencer). Jake's fragmented flashback reveals otherwise. Flying alien drones swoop down upon the town in dramatic display, tethering fearful citizens off into the clear night sky. Jake's bracelet unleashes a burst of energy that destroys one of the ships. Dolarhyde has questions, but knows that Jake holds the key to getting his son Percy back.So Jake, Dolarhyde, Ella, and the crew ride off in search of the Aliens. In a bizarre twist, they align with the Indian tribe, and Jake's band of outlaws. No nonsense Ella holds the secret to Jake identity, and the grand alien scheme. Disappointingly, Ella gets almost naked in the integral plot point, as misrepresented by the movie trailer. After all Craig bares his ripped torso throughout?fair is fair? Craig, Wilde, and Ford captivate us; even when it ominously seems "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is going all "Predator" on us, particularly as the hulking aliens hunt down the humans. I really didn't want to hear Jake say, "If it bleeds, we can kill it." "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" leverages some quirky narrative twists. The intent of the Alien invasion is a little weird and in context, along with the bewildering abductions. Really this doesn't matter. You have spectacular cinematography of the panoramic desert and mountains. Jake rescues Ella from a soaring drone, before diving into the river. The action is expertly executed. The visuals are exquisite. Enjoy the ride. Perhaps "Cowboys &amp; Aliens 2"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film is a well-acted Western with Aliens in it...not an alien invasion movie with cowboys in it/</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised with Cowboys and Aliens. After reading a few critics calling it "dull" and "lifeless" I was worried this would be a CGI riddled film where the action is so broad and large scale you become detached causing the dull reaction. I found it to be quite the opposite. Cowboys and Aliens is a "Western". People need to realize this before viewing. This is not an alien invasion movie so much as it is a Westerm where the Aliens are a part of the story of the town of Absolution and its inhabitants. Readers of this are probably saying huh? If this movie were a weekly TV episode that focused on a town called Absolution and its characters such as Jake and the Colonel and their story...and one of the weekly episodes has aliens in it..this may be a more accurate way to describe Cowboys and Aliens. I found it to be terrific. I imagine some of the disappointed reviewers went into the film expecting an alien invasion film that is set in the old west. When they find out it focuses on the Western I think it will disappoint a certain demographic of viewers.Daniel Craig &amp; Harrison Ford are terrific in opposing roles. Ford, as usual, is able to tap into the emotional part of the story and draw the viewer into his story of redemption. Craig does more compelling work with his eyes than the wrist blaster and really impressed me. Without saying too much look for the scene between Adam Beach, Harrison Ford, and the Indian Chief and tell me that isn't Ford at his best since "Air Force One". The CGI is used right without overkill, the action is kept in perspective, and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous.If you are looking for an adult Western with some terrific action sprinkled around a character driven script go see this film. It won't leave you disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is much more than a Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford action movie. It is a fantastic blending of two genres (western and sci-fi), and the supporting cast were exceptional. I saw this movie with a large group of people (ranging from an 11 year old boy to a 50 year old woman), and we all loved it! I liked the fact that it wasn't predictable, and both genres were done in a very believable way.I got home a few minutes ago, and I want to go back and watch it again already - that rarely happens, almost as rare as me reviewing a movie. That's a sign of how much we loved this film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just A Bad Film - I Feel Bad For The Talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, I just came back from a screening of Cowboys and Aliens and all my worst fears came to light. Yes, this film is as bad as everyone is saying. Now, I really liked most of the directors films (The Iron Man films are awesome). So, I defended this team and this film saying it would be good but they made a liar out of me. I'm all out of praise for them. I just went off on my friends about how much this movie sucks, so I probably won't have much left to say. I wanted to like this film; I was going to cut it all the slack that I could manage. I'm sorry but even given that factor, this movie falls so flat. Even trying to fool myself, it is bad. I literally could sit here all day ripping apart the poor dialogue, the multiple tones, the dumb concept, etc. It's such a shame that a director that maybe was on his way to being called one of the best working today seems to have stubbed his toe big-time here. Hopefully, Cowboys &amp; Aliens marks the bottom of the barrel and we can all forget this thing ever happened at all. I kind of feel sorry for Harrison Ford. He's too great of an actor and too much of a legend to be staring in a movie that's this bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than What the Title Suggests</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1875. New Mexico Territory. A stranger with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde. It's a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been, he realizes he holds a secret that could give the town a fighting chance against the alien force. -- (C) UniversalC&amp;A has a ridiculous, B-movie premise that is executed like a serious, A-grade film, and that's a good thing. The film turns out to be fun entertainment in a SUPER 8 kind of way than a SNAKES ON A PLANE kind of way. They're both fun films but for entirely different reasons. With that being said, C&amp;A, as dumb as it may appear to be, is actually quite good, and it's apparent a lot of hard work went into the film. The film manages to blend the western and sci-fi genres together better than one might expect, but with director Jon Favreau in the chair, it's also not that surprising. I'm also glad to say the trailer manages not to reveal any major plot points that happen in the film, most of it coming from the film's first 30 minutes, which is refreshing considering the trend of where most film trailers have been going.However, I'm surprised to say C&amp;A seemed more like a western WITH aliens than a mix of two genres, which I'm pretty sure is how the filmmakers managed to pull off what they did. It didn't seem like a full fledged sci-fi flick until the climax. Still, lovers of both genres will not be disappointed. It's also great to see some thought put into the story than your usual mindless summer flick. Another thing that you might not expect from a film with a ridiculous title like this is that the characters are fleshed out enough to care for them. Even the supporting characters have their own little character arcs going on, and let me tell you, there are a lot of supporting characters. While that may sound bad, Favreau manages to balance them out really well.I also liked the action sequences as well. Seeing alien attacks mixed with old fashion western horse chases was refreshing and exhilarating to watch. The alien design itself reminded me of the creature in SUPER 8, so it wasn't really anything new but I didn't mind it. The soundtrack by Harry Gregson-Williams is refreshing, with a mix of western and modern, orchestral film scores.The success of the film also comes from the terrific cast. Daniel Craig continues to prove to be charming in any role he's in, and pulls off a convincing Southern accent. Even Harrison Ford is great in his role, who doesn't seem outdated at all. However, Olivia Wilde could have done more in her role. She seemed restricted and could have expand her performance a bit. I really liked seeing Sam Rockwell playing your average Joe with big dreams, similar to his character in MOON. Noah Ringer improved his ability to act when he was last seen in THE LAST AIRBENDER, but then again, he is a Texan at heart. As for Paul Dano, blink and you'll probably miss him, although he does provide some good laughs.Overall, C&amp;A is an entertaining romp. Unlike the premise suggests, the film is serious but is also genuinely funny when it needs to be. The cast is great and the action scenes are well done and not overdone, if I might add. While it's not as fantastic as Favreau's IRON MAN, it could have ended up a lot worse in the wrong hands. Give C&amp;A the benefit of the doubt, because it is a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Man Alienation: Should of, Could of, Didn't?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What should happen when James Bond, Indiana Jones/Han Solo and the hot chick from "Tron" stumble onto a movie set under Jon Favreau's ("Iron Man") direction? What about when cowboys collide with aliens in a film adaptation of Scott Mitchell Rosenberg's graphic novel "Cowboys and Aliens"? The answer is simple; Daniel Craig ("Casino Royale"), Harrison Ford ("Indiana Jones") and Olivia Wilde ("Tron: Legacy") should produce a movie that is nothing short of spectacular. However, Favreau's genre clashing flick "Cowboys and Aliens" is everything it shouldn't have been; monotonously bland. It begins in the year 1875 when a nameless man (Craig) wakes up from a dazed sleep with no memory. The mysteries of his past are closer than he thinks when he enters a small town called Absolution and gets in a scamper with renowned Colonel Dolarhyde's (Ford) son Percy (Paul Dano, "Knight and Day"). His goodwill is commended by a man named Doc (Sam Rockwell, "Iron Man 2") and a woman named Ella Swenson (Wilde). Colonel Dolarhyde hears of the commotion and hastily returns to the town. Enter a group of alien ships that take half the town hostage including the Colonel's son and Doc's wife. A search party forms to bring the town back together and the nameless man joins when he realizes he has a special weapon enabled to destroy the aliens. Worthwhile action is few and far between after the film's opening bid and once the film passes its halfway point not even Craig and Ford can save the film from abduction. The Good: Favreau abides by the most basic rule of filmmaking by creating an inaugural sequence making the film seem like it is worth the time of the viewer (the hook). If the rest of the movie to follow suit with heroic Daniel Craig action, everything would have be how it should have been. Needless to say, Craig brings his A-game alongside Harrison Ford's grouchy performance, who makes a one man show into a two-man show. Olivia Wilde subsequently turns this two-man show into a three-person show that avoids the typical Hollywood love story formula.How do you screw up a film about cowboys and aliens? First, create the most cliché action sequences that you can. Then, make the action repetitiously ordinary. Third, make the Native Americans in the film as stereotypically cheesy as possible. Lastly, do not put any effort into choosing a supporting cast. Instead try and cast as many useless, faceless characters as possible so the audience can be uninterested enough to nap while they are on screen. Oh and whatever you do, make sure to put more emphasis on a shoddy script instead of showcasing the badassness of Craig and Ford and the sexiness of Wilde."Cowboys and Aliens" was either going to be a nerd's perfect entertaining mindless blockbuster, or a work of audience alienation. With the later being true, stay home, turn on the fourth "Indiana Jones" followed by "Quantum of Solice" and feel infinitely more fulfilled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The problem is it messes with the idea of literary fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the movie was made by directors and actors that had the knowledge, skill and money to make a good movie. As an aside, I watched a movie on Mohammed Ali a few years ago that had a great life to make a movie about, and turned it into a boring 2 hours because they didn't know how to make a good movie.The guys making this movie know how to push audience buttons to make a good movie. The problem, it seems to me, is that this movie undermines the premise all readers, movie-goers, all those who choose to spend any time letting their minds enter a story, give the story teller: accepting the premise of the story or movie won't be abused. There will be enough sense or cohesion to make the investment in the literary fiction worth it.Spoiler alert This movie, to try to mix the genres, has to abuse the literary fiction to a degree that has the audience questioning the value of listening to stories. First, the only way an 1870's human can have a chance against technology advanced enough to get here from space is for an alien to leave its technology lying around in arm's length of a human.Then, to get the audience satisfying ending the film maker/story teller wants, the female heroine starts behaving more like a fairytale god mother than either a cowboy or alien. She comes back from the dead, got here by some kind of teleportation yet needs to walk around like us and needs the alien technology to be able to fight/destroy the aliens.This is a well made movie... except that it abuses the trust we place in good movie makers to not require the audience to ignore all reason and logic. In almost all literature we give the story teller a fiction or two.This one asks us to not just buy in to a literary fiction, but to really be mindless and or stupid movie goers.It would be like getting to the end of The Godfather and have someone sprout wings and fly off to get the plot where the movie maker wants it to go.This movie is neither fish nor foul and simply asks the audience to be dumb so two genres that don't fit together can be toyed with by the movie makers. It would have been just as satisfying to have Daffy Duck pop in at the end to save the day. There are reasons for genres. A large one is so the audience can trust where and how the story is going. Anything less than following certain "rules" and we are just watching random dots bouncing around on the screen without rhyme or reason. What mish/mash can I put together to keep you watching for 2 hours, say these film makers.Liked the acting. Loved a lot of the cinematography. Hated the way they ignored audience mindset, reasoning and story teller trust.I had just as soon have had Bugs Bunny convey the clichéd message of the movie: we all hang together or hang separately. At least anything he did I would have known was being done in the boundless arena of a cartoon character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I want that man! You give him to me now, or I'm gonna take him!" Plot: A man wakes up in the middle of the desert with a strange bracelet on his arm and no memory of who he is or what has landed him in this place. He makes his way to a nearby town where he learns he is a wanted man. Not long after, strange flying machines attack the town and begin to snatch up people left and right. After all of it is over the man, who's name is Jake teams up with a wealthy Civil War vet who's son was taken and a mysterious girl who believes she and Jake can help each other. With a gang of rag tag villagers and criminals, they set out to rescue the missing townspeople and uncover Jake's past. I can't, for the life of me understand why director Jon Favreau(Iron Man 1 &amp; 2, Elf), or any other sane person for that matter would choose to commit to such a terrible script. I have really enjoyed Favreau's other work until now. It also amazes me that Ron Howard and Steven Spielberg were actually involved in this as well. You'd think with their talent, they would have stepped in and gotten a better screenwriter to rewrite it. Writer Roberto Orci who also wrote last year's disastrous Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, is back at it again and this time doing even worse. There's no doubt in my mind that he'll win the Razzie award for worst screenplay for the second time in a row. The plot never really takes off and just lumbers along for the entire two hour run time, not to mention the laugh out loud terrible twist. Every Western and Sci-fi cliché in the book is in here somewhere. I didn't care for any of the cardboard characters. There were many times when I either shook my head or laughed at how horrible it was. Terrible writing aside, the acting isn't much better. It is painful to watch Harrison Ford, my childhood hero, mumble awful dialogue throughout the entire movie. I ask you Mr. Ford, where are my heroes? Where is the Indiana Jones and Han Solo who I looked up to? Where?! Another person I was disappointed in was Sam Rockwell. I loved him in Moon and Iron Man 2, but all he does in this is shoot off unfunny one liners. Paul Dano, who has a lot of talent wastes it here by playing an unconvincing spoiled brat. And lastly Noah Ringer. I have heard he was terrible in The Last Airbender and I assume he's no better in this. He's just annoying. The entire time I kept thinking; "Oh please just go back to the town so we don't have to hear your whining." OK but awful stuff aside, this movie isn't a complete failure. I didn't find Daniel Craig's acting to be that good nor bad. He was just OK. I have never enjoyed action movies that much but I was impressed with all of the thrilling and exciting action sequences, even if most of them are downright cheesy. Add the always beautiful Olivia Wilde to the mix and at least you have something to look at. I was also impressed with the aliens even though after the first time we see them, they aren't very frightening. They look like a cross between the Super 8 monster, the Kraken from the remake of Clash of the Titans, and a fish. But all in all, if you're just going to see it for the action, you may have a good time, but if you pay attention to the writing whatsoever, then you'll absolutely hate it. This isn't the worst movie of the year(Battle: Los Angeles takes that spot), but it's definitely in my top five. Extremely disappointing. Total Score: 3.5/10</fullReview>

Once it came out on DVD, I rented it. You'd think in the first place, that there would be some reason of making a movie about such an odd combination, because in the first place, no one likes that kind of combination...cowboys and aliens?Initially, "Cowboys and Aliens" sounded just like Cowboys and aliens fighting each other which was exactly what this movie was and nothing more. There was no plot or story, except for the typical clichés we've seen over a thousand times: Daniel Craig's character plays a cowboy who has amnesia...what? Seriously Jon Favreau? I love Jon Favreau as an actor and a director, but this movie was seriously a f***ing waste and a complete pile of horsesh**. Maybe I was being naive to think that, well there has to be some reason to put these two together, otherwise no one would be interested, so maybe these people (the film crew) have something to say about this movie. Maybe it will be a good movie. I was still thinking, why would someone want to make a film about cowboys and aliens together? The aliens just attack the humans, and invade the Earth basically, but for what? It's nearly disaster porn. Words can't describe how much I hate this movie eternally. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this. Jon Favreau thinks this is a good movie? There was no story. Seriously, if you think this movie is any good at all, then you're stupid.NEGATIVE 100 out of 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising Concept, Disappointing Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jon Favreau directing Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, what could go wrong? Plenty. The intent of "Cowboys and Aliens" was to mash up two B-movie genres, the western and the alien monster. The problem is that, unless the script brings some originality beyond the usual genre tropes, the result is just another B-movie. Lucas and Spielberg both showed how to pull off hommages right; "Cowboys and Aliens" fails on most counts. Character development is poor all around, with the most egregious being that of Ella Swenson. She carries a highly important plot thread in the movie, but is as disposable as any of the anonymous black hats dragged off their horses in the climactic battle. One should also remind movie makers that successful monsters have to be scary; and this is no longer possible just by creating hordes of big ugly CGI creatures. It might have been better to have fewer of them, but make them smarter, more unpredictable, and more alien. As it was, they seemed like like slow-witted oversized lions, dangerous but familiar. Maybe the comic book was better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can someone please tell me when exactly during this movie I was supposed to be impressed?I've been seriously concerned about the "new" generation of movie makers for a number of years now, and this non-movie merely proves my concerns. Did someone actually think this was going to be a blockbuster? I can't really think so, for I have been watching this on TV for the last hour and have absolutely no idea what it is suppose to be about. Sure, the title says it all, cowboys (sorta) and aliens (huh?), but this has no story to tie the dialog together. Who's who? I dunno...Why? I dunno...Is there a plot of any kind? Ummmmm, noooooooo...Is there action? Sometimes, but it has no meaning.OK, that's 9 lines, one more to go...My question is this...is Harrison Ford now so desperate as to take a role in a useless outing such as this just to make a few dollars????? Ugghhhh, I guess so! I mean, you have cowboys who lasso nothing...yet you have aliens lassoing townspeople from their zippy flying platforms. When we finally get a good look at the aliens, they are running around on all fours like a clan of drunken chimpanzees. And their space ship looks like someones bad imitation of steam punk.

		<fullReview>Checked out the movie "Cowboys &amp; Aliens," starring Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde. I actually wanted to see this movie in the movie theater and didn't get a chance to. My first thoughts when I saw the previews of this movie were "this looks cool." The concept of cowboys and aliens going head to head, to me, was a very cool concept. When you looked at the preview, you wasn't a hundred percent sure what to expect. I thought that was good too!Surprisingly, this movie isn't too far fetched. I felt like they did a good job of keeping the story feasible. This film is enjoyable. It was also different too. Even though it does have its common alien moments. Parts that you've seen before and you figure will happen, but all in all, a pretty good film.I loved Harrison Ford's character(Woodrow Dolarhyde). He was a classic rooting tooting cowboy leader you would predict to be in this type of film. You could feel the natural cowboy nature in him. He did a great job of acting. There's a part were he's talking to the little boy in the ship and he cracks a baby smile, classic.I'm giving this film an 8 out of 10. I would say this is DVD worthy. I borrowed my friends DVD, but eventually I will own this movie. If you son't feel like its DVD worthy. Definitely check it out on Netflix's or Redbox it. Solid film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had huge expectations for this movie. Legendary Harrison Ford, and guys guy Daniel Craig together in a blockbuster sci-fi western based on a graphic novel, had me just drooling to see this. There is a lot of really great things about the movie but when all is said and done it leaves you wanting so much more from it. Ford and Craig are good together, but Craig's character is a little too much brooding and not enough in your face action or depth. Ford is good in his role though and does the part perfectly. I don't know if I like Olivia Wilde or not...she was good on House...but then in something like this her character is a complete waste of space. She has no point at all to the story and she just looks silly in the film and her entire purpose is pointless. The supporting cast is also good with some decent performances by Sam Rockwell, Adam Beach and Keith Carradine. The special effects are stunning and it truly is a great concept for a movie that is actually sort of unique. Director Jon Favreau certainly knows action and he keeps the story going at a good pace. I suppose the only issue with the movie is that it never truly hits a climax, you're never truly 'wowed' by it and you want to be very badly. Still action sci-fi lovers should check it out and I would like to think they'd consider doing a sequel to try and bring out the best parts we all wanted to see but I don't think it did well enough to warrant a sequel. Still worth seeing for what it is. 7/10</fullReview>

The movie begins with Daniel Craig (being best known as James Bond) playing an outsider who wakes up with unexpected amnesia, with an alien device strapped to his wrist. Not knowing that aliens are invading the Old West, this outsider teams up with Harrison Ford (being best known as Indiana Jones) as a cattle rancher, and Olivia Wilde as a mysterious female accomplice, to help defeat these extra-terrestrials, and save their friends and family. The movie begins like you're in the middle of an entertaining adventure. Director Jon Favreau has done a terrific job of mixing these two classic genres, and he made it happen in such a cool way. The art direction, recreating the Old West, is beautifully "picturesque". The special effects showing the alien invasions are super breathtaking. But I really didn't like the way they portrayed the aliens, when they looked more like "District 9" aliens, instead of the classic "E.T." type of thing. I enjoy watching Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford play iconic roles, and the thought of watching them in a movie together is priceless. But neither of their performances were that special, but they do make the movie fun. Rounding up the supporting cast is newcomer Olivia Wilde, who is so beautiful to watch on screen with her incredible blue eyes. But she doesn't reveal any back-story to her character, it's like she has no personality. But she still does a pretty good job. Sure, this movie isn't an Oscar-worthy film, and it's not one of the best movies ever made, but it is a perfect popcorn movie. Anyways, if you are in the mood for a classic summer movie with cowboys, extra-terrestrials, pretty ladies, cool special effects, and beautiful landscapes, you will not be disappointed. "Cowboys and Aliens" is the perfect example of a classic popcorn summer flick. "Cowboys and Aliens", in my review, "a fun adventure, classic summer entertainment".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved it. Refreshing plot. Don't over analyse this story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found it a breathe of fresh air. A totally left field plot. And with a title like this I fully expected a spoof. What I got was a story, that while a bit vague on detail, made up for it with a concept I'd never seen before. I liked the setting. The time in our history was unique as well! I'd actually look forward to a sequel. Which for me is always a thumbs up right there! Cowboys and Aliens will never be award winning stuff. Its just a good watch. Although I do have one question of the producer: Why does alien blood always have to be green? And fluorescent green at that.. 8 Spicy Tomatoes from me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best part about the film is the actors performances, which really helped the feel of western culture. This film is defiantly worth watching with its many sub stories and few scares but I feel the film could of been a bit better when it came to consistency, for example how easily the aliens could be killed by arrows but other times bullets did not make them flinch. The film can start to drag in areas which nothing is happening, exaggerating relationships between each character making the film much longer than it needed to be. The film gives the audience a good mix of action scenes between human and aliens as well as humans with humans, most of which are very well done. I can end this review by saying any fans of aliens, history, action or good acting then watch this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cowboy and Indians + Super intelligent alien race without a tiny bit of intelligence = A lot of entertainment followed by a whole lot of stupidity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cowboys And Aliens is a science fiction/action movie about, as simply as it sounds and is, cowboys and aliens. Sure, there is a somewhat tragic story as well, but who cares. That is the formula they made it on, anyway. Unfortunately, but...There is one thing i never got about alien movies that are meant to be like big spectacles. How is it possible for a super intelligent alien species to be that stupid? I mean, supposedly they have this super advanced technology, but without surveillance cameras or anything of any kind that could warn them of danger approaching or help them spot the enemy. They don't even have any cloths. Not to mention that they act like dogs in battle. And that's an insult for the dogs. I mean, no strategy, no nothing. I'd expect something a bit more intelligent from someone who's supposed to be super intelligent. Dogs can at least sneak on you. I highly doubt it that anyone capable of thinking would just run out in the rain of bullets for some cowboys and Indians with no technology what-so-ever to shoot them. It's just stupid. Also, one would think that their ship will be highly equipped with all sorts of weapons and devices unknown to the man, but no. Instead, their ship looks like a cave or something. And i just can't buy it that they look like these giant monsters covered in saliva with no cloths of any kind and so on... And that's supposed to be the race that conquered a couple of planets on their way to earth. ... But that can't conquer a bunch of stupid cowboys and Indians even though they can take like ten bullets before they're killed. Yeah, right. I'm buying it.There is a whole lot of things about this movie that make no sense and that are just irritating and stupid, but where it does work, and works best, is entertainment. It's never boring or heavy to watch and the characters, even though seen a thousand times before, are more than bearable. I only wish they were funnier occasionally. And the acting is fine, too. Harrison Ford would be the star of the crew, but as far as acting alone goes, no one was above average.The one thing that is a bit disappointing and that shouldn't be are visuals. I just expected them to be better. Perhaps it's because of the terrible alien design, they look a lot more like demons than aliens, but they should've been better.The movie works well on purely entertaining level, but if you're looking for anything more, and i mean anything, don't expect to get it from this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why a huge wave of negativity surrounded this film when it was released because it's just a decent film.I was looking forward to watching it when I first heard about it and then "people" kept saying it was bad (i.e. "reviews") and I waited for the DVD.It doesn't matter that it's a western, it's nowhere near as bad as the weird "past and future combined" thing that "Priest" did.I didn't care about the lead female character even a little bit. She got more interesting later on though.The only issue with this film is that there is literally no emotional involvement with anyone.But I don't think anyone will watch this film for the story aspect, I think people will watch for the action and there's plenty of that.It's entertaining and worth watching.I would suggest though that this may have been better as a tongue-in-cheek film. Maybe some comedy would have made the film seem less preposterous? For example "Wild Wild West". I think "Cowboys and Aliens" tried to be too serious and this sucked some of the enjoyment out because people who want alien-action don't necessarily want serious western-drama.Oh and Daniel Craig plays James Bond. Not a bad thing but not a relateable character in this film.My vote: 7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good but a few too many questions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright I'll admit it, the only reason I actually bothered to watch this movie in the first place is because of Olivia Wilde, who I might say is the hottest and just plain sensual woman around. But I'm personally disappointed in her character. I was initially intrigued that her character was allowed to have a gun, and was rooting for it but I don't believe I saw her draw the gun more than 2 times if that. Which is kind of odd considering just how much of this movie was action scenes with plenty of opportunities.I'm interested by the fact that Ella was from another world, but I still want to know where she came from and how did she know that Earth was that next target for the big bad aliens, and how did she get there if her world was destroyed? I found the scene where she came back from the dead rather beautiful, the digital work of her body in the flames was amazing to watch. Which brings me to my main point, if she could come back from the dead when her body died and was burning in the flames what was to stop her from coming back to life after the big explosion? Bottom line I had a couple of questions left unanswered, but I really did enjoy this movie and for several different reasons. Love sci-fyi films and country films, and I was intrigued as to how they planned to work with two very different subjects. Anyways this was an awesome movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where a Western meets Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To put it simply this was not a bad movie. When we first heard of it we thought that the title suggested that it was going to be rubbish. Okay, it isn't a movie that one would put on the list of top literary movies of 2011, but it was a good and enjoyable movie nonetheless, especially if you are the type that that enjoys sci-fi movies.As can be seen from the title, this movie is a cross between a western and a sci-fi, though I am doubtful that fans of westerns would like this movie all that much. One has to be a specific type to enjoy cross themed movies, and usually with cross-themed movies it is the fan of one type that will like it above the fan of the other.The movie begins with the main character waking up in the desert with a strange device attached to his arm, and with no memory. As the movie progresses everything becomes revealed (but this is something that I will not do here). The movie then rolls out like your typical western. The nameless stranger arrives in town to find that there are a lot of problems. The town has run out of gold, the local rancher pretty much runs the place, and his son is a bully. Thus in steps in stranger to save the day. However, as tensions become high, out of the blue, a bunch of alien space craft arrive and start blowing things up and kidnapping people.This is when the main part of the movie begins. It ceases to be a western (to an extent) and becomes a sci-fi quest film as the heroes then travel across country to find out where the aliens came from and how they can rescue their loved ones. The movie then ends in typical western style with the nameless stranger riding off into the sunset (well, not quite) to continue his lonely journey across the country.As I said, I liked this film (even though I did see it in Berlin, it was in English and had no subtitles). It had twists and turns, and one wasn't sure how it was going to pan out. It would have been better if I had not known that it involved aliens, but, as with most movies, marketing is the key, and it probably would not have done all that well if the sci-fi buffs had thought it was a western (and thus not gone and seen it).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining and original movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really surprised for so much negative comments about this movie. Hey, there's cowboys and aliens. How you can suppose that it would be realistic? It's full of good actors and ambitious action. Perfect for time killing but it provides also very good movie-experience. Cowboys and Aliens is courageous test. It's something new and distinctive.A plot was okay, basic men-in-mission. However charterers were best in the movie. Craig played well his amnesied and traumatized cowboy-role. Harrison Ford was grumpy and bad-ass veteran-colonel (why colonel is most bad-ass military rank). Other crew was also very good, but sometime it felt that some of charterers were bit of pointless.Aliens were basic-looking CGI-insects. Scary and serious bad guys. There was real desperation and mind-blowing thrill in scenes when brave humans fought for their lives against demons. Movie made watcher feel same brooding ambiance as heroes on screen felt.Okay, how about action? It was awesome. Explosions, lots of them. Shoot-outs, many cool ways to kill aliens (Ford joists alien with wooden pole and then blows it's head out with his revolver, hell yeah!) and especially Craig vs. aliens in the big ship was extremely bad-ass.After action best thing in this movie, I think, was Craigs lost memory and his flashbacks. I can just imagine how horrible it is, get tortured by monsters, escape barely living from tunnels of nightmares... It was just shocking. Okay, I don't look much horror movies, so others would not see that so scary.For quick overview, movie were underrated but very original movie with good actors and awesome action scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrison Ford against aliens! That's just "Wow"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title seemed so silly that when watching the trailer I could not take this film seriously. But do you know what's strange? "Cowboys and Aliens" has everything a good western flick should have: shoot-outs, duels, bar fight, horse-riding, use of lasso, revolvers, gold, use of slang, natives (and their unique language), a sheriff, the good (Daniel Craig), the bad (Harrison Ford, well, he becomes the good later), and the ugly (large, dark-skinned aliens with claws and high- tech equipment).And as all the above-mentioned elements are adequately mixed this film cannot really be that bad... oh, I almost forgot the mention the lady element (played by Olivia Wilde) and of course the romance between her and the good guy. "Cowboys and Aliens" is a 2-hour long film where a good western meets a good sci-fi. At first, you don't want to believe it is possible to get close to it, later, you'll realise you crave after more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining mash-up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is a great title for a movie. It reminds me of "Snakes On A Plane". In each case, you get what it says on the tin. With "Snakes", the tension was leavened with lots of laughs. By contrast, "C&amp;A" takes itself very seriously - but it works. It succeeds because of a half-decent plot and some fine acting coupled with great scenery, reasonable special effects, and sustained action. The strongest part of the work is the opening pre-credit sequence, while the weakest is the final (unnecessary) scene but, in between, there's entertainment aplenty. Director Jon Favereau ("Iron Man") had crafted a mash-up which is quite a treat.Set in Arizona (but filmed in New Mexico), the story is located in 1873 - which suggests that Roswell was not the first time aliens have visited the United States - and the folks of the desert town of Absolution don't seem overly surprised by the ferocious attacks from the sky but I guess that the wild west toughened up its settlers to expect anything from indians to aliens. As with the other summer 2011 alien adventure "Super 8", it seems that the visitors from outer space want our bodies and our metal, although you'd think that such advanced life forms would have cracked the potential of nanotechnology and not need anything.The revelation in this movie is Daniel Craig. I've never thought of him as a mean gunslinger but he's terrific here. Since his first major film "Layer Cake", his charisma has grown and grown. For once, Harrison Ford acts the grizzled bad guy in an effort to play against type, as Henry Fonda did in "Once Upon A Time In The West", although he turns out to have much more heart that Fonda's character. In almost all westerns ("The Quick And The Dead" was an exception) and virtually all sci-fi movies (the "Alien" series was a wonderful exception), female characters are either absent or bit players. Here Olivia Wilde - who has amazing eyes - has a role which is a little more than love interest but still underwritten.A pleasant change from all the sequels and prequels - so please: leave it there; the world does not need "Cowboys &amp; Aliens &amp; Cops".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted so much to really like this flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jon Favreau is such a great director. He's got a really delicate touch at getting the action/comedy balance just right. He proved that with the Iron Man things. And his comedy/action stuff seems to be pretty good, too -- take a look at Zathura. With a track record like that I expected Cowboys and Aliens to be a real smash.Uh, oh. How the mighty have fallen.It's not that the film is bad; it's well made, well acted, directed, produced, post-produced, everything. It's just that this time Favreau got the balance way off. C&amp;A takes itself just a little too seriously while not presenting a very good Bad Guy in the form of the aliens.Okay, there are plenty of technical suspension-of-disbelief "issues" that one might point to, such as the wrist weapon that the alien technician leaves lying within reach of a subject, or that the weapon happens to perfectly fit a human wrist, or that it reacts to and even targets craft belonging to the people who made it in the first place...it goes on forever. The technical stuff can be ignored if you are having enough fun.But my real problem with this flick is that the Bad Guys are simply too easy to deal with. The cowboys, with their 1880's weapons, were able to take on and defeat the aliens, who had spacecraft capable of interstellar flight and energy weapons that used holographic targeting systems. The aliens couldn't even detect the cowboys on the ground when they flew right over them. Oy.Had Favreau managed to throw in some funny fight sequences or other conspicuous humor he might have saved this thing. As it is I'll see it on late night TV reruns, but I won't spring the $10 for a DVD when it gets to the bargain bin at Target.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The classic western genre is re-imagined in this tale of inter galactic marauders who attack a small mid west town.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The prospect of Cowboys fighting marauders from beyond the stars is most definitely an intriguing one and with an excellent cast the movie tells the tale of a small Arizona town and its inhabitants who are attacked by alien beings from another planet. All that stands in their way are a posse of cowboys and Native Americans led by an amnesiac wanted man Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) and civil war veteran Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). But seriously out-manned and out-gunned by technology far beyond the 1873 period can this band of infighting misfits really overcome the insurmountable odds laid before them? This movie promised much and despite the jokes about the title relating to U.S. foreign policy on immigration the movie was entertaining. There are plenty of references to the western genre the slightly bigoted army veteran Colonel Dolarhyde is vaguely reminiscent of John Wayne's Ethan Edwards from the Searchers. Jake Lonergan the anti hero with an ugly violent past is definitely a nod to movies like The Outlaw Josey Wales or Pale Rider. They even have a Doc turned bar owner played by Sam Rockwell. The action and special effects are impressive enough with the aliens akin to primates crossbred with the aliens from Independence Day.This is yet another comic book adaptation and break from the norm for everyone involved including the director who has left the rewarding plaudits from the Iron Man franchise to direct this science fiction hybrid. There is plenty to like about this movie and although entertaining there is something missing, perhaps it's the casting of Colonel Dolarhyde Harrison Ford who never really quite conveys the slightly brutish bigot with a strong dislike for authority other than his own and a with a penchant for corruption. Or maybe it's the portrayal of Jake Lonergan who just doesn't ever strike me as gritty and grubby enough to be a man of disrepute and out for his own ends. I get the impression that Jon Favreau is a western fan and has crammed the movie full of cultural references to this classic genre and then thrown in some aliens which momentarily replace the usual suspects the native Americans. The movie isn't going to rewrite history I suppose but it would have been nice to have gotten a perspective from the Native Americans but that is no doubt a whimsical fantasy of my own. This movie struggled against the Smurfs in the U.S. which doesn't bode well and with an already packed blockbuster season this may not fare as well as some of the other movies we've been treated to over the season. This movie is a welcome distraction with an interesting take on two over used genres but may have probably benefited from a slightly earlier release as it will now have to contend with the more superior Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Cowboys and Aliens is in cinemas from 17th August and receives a 2 ? out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It delivers what it promises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it was first announced there was a lot of hype towards Cowboys and Aliens: a simple high concept film with a wide range of talent behind it, Jon Favreau in the director's chair, Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer producing and Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford starring.A man (Craig) wakes up in the middle of the desert with no memories about who he is or how he got there and has a strange bracelet around his left wrist. After beating up some thugs he goes to the town of Absolution and he discovers he is Jake Lonergan, a wanted outlaw who had robbed the powerful Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford), who wants Lonergan. But when the aliens attack the town and abduct a number of the civilians, a posse to hunt the aliens and unite different people to fight, whilst Jake must discover his past and what is the real goal of the mysterious Ella (Olivia Wilde).Since directing the Iron Man films Favreau has certainly able to direct action sequences and handle special effects. Cowboys and Aliens delivers on that front and it great blockbuster fun. For a man who is known for have a light touch to directing, Cowboys and Aliens is a very serious film: it is set in a dirty, gritty version of the Old West, it is not a fantasy world like in Back to the Future III. The filmmakers approach is how would a town in the Wild West react to a mystery force. The aliens themselves look a little bit like the Prawns from District 9, particularly how they move. It has been criticised for being too dark, but I still found it to be fun, action packed, with a few little moments for good measure. It was a fast paced homage to classic Westerns with a sci-fi twist. Cowboys and Aliens also sets out to show the different factors, lawman, outlaws and Native Americans, all traditional enemies uniting against a greater threat.Acting wise Craig is a strong, stoic character who has is a man of few words. Because of his role as James Bond he is assured as an action performer and his amnesia is he is very much like Jason Bourne, a little ironic really. Ford has turned into a grumpy, grizzly senior citizen and be was believable as a man who is willing to use violence but having a softer side as well. Olivia Wilde does have a unique look and a bit of a mysterious quality to her: she was not the best performer, but she gave it a go. Noah Ringer on the other hand is still wooden and it will be remarkable to he keeps getting film roles. Much of the supporting cast is solid in what is a pure summer blockbuster.Cowboys and Aliens is not perfect. There are some goofy moments like the Apache scene and problems involving the Ella character. But it is still entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the title sounds novel and inventive, the movie is no more than a huge smorgasbord of all-too-familiar cinematic ingredients, which Ebert probably did the best job among critics in listing. There is not much point in critiquing plot logics. It is very much a case of "take it or leave it", and the fact that you have purchased an admission ticket betrays your intention of probably to take it. In any event, most of the mysteries that may get in the way of your really enjoying the movie are resolved sufficiently.All kinds of earth people putting their difference aside and uniting to resist aliens is so heart-warming. The aliens here are introduced in a way very similar to that in "Super 8" (although in that one there's only one alien) ? scary sneaky previews first, followed by an eventual full revelation of the hideous form. Here again Ebert gets full marks for his witty depiction: resembling a fusion of gorillas and lobsters.The star-power could be considered a little wasted in such a frivolous undertaking but then again what's wrong with their having a bit of fun to go along with a pay check. Daniel Graig, just as in his version of rough Agent 007, is equally good in his version of a rough cowboy. Harrison Ford's character, set up initially with fiery expectations, turns out to be adorably mild. Olivia Wilde is mostly eye candy, but eye candy of the first order. Not quite recognizable under his moustache, Sam Rockwell fills a useful support role. Paul Dano (best remembered from "Little Miss Sunshine") with his small role at the beginning manages to steal some scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well directed genre mash-up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cowboys &amp; Aliens better than what the name suggests and when you replace the &amp; with Vs you basically have the plot of the movie. Although that is a rather simple summary because included in the mix are Apaches, a faithful fear sensing dog, a young whippersnapper, a symbolic hummingbird, a magic bracelet and a beautiful young woman who actually looks like she could the product of a cowboy-alien! I praise Jon Favreau for an ambitious story, of trying to bring the western into the 21st century and trying to appeal to a mass audience of young and old. Considering all this, he hasn't actually done a bad job and the film is, in a word, good. This is because when attempting to cross genres like this it is always such a difficult task, the audience are usually not so keen and often unsure of how to react with such unfamiliar categories much like, but to a lesser degree, comedy horrors. Here, the film is balanced in that respect and made to feel quite plausible that in 1873, modern aliens in spacecrafts can battle against the bow and arrows of Indians and the pistols and whips of cowboys.All the mis-en-scene is thoroughly thought out and the aliens / spacecrafts wouldn't be out of place in one of Jon Favreau's Iron Man movies they are that nicely designed. The cast has been well chosen and the acting from just about everyone is solid.One problem I have is, the aliens are made to be not as intelligent as humans yet if this where the case, the humans in this movie would be flying around in aircrafts and modern technology not the aliens so that is a little disappointing. Another problem with this film is I believe, had it entirely been a cowboy western it probably would have been a far better film. I found the best aspects throughout were actually the 'cowboy' moments and that the opening scene was full of suspense and tension, more so then when the aliens arrived. On the other hand, it's also quite possible that had it totally been a sci-fi alien film that would have been far more appealing and interesting for many.As we have it, the western is a dying genre for mass audience attendance and so we have been given this mix up. Cowboys and Aliens are a non-alcoholic cocktail if you will, nice, refreshing but lack of punch. An enjoyable movie that I guess families will be the ones who will benefit mostly from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cowboys and Aliens loose the fight to over-hyped publicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to blending two different film genres for a movie, it takes a lot of hard work and careful balance in order to satisfy the audience with each thrilling side. There are definitely examples out there that show two genres not dominating over each other such as Aliens, Rango, Zombieland, Blazing Saddles, and The Incredibles. Aliens succeeded in inserting a horror element with a cool Sci-Fi story that practically has you on the edge of your seat with terror. The Incredibles, well, what can I say more than a great animated movie with a great blend of superhero mayhem that you wished was a comic book. This year's cross-genre movie, Cowboys and Aliens, unfortunately, doesn't make this list for it just stuck to a very conventional and clichéd western formula and the back-story to Olivia Wilde's character that didn't get any development once it surfaced.The movie centers around wanted criminal Jake Lonergan played by Daniel Craig (Casino Royale), during the 1870's in the wild west, who wakes up in the middle of the desert one day and has no recollection of who he is and why he has this strange, alien bracelet strapped to his wrist. After confronting three cowboys that results in Lonergan introducing them to their maker, he rides into a nearby town and is very quickly recognized by the town sheriff and two henchmen that work for cattle boss Woodrow Dolarhyde played by Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones Quadrilogy). Dolarhyde, who apparently has some beef with Lonergan, rides into town to stop the sheriff from taking Lonergan to the hangman's noose. That night during the confrontation, these peculiar and strange lights appear a few yards from the town that, once completely over the town, start attacking the town's folk, blowing up the buildings, and then start to snatch people left and right including Dolarhyde's son. Lonergan shoots an approaching ship, with his alien bracelet, that crashes and releases a wounded alien into the dark, desert plain. Discovering its tracks, Dolarhyde, Lonergan, and few others begin their chase to catch up to the creature and find out why these beings are here and what they want. In the group, a mysterious woman named Ella played by Olivia Wilde (TRON: Legacy), who may have the key to Lonergan's past and identity.After the experience of watching Iron Man and Iron Man 2, John Favreau, as a director, can really deliver in spectacle and action. I was going in thinking that Favreau's going to create a bad-ass and maybe some what of a ballsy western. I was deeply disappointed and unimpressed by Favreau's conventional and clichéd western. It had nothing to offer than what we've already seen for countless of other westerns. Craig's character is the stranger with no name and has a mysterious and dangerous past. Harrison plays the gruff and tough bully that nobody messes with because without him the town would be left in the dust. The film even brought the old' theme of what it takes to be a man between Dolarhyde and the sheriff's grandson, now I wouldn't mind that if they didn't go about the most boring way and in the end it was just pointless.I was constantly back 'n forth with the purpose of Olivia Wilde and the instant stop of her character's development. In the beginning of the film, she's set up as the key to Lonergan's unknown past for a couple a scenes and then in the middle the audience finds out that she has a connection with the aliens. I have to give credit to Favreau for giving Wilde some back-story at first, no matter how silly and sudden it was. I was being forgiving, but then all of sudden, the movie stopped with her story and made her Mrs. Exposition for the motives of the aliens throughout the rest of the movie.Now matter how much I'm ragging on this movie, I did have a fun time and there are some redeeming qualities. The chemistry between Craig and Harrison was great and they had a lot of funny moments together. I was freaking in love with the design with the aliens and the C.G.I. for them and the alien space crafts looked more convincing than they did in the trailers. Favreau's camera-work with the landscape and the action sequences made it really stylish, in a way.Is Cowboys and Aliens John Favreau's best work? No, Iron Man is. I do believe that he made a really fun cross-genre movie that has it's moments that are really bad-ass and really funny. This is perfect for a rental during date night, but if you see this at a matinée it definitely won't kill ya. I give Cowboys and Aliens a high rental or two out of four popcorn bags.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Move over Clint Eastwood - DANIEL CRAIG is the new Cowboy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was really good. I liked the way it was made. The director had all the necessary elements of a movie: Beginning, middle and end. I was pleased with the way Daniel Craig embraced the role of a cowboy. He had a lot of confidence and was literally perfect as the cowboy. I was amazed how well he dealt with all of the people who were mean to him. One of the things I liked was when he was confronted by the mean outlaws at the beginning. He was such a good fighter for somebody who did not remember who he was. I was hoping that there would have been more scenes like that. Harrison Ford was in OK form and had quite an amazing accent. I liked it when he yelled at his son who, by the way, was a total jerk! I think that son is the same jerk from There Will Be Blood. Whoever that actor is - he is perfect for playing a guy you hate. As for the aliens, well they were pretty gross and resembled fish in a way. If there was really a way between the Cowboys and the Aliens there is no way that the Cowboys would win in real life. I give this movie two alien thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cowboys &amp; Aliens"A Movie ReviewByNick Iacobucci "Independence Day" meets "Tombstone" in this big budget summer popcorn movie. Hello there everyone I'm movie critic Nick Iacobucci as always for ReelScreenReviews.com and our next movie review is the adventure "Cowboys &amp; Aliens". This special effects western fantasy, 4 words I thought I'd never say in a row, opened in the middle of the summer movie season on Friday July 29th, 2011, and it stars Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Olivia Wilde, Sam Rockwell, Walton Goggins, and Clancy Brown. "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" comes to us from the very versatile and talented writer/producer/actor/director Jon Favreau, writer and star of "Swingers" with Vince Vaughn, and the director of "Elf", "Zathura", and the "Ironman" movies. This time out he combines a good old fashioned western with the high tech effects of Hollywood, in an attempt to turn out something as fun and entertaining as Robert Downey Jr. in a suit of armor.This tale tells us of the town of Absolution in the Arizona Territory circa 1873. Daniel Craig stars as a secretive cowboy suffering from amnesia that stumbles into this rough town known for its fair share of trouble. Harrison Ford's Colonel Dolarhyde seems to rule this town of Absolution with a very tight grip, and he doesn't like strangers and neither do the townspeople. They must however learn to put their differences aside when unidentified and mysterious crafts begin to invade our world, and they haven't come to make nice. As the tale progresses not only will our hero begin to recall who he is, that seems to be directly related with how these creatures can be bested. Now adding to the mystery and fun is Ella portrayed by Olivia Wilde, and she too brings adventure to a tale that builds and builds to a climax that will see all involved standing together against 1 common nemesis.Well people this film is better than average and it is better than average for 1 main reason, and that would be the natural intensity of lead Daniel Craig. His eyes and his stare seem to pierce right through you, and I couldn't believe how much he reminded me of the great Yul Brenner. In the cowboy hat he even kind of resembled him from "The Magnificent Seven". Daniel Craig so radiates the strong and silent type and it really seems to me that the less the man says, the more he gets his point across.Also Harrison Ford picks up right where he left off in the wonderful "Morning Glory" once again bringing a mean, grumpy, and difficult personality to the big screen. Even though his Col. Dolarhyde isn't very nice, what is nice is seeing him still actively challenge himself as an actor instead playing the same old part again and again. Then Olivia Wilde is not only one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, I have always thought her to be much more than a pretty face. Now unfortunately I think that she was only in the film to have a female character in there, but with her, Sam Rockwell, Keith Carradine, and a slew of quality talent in front of the camera?well that didn't hurt this film in any way.Why not the old west? No reason. Aliens could just as easily attack present day as 13th century England or France, or even the caveman era for that matter. One of the better compliments that I can pay "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is that it is completely original. The first half completely feels like a true and authentic western, and then when the aliens show up the action and effects seem to accompany the movie without so much as the blink of an eye. Then director Jon Favreau stepped up the drama and seriousness from the 2 previous "Ironman" films. The movie I thought was graphic in spots for a PG-13 feature, and not only did I really think he was restraining the violence in the first place; many of the film's characters meet their demise of the tale progresses.The only part of the movie that feels like a retread is the same overlooked back story of these aliens that are here for no other reason than to soak up our planet's natural resources. Also, you know the "Us Against Them" theory will come into play right after all of the differences are cast aside so that we can stand together as one to fight.At just shy of 2 hours "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" isn't a great film, but it is one of the more fun times that I have had watching a movie this summer. I could've used a little more of the alien background among other things, however the first time that I looked at my watch there was only about 15 minutes left in the feature?and that is always a good sign. In the end I think that the scenes with Daniel Craig are worth the price of admission alone.The effects are good, the story is original, and the movie is entertaining.A generous?.3 stars out of 4.And thank you for your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cowboys, Aliens, and Rounding Up the All Important Buck-e-roo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is mildly recommended.The western genre has bit the dust. Yes, it's true that, once in a great while, I reckon, there is a resurgence of these old fashion oaters ( the remakes of 3:10 to Yuma, True Grit, Open Range, The Proposition, even the recent parody, Rango ), but like that classic Shane, the western has quietly rode into the sunset. Yet other genres are very much alive and still popular. Sci-fi films are thriving with today's movie-going public. So it seems reasonable, and far from foolhardy, that a hybrid like Cowboys and Aliens has landed to your local cineplex. Its demographic audience spans generations and can peak the interest of youngsters and seniors alike. However what is surprising about this mash-up is that this film is less than surprising. It is strangely predictable and somewhat lifeless. Yes, it still entertains and is diverting, but I truly expected some amusing tongue-in cheek humor and much more excitement and thrills from my big budget blockbusters.Cowboys and Aliens is a rather flat but straightforward retelling of countless westerns, but this time, the aliens have replaced the Injuns as the adversaries. Of course, many of this genre stereotypes live on: the lone gunman, the beautiful strong cowgirl, the mean land baron, his sniveling bratty son, the weak pacifist barkeep, the young awe-struck boy. They're all there in the Old Wild West. It's still a wild and dangerous place, but this particular adventure is not very wild, just very old.Fortunately the cast performs their roles well. Daniel Craig fills out his chaps rather nicely, and the cast of seasoned character actors like Sam Rockwell, Keith Carradine, Paul Dano, Adam Beach, and Clancy Brown provide ample support. Olivia Wilde is the female with the gun and grit, and she does as much as can be done in her underwritten role, looking rather babe-o-licious with her modern Vanity Fair posturing and riding well on her horsey. Harrison Ford, speaking in a lower register to reinforce his mean side, still has his swagger and a well worn look about him.Even the aliens have a well worn appearance about them too, but they have a serious identity crisis in their their form and function. They suffer in comparison with more inventive and original creatures from other films, lacking originality and looking like monsters previously seen in Robocop, Aliens, and the recent Super 8 film to name few.The first half hour is mostly the cowboy thing, which I must confess is not my favorite genre. I much prefer the sci-fi fantasy and waited impatiently for that portion to kick in. Once the aliens invade the town, it's us against them with numerous fights with some cheesy special effects and other encounters of the third rate kind. As the film progressed, even the kinda cool alien lassoing of its town-folks became rather monotonous to me after that overused novelty worn off. Still, Cowboys and Aliens is effectively directed by Jon Favreau and some of his moments with the aliens involving the young boy showed much promise and built some needed suspense. But it's the film's lame script that finally disappoints and rarely delivers the adrenaline rush with either its cowboys or its aliens. In this case, opposites don't attract. GRADE: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is FUN! If your looking for an epic grounded story then you won't find it here. You also won't find new CG and tech like in ride of the apes. But what you will find is a fun story with great action. That isn't to say that this film doesn't deliver great sound and CG, the bar has been raised a long time ago and watching CG made real life is common place. Crag delivers a great cowboy character who won't make you think Bond along the way. Ford also delivers well and plays his part perfect as many expect him to do. I truly enjoyed this movie from start to end.If you want to forget the world for a while and simply enjoy a good story that is delivered in a great manner then see this film. You will not be disappointed so long as you take it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a title like that, it would be difficult to take the movie seriously no matter how hard Jon Favreau tries to portray that it means business. However, this blend of two distinct but popular genres does justice to both sides while dishing out all ingredients for a fun summer movie. Indiana Jones meets Independence Day on horses and that will be the main draw if you didn't figure that out from the title. In 19th century New Mexico, Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) wakes up to the memory loss about his own past and to the huge metal bracelet affixed to his hand. Jake stumbles onto the small town of Absolution where strangers are rare and control is directed by the local cattle rancher, Col. Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). Jake's cold, brutal, totally western character lends a crushing blow to Dolarhyde's spoilt son, Percy, who is apprehended for his misdeeds in town. Jake realizes that he is a wanted criminal and before he could knock the entire sheriff department down, he is nabbed and taken into custody. The other-worldly beauty Ella (Olivia Wilde) knows something about Jake's past but remains mysterious. As the Sheriff prepares to transport the prisoners out of Absolution, the Colonel arrives with his gang to rescue his son and as the tension builds up in the center of the town, a light flashes in the sky....'Cowboys &amp; Aliens' boasts of all the traits that are inherent to both genres of movies. A stranger ending up in a small desert town that is controlled by one local bad-guy who means business when he has a gun in his hand, a few outlaws who always have a good heart, a band of Native tribes willing to fight for a common cause and an alien race that captures humans for further study while they secretly exploit our planet's rich resource for their own good. Action and explosions are frequent and most of the time, quite entertaining. The visual that has spaceships firing plasma guns on targets that race through the spectacular landscape on horse-back is indeed, an enticing proposition. There are no buildings to blow up here and no fighter planes to defend with. That very fact, makes this movie enjoyable for what it is. However, Favreau and his ensemble of script-writers fail to revamp the familiar alien invasion saga and maintain the regular faire, albeit, involving gold digging this time. What's next? Oil exploration by Vogons?Daniel Craig starts off very well with is cold, brutal self that we saw in 'Quantum of Solace' and it's fun to watch him lend a crushing blow upon his adversaries while he maintains the chiseled, straight face. With the powerful weapon strapped on his hand, he seems more credible as the strike-force against the aliens than any boy (Shia LaBeouf) would in such situations. As Jake recovers his memory, we see him even stronger than before and he makes his mental clarity reflect upon his body language. Harrison Ford is exemplary when he plays the bad Colonel around town and also when he plays a father figure to those in his influence. Olivia Wilde's ethereal beauty serves her character whose background is as vague as she is. Following the footsteps of Angelina and Megan, she could well be the next Action girl. Favreau lends some humor amidst the seriousness but rarely gives a breather from the crossfire. The script writers also failed to exploit the relationship between Jake and the Colonel since their confrontations were among the highlights of the film. For any film-maker, portraying aliens differently will always be a challenge especially following 'District 9'. One can only change their setting and that's precisely what Favreau chose over the destruction of yet another American city.Cowboys &amp; Aliens provide the summer entertainment but disappoint those who came for a Jon Favreau film starring Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig. These are all big names and even though the action and concept strike the entertainment cord, they are unable to overcome any apathy towards the outcome of this fight. Even so, for a summer movie, the film lives up to its expectations and delivers its share of explosions on screen this year. Favreau's idea was simple - No matter what genre you're drawn to, if the title interests you, then the film will too.- 7.663 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cowboys, Aliens and Indians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the Iron Man movies, Jon Favreau is now something of a fan favorite. Taking from the graphic novel of the same name, Steven Spielberg along with several other have produced one of the best movies of this year. This is solid story telling in a different kind of movie one doesn't see that often. Harrison Ford reenters the action genre as the Colonel of a scared town that gets invaded by Aliens in which several family members are whisked away via cables from the mini space crafts. Jon Favreau perfectly blends the Western and Sci-Fi genre's to the point that one never overshadows the other, but are merged well. The acting is excellent including a very cool headed, yet violent Craig who has amnesia and can't remember much. Olivia Wilde's character has a confusing background and the script never delves into it, so you sort of have to make do. The aliens are another interesting aspect. In today's Hollywood, aliens and or predators are not the most original designed beings in movies. Movies also have the tendency to wait till the end of a movie to show the audience what the creatures look like and normally not in the best of lighting. Here, we are introduced to one quite early and we see them very clearly throughout. I thought they had a cool design and were fun to watch as they battled both cowboys and Indians. The SFX and VFX were also very cool and fun to watch while not overshadowing the real elements of this story. This movies packs quite a punch and should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Western 8 Aliens 6 = 7</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Standard western elements mashed with a standard alien invasion story. In this story, set in the old west, the Aliens take the part usually played by the Indians. The Aliens shoot, burn, and take hostages all with a certain Alien penuche. That leaves the Indians to join forces with the cowboys.Good performances. Harrison Ford is such an icon, forget his character, it's hard to get past seeing Harrison Ford. What made his son the slightest bit likable or deserving of that end reward? The mistake Aliens tend to make is not to look like Olivia Wilde who accomplishes things with a kiss. There's some confusion about exactly what kind of experiments the aliens are doing on their human captives. Outstanding sound. Great locations. Destruction of the alien ship resembled the Challenger disaster.Overlook the flaws. It's a summer action movie that delivers. A wild thrill ride that leaves you exhausted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Got what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a cowboy movie with aliens thrown in for fun. I recognized all the plot lines and thoroughly enjoyed some mindless cinema entertainment. Didn't expect an indie film or a classic. Clearly not a John Ford production. Really enjoyed the corporate cinema as it had true stadium seating and super-great sound that made your seat shake. If I'd had french fries and a chocolate shake it would have been perfect. I first experienced stadium seating in LA near that mall with 350 stores and this is the first theatre in Ohio that measured up to that one. Our local cinema has so-so stadium seating but they insist on showing frothy Hollywood trash that numbs the brain. Every time a decent movie shows up they put it on one of the small screens that aren't stadium equipped.</fullReview>

It's not supposed to be The Godfather or The Shawshank redemption. It's intended to be exaggerated, like Machete, if you want, minus the gore. Craig is plain badass, as usual. It's not meant to be serious, as the title screams out loud, and as you can see with the actors and the use of cinematography. It's meant to be COOL &amp; BADASS &amp; GOOD LOOKING and that's about it. I expect that those who hated this movie will be the same that whined about the exaggerated blood in Kill Bill 1.

		<shortDescription>Exactly what the title suggests</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the name suggests, when you go to see this you are going to get plenty of cowboy action and plenty of alien action. I mention this because, although the movie is not perfect, it is very enjoyable if you are looking for a good combo of old west meets sci fi action. Its good, its fast paced, its exciting, its entertaining, but it does get a bit silly at times. By all means, don't let that stop you from going and enjoying the spectacle that Favreau has created. I enjoyed the first part of the movie better than the rest. The old west portion of the movie was done very well. Craig plays a great cowboy character, almost as iconic as Josey Wales himself. All the cowboy stuff is spot on, complete with good gun slinger action and a cool saloon fight. Craig's tight-lipped cowboy draws you in and makes you want to be him. When the aliens come along, the movie gets a bit silly. But I didn't mind so much. I love action packed westerns and I love sci fi movies, and this one brings the two together pretty well. Still, though, I felt like the aliens were a bit weak. I guess maybe they lacked development. They were not well explained or well motivated, and it was a bit silly that they could be so easily defeated by men on horse back. If you think about it, could a band of cowboys on horseback stand a chance against the modern American military, complete with jets and stealth bombers and such? No, of course not. But then, that is why you shouldn't think about that. No, don't think about that. Don't question it. The fact is, the special effects are really cool, the action is fast paced, the characters are cool, and the movie is a lot of fun and I am glad that I watched it. And I think you will be glad, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun summer popcorn movie if you can suspend disbelief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fun, suspenseful summer "popcorn" movie, but strictly make-believe. You have to be able to turn off the analytical/logical part of your brain to enjoy it. If you can do that, this is an enjoyable movie in the "guilty pleasure" category.It's an original premise: take a western movie, your basic evil cattle baron (Colonel Dolarhyde, played by Harrison Ford) who owns the town vs. "lone wolf" gun-slinger (Jake Lonergan, played by Daniel Craig), and mix in an invasion of aliens to shake the genre up.Harrison Ford makes a fun bad guy, especially a bad guy who is ultimately redeemable. Daniel Craig is the strong, silent type of gun-slinger (possibly so he doesn't have to deal with his native British accent?), charismatic and riveting. These two guys together in one movie is just plain fun.Olivia Wilde, who plays "Thirteen" on the Hugh Laurie series "House," has a pivotal role, and she's on screen as much as Ford and Craig are. She plays Ella Swenson, who is apparently a commercial woman of ill repute (don't call her the word that rhymes with "door" in Lonergan's hearing!), and she's up to the task of carrying her part of this movie, a very important part.The movie starts out with Lonergan waking in the middle of nowhere in the desert, wounded in his side and with an apparent loss of memory. One thing you can count on in a Hollywood western: if there's someone injured out in the middle of nowhere, with a population density of about 1 person per 1000 square miles, someone will come riding along and will find them. The finders are a group of bad guys, who set out to rob and kill Lonergan. This triggers his "physical memory" and he out-fights and out-guns them, killing them all and acquiring a horse, clothes and a gun, as well as the conclusion that although he can't remember who he is, he shouldn't be messed with.He also has a weird bracelet-thingy on his wrist. He doesn't know what it is, or how he got it, and he can't get it off. He tables the issue for later contemplation.So he rides into the nearest town. (How does he know which way to go? Towns are hundreds of miles apart in this part of the country at that time. No road signs. No GPS. No service stations to ask your way.) This town, it develops, is "owned" by a Colonel Dolarhyde, whose ne'er-do-well wastrel of a son, Percy, played by Paul Dano, is shooting up the town out of boredom, winging a deputy sheriff in the process. The sheriff (reluctantly) arrests young Percy, who sneers at him and tells the sheriff that when daddy finds out what's happened, daddy is gonna make the sheriff very sorry. Bad Percy!The sheriff, having a picture of Longeran on a "Wanted" poster, also (reluctantly) arrests Longeran, who now knows his name and why he's someone who shouldn't be messed with, but still doesn't know how he got into the middle of nowhere with a wound on the side, the very strange hardware around his wrist, and the loss of memory. This sets up the rest of the movie: Lonergan and young Percy Dolarhyde are both set to be shipped off to a US Marshal who can take over their imprisonment. As the sheriff is loading Lonergan and young Dolarhyde into the lock-up wagon, the elder Dolarhyde comes riding into town to free his son. This is the device used to get all the main characters into one place outside at the same time so the aliens can come and engage them in a fight. And what a fight! Alien fighter craft blowing things to smithereens and grabbing people off the street with long cables, yanking them away to...what? We don't know. But young Percy is taken, several of the townspeople are taken, and a rescue mission must be mounted.I don't want to spoil the movie for people who haven't seen it. The rest of the movie is rich in unlikely allies for Dolarhyde and Lonergan in their fight with the aliens, who are terrifically ugly and apparently technologically advanced. (Why do technologically advanced bad-guy aliens never wear clothing? And have only one apparent gender?) The fighting proceeds with nifty tricks and stunts and clever Macgyvering by the humans in their hopeless fight against the aliens. There's an important revelation about Ella Swenson, both Colonel Dolarhyde and Lonergan show unexpected sides to their character, and there's some mild comic relief scattered throughout. In the end, the humans vanquish the aliens. I don't think this is giving anything away, because did anyone really expect it to turn out any other way? I enjoyed the movie. The special effects are very good and move the action along; the acting by Ford, Craig and Wilde is excellent, and everyone else is passable. The aliens are scary bad guys and the ending gives the "happily ever after" crowd something to enjoy.If you're looking for a fun action summer movie with thrills, scary aliens, and nice but not epic performances by Ford and Craig, and the pleasant surprise of finding Wilde able to hold her own with these Hollywood heavyweights, you'll have a good time watching this movie and I can recommend it.I don't recommend this movie for very young children, who may find the aliens too scary, the gory parts too gory, and the brief nudity (Wilde or a body double, back view) and references to commercial sex too adult. And if you aren't the kind of person who can forgive lapses in logic, sense and believability, then you probably won't like this movie.Great cinema it's not; entertaining summer fare that's above average, it definitely is. I enjoyed it for what it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually bought this movie almost as soon as it came out because of the previews, but it sat around forever before I finally decided to watch it because I was wary of the premise, but I'm glad I finally did watch it.I've seen the other reviews that knock it around, but the fact is that it's based on a comic book. This is pure entertainment and a fun ride. The mix of genres make for an interesting story and you wonder why we assume that alien sightings are often only part of contemporary culture- if it happens now, then it happened then- if you buy into them.Daniel Craig portrays the quintessential cowboy, short on dialogue and long on tough. Harrison Ford delivers with the kind of performance you'd expect from such a seasoned and respected actor- his angst is strong enough that he is believable as a not-so-good guy from the outset and as the reasons unfold for that angst you get it. The chemistry between the two of them lends to the pace of the film. And what could I possibly say about Olivia Wilde that would do her justice? The rest of the cast populates the film with a gritty, western feel that belies cleaner western of the past. I was incredibly happy to see Walton Goggins and Clancy Brown as well as Keith Carradine, Paul Dano and Chris Browing round out a great story with a mix of young as well as seasoned- but all talented- actors bring us a fun romp through our own imaginations. Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cowboys vs. Aliens, Seriously??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a name like "Cowboys and Aliens," you have to figure the movie is going to be about as good as "Jesse James vs. Dracula" or "Indians vs. Vampires," but this movie actually surprises you. "Cowboys and Aliens" is actually a bit better than I expected, and I'm not even that big a fan of cowboys or science fiction movies. Daniel Craig plays an amnesiac cowboy with a strange object on his arm. He's basically "The Man With No Name," the gunslinger with no past and no future. Shortly after he appears in town, strange crafts appear in town blowing things up and abducting a lot of people. All Craig knows is that somehow he's the solution to the problem. Harrison Ford plays against type as the local crime boss, and Clancy Brown is the local priest. They believe the creatures are "demons" and start fighting back. John Favreau directs the movie seriously. The special effects are stunning; it's next to impossible to tell where the real scenes start and the FX takes over. The aliens are impressive too. Everything seems to be accurate to the period (except for the aliens), and the script moves along briskly without pausing to explain anything or add any extraneous details like the movies on SyFy channel. It's a really good movie and I kind of liked it myself, even with that James Bond guy in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This stinks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember not going to see this film at the theater because I thought it was going to be dumb, and I don't like wasting money. I was right. But as I was watching this film on cable, I wondered why I was sitting through it. And finally I realized it was because sometimes it's enjoyable to just wallow in the dumbness of some movies.Although I've been aware of who Daniel Craig is, this is the first of his films that I've seen, and his acting here was decent. But doesn't a really good actor have a sense from a script when a film is going to be lousy? This is the first Harrison Ford film that I've seen that I've been disappointed in. In fact, about the only thing it accomplished in terms of Ford's career is pointing out that he is now an old man. Bad choice, Harrison.Poor Adam Beach -- a pretty good American Indian actor. This has to have been his worst role.No one else is even worth mentioning. Well, one more -- the boy actor Noah Ringer. Probably the best performance in the film.Some of the special effects here were quite good, while other times they were poor (for example, the gold in the cabin). But, come on, a cowboy jumping on a flying rocket? There are too many absurdities in this film to mention them all.It is said that Cole Porter wrote "I Love You" to intentionally be the sappiest song he could possibly write. Ah well, I liked the song. It appears that the producers and directors here were operating on the same principle. Unfortunately, they succeeded where Porter failed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a class A stinker of the worst kind. To paraphrase, it's "a close encounter of the worst kind." Why? The premise is absolutely awful. Aliens invading the old west to wreak havoc on the people there.It's so bad that you eventually don't even care about the people who are kidnapped by these monsters.How Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford ever allowed themselves to be talked into this mess of a project is beyond me.Even the characters can't develop here because the writing and general premise of the film are both so awful.A colossal bomb ranking with such flops as "Spaceballs," some years back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was more fun and better than I thought it would be. The aliens, even though they were rip offs of Ridley Scot's aliens, were better CGI than expected. But why were they after gold? I didn't get that unless it was for energy.Any ways, Jake, played by Craig, has lost some of his memory but knows something weird is going on. He has a bracelet that can zap people and he knows something happened to his lady. He wonders into a town, only to have a lot of the townsfolk captured by the aliens. So, him, survivors set out to find them and eventually join forces with Indians. The story did make sense, it was terrible.FINAL VERDICT: OK action film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cowboys and Aliens stars Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford. Daniel's role was written for Robert Downey Jr. whom was interested but he had to drop out to do Sherlock Holmes 2 which is a good movie, better than the first. The plot is Daniel's character wakes up in the outskirts of some town with amnesia, it doesn't take long for him to find out he's an outlaw, he meets a grumpy rancher played by Harrison and the town is attacked by aliens.I understand why some hate this movie. I think it's good but not great. Combining the western genre and the science fiction genre is unique but the plot is certainly not new. The plot is weak but it's not a big deal. It's nothing more than fighting aliens and Daniel's character uncovering his past. Some think every character is weak and that's fine but I feel there is some character development , specifically the leads.The aliens are CG creatures, practical creatures would have been nice, they are bland and that means they are just targets, blips or whatever to shoot while on your way to work or maybe the dentist. Not showing the aliens in the marketing was a nice idea, some trailers like to show everything. The Super 8 marketing didn't show the alien and hopefully this "showing the whole movie" phase or period will die.How is the action? It's explosive and clear. I hate shaky cam and it's probably worth mentioning I didn't mind the shaky cam in The Bourne Supremacy. Nothing new happens and surprisingly there is some blood.Is is worth seeing? I feel it's worth a chance, it was made as a popcorn flick from the beginning. I seen it only once and I see myself watching it only once more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cowboys &amp; Aliens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for this film at the time of its release, I got very excited about seeing it, because it is not often you bring together two genres that normally wouldn't go together, from director Jon Favreau (Elf, Zathura: A Space Adventure, Iron Man). Basically, set in the Old West, 1873, in Arizona Territory, an unnamed loner (Daniel Craig) wakes up in the desert with injuries, no memory and a strange metal band shackled on his wrist, and after beating up three thieves trying to rob him he takes their clothes to put on and ride to the nearest town. He finds the small town of Absolution, where his wound is treated by preacher Meacham (Clancy Brown), and after a tussle with drunken Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano), the stranger is recognised as wanted outlaw Jake Lonergan by Sheriff John Taggart (Keith Carradine). Mysterious woman Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) stops Jake from escaping, and wealthy and influential cattleman Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) stops him and his son Percy being arrested, Jake also apparently stole some of the iron-fisted Colonel's gold. During their standoff in the night, all of the sudden some strange lights come towards the town from the sky, and alien aircraft start attacking with their weaponry, and abducting the Sheriff, Percy and some others, the attack ends though when a Jake fires at a ship with device in his wrist shackle. Dolarhyde and Ella with many of the townspeople form a posse to look for an extra-terrestrial that apparently ejected, while Jake goes to an abandoned cabin, and has a memory flashback of taking the stolen gold there, and he and Alice (Abigail Spencer) being abducted by aliens. When he returns to the posse they have a close encounter with the alien they were looking for, and Meacham gets killed as he sacrificed himself to save Sheriff Taggart's son Emmett (Noah Ringer), and by the morning many of the people have abandoned them. Jake tries to get his former gang to join them in their journey, but they don't join, and then in another night alien ships attack again, with Ella being captured, and Jake causes the ship she is in to crash and her get fatally wounded. Next Chiricahua Apaches, i.e. Native Americans, capture the posse, blaming them for bringing the aliens, and as Ella's body is burned on the fire, she suddenly resurrects, revealing that she is in fact an alien who came to Earth to escape the other aliens who destroyed her home planet. She explains that the aliens she is also in fear of came to Earth because of the gold supply, they use the priceless rocks as fuel for their ships, they also experiment on human beings. Ella also says that Jake with his gauntlet (directed energy) weapon s the key to locating and defeating the aliens, they may be more superior to humans but they can be killed, and with an Apache medicine he has a flashback of Alice dying, stealing the weapon and where the aliens are in the desert. Led by Dolarhyde the group go to the location of the grounded mother ship, and Jake convinces his old gang to join the fight, and he and Ella board the ship, releasing captives along the way, but he ends up captured. In the final moments Dolarhyde saves Jake, and with Jake's metal shackle off his wrist, this is activated by Ella as a high explosive device and she sacrifices herself, destroying the alien ship, and it ends with wanted man Jake allowed to go and ride away. Also starring Sam Rockwell as Doc, Adam Beach as Nat Colorado and Buck Taylor as Wes Claiborne. Craig put on a good American accent and was a cool rough cowboy, and Ford was also a good as the grouchy not to be messed with Colonel, there are certainly some eye catching sequences with the help of the terrific special effects, and it is a good mix of The Searchers (and the Man with No Name format) and Independence Day, without becoming Wild Wild West nonsense, a most watchable science fiction western adventure. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a pretty good mixture of two different genres:western legend and aliens adventure.I am not sure if this fact is enough to make this fiction this story original, but I am sure that it is not a very ordinary and old fashioned plot.When the movie started, I was looking forward to invasion of aliens as in every alien movie I used to. But you should be patient to see beautiful effects and battle sceneries.In the first three quarters you can only enjoy two or three sceneries but the last quarter is full of a huge battle scenery supplemented by nice visual effects.This movie didn't impress me as much as 'The Independence Day' or 'Avatar', but it deserves watching. It is worth watching alone or with your family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Is The Problem With FUN??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I highly recommend Cowboys &amp; Aliens to anyone interested in seeing it.I recommend it as a fan of westerns, as a fan of science fiction, as a fan of comedy, as a fan of innovation, as a fan of CINEMA.It's a perfect prequel to the Men In Black story universe. It's a wonderful vehicle for the fine actors who take part; it's the only chance a number of them will have to do an a-list western-era movie.Mostly, for me, it's an odd idea that WORKS. I'm the kind of sci fi fan who is bothered by little flaws and errors that wreck the suspension of belief you have to exercise in the genre. I took awhile to warm to Firefly because of the blatant use of American Western clothing and attitudes, and I regret the wasted time because Serenity was a fantastic movie. It made me go and rewatch the series.I was ready for this movie, and its melding of seemingly incongruous setting and plot. There hadn't been a video alien invasion of the Old West since "Time Tunnel." I loved it all. My MIB-loving kid loved it all. We were glad to see it on the big screen and we'll be buying and watching the DVD too.I read a lot of the negative reviews in here before going. I do that sometimes so that I can gauge my own reaction and consider things as they strike me in the theater.Relax and have fun with the movie. It's not Asimov, it's not Shakespeare, it's not Zane Grey. It's just fun. Well done fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well the trailer was good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I would like to say that I loved this movie but unfortunately I didn't. Before I start I cannot understand why a dull and serious movie of this type would have a fun name like 'Cowboy and Aliens'. Admittedly it wasn't what I expected. I think I was expecting it to be along the lines of a tongue in cheek Bruce Campbell movie. But hey, I like to be surprised so what was the actual movie like? Well from start to the finish it was given the opportunity to make something of itself but decided to be a slacker. Daniel Craigs performance was below average to say the least such was Harrison Fords, as for the rest of the cast they were just insignificant. The plot I have to say was consistent but empty. There were points in the movie I sat up and thought 'this is it' and all too soon 'it wasn't'. The end was like two different films pasted together and to be honest I didn't care about either of them. On leaving the cinema I over heard an over enthusiastic father say to his child 'So what did you think about that?' to which he replied 'Rubbish'. I think that comment says it all. Would I recommend it to a friend 'No'. Would I watch it again 'No'. Do I wish I had gone to see something else 'Yes'.</fullReview>

Having said that for a movie with Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Sam Rockwell, etc., you'd expect something that is at the very least very good. Near the end I did start to feel for the characters but I just never felt really connected to them throughout the movie. It is already two hours long but maybe it would have been better if it had been a little longer so that there would have been a little more development in the characters. At the end of the movie I felt entertained but I wanted more and felt that the movie could have given more than it did. Not a bad movie but it could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" We've fought off the aliens, now we can go back to fighting ourselves "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer Robert Orci and Mark Fergus and others combined to write this unusual Western tale set in the Arizona desert. Directed by Jon Favreau who does an extremely good job of pitting old west cowboys against space-age Aliens, the film comes off as one of the most fantastic encounters of the third kind. In this gritty, shoot-em-up setting, we have Harrison Ford playing Woodrow Dolarhyde who's son has been kidnapped by strange aliens and Daniel Craig as Jake Lonergan, who's wife has suffered the same fate. With one man trying to recover his memory, the other his son, they join forces along with a rough assortment of renegade bandits, Savage Apaches and other odds and ends. Throughout the fast paced story, the audience is mesmerized by the powerful special effects and air whizzing devices, which pervade the dark confusion, the victims and country folk. In addition, there is much energy in the story and something to be said with the cohesion reached by those involved. I expected more confrontation between the two major stars, but received unexpected satisfaction when they united to discover the Alien's weaknesses. All and all a good movie and one which set the stage for future similar films. ****</fullReview>

I enjoyed every minute of it.I am an educated person and a Mensa member, and I appreciate a finely wrought, intellectually challenging period piece as much as or more than anyone, but I also loved the heck outta this film.Good grief, people. This movie is about COWBOYS and ALIENS. Not sure what you could reasonably expect other than the fun it delivers.For nuanced plot points and refined character development, please do look elsewhere.

		<shortDescription>Honestly I am amazed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will say the movie got off to a good start with the opening moments, where Jake, the film's protagonist wakes in the desert, unaware of where he is, and then the following scene with Jake beating the men up and stealing their clothes and horse was great too. Speaking of the protagonist, I'm not sure why we don't find out his name until about 30 minutes into the movie, or so it seems.Anyways, back to the "plot". He appears to have woken up with a bracelet made of iron on his left wrist, which leads to what may be the most ham handed Chekhov's Gun example later in the film. He appears to have no memory at all and later finds out he is a wanted robber, and is imprisoned after a bar fight. One night, aliens attack the town, and it is unknown why (nor is it really explained, save for some weird gold subplot later in the film). And there's more attacks, and the men go on an adventure to stop the attacks, and blah blah blah... The end.Oh and I forgot, Olivia Wilde is in this. What she was even in there for again I'm completely empty at the thought of too, and maybe my summary wouldn't be so vague had there been STUFF HAPPENING in the film. Sad thing is, her performance is the best thing of the movie.Honestly I am amazed. I haven't had this much trouble trying to find the words to say about such a frustrating film. How could a movie with such a concept be so BORING. There is basically almost no fun in the film. When a movie is called "Cowboys and Aliens" and there's no fun in the movie whatsoever, that is not a good sign. In fact, why are there aliens in the movie, anyway. They are indeed very pointless and they feel forced in just to create some pointless conflict involving gold, which gets left to naught in the end. And we rarely see any of the aliens anyway. In fact, we see more spaceships than aliens. And the aliens look dumb anyways. Do they give razzies for CG? Because they look so bad, they make the aliens in Battle LA look awesome.The movie gets two of three stars for Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde, both the best things about this film, and the third star for the beautiful Arizona locations. The rest... yawn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1875. New Mexico Territory. A stranger (Craig) with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford). It's a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been, he realizes he holds a secret that could give the town a fighting chance against the alien force. Starring Daniel Craig, Olivia Wilde, Harrison Ford, Sam Rockwell, Paul Dano , Adam Beach , Noah Ringer , Abigail Spencer , Brendan Wayne , Buck Taylor , Matt Taylor and others.Directed by Jon Favreau a famous actor come director who directed movies like Elf, Zathura and the famous Iron Man 1 and 2.wow what a entirely new and strange combination it is, Western with Sci Fi. when i first saw the trailer i wasn't sure it is gonna be a great movie. many people were looking forward to it and were calling it a must see summer flick. i saw it with less expectations and wow i wasn't disappointed. i knew how it was gonna be but somehow it surprised me too, it didn't turned out the exact way i thought. i had this idea that it will be a mindless summer fun movie but no it wasn't. this movie has a very serious and somewhat dark tone which was a surprise with almost no jokes at all. i must say it didn't quite worked at all.Jon made some goof movies but this might be his weakest, i don't remember anything about Elf though. he did a nice job as a director but this movie needed more and i expected more. still it was very brave enough of him to make a movie on this topic. talking about actors, such great cast it had. Daniel Craig as a lost man with a past with these Aliens did a nice job. i would be honest i didn't liked Harrison Ford at all in this movie, he was i don't know lost. disappointed as i thought they both will make a good team.Screenplay is okay, very stretched though. plot is something that goes on forever. could have been tighter. nice cinematography and Art direction. talking about those Special effects, they were really weak and bad. i didn't liked the Sci fi part of the movie at all. it lacked many things. the western part was watchable on the other hand.this action summer sci if western movie is not something you will expect to see. it is not totally a popcorn flick nor a good Alien invasion movie but some fun it has. but movie lacks a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so let me get this straight. Aliens come maybe millions of light years, to strip Earth of gold? For those who do not realize, the only value of gold is that it's rare. It is way to pliable to be used in things other than jewelry, it has very poor energy conduction, which is why you don't see it used in circuitry. Essentially, it's only value has been made by good marketing. So these aliens not only travel millions of light years to strip Earth of a worthless material that looks pretty, but they have the means of hiding so completely and extracting it so discretely that no one had any clue they were there until the Aliens began attacking humans. WHY!! "Because we're aliens, we do things like that!" Does anybody else picture a conversation between the Alien General and is 1st officer?General: "Attack and probe the humans!"1st Officer: "Why, we are getting what we came for and these primates are clueless?"General: (points at 1st officer) "Kill him!"1st officer: "Why?"General: "For making me look stupid."It is very clear the Aliens had no Spock aboard their ship!That being said the human characters were very good. Harrison Ford especially rocked in this film. Tho what else would you expect from Harrison? All and all the characters were done very well and I don't think there was a weak link among the actors. The weak link was all within the plot. I mean really why couldn't they just say the Aliens came for something believable like water,or our women!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a bad movie, but it could have been better. We left the cinema on a Friday night feeling like we had been entertained ? which is about all I really need on a Friday night ? but it was a little bit of a mess. Prettily shot though, in New Mexico I think.The problem with Cowboys and Aliens is that it's one of those movies that wants to be all things to all people and doesn't pull it off. Is it a drama, a spoof, a serious sci fi movie or a parody? Daniel Craig gives a good solid performance as the central character, an outlaw who has lost his memory and lands in the middle of a scruffy New Mexican, failing, mining town, lorded over by a cattle baron bully totally hammed up by Harrison Ford. I can't deny that simply looking at Craig ? who is super buff ? for 2 hours is probably pleasure enough for a Friday night. The aliens are irredeemably evil ? no attempt at any of the touchy feely 'they are so much more intelligent than us' stuff. These guys are bad, ugly, rapacious and not even very bright. Everything barring the kitchen sink is thrown in, the local Apaches, the outlaw gang, the tough but beautiful, mysterious woman, the weakling son, the Indian boy raised by white men, the upright local sheriff, the mild mannered saloon owner, the kid on the brink of learning about manhood, a dog? I mean this is a pastiche on one level.But then there are one or two scenes which are really quite jarringly violent and nasty, which made me wonder exactly what this movie is supposed to be? The one that had me wincing most, was the guy being tortured by being strung between 2 horses with the threat of being pulled apart, like a western equivalent of the medieval rack. He is released from that fate only to be dragged off along the ground at a gallop, presumably to his death. The kid learning to wield a very large knife to kill an alien was pretty vivid too.But then there are other scenes which are just plain silly, like the low tech rocket which looked like something that came free in a cereal box. Had the violent scenes been more tongue in cheek, it might have worked. Had the science fiction been even slightly more 'sciency' it might have worked. If it's a serious attempt at depicting an alien invasion of earth, I found it pretty unconvincing. As pure sci fi entertainment, it's no Men in Black.Perhaps one problem I have with this is Harrison Ford, who seems to be playing a parody of himself. I loved him as Han and even as the archaeologist, but this? No way. Then there is Craig's mystery bracelet, which I never quite understood. I mean are they kidnapping people for food or to make them into warriors or what? Why did Craig's character have that bracelet at all? So many holes, so little effective dialog. But then again, it was nicely shot with dramatic scenery, and it WAS a Friday night?..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into Cowboys &amp; Aliens expecting it to be a hastily put together film aiming to bring in big summer box office bucks. You know, one of the same old flicks that places explosions, all knowing heroes and hot chicks over a good plot and characters with substance. Fortunately, Cowboys &amp; Aliens proved to be a couple steps above that formula, by entertainingly weaving the sci-fi and western genres together into a relatively enjoyable film. Daniel Craig delivers a supremely bad ass performance as Jake Lonergan, a wanted man who finds himself struck with memory loss in middle of the desert-in addition to having a mysterious mechanical bracelet bound to his wrist. Craig is so good in the role that I found myself wishing that the whole movie was a western centered on him. He is cool, calculating, and threatening, sending chills down your spine as he simply stares a character down. Craig's remarkable screen presence is electrifying, allowing him to carry the film magnificently well. Harrison Ford also stars as Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde,a tough cattleman with a brat of a son. As gruff and impersonal as he seems, viewers can't help but love him. From the moment Ford appears on screen, turning towards the camera in a closeup, you can't help being struck with a feeling of nostalgia, seeing the man who played Indiana Jones and Han Solo still having the same affect on viewers today-that is, making you root for a seemingly unlikeable character. Ford brings heart to the role, combining rough cowboy with secretly loving father perfectly. In the last main role is Olivia Wilde as Ella Swensen, a cryptic woman who accompanies the men on their quest. Anything but a damsel in distress, Wilde holds her own on screen next to her two commanding co-stars. Obviously she is strikingly beautiful, but Wilde shies away away from being the annoying sidekick girl and instead flourishes as a captivating counterpart to Craig. Wilde is able to take the somewhat generic role of Ella and transform her into a believable, mesmerizing character capable of holding attention just as well as her co stars. The movie's three stars worked together incredibly well, and kept me entertained the whole way. The subplots with the other characters (Preacher, Doc, boy) where somewhat lost in the overall story, but nonetheless I am glad that they were included to show how these 1800's folk would have reacted to the alien invasion, referring to them as "Demons". The plot, while somewhat thin and unoriginal, was saved by the genre mixing concept, which gave Favreau lots of room to play around. It allowed me to overlook certain elements that would otherwise be deemed as far-fetched and unbelievable. Additionally, if you let yourself get into the movie, there are a couple genuinely suspenseful moments, as well as some jump-out-of-your-seat moments. All in all, Cowboys &amp; Aliens is a a fun summer flick. There's not a lot of depth to it, but that is really not something to look for in a movie like this anyway. It's about taking two fun genres and combining them to create a lively, amusing experience for viewers. With the right balance of character development and straightforward plot pacing, Favreau delivers an energetic film that never tries to be more than it is. Don't take it to seriously, and you won't be disappointed. This movie is pure fun. P.s. If you enjoyed this mix of genres, check out Joss Whedon's TV series Firefly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good solid movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good solid movie. Cowboys and Aliens is an unusual mix of a Western, and science fiction movie. The movie makers excellently crafted the two genre together by merging two films into one. The first part of Cowboys &amp; Aliens has the usual Western plot where the town's people are scared of the local ranch Baron, with the man with no name (the bad guy) added into the story. The second part of the movie grabs the viewer unexpectedly with an Alien attack. I will not ruin the movie for the reader, but I will give you this. The movie mixes a theme of many people binding together to fight a common enemy with a few interesting plot devices. If the viewer watches closely he or she will notice a few homages to other movies. The Alien ship sort of looks like the Jawa vessel in the first Star Wars movie and there are a few camera shots with Craig that resembles Indian Jones. Cowboys &amp; Aliens is pure escapism at its finest. I give Cowboys &amp; Aliens 10 out of 10. When I went to the theater I knew I would either love or hate this film, because it would either work or bomb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so bad that even stoned out of my mind on narcotics and unable to leave the house recovering post-surgery with nothing else to watch, I still couldn't finish it. Plot less, terrible acting, awful effects; simply no redeeming value at all.I wanted to watch this purely on the strength of Olivia Wilde's previous work, especially _House_, but even she couldn't carry it. And her acting in this production was no better than the rest of the cast.I will never understand how such an otherwise excellent cast produced this junk.Maybe the second half is better, but I'll never find out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the story the most, but the actors are superb. Also the visual effects is marvelous, nothing to complain about there.I don't know if they were filming in a studio, or in the real desert, but it sure looked real if they filmed in a studio!Too bad they didn't show it in 3D (at least not here in Norway), because i think this would be one of the few movies that you really can enjoy in real 3D."minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text" - that is just lame, why can't people with an opinion write it down without sitting and typing here all day?Anyways, i would recommend everyone, all ages, to go watch this movie (this movie is too good for downloading illegal).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major Disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not much more needs to be said. There was NO humor throughout; the violence was cruel, unnecessary, and graphic; the aliens were of 1960's quality and needlessly gross. Thankfully the aliens were a very small part of the movie.I have come to expect Harrison Ford to sprinkle even those most dramatic movies with humor, but not only is that not true here, but Harrison is NOT a "good guy." That was one of the worst parts of the film for me, a Ford lover.With this setting and these characters I certainly expected a more entertaining film! Save yourselves and do not see it if it is not too late!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why does everybody hate this movie? It's not the average hectic action movie you see every day and it was clear how much work was put into it. I could relate to almost every character and not just because they were played by awesome actors but because they really went true character development. The story wasn't very complicated but Spielberg's old movies hadn't such great story lines as well and everybody liked them to. The atmosphere was breathtaking and beside of some plot holes, i really don't have the slightest idea why you are all so unhappy about it. In my personal opinion i would at least give it an eight out of ten. Not perfect, but still a great nostalgic movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun and awesome blend of sci fi and western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a fantastic adaptation of Scott Mitchell Rosenberg's comic book. This movie used a perfect combination of old west cowboy setting and aliens shock factor. The western theme of the story is so good it could stand on its own. The sci-fi addition of the aliens was not overdone yet they spared no expense making the aliens. (This is NOT some cheap low budget low light syfy TV movie) All the actors involved were great. Story was solid. Action is continuous and special effects are brilliant. This movie is safe to take younger kids if they are not afraid of monsters or too much violence. I like the twist of Aliens visiting 1800s USA, kind of reminds me of Predator and FireFly. The actors all did a great job Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Sam Rockwell, Keith Carradine, Adam Beach, Paul Dano and Olivia Wilde. Each brought their A game. Cinematography and set design was outstanding; like I said even the little details sold me on the western. This movie deserves to be seen on the big screen due to the great action scenes and special effects. Not worth IMAX or 3D, so you can save a few bucks there.All in all Great movie worth watching in the theater and buying on Blue Ray.</fullReview>

Beside all that, what is not to love about watching classic adventurers/good guys, Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford? Not to mention the always entertaining Sam Rockwell?

		<shortDescription>Truth in the title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A memory impaired man (Daniel Craig) awakes with a strange metal shackle on his wrist and a wound on his side. After showcasing hidden skills like a 19th century Jason Bourne on some rough and tough dudes, he heads to the nearest town of Absolution only to find more hassles. He deals with a spoiled, troublemaker named Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano), who's father is a not-to-be-messed-with head honcho of sorts. Percy lands in jail and soon enough the man with no memory ends up in the cell next door, as he turns out to be the infamous Jake Lonergan who has a rap sheet longer than the Oregon Trail. When Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) gets word of his incarcerated son, he storms the streets with his cowboys. Right before a tense showdown, the alien part of the equation shows to make things go boom and people disappear. Jake's bracelet suddenly turns into Mega Man status and he blasts one of the ships down with an energy beam. The creature that operated the vessel flees and they round up a posse to track it back to where their kidnapped loved ones are."Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is more about the journey to the final showdown involving various characters that it never fully scratches below the introductory surface on, which at times makes them more plot device than natural. Along tags a bartender who's more business than brawn; a mysterious woman who eyes Jake; a practical preacher who knows how to pray and shoot; a young boy who's not yet a man; a loyal Indian who looks at his boss as a father figure; and the former colonel Dolarhyde who's got a thing or two to teach the youngins about battle. Now, where westerns in the past had everybody out for their ruthless selves, this uses the enslaving extraterrestrials as a means to get along for the greater good of humanity, including fierce outlaws and warrior Indians who are in the same dire straits. In the meantime, no one ever claimed the abominable aliens didn't have punctuality as they make a few well-timed appearances to the point of predictably just before a human vs human conflict is about to get all gun crazy. Though like throwing a rock at a tank, these basic, booze-drinkin', boot-wearin' westerners look to be completely overrun and overwhelmed. That is until they have to get sneaky and use strength in numbers to put a stop to the aliens, which at this point are so one-dimensional the movie plays out like an easily sold good vs evil template with nothing left over to put in the bank to accumulate interest.This is more the former than the latter of the title. The western portion on its own isn't groundbreaking to the genre, and the sci-fi side isn't inventive enough to blow the lid off a long time fan, even if the combination is definitely original. Other aspects to fall back on like the pacing can feel like it revs the engine, then levels at a lower gear. This wouldn't be such an issue but it's not that contemplative of a film to hit the locker room in between for a break, and as a result creates a building list of questions from the viewer that never end up answered about certain plays. It's a film that treads more on mystery when it comes to its antagonists, by at first seeing a shadow, a claw and then a quick full frontal, as well as it only gives little snippets of information for the viewer. Problem is, it doesn't create that intriguing enough of creatures to pull the enigma off--no communication, no interaction with each other, very few distinguishing elements with behavior or appearance--or even go further into why they're on Earth other than laying out a questionable reason at face-value.Daniel Craig played a simple but commanding presence, as he said little but when it came time for action delivered with full force as if he meant it, and then some. It causes you to focus in on him to not miss his next move, despite getting knocked about with a lesser blow or two. Clancy Brown plays a memorable role as a tough holy man that adds humor to the situations, but Chris Browning includes cartoon flavor with his crusty chompers and oafish demeanor. Paul Dano, as much as he tried and has the most range, his performance felt misplaced as if he's a tortured man rather than just a fearful kid with no perspective from growing up safe and spoiled. Harrison Ford's character is built up and built up, with other people making not only a legend of him but a power not to be reckoned with, though by the time it comes for him to show his stuff, he falls somewhat short on punch. It's a shame that some of his gruff lines come off as unflattering imitations rather than truly compelling. On an entertainment level, you get massive explosions, O.K. Corral-thumping gun fights, built up thrills, mystery, situational humor, potential love, tragedy, resolution and you get to see two separate genres at the same time. It sounds like a lot, but it didn't always come one after the other or always in a smooth, edge-of-your-seat transition together. The mentioned certainly made this enjoyable and an interesting concept to see but unfortunately it wasn't capable of thoroughly traveling beyond expectations for such a cool premise.

		<fullReview>Warning - This movie has graphic scenes of human torture and mutilation. I was not impressed. The movie was already going in too many directions to throw a little Auschwitz in the mix.Daniel Craig's acting and character were excellent. Harrison Ford, not so great. Action was OK but a bit over the top at times. Alien CG was poor.The worst thing about the movie is the constant continuity problems: 1)Landscapes keep changing from minute to minute. mountains one minute then plains the next, then all of a sudden canyons. 2) Two characters fall towards a huge mile wide river in a canyon. Then the next scene they come crawling out of a bit of water about 100 feet wide that looks to be about 3 feet deep. 3) The worst was when Daniel Craig's character rides off into the desert to search for the location of a gang of men, finds them, convinces them to break camp and ride all the way back with him. And then when they get back, only about 20 minutes has passed. What?I'm not a big stickler for continuity, but it was so bad in this movie, I was constantly distracted and could not enjoy it.So maybe rent it, if you have a strong stomach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The wild west with a twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the graphic novel of the same name, Cowboys &amp; Aliens takes us back to a post-Civil War west, similar to the west evoked in the glory days of westerns, or for you readers out there who didn't receive a healthy dose of John Wayne and John Ford, think Unforgiven. We meet a man with no memory (Daniel Craig), who we later find out is Jake Lonergan, wanted for armed robbery and murder. He doesn't know his name, where he came from, our how he ended up in the middle of the desert with a large metal cuff on his wrist. He wanders into a nearby town where he winds up getting into more trouble. He gets the attention of the sheriff and the wealthiest man in town, Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). Ford knows Jake as the man who robbed his train. He wants to hang him up, but he won't get his wish.The town is bombarded by a wave of alien spacecraft, the kind the throw bombs and suck up victims with lights and ropes. Six-shooters and Winchester rifles do nothing but make noise. It is here that we find out the purpose of the metal cuff on Jake's arm.If you've seen the trailer you can pretty much guess what the film is about. One man, wanted for murder, is the key to the town's survival against the alien invaders, as well as the key to getting back the abducted townsfolk. Simple enough. That's what I expected and that is what I received. The only part I didn't account for was how entertained I was.I have a tendency to look past the surface of the screen, at the dialogue, camera shot selection, lighting effects, etc. Here I was more concerned about whether or not a Cowboys &amp; Aliens toy gun like the one Craig uses would be available in time for Christmas. The movie is fairly simple but the concept is, to put it bluntly, really cool!Think about it for a second. Put yourself in the wild west of the 1870s. You're exiting a saloon and are about to mount your trusty steed. Then on the horizon a line of lights appear. Unlike anything you've seen before. Suddenly you are surrounded by lights, sounds, and explosions the likes of which you never dreamed of. The weapon you carry in your holster has been made useless. All you can do is try to survive. It's kind of frightening. These characters didn't even think about creatures from another world. They have enough issues with the Natives of the country.Favreau does a fantastic job in recreating the old west and throwing it into the middle of this utterly preposterous situation. The clothing, sets, and weapons hearken back to the days of Wyatt Earp and the O.K. Corral. Taking a genre as familiar as the west and placing it in the context of a science fiction story makes too much sense. Most science fiction stories have roots in the west. A hero versus a villain. The threat of outsiders. Foreign landscapes. Big shoot outs. The story lines cross over so much that they were bound to collide some day.The two leads of the film, Craig and Ford, or James Bond and Indiana Jones, work hand in hand, feeding off each other's sharpness. Craig has a cold, icy stare, like you don't know what he is going to do next, but he knows exactly (perfectly describes his character). Ford plays angry better than most. His scowl is legendary, and puts it to plenty of good use here. The supporting cast of Sam Rockwell, Keith Carradine, Olivia Wilde, and Adam Beach do a fine job. Nothing outstanding (except for maybe Rockwell), but still a decent job.It's not a perfect film even if it is a summer blockbuster. There were a few moments where I shook my head and asked why, but for the majority I was entertained. Action junkies will certainly get their money's worth, and best of all it comes at a 2-D price. No glasses required and no extra fee (though the price still stings a bit). It's War of the Worlds meets The Searchers. Not the best match, but one that you can handle. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good Western . . . till the aliens spoil the party.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title suggests, "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is indeed a western mixed with science fiction, with guys in cowboy hats fighting bug-eyed monsters from outer space. Fundamentally, that's a combination that should go together about as well as pizza and ice cream. Yet, here is a movie that, at heart, is entertaining without really breaking new ground.The plot is more or less spoiled by the title. The first half hour of this movie creates an intriguing mystery and a pretty good western before the spaceships show up and ruin the party. The story takes place in 1873, and opens with a man (Daniel Craig) waking up in the middle of the desert with a wound in his side and a strange metal bracelet attached to his left wrist. He has no memory of how he got there or who he is. He is literally a man with no name.Soon we will find out his name and, by the end, we will learn all about his identity. It would have been fun if the movie had left him as a Man With No Name, kind of like Clint Eastwood, but never mind. Any information about the movie will give away his identity but since his name is part of the revelation about his origins, I'll leave it for you to discover and simply address him as The Stranger.The Stranger walks out of the desert and into the dusty desert town of Absolution, your usual Western movie town with drunks, barkeeps, gunslingers, a man called Doc and, of course, one breathtaking beauty (Olivia Wilde).The town is ruled with an iron fist by a crusty former Colonel named Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) who returns into town only to find that his loud-mouthed son Percy (Paul Dano) has been arrested for firing his gun randomly in the street and scaring the townsfolk. Earlier, Percy had a run-in with The Stranger and they are both taken into custody.That's about the point where alien spacecrafts from above fall from the night sky and begin firing lasers at the people below. Some are killed and several are scooped up on long metal ropes and pulled up into the ships. The population of Absolution is, understandably, dumbstruck. They don't know what has just happened (some suggest demons from Hell) but they know that some of their loved ones have been spirited away by . . . something.The alien attack leads to Dolarhyde forming a posse out of the menfolk and, of course, the town beauty (who I think is actually the only woman in town) to go and track down these thingy-ma-jigs and get their people back. That leads to a long trek into the desert where we unravel the mystery of The Stranger and, very often, get to see lots of spaceships and bug-eyed monsters. They are not at all friendly or even slightly benevolent. They roar, they snarl, they bite and they shoot lasers. Their purpose for abducting humans is pretty familiar if you've ever heard any story of alien abduction. Nothing new.To be honest, I think this would have been a pretty good movie without the aliens. The first 20 minutes of the movie show great promise as we are introduced to a western settlement that actually feels like a real place. The people who populate Absolution are slightly more than one dimensional. In particular is the character of the local saloon owner (Sam Rockwell) who seems to have a presence that suggests that he is more than simply a background character. Also interesting is Meacham, a kindly soft-spoken preacher who speaks with a certain manner of wisdom that doesn't feel clichéd. There's even a nice presence to the town beauty, Ella Swenson. She spends half the movie as a pretty love interest until an intriguing story development midway through make her character into something more.Surprisingly, the character that I found the least interesting was Dolarhyde. Ford gives a serviceable performance but the character is written at one level: A mean old man who has a soft heart, especially in the presence of a little orphan boy. The characters have the stature and the presence to make for a really interesting Western. Done well, audiences will go to see a western, witness the success of last year's "True Grit". It can be done.Yet, I think the mood is spoiled by the aliens who aren't all that interesting. Even with that, the third act of the movie is no surprise, with the humans and the aliens battling it out with gunfire and laser blasts. I wouldn't have minded the presence of the sci-fi plot if the movie had really gone somewhere with it. Say, taking some of the cowboys away to their home planet. Or, how about having Sigourney Weaver join the posse? The movie, on the sci-fi level, is kind of a let down after the bar has been set for this genre by the likes of "Avatar" and "Super 8". By comparison, this one seems rather droll. The aliens just aren't all that interesting. "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is a competent, if not overwhelming late summer movie. There's a lot to like about it. It is entertaining on a visual level, but fundamentally we're dealing with two great genres that don't go great together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish I could lose my memory..... of this film that is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing Cowboys &amp; Aliens, I've come to one conclusion...I wish I couldn't remember anything. This movie is almost as upsetting as George Clooneys "The American" The previews deliver more than the movie does! There are some good pieces to the story, but that's all they are pieces. Blah, Blah, Blah, The effects were good but there were holes in the story the size of the New Mexico territory! Poor character development and no definitive information concerning the aliens. And why do most aliens portrayed in film have to look like insects with no clothing? Giant Grasshoppers with blasters! This is more of a kiddie flick than an adult flick. The predictable "feel good" relationships were cliché. This film would have served better had it been more along the lines of a thriller, or better yet if it simply had someone to write a story for it. It really feels like they created a movie completely from a concept and never really thought through the story. Also, the movie starts very dark, violent and serious,and then develops quite literally into a campy Disney film! Great concept...epic fail on execution! Also the names of the characters were campy "Loner-gan" is obviously Craig The "loner"and "Dolarhyde" is the cattle rancher (Ford) (one last comment) No one in the film seems amazed at the creatures or the fact that these things could fly in a machine! Pre-flight Americans were not amazed or shocked at seeing a flying machine! The best they could come up with was this deadpan quote from the movie, "hey, we were flying.</fullReview>

Throughout the movie I tried to entertain myself believing that there might be something interesting coming soon. This movie is not recommended to watch for anyone, except those who really want to waste sometime. Daniel Craig's fans should adjust with the stupid story but at least they can see their loved ones on their screens. There are few scenes where you can laugh and few scenes which would be kind of terrifying, but it is a terror without a reason, or a humor without any base. This movie reminded me of small assignments that we used to submit in a hurry during college days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not a block buster really. But it is a really good summer movie. The cast did a pro job at making it feel believable. By doing so they manage to pull you into the setting and the action just enough to make it worth watching. However I feel that if there had been a much better script available.. cutting the science fiction out completely a really good western movie would have come out of it. I would have preferred to see such a good cast in that movie more than this movie. (If that makes sense)As in all of Jon Favreau's movies there is the notch special effects. But the aliens... didn't come off as quite evil enough to make you really feel intimidated or even hate them. They're just there sort of... in the way. Annoying mosquito's. While the dialogue is good in the film there are plot cliché's that really detract from the whole movie. There were some things that could have been done that would have made it feel/draw a much better reaction as a whole.Anyway, don't let that stop you from seeing it. It is still a good summer action flick to sit down and eat popcorn, and sip down a favorite beverage while watching it. There is some good timed points of humor and even some things only science fiction fans would really catch in it, that make the small successes it does have all the more enjoyable!</fullReview>

The lead actors looked equally bewildered. Such big names however, could not uplift the movie.I could not fathom the plot at all.The aliens, with their futuristic technology looking for gold on planet earth! God help me! Everybody in the theater was enthralled in their own private conversations.I wish I could push the pace of the movie,but the plot was all like a kiddie one. Daniel Craig looks rugged but the aliens looked at least more expressive! Harrison Ford looks tired and worn out.The leading actress Olivia Wilde tries to pout, but fails miserably. A bad plot brings out the worst in amongst the best of actors. We all sadly walked out of the theater. There was no headache as we hardly got involved in the movie. The best part of the movie was during the intermission when I bought pop corn and ice cream for my 9 year old eager small daughter. The plot failed to capture her attention too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets get this straight, the title of this movie reveals the entire plot. Its just simply cowboys fighting aliens. If you throw in a couple of Indians then you have Cowboys and Aliens. A lot of people think that this movie looks stupid just because its cowboys vs aliens. But think about it, its like any other alien movie just a different time period. I didn't really have faith in this movie when i first heard about it but then i found out the movie was being directed by the guy who directed Iron Man(Jon Favrea), then i found out it was starring James Bond and Indiana Jones along with Olivia Wilde and Sam Rockwell. Who wouldn't want to see that? Its not supposed to be an Oscar winning movie, its supposed to be a fun summer blockbuster. It was one of the funnest movies I have ever seen. Its the perfect summer blockbuster. The western part of it felt a lot like True Grit and the alien part look like....well like alien movies always do. The movie is just such a blast. The acting was outstanding. Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford both brought their A game and Olivia Wilde was perfect for her role. All in all, Cowboys and Aliens is the perfect summer movie if you are looking for an action packed, funny, bad ass movie, and thats what this movie is. Kudos to you Jon Favreau.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Summer Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cowboys and Aliens is one of those films that a lot of people laughed about when the trailer first started popping up. Yeah, the name is kinda funny. Even the idea is slightly bonkers. A western and a sci-fi mashed together like peanut butter and jelly? We've seen it before. And if you can name the last one that did a good job of mixing the two, then good for you. But Favreau does a good job of defying the typical by presenting a fun and exciting summer blockbuster.I'm not going to say this film defied any kind of expectations. In fact, I really had none. The trailer leaves little to guess at beyond the initial attack. What it becomes is a basic western with sci-fi trappings. Beyond the aliens and technology in the film, this is a western at it's core, with all the typical characters, from The Man With No Name type to the cattle baron to the rowdy bandits. It's all here. Even the Indians. But it's all in good fun, led by fantastic performances from both Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, who seems to be at his most comfortable and enjoyable in a long time. In fact, dare I say, Ford was fun to watch again, and he hasn't been that in a long time. The supporting cast is also strong here, with Olivia Wilde doing a fantastic job specifically and looking great doing it.It helps that Favreau himself chose to focus more on the western aspect of the film than the aliens. Wild Wild West this is not. While the alien aspects are good, the western part is what truly shines. It feels like a traditional western, which in this case is not a bad thing. Yes, it's pretty clichéd, but that's okay. Ford and Craig make it okay. Unfortunately, the film feels a little underwhelming. While it's great fun, it almost feels like the premise is too large for the film to fully capitalize on it. Then again, it's hard to imagine what would fully realize the potential of such a clash of genres. Maybe Cowboys and Aliens 2, huh?But, I really can't complain. The film is good fun, and it's nice to see a cast that seems like they genuinely enjoyed being in it. The film may not go down as summer's biggest, but it should be noted as another of the summer's enjoyable films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The name of the movie struck my eyes many months ago when I thought that the mix of a sci-fi and a westerner will be great. But, in order to deliver that up to the expectations and (sometimes beyond that) you either need Sergio Leone mixing with H.G. Wells or you need either of Scorsese, Kubrick or Nolan who I think are very few directors who can actually make you visualize whatever you ever imagined. The movie starts slow and gradually takes speed (just like you would expect from a westerner) but when the first attack takes place seemed to be the peak of the movie. Till that time, music miserably fails which puts life in a westerner and hence gradually the feel of a westerner seems to wane. Although at the time of the first attack, it feels like that you are getting the feeling of watching a horror, Sci-Fi and a noir. Harrisson Ford could have taken the feel from blade runner but right after this point, movie fails to pick up. Movie could have picked up from this point and taken a better speed but compared to last year's True Grit, this movie, I believe, will fail to live up to the expectations of the audience. Definitely not worth going by spending money on this. Watch it when it comes on your local television channels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can a sensational trailer raise expectations to the point that actual movie must be considered a disappointment? Perhaps, but 'Cowboys and Aliens' suffers from more than high expectations. It features a disjointed screenplay that reduces Harrison Ford to channeling his inner Walter Brennan and Daniel Craig awash in multiple personalities. And Olivier Wilde finds herself sporting a 15 inch revolver strapped round her 20 inch waist for much of the movie, except when she's jumping out of funeral pyre. However,in spite of its many flaws this movie retains a basic likability...If nothing else, you can root for the dog</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cowboys, Indians and ... Aliens ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that would have made a better title for the film than just Cowboys and Aliens. Anyways, I just came back from watching this movie, I have to say, I was more than satisfied.Just imagine if you put James Bond " Craig " and Indiana Jones " Ford " in a Western Sci fi, what would you get ? A definitely original and entertaining Action / Adventure film.While the idea is not entirely original, as it has been done before, but i must say not with Favreau's style and not with this brilliant cast.the movie starts immediately with Daniel Craig's character who wakes up in the middle of no where with amnesia, and finds an electric bracelet around his wrist, which seems to be a weapon of some sort, and so that mystery captures the attention of viewers and audience early on. the plot moves in a steady pace, introducing us to all the different characters, including Harrison Ford's character who plays a gangster who seems to have crossed paths with Craig's character before he lost his memory.the characters were all very well defined with clear goals and motives, and the chemistry between them was strong. I was particularly very interested in Ford and his fellow Indian right hand guy relationship.the cast delivered very memorable performances, and Harrison Ford was much better here than his role in Mornning Glory. Daniel Craig, Sam Rockwell and Olivia Wilde were all very good here.the Action was executed in a very good way, mixing old school stunt with a little special effects. not a lot of CGI too which was something refreshing to see in an action sci fi nowadays.the story was simple but intriguing, never dragged or felt boring. it involves Aliens who keep attacking humans in a small town and start abducting people, that of course takes place in the old West, which forces the two seemingly enemies " Ford " and " Craig " to join forces against that Alien attack.I highly recommend this movie, definitely original and entertaining. with a very good cast and the direction of Jon Favreau who adds a lot to the film, with some solid action scenes. not to be missed, i can safely say, this was my favorite movie this summer 2011 so far !!9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew perfectly well I was going off to see this thing because I had nothing better to do and I was sick up to my throat of hanging by my thumbs waiting for some resolution of the "debt ceiling" crisis.Always naively hoping for someone out of Hollywood to make a thriller with some intelligence and respect for the audience. But hey, that's just not the way it works is it? Even "Super 8" kind of sucked far worse than it should have."Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is riddled with clichés like Spam is full of fatty chunks. Even the weepy boy and his dog! The geeky psychopath punk son. The mysterious woman floating around in the town looking like she just stepped out the glam makeup trailer. The noble Indians! Harrison Ford is a horrible, horrible actor. He might have fit the bill for "Indiana Jones," but otherwise all he does is that phony glare/stare and attempts at sober seriousness that just leaves audiences laughing (at the mall-o-drome where I was I swear people were cracking up just over his lousiness).And whatever mook directed this thing hasn't a clue, so everyone in the cast, at very predictable moments, just EMOTES like crazy. They must have been told to take lessons from Ford.Lots of things made no sense. For example, toward the end in the big requisite battle scene, the aliens must have gone off for ten minutes to have a powwow or clean the entrails out of their claws so that the action could pause while Harrison and the Indian chief sort of chewed over their personal issues. Oh - maybe the aliens were supposed to be off in the conveniently-placed bushes snickering? Well, at least we got what we know we always need, why we paid our bucks and watched the big-screen commercials and all the previews: sure enough, a heroic figure (this time the alien chick) clawed all the way to the exact central hub of the alien ship and blew it up! Hooray, all must be right with out fantasies.Yeah, I know I just went off to waste an afternoon, but I mean why do these people have to be SO OBLIGING?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... but this was originally supposed to be a solid Western. At a certain time Spielberg thought that "something special" was missing in the script, so he gave it to Lucas for one week to have a look at it, and...well, the rest is history.It looks like that the CGI department had a hard time to fit Lucas funky Visions into a frame which would look a kind of appropriate to the 19th century. So this time they convinced the producers to leave the obligatory Jar Jar Binks-like character out. The alien ships therefore uses lassos instead of tractor beams and they are powered with Diesel engines with a lot of steam and smoke. And, they don't use mental powers and they are not Nazis!If this movie accidentally should have something to do with the original Cowboys &amp; Aliens books, then its accidentally. Because nothing essential of Rosenberg's comics appears in the movie. Despite that, the movie is not that bad. I actually enjoyed it.The motivation of the producers was clearly to combine favorite genres and make an "awesome" summer blockbuster. It's terribly generic, the ETs are plain stupid and have probably not the slightest glue how they managed it to travel the light years distance to earth. They can easily be shot dead with a .45 Colt. They are so uninteresting as villains that you can cozily watch what Ford and Craig are doing together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting story but poor character development? Who is responsible for delivering a tedious and poorly written movie? The meandering story didn't deliver what it was supposed to at all. Did we really learn about any character or come to care for anyone at all? This movie tries to cash in on its stars' coat tails but really can't stand on its own. I love this cast and actually felt bad for them DURING its running time. It's bad when a movie takes you completely out of the film and makes you pity the cast. It also lacked pacing, it wandered, it repeated, and it just failed to build any real momentum. Average action sequences seem so out of place this late in the summer. Bigger and better films had already raised the bar and Cowboys &amp; Aliens just couldn't give audiences anything as good in terms of action. Brooding and wild alien crap may eat up screen time but it doesn't add any real depth.A film with no depth that feels tedious and delivers no fun at all.</fullReview>

The movie had a decent plot and Daniel Craig carried off the lead role well. Harrison Ford was good, too. It all boils down to implausibility. The aliens had weapons, but chose to fight the humans by tackling them in the climactic battle. That's because they underestimated humans, I guess. The part where someone is really an alien in human form was wretchedly stupid. The aliens were too grotesque to be intelligent beings....they ran like cheetahs, were built like gorillas, had crablike faces, sticky arms that popped out of their intestines...c'mon, guys. And an outlaw gang with 30 members??? Ten would be pushing it, don't you think?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth May Be More Nigh Man Than He Realizes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In watching "Cowboys and Aliens" some similarities come to mind. They referred to the aliens as demons. The demons wanted to steel gold. They snatched humans away from their spouses, and from their children. They held their minds. The eyes of the "snatched" appeared soulless. The appearance of the aliens were large, powerful; and to some, intimidating and terrifying. Science fiction, somewhat, mirrors reality. The word of God (Revelation 12:7) says, "And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found anymore in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him." Demons are real. They do seek to overtake humans. They do not need spaceships to get around. We see in Job 1:6-12, "Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them. And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it." Here we see Satan before the LORD in heaven. We hear him tell the LORD he has "been going to and fro in the earth, and ... walking up and down in it." We see he can travel from earth to heaven without a spaceship. Jesus referring to Satan as the thief reveals Satan's goal: "The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and destroy." (John 10:10) Jesus also refers to Satan as a murderer and a liar. (John 8:44) I Peter 5:8, says, "Be sober, be vigilant; because you adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:". Satan and his demons seek man. Satan has a will to capture men: "And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will." (II Timothy 2:26) Those in "Cowboys and Aliens" were being snatched away against their will. The aliens wanted gold. Satan and demons want a righteous man's gold. Jesus said, "I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich..." (Revelation 3:18) Gold being the true faith; that faith which nothing on earth, or things not of earth, can destroy. (Also, I Peter 1:7) The aliens wanted to steal mans gold. In reality, Satan and his demons want to steal mans faith in Jesus Christ; which faith brings salvation. How to overcome the aliens in "Cowboys and Aliens" is different than overcoming Satan and demons. There is no weapon that can kill or destroy man's chief enemy, Satan; there is only one weapon given unto man to overcome him - faith in the Word of God, Jesus Christ. In the end, Jesus Christ with His armies from heaven, will smite the nations with a sharp sword that goes out of His mouth. Jesus being the Word of God. (Revelation 19:11-21) In the final battle, Satan will seek once again to deceive the nations, but, "fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them." (Revelation 20:1-15) In the end of "Cowboys and Aliens" a normalcy began for the town again. I'm not saying a righteousness, but a new beginning.(Ir reminded me of what is said in Revelation 22:11. It made me wonder, after man has fought an enemy, without conversion to truth, there is no real, eternal victory; but, after God's final victory, there will be "a new heaven and a new earth." (Revelation 21-22) It will be new; no sin, no curse, no death, no sorrow, no sickness, no crying. etc. We will dwell in righteousness. I found "Cowboys and Aliens" to have elements of truth in it. Truth may be more nigh man than he realizes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an enjoyable blockbuster. Its not going to set the world on fire but it delivers in all the areas it should (action, characters you get behind and modest special effects).I was glad to see Harrison Ford get a bit closer to form as after Indy I thought he couldn't hold the camera anymore, but hes coming back round. Daniel Craig does the distant stranger role well. As always with alien films the start is stronger than the finish, lots of suspense and uncertainty, then you see the alien are slightly disappointed that its just a moody overgrown frog.But regardless, you are taken along with the journey (the steamer scene is good and tense) and root for some characters (Sam Rockwell's downtrodden barkeep and the young lad). The plot twist is a bit leftfield and unnecessary. The finale isn't handled the best and maybe they could have dropped twenty minutes from the whole shebang, but still worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cowboys &amp; Aliens is not for everyone. It was created for one specific audience: Western/Sci-fi fans. If you aren't fond of either, don't bother seeing it.I, however, am I huge fan of both. The movie started out boring, but once the action came in, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The only problem with this movie is that there was more action then working on the plot and background of why everything was happening.The action made up for that though. There were explosions and shootings happening everywhere. The aliens were not shown in the film as much as I would've liked, but the cowboys were the best I've seen.My only piece of advice for anyone who is thinking about watching this film: Don't watch it if you aren't a fan of Sci-fi/ Western action movies.The other reviews are useless. Not every movie is going to be made for every audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cowboys &amp; Aliens-- two great tastes that taste great together. The cowboys seem to be a homage to many classic westerns, while the aliens are pretty generic, but both workable and believable, if, again, a little flat as far as motivations go-- they want gold, which is a commodity to them as well, and are willing to kill to get it. this is one of two plot points i would have liked to see expanded on. the weapons are realistic, with the arm cannon used by the aliens being used primarily as a wrist computer but also as a self-defense weapon, the kind of multitasking you would expect from lightly equipped and probably cash-strapped miners. weapons overall were rare, as could be expected from miners who were going into a lightly populated region. the classic "rock beats laser" crap is averted-- the cowboys beat the enemy with tactics, skill and a little bit of captured equipment. the other plot point that i wanted expanded on, as i mentioned earlier, was Olivia Wilde's character, a shape-shifting alien that came to earth to help the earthlings prevent the world destruction she escaped from happening again. this back-story was interesting, but glossed over understandably for the sake of the main plot. along with the aversion of the classic "aliens land in exactly modern times and seek out the most iconic and heavily defended cities" device used in media, all of these points coalesce to make a fun and refreshing popcorn flick that is definitely worth a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cowboys &amp;....Aliens?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A funny thing happened to me at the local cinema the other day. Just as I rounded the corner from the concession counter nibbling on a chocolate bar I had purchased, a youngster eating from a jar of peanut butter ran full speed right into me and knocked us both to the ground. We were both uninjured, but my chocolate bar had become embedded in the lad's peanut butter. Carefully extracting my dark confection from the goober paste, I sampled it. You know what? It was pretty good.My actual experience at the movie theatre entailed the viewing of Cowboys and Aliens, directed by Jon Favreau. Mr. Favreau, who previously directed the highly successful Iron Man movies, has imaginatively blended the respectively entertaining genres of westerns and science fiction into a solid work that pleases the viewer. Based on the graphic novel of the same name, Cowboys and Aliens is the story of an extraterrestrial incursion into 1873 Arizona (though it was spectacularly filmed in New Mexico; one of the great charms of the movie). When the sinister aliens abduct the townsfolk of the mining town of Absolution (along with a few neighboring Apaches), curmudgeonish cattle king Colonel Dolarhyde and mysterious drifter Jake Lonergan ally to combat the invaders. Joined by the equally mysterious Ella, an outlaw gang, and a band of Apaches, the earthlings endeavor to rescue their people and drive the bad guys back to outer space.The film's characters are the driving force. Academy Award nominee Harrison Ford (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Witness) simmers as Col. Dolarhyde, and Daniel Craig (Layer Cake, the new James Bond) turns in an excellent yet subtle performance as the enigmatic Jake Lonergan. They are joined as headliners by Hollywood's new "it" girl, Olivia Wilde (Tron), who flawless beauty aside, is respectable as Ella. Other strong actors who will be recognizable to the audience include character actor Clancy Brown (Highlander, Extreme Prejudice, Shawshank Redemption), as the preacher, Sam Rockwell (Charlie's Angels, Conviction) as Doc, Adam Beach (Smoke Signals, Flags of Our Fathers) in the role of Dolarhyde's Native American right-hand man, and Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine, There Will Be Blood) as the colonel's son. A strong cast submits a fine performance in a story that could easily be subject to question.The cinematography of this work soars, as the camera work turns the New Mexico landscape into almost another great character. The dusty plains, juniper-dotted hills, dry arroyos, and distant mountains come alive through excellent photography and the artful use of the great light that is ubiquitous in the Land of Enchantment. The viewer can almost smell the pinon, and you will swear you have to wipe the dust from your face when you leave the theater. Even a person who is not a connoisseur of this type of movie should be able to enjoy the scenery that envelops and cushions the story.What's not to like about the movie? Nothing overwhelming. The presence of five writers on the screenplay occasionally creates a sense that the story is being pulled in different directions. Some of the elements necessary to a western film can lend an air of triteness to the skeptical, and quite honestly, I would like to have seen better aliens. Favreau's gold-mining extraterrestrials look like a cross between the alien from Steven Spielberg's recent Super 8 and the Rancor monster from Star Wars Return of the Jedi, with certain appendages that come into play only through an anatomical mechanism reminiscent of the bad vampires in Blade II. I'm sorry, but I like to think of aliens that are capable of traveling light years to eradicate mankind as looking a little less brutish and a little more cerebral. Finally, the characters' overly good looks and perfect smiles (particularly Ella's blinding white teeth) suggest that 19th century Arizona was either a place devoid of poor oral hygiene or the world Mecca of cosmetic dentistry.In a work that could easily be construed as a dubious premise, the plot holds up. Action-adventure aside, it contains elements that represent profound and timeless themes. We see the redemption and reconciliation of men who had previously done wicked things, the maturation of a prodigal son, and even a suggestion of the eternal nature of the spirit as subscribed to by different faiths. The movie portrays enemies coming together based on their common humanity and strongly reminds us the poignant lesson of the Golden Rule, via its tacit commentary on manifest destiny (is Stephen Hawking listening?). While this film may indeed be the stuff of graphic novels, it is no comic book.Western movies are a staple of the American spirit. Films such as Unforgiven, True Grit, and Dances With Wolves have not only entertained, but also drawn the praise of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences. Over the past thirty years, science fiction has become an increasingly popular genre, with the Academy noting works such as E.T., Avatar, and District 9. With a stroke of cinematic genius, Jon Favreau has combined the two into a highly entertaining amalgamation that honors both while taking viewers to a new place. Like chocolate and peanut butter; not bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>14-year-old Raven Devanney, a KIDS FIRST! Film critic reviewed it this week. Here's a link to her videotaped review http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxEwtAIfczE and below is her written review: If you love action packed adventures then 'Cowboys and Aliens' is the perfect film for you!I'm actually pretty impressed with this movie because I think the concept of throwing together two separate genres like westerns and Si-Fi is an interesting idea but I didn't think there would be much more to the film then explosions and gun fights. However the story line is much more entertaining than I expected.I think the visual aspects of this film are good because the aliens are relatively creepy and the design of their ship is really cool. If you're into horror films (like me) then the aliens won't be that impressive to you, but if you are easily frightened then some scenes may seem a bit intense.My favorite character is the preacher because he seems a lot more compassionate and caring then most of the other characters. Something that I think is very unrealistic is in the final battle scene when the humans start defeating the aliens. In the beginning of the scene the humans are totally getting crushed by the aliens (which makes sense since they are practically killing machines) then the humans start winning which is odd considering their weapons are far inferior to the aliens. Obviously there isn't be much of a movie if the aliens conquer the world; it just seems a bit unrealistic.This movie is for ages 13 and up because there is some inappropriate language and it is very violent. Overall, I give 'Cowboys and Aliens' 3 out of 5 stars because personally I'm not that into Si-Fi, but if you are, you'll definitely enjoy it!Raven Devanney, age 14, KIDS FIRST!

		<shortDescription>Neat high-concept blockbuster that's very entertaining in my opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Bond and Indiana Jones are thrown into a "War Of The Worlds" scenario set in the Wild West. This concept is utter nonsense at first glance, but under capable hands it can make for a very entertaining thrill ride. With a title like "Cowboys and Aliens", I paid to see cowboys and aliens. And that is exactly what I got.What startled me, though is that the comments and most of the critics have been unkind to this movie. Yes, it has its faults, but boring isn't one of them. But then again, one would expect a concept this ridiculous to have a light-hearted, Spielberg-like atmosphere around it. The only thing Spielbergian about this movie is the great special effects, and that's it. The western aspect is nothing new - straight out of any classic Western film, but it is executed in a similarly serious tone to that of Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven" - ambiguous lead characters, some dry humor here and there (no wonder the characters and the script were thought to be "bland") and realistic Western settings - at least for the first third of the movie. Once the aliens start to appear things quickly shift into mindless fun territory. Yes the script has problems but what other blockbuster doesn't? ("The Dark Knight", maybe)The action sequences and special effects are engaging, and they are handled with a lot of energy by Jon Favreau and his team. Daniel Craig makes for a convincing action hero with his accent completely unrecognizable, although Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde's characters are somewhat underused (Craig, Ford and Favreau should make more western films, not necessarily together but that's OK too). Harry Gregson-William's score is good and does the job, but I really adore the production design/value and Matthew Libatique's great cinematography - it looks like a real Western.So in short, I got my money's worth. I think the problem is that people were expecting something light-hearted like "Silverado" meets "War of the Worlds", but got instead "Unforgiven". It was a risk that Favreau and the screenwriters dared to take, but the result is a unique hybrid of serious Westerns and alien invasion flicks. It's great entertainment, and people should not have any expectations and go in and watch this movie with an open mind.Overall rating: 72/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had I seen just the plot description, I would have not considered this for a second but....Stephen Spielburg, Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig...these guys don't do rotten movies, so I took a chance. I was glad I did. It is not "great serious cinema", but it is a good two hours worth of entertainment. This movie does require the willing suspension of disbelief but once the general premise is swallowed, the rest is somewhat plausible. The action is great. Sets and costuming are traditionally Western/Sci-fi. Monsters were not outright copies of something else. Character development is workmanlike. Good popcorn ending. Daniel Craig carries over his Bond fighting skills and, my god does he remind me of Steve McQueen! Western shots include a lot of the John Ford Big Sky/wide vistas stuff with bands of riders going forth (good stuff for Saturday afternoons). Alien motivation is not too far-fetched. Gold is an unique element and just may be suitably rare in outer space.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like cowboy and Indians stuff and I like sci fi movies, those are actually my favorites. I didn't think that the concept of putting cowboys and aliens in the same movie could work. Man, I was I wrong! It seemed so natural, I forgot all my initial objections minutes into the movie. I think it was cool that the main guy from James Bond didn't play it looking all handsome, but looked beat up for a lot of the movie. And that chick being an alien in the end really threw me for a loop. No way did I see that coming! I knew she was different, but not from another planet different. When she came out of the fire, alive, I was like WTF. I liked the gruff Harrison Ford character, he was cool. I liked that he was nice to the Indian guy when he was dying. I have relatives like that. They can't show their emotions, but you know they really like someone and, from time to time, they soften up. I really liked all the characters. For a movie that mixes up cowboys and Indians with aliens, it is as believable as can be. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read this review of C&amp;A calling it ridiculous garbage. (http://www.searchindia.com/2011/07/30/cowboys-and-aliens-review- %E2%80%93-ridiculous-garbage/) Here's what he says:"The movie was clichés galore.? Harrison Ford gives a knife to a kid asking him to be a man and use it when needed. When the time comes, the Kid uses it to kill an Alien.? There is another guy whose wife is captured by Aliens. He is trained to use guns but he is a lousy shot. You know he will get it right when the time comes and he does it.? There is more to the mysterious Ella than what meets the eye. You know it and you get it.""Some things were downright ridiculous:? The Aliens are supposed to be more advanced than Humans of 1800s but what you see is a bunch of drunken gorillas running around crazy.? Why does Jake get thumped in the skull all the time when a bunch of new people walk into the screen?? How come a hardened criminal becomes a goody two shoes after a thump in the head resulting in memory loss?? The bracelet on Jake's hand does not come off no matter what. Ella solves the problem in seconds by Kissing Jake and the bracelet simply falls off.? The Aliens come to earth to collect gold. Humans are captured merely for study.? The half-wit villagers chase away a few aliens with sticks and stones! Most of the action scenes were greeted with laughter in the theater where I watched the movie."So let me get this straight: You complain when "there is another guy whose wife is captured by Aliens. He is trained to use guns but he is a lousy shot. You know he will get it right when the time comes and he does it." because it's cliché, but you whine when "the half-wit villagers chase away a few aliens with sticks and stones!" (a welcome break, in my opinion) because it's NOT a cliché??Apparently, to be considered a good 'critic', you have 'criticize'. And when a good movie like this one stares at you in the face, you just have to find something wrong with it. This movie was great in every way; it had a good plot, blessedly free of clichés, I loved seeing Harrison Ford back in business, all in all, a thoroughly entertaining movie. So ignore the self-important 'critics' and go watch this. I highly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not horrible, but still bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes westerns and sci-fi, are not always an interesting mix. Case in point Wild Wild West(1999), and Jonah Hex(2010). But I became interested in this, because director Jon Favreau was attached, the director of Iron Man 1 and 2(2008-2010) and ELF(2003). And stars like Harrison Ford, who you probably know is no stranger to sci-fi adventure, Daniel Craig and Olivia Wilde.The problem with this is, the story feels so half baked, like the story does not seem finished. Jon Favreau direction does alright some parts, but the other part it seems lazy. Effects are okay in spots. But some of the characters logic, never are fully understood. Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, and Olivia Wilde do alright for the material they are giving. I'll give it credit, it never tries to get silly, but still not a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than I was led to believe by the trailer and a review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard about this story being made into a film years ago and loved the idea. It fell off my radar until I saw the trailer. The trailer was a a letdown though and I didn't like the fact that it was starring Daniel Craig (a good actor but not my first choice) much either. This was followed by a pre-release online review that was less than favorable along with the recent flop Battle LA which I had high hopes for (get real, invading earth to boost water?) so I really didn't expect much but paid my $ anyways. So much for the trailer, Daniel Craig, and the bad review and my angst over the recent run of bad Sci Fi plots. Now for the actual movie: Bottom line it was highly entertaining and I left the theater feeling more than satisfied. The alien motivation for being on earth actually made sense for a change and other than a few non-realistic moments it really worked. And my original interest in the concept I'd heard about years ago was sated and Daniel Craig turned out perfect for the part!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fun the Summer deserves.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford star in the latest from Jon Faverau, Cowboys and aliens, a fun and exciting sci-fi western that came just in time for the end of the Summer. The Summer's had its ups(Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II and Super 8)and downs(Green Lantern, Fast five), and even though Cowboys and aliens isn't perfect, its the fun that Americans deserve.Craig plays Jake Lonerghan, an outlaw who wakes up with amnesia and a mysterious silver bracelet on his arm. Apparently, he was really bad, so the townsfolk don't treat him very nicely. But once the aliens come and attack the western town, then everybody must put aside their differences and fight.The cast is fun: We got Craig playing a cowboy, and we all know him as James Bond. We got Harrison Ford as the grouchy town sheriff, Dolyrhyde. We got Oliivia Wilde playing a townswoman who grows a crush on Jake, we also got Sam Rockwell, and other people to add on.Cowboys and aliens has a silly but fun premise that never dies out. There is a lot of excitement and a lot of thrilling moments, and an interesting origin story to say the least. Plus, there are some funny moments, and some moments that just jump out at you.Faverau has made a fun if not a bit uneven genre mixing film that the Summer deserves, and trying to figure it out is fun also(though I didn't get bits of it). It's good to see James Bond and Indiana Jones fighting together, and you won't get it that often. I say see it.B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wild wild west 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie reminded me of the Will Smith movie flop from a few years ago.A bizarre and unsatisfying mix of western and science fantasy that basically ends up as a stupid waste of time.I thought Favreau had messed up with Iron Man 2 and this film confirms that opinion. It's big and loud but not much fun.The best thing about the movie is Harrison Ford who brings an old pro's grace to this rubbish just as he did with other turkeys such as Devils Own. Daniel Craig does his usual schtick. I had only seen Olivia Wilde in The Next Three Days before this and predicted great things for her but may have to reconsider that after cowboys and aliens. She is much less natural and likable in this, maybe not even as pretty. I suppose that could be the result of the awful script and direction.There was a time when anything Ford was in was entertaining..that time ended a long time ago and doesn't look set to come back anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie in theater with expectation to see an interesting mixture of old and new, but failed. There is nothing new in this movie. You feel that only an old average Hollywood just seen. The climax also lacs excitement. Story could not tell about why aliens come and why collect gold ? Leading lady role is not properly written. There are numerous questions and no answers. All over it was a waste of time experience. Only Craig's role is impressive rather that bond! Famous Harrison Ford lacs its form. I recommended to see viewers 'Source code' or 'Thor' or 'Tron' for good entertainment. As our Hindi"Nam bade aur darshan khote"(big name with no impact).</fullReview>

Many say they thought it was ridiculous, and I'm sorry... so is the thought of cowboys fighting off aliens... so it's no ones fault but your own if you didn't like this movie. Don't see things like this without the assumption that your going into a wild and ridiculous romp. For me, I got just what I wanted: FUN. I loved all the characters, Daniel Craig was great. Harrison Ford delivered as usual, LOVE HIM. I thought the movie was a great time :D Sci Fi fans will love it, I know I did!</fullReview>

The people who are writing bad reviews are people who went to the wrong movie, they should go to something like the piano or some other move that's more serious! What were you expecting! Its a film about the wild west and an alien race attacking them! It's an action film, not a thinking film! People are complaining that everything wasn't explained. Did it really matter?? It went from start to finish and it did it well. Look, if your looking for a film to just sit down and enjoy without looking into every little detail, then go to it. And if your unsure.. well look at the title.. cowboys and aliens!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favreau's best since "ELF"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cowboys &amp; Aliens was Favreau's (Elf) response to Alien, a gore-fest pulling out all the stops to surpass its inspiration. What results is at times bottom-of-the-barrel fare, but occationally rises to abject mediocrity.The main attraction of this film is its gruesome death scenes, which range from people being burned alive to being tied down and devoured by space cattle. The blood flows freely, with a death scene roughly every five to ten minutes. The special effects, though not award winning, are adequate, with some good moments provided courtesy of a seasoned Spielberg.However, all this does not a good science fiction movie make. For something to be truly frightening, we need to care about the characters involved. These characters are only developed enough to foreshadow how they'll die. Furthermore, although there are some good supporting performances by Harrison Ford, Ray Winstone, and Daniel Craig, the leads are bland and uninvolving. Favreau, for his part, proves once and for all that as an actor, he is an inadequate director who should stick to holiday films about tired-out SNL alumni acting as fairy folk.Moreover, there are odd points in the script that are never explained, such as one character's fondness for shurikens, and the constant burning of corpses by the posse. Ultimately, this film is worth a rental on a dull night, but not much else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less that anticipated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, going to a theater should be perfect. If you have a decent home theater with solid spacial sound reinforcement, you can guess at the disappointment I felt when even after complaining to workers, the audience was denied the full experience of a front left audio channel. For a first run of a blockbuster feature film it is unforgivable that a large movie complex with huge screens don't check EVERYTHING before opening the doors. Sad.Since the first teaser that aired last year I was on hook for this. The cast looked like a great constellation and the story twisted the cowboy story so seductively that I really did have high hopes (even more than Potter if you can believe that). I watched the featurette and was pleased that it was done in the wild for the most part and not on a stage with nothing but blue-screen surrounding the characters. I agree with Mr. Ford, how can you act when you can't really see who you are acting with? But a big budget, great support crew, creative writers and outstanding cast do not guarantee the kind of movie that made you reel in your seat like the first Jurassic Park. Mr. Favreau seems capable of a big budget film, but it is like since the premier of Iron Man, his respect for the industry has fallen into mild sensationalism.Scripting molded some solid character development. Daniel Craig's enigmatic bad man with no memory, a tight mouth and easily irritable personality was perfect. Harrison Fords grizzly old curmudgeon shows he had this character in his pocket: Crunchy on the outside, a marshmallow on the inside. The CGI was suitable and all interaction between human and alien at home. All the supporting cast well chosen, so what was wrong with this film not to wow critic posting to the various boards world-wide? There were awkward moments throughout the film, and whether they were intentional or perceived as good by the production crew, they were not received inspirationally by the viewer base. They were all technicalities that I felt if director, producers and execs had a chance to view the takes (after the editors did their magic) would have taken it back to ... how did it go in Spider-man? Back to formula? I will not address those moments here, as I would have to tag the Spoilers box, but the whole movie just didn't "breath" normally.Yet the movie is much better than just good. It holds together very well and overall presentation should satisfy more of the common population that are not overly critical and shoot first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holy cow was this a fun summer blockbuster! It kind of grabs you by the throat right off the bat, releases it's grip a few times so you can catch your breath, and then squeezes hard at the end. It's got everything - action, comedy, romance, drama, pain, joy. Lots of characters with their own stories; but Daniel Craig shines as the eternal bad ass that he excels at.I love that everyone in this movie is fallible. As one character says "Good people do bad things; bad people do good things". No one is cookie cutter goodie or baddie. They're human beings, so they have both capable within them.My husband was practically bouncing in his seat during the action sequences. Funny, so was the guy behind me. And I think a guy to my left... The fights were realistic to the point where I was wincing. There was applause and cheering when the movie was done, and plenty of laughing and gasps throughout. My husband is grabbing his guy friends and going to see it again this week. I on the other hand am grabbing my girlfriends and going to see it too. Ha.*Spoiler. My husband's favorite part - the humans fighting the aliens get their families back at the end. Except for Daniel Craig's character - the traditional lone gunman of all the westerns. Even the music cue as he's silently watching them all reunite - perfect.Go see it! Go see it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what exactly I was expecting but it didn't quite reach the mark. I enjoyed it but didn't LOVE it. Towards the end in the action it began to remind me of The Goonies. The fact that there were cowboys, Indians, bandits &amp; aliens was a plus! The acting was good, the casting was excellent, the script was OK. Not really believable as there were records kept at that time. Unlike Stargate or something where it left you with a thought process afterward. I wasn't really that keen on the cinematrogragy either. Just purely for entertainment. Certainly good for a escaping on a hot afternoon. I probably would not want to see it again though.

		<shortDescription>Actually Pretty Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie has far less comedy than you'd expect from a movie called "Cowboys and Aliens" it's actually pretty good.The movie paces itself more like a western than an action or science fiction movie, and it's more character oriented than your standard action sci-fi film. The characters in the film are definitely taken from western archetypes (i.e. the mysterious stranger, the rich old man who owns the town, the spoiled brat son), but they're all well acted, and well rounded characters. They all come across as three dimensional people rather than cardboard cutouts which is a definite plus. None of the characters really annoyed me (who weren't supposed to annoy me).The movie comes across as a good, standard, character driven western first, with aliens thrown in as the bad guys instead of a band of rustlers or miscreants.The action scenes are very well done. The CG shows a bit on a few of the aliens, but not to the point where it prevented me from enjoying the film. Some viewers might be turned off by the more character driven story expecting a slam-bang action adventure blockbuster, but if you give it a chance it's not really a bad film. It's just more character driven than action driven. That's not to say there isn't action, and that's not to say the action scenes aren't well done, but they're just spread out more. I also like that I can follow the action scenes in this film without having to guess what the main characters are doing (unlike a few films I've seen where the editing is so choppy I can't tell what exactly the main character in the fight is doing).The story is pretty straightforward, and I can't point out any major plot holes on the first viewing. People will either buy into the reason the aliens are in the old west, or they won't. People will either buy into the sci-fi elements of the script, or they won't. It really depends on how much you're willing to suspend your disbelief. If you just accept the reason the aliens are there, then you'll probably be able to get into the story. If you don't...well... then... you won't.There are some very atmospheric scenes in the film, especially a very good sequence in an overturned river boat, but the film as a whole does rely a bit too much on jump scares with the aliens. It didn't really annoy me, but I noticed they used the trick a little much.If something really hurts this movie it'll be the expectations of a viewing audience. I think people will go into this expecting a fun, silly blockbuster with plenty of humor and tons of CG action. It's actually a standard western with a more character driven story, a straightforward plot, some very good (but more spread out) action scenes, and aliens as the bad guys.I'd recommend it if you are interested in a fairly standard (but good) character driven western and don't mind that the bad guys are aliens instead of people. If you want a goofier, more popcorn fun action flick with tons of humor and CG, I wouldn't recommend it because that's not what this movie is.8/10 - Actually pretty good, depending on your expectations and how much you're willing to suspend your disbelief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Franchise?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people are hating on this movie, saying it's really stupid just because of its title and the plot, but what people don't see is how ingenious the story really is. Cowboys &amp; Aliens is almost exactly what it sounds like; a movie about cowboys &amp; aliens. But when you watch it, the plot thickens and becomes something in the vein of "Inception," having many twists and turns that ultimately lead to one big concluding fact.The story is not the only thing to praise; characters help shape the plot for this movie. Daniel Craig was perfect as Jake Lonergan, a man who has lost memory and sets out on his own personal quest to find out his identity, but not before running into trouble in the little town of Absolution, where a bounty on his head has been presented to the sheriff. Then there's Harrison Ford as Col. Woodrow Dolarhyde, the man Jake supposedly stole gold from, and happens to be the one who 'controls' the town. Throughout the movie, their relationships change with the other characters as they begin to realize what kind of men they are meant to be.Overall, with the original take on the sci-fi &amp; western genres, a classical score, memorable characters, and a witty script, Cowboys &amp; Aliens has proved itself to be a fantastic summer blockbuster and hopefully will become a franchise, having much more to explore as there are still holes to be filled and conflicts to be resolved.9/10 Stars***</fullReview>

If he ever gets the emotional part of the movie to be the driving force....&amp; gets his very bright ideas to seam together just right.....I think he could make a movie thats as unbelievably good as most folks think this one is.Lets see - the story of a reptilian race seeking to take over the world by hiding behind human form. Now, where have we heard that before...?? The people incharge are completely invested in that tech and they don't want to loose power. We need to evolve into a currencyless society. Think about it. Enlighten yourself. as of now we are slaves, etc. ad infinitum.Cut to the Arizonian ranch house....I thought for sure a scene from a Sam Witwicky movie got cut in by mistake here...all the CGI in place of actual plot or story....I guess this was an action movie as well with the tumbling and crashing &amp; well, you know.This movie could very easily be summed up as a dream somebody had....somebody that you never see in the movie...just somebody's dream. And some people think it was that.You have to give Favreau (Elf) credit for a lot of his ideas, really good production values, and other movie making strengths. I thought it went way overboard with the complexity of who is the alien &amp; who is the cowboy. You could go on &amp; on about this...but I guess you get my drift.I think Favreau (Elf) has has the talent to make a great movie...but I think it will have to get people in their emotional core &amp; I don't think he has done that yet. I liked "Elf" when "The Buddy" character was in the scenes...too bad about Ferrell...he was really showing some acting chops big time.I probably would have thought this movie was a lot better when I was an infant but then the loud sounds would have harmed my tiny ears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere out West. Man (Craig) wakes up in the desert, bleeding. Weird metal manacle on his wrist. Doesn't know who he is. Doesn't know how he got there. Kills some passing lowlifes. Rides to the nearest town: Absolution.Ordinary kinda place. Usual kinda folks: kindly preacher (Clancy Brown), fretful barkeep-cum-doctor (Sam Rockwell), dog-tired sheriff (Keith Carradine), purty mystery lady Ella (Olivia Wilde), young troublemaker (Paul Dano).Turns out the latter boy's untouchable, bein' son of local bigwig Dolarhyde (Ford) an' all. Figures he can push the stranger around. Figures wrong. Turns out it's Jake Lonergan - a bigger villain than old man Dolarhyde.So just another day in Absolution. Til nightfall that is, when a bunch of machines swoop down from the sky, blow the town to smithereens and make off with half the people usin' some kinda fancy lassoes.Aliens. Doggone.Only thing that'll stop 'em is Jake's fancy wrist cannon. So if they want their folks back, everybody's gonna have to put their differences aside and posse up to track them unidentified flying varmints down.Along the way, Jake gradually gets his memory back. Runs into his old gang too. And some Apaches.Also finds out what mysterious Ella's all about and what the ETs want (same thing as everyone else, truth be told).It's all based on one o' them graphic novels. But with a tale as outlandish as this, it proves a wise move to play it straight. Mostly.Course, there's a gutful of guffaws to be had, but it all pans out like 3:10 to The Alamo. With more alien splatting.Director Favreau has great fun with his flashbacks and dandy effects and such. Even throws in a few sly nods to the genre, yessiree.But what he needs is a manly, clenched jaw or two to carry it off. And what he gets in Craig and Ford. That's what they do.The set-up's terrific. Pacing's a mite skew-whiff though. The search and rescue bit kinda drags. Favreau needs to put his spurs in more often. Bringing the sheriff's grandkid along don't speed things along none either. Coulda made more use of the dog too.It ain't free o' clichés. But then what western is? Want a mash-up that does what it says it's gonna do? Saddle up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action heroes versus cowboys and aliens where thinking is not allowed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is actually just Daniel Craig versus cowboys and aliens. It's very handy that he has an alien countdown timer bracelet on his wrist that doubles as a special alien killing machine. It works better than guns and knives which is all that real cowboys have. But Jake Lonergan (Craig) doesn't know how he got that bracelet, or what his name is, or who he is. He does know English.It's lucky for us that he knows English because at every break in the action he can utter every cliché line imaginable ? but then again, what action movie is complete without "Let's get outta here!" being said at least once? The horrendous dialogue gives way to Indians speaking a made up language and disgusting aliens who don't speak but prod at you with three gooey fingers.The aliens are here to discover our weaknesses. Although we, as human beings (and especially the cowboys that are passed off as human beings in Hollywood movies), have a lot of weaknesses, at no point is there an examination of our weaknesses or how the aliens are going to exploit them. Obviously it was just said because that is what is supposed to be said in an alien movie.The mystery surrounding Daniel Craig's character in the beginning is then completely solved with a simple flashback soon after. I think at the 30 minute mark after we had a big battle between the cowboys and the aliens, the filmmakers then realized that Hollywood movies are supposed to be two hours long. So they then started a new nonsense story. This time surrounding Olivia Wilde's character since the target audience would rather see her naked than Daniel Craig. But just kidding, it's PG-13, there's no nudity."Cowboys &amp; Aliens" is a mix of western, science fiction and action, and you'll just have to watch to find out how they add vampires to that mix. No popular movie is complete without them. Olivia Wilde's character tells us the secret on how to view this, "you have to stop thinking." Literally. But why should I have to?</fullReview>

And, naturally I had high expectations for the movie. As each scene rolled out I hoped there would be some twist in the plot which would keep me interested. But alas, that twist never came. I wonder if someone held a gun (a bazooka perhaps) against Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and made them sign the contract for this movie. :) Very orthodox treatment, no great plot, very predictable ending, no or little character development, so so CGIs.

Daniel Craig is really trying to make a name for himself outside of the Bond films.I really think he's going to have the best post Bond career because he's such a great actor. His accent was on point and he picks up where Cling Eastwood left off with "the man with no name" type of character. Harrison Ford was effective as his nemesis but he tends to be grouchy in several of his films as of late.Olivia Wilde was OK, any number of actresses could've played that part. Jon Favreau, who I loved directing the Iron Man movies is trying to do something different and I applaud him for trying. The special effects are amazing. The aliens remind you of the creatures in Predator or Alien. This movie has potential to be a great TV show. Overall just silly Saturday afternoon fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before you see this movie, remember this - it's an action movie, with cowboys and aliens. It's Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig doing what they do best! Unlike some action flicks, this one actually has a plot and a unique story line. Sure, it isn't the most sensible movie ever made, some bits may seem a bit silly, but it's still a great movie. Movies are all about entertaining people, I found this extremely entertaining, so why doesn't everyone stop hating and just acknowledge the awesome action and fight scenes. The special effects are mind-blowing and the movie flows really well. There is no confusion but it doesn't feel patronising either, it's a straight forward shoot-em-up in the Old West... with aliens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is clearly not everyone's cup of tea. Despite the rating (6'ish is usually sufficient to put me off a film) my youngest, 11, and I went to see this on a wet August Saturday afternoon. We came out smiling, high fiving, recounting our favourite bits . The film has twists and scary moments and a good old hero versus villain storyline. The story makes complete sense from beginning to end. Daniel Craig doing what he does best - being tough. Harrison Ford - well he is Han Solo and Indiana Jones, and Olivia Wilde is gorgeous. The rest of the cast do a fine job as well. The direction is unexpected insofar as you expect Ironman but its not so slick and modern. It seems to be aged and is better for it. Clever.Having read some of the reviews I wonder if people expect too much from films. 3D, Inception, CGI. All good in their place but they are no substitute for a good story, with some good action, some scary moments and a little bit of love.Having seen Harry Potter and Planet of the Apes recently I would put this on a par with them, if not better. If I had to choose one of them to buy on DVD it would be Cowboys and Aliens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good - Would Watch It Again Sometime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, the premise of this movie, obvious from the title, does seem a bit silly. Don't get me wrong, I've always been a casual fan of the western, whose movie popularity has waned for years now. And I have always loved science fiction. Star Trek, Star Wars, and space related science fiction in particular has always fascinated me. But to combine the genres sounded a little off.But, I watched it recently and was pleasantly reminded how much I like Daniel Craig and Harrision Ford. Craig's Bond movies and Ford's Indiana Jones movies are films I would watch pretty much anytime, anywhere. And the reason is that those movies are exciting and improbably adventurous, but somehow made believable by the two fine actors.The same is true here. These guys are some of the best Hollywood has to offer and it shows, once again making a strange sounding or improbable concept come to life in a believable and enjoyable way.In my mind, the classic western has always had the grizzled and stoic hero, standing alone, or almost alone, against some undeniable and intolerable evil. Well, we got that here.Science fiction often, overtly or subtly, involves contrasting the advanced technology with the immature social and political knowledge of the times, or even some current social issue. This movie doesn't go overboard with the special effects, nor does it get preachy. It's just good, plain action and adventure.Besides the stars mentioned, there are some fine performances given by a variety of other actors, including Olivia Wilde, Walton Goggins, Sam Rockwell, and Noah Ringer (The Last Airbender). Olivia Wilde in particular has that something special about her (like Cameron Diaz and Brittany Murphy). And yes, there is enough drama to break up the action a little and help tie together the western and science fiction themes.This was enjoyable to watch and good enough to watch again sometime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bizarre thought of Cowboys and Aliens in one picture is the greatest thrill for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford in front of the lens and Jon Favreau at the back seat calling the shots; COWBOYS AND ALIENS yet to be released in the UAE is much anticipated by us as it was worldwide. One thing is for sure, there are cowboys and then there are aliens, there is sure fire action, there is some gnarly aliens with gooey stuff dangling out of them and there is indeed a collision of both sides. What you should not expect is an intellectual plot, space for character development and anything else other than a raw "you shoot I shoot" attitude. Thrilling to sit and enjoy and walk away thinking "everything in the title was present", most certainly this is not for those who are seeking entertainment on the pars of ALIEN (1979). I am sensing the best bet for that is to be patient until Ridley Scotts PROMETHEUS is released and boycott COWBOYS AND ALIENS.What was great and what was not?Great - The bizarre thought of Cowboys and Aliens in one picture is the greatest thrill for me. I was convinced that nothing can be worse than ALIENS VS PREDATORS. So if you like your aliens oddly combined with cowboys then it's one reason. The next is the very subtle comedy, it is so subtle that it was in fact nonexistent, however if you keep your eyes and ears sharply tuned and there will be few moments with Sam Rockwell. Also as much man would agree, there is always more pleasure when you can see what you're enjoying! As much as night time action sequences are effective in IRONMAN Jon Favreau has focused more on day time action sequences which is most welcome. I hate seeing the scariest alien to be killed in the sewers in deep blue lighting!Not - The plot seems to have been sketched by Charles from SUPER 8. Quite basic for a star cast and also can work quite negative with those viewers who look for depth in summer blockbusters. Alien presence is a little less with comparison to the over-does of Cowboys. Character depth and development does not seem to have been considered heavily to a point where the audience would begin to connect with one person.Jake (Daniel Craig) wakes up all Samantha who with a metallic device attached to his left arm. Never mess with a man who has no memory! Jake took 3 cowboys to the ground within 3 seconds after a very short confrontation and was soon on his way with a new set of threads and of course a stolen horse. Jake; a dispassionate cowboy rides onto to a small western village that I presume was somewhere in the mid or late 19th century. Here he meets Doc (Sam Rockwell) the towns' tavern owner, Ella (Olivia Wilde) the mysterious lady who hits him on the head from behind and Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) a very powerful businessman/ cowboy of the town at that time. All of them together run into the Aliens that very night. It was like a preplanned bon fire of the wild wild west! Apart from the metallic weapon attached to Jakes arm nothing can harm the body snatching aliens, which makes Dolarhyde and Jake best friends.Title: Cowboys and Aliens Directed: Jon Favreau Starring: Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Sam Rockwell &amp; Olivia Wilde Rated: PG-13 for intense sequences of western and sci-fi action and violence, some partial nudity and a brief crude reference Rated: 05/10 118 Minutes</fullReview>

Like any good western rough and tumble people eventually put aside their differences to fight a common enemy. There's plenty to like about this movie and Harrison Ford delivers in a supporting role.

		<shortDescription>Western for today's audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a western fan for the past 50 years, I miss that genre. This is a massively entertaining film that includes the explosions and futuristic technology necessary today, while presenting the elements of the classic western. Along the way the western watcher is treated to reminders of The Searchers, Broken Lance, The Big Country, etc. If you like westerns, you will see in this movie what many will miss. The subtlety is what makes in genuine instead of parody. There are a lot of characters and it takes time in the beginning to establish them so that their development has meaning. Even the use of the title "Colonel" has significance. Again, subtle. My only disappointment was that other members of the audience were not having as much fun as I. Hard to clap and cheer by yourself. If you miss the western, you must go see this film!</fullReview>

It's just like an American patched blanket written by a bunch of high school kids in a writing class, everybody throw in some ideas: Hey, how about a bunch cowboys mixed up with some aliens? Yeah, how about bandits? robbers? flying war crafts? tavern owner? preacher? mysterious woman? gold coins? Indians? Yeah, how about letting the guy have some special weapon on his left wrist? Yeah, cool. Apache with spy glass, rifles. How about joint venture or joint forces. Let's liberate Arizona like we try to liberate Iraq? First, we got to use the big slogan: "Fight For Iraq!" to protect and serve, man. We got to use the woman to become an interpreter who knows mucho languages. An alien fortress in the Arizona desert. Yeah, let those guys have some dynamite to blow up the alien fortress. This movie is not environmental "GREEN" either, 'cause they used lot of explosives in the Arizona wildness that disturbed and ruined a lot. All the aliens looked like a mixture of lobster, scorpion, grasshopper, crab, shrimp.....you name it, man.Not quite sure about what I'm saying here? That's quite right, because it's just like what the movie did to me. I didn't know what happened in the end, 'cause I walk out of in the middle.</fullReview>

C&amp;A has its usual set of clichés, but for the sake of fun - we sometimes start loving these clichés - be it the aliens capturing humans, cowboy racing along &amp; jumping on to the alien craft (in this case), gold rush, the- everything-collapses scene etc.After all, it brings in a lot of big names together - Jon, Spielberg, "Indiana" Ford, Daniel, Ron Howard,Wilde, Lindelof (surprise surprise) etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kudos to Jon Favreau and a wonderful cast for making this one of the best summer films in a while. I know the premise of this movie is hard for some people to swallow. It's not as realistic as humans that fall in love with vampires and werewolves, but it will do in a pinch. Everyone knows the premise already. The acting is great all around and the effects are spot on. Forget the old adult in you and go as a child with a wild imagination. You will enjoy the hell out of this film. The thing that made this film special to me were the back stories of Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig. Interesting that the hatred of these men could be put aside for a singular cause.</fullReview>

The film doesn't even tell why are those mining off gold. And another thing you'll notice is that like in the previous alien invasion movies for the past year, this film also features those alien spaceship capturing humans from above with those long mechanical wires. I have heard the producer saying that this film will have some new ideas, but I didn't find any. This film is not worth wasting your money.</fullReview>

This was Wild Wild West bad and even that awful film has a more intelligent premise and better dialogue and that really says it all.The movie starts out great as they really attempt to make it a Western and stick to Western sensibilities. Then, it degenerates in to a big fat throw-everything-at-the-screen-and-see-what-sticks insult. By the end you feel cheated of everything: fun adventure, a tangible sense of peril, anything approaching drama and even a sense of wonder. You experience or feel NONE of those things watching this movie. And, to add further tacky insult to this gaudily eye sore, it can't even be enjoyed by children, unless something is serious wrong with them. This movie gets caught in no man's land and I guess that surprises no one who has seen the trailers for it.</fullReview>

But it makes sense about the aliens that we have memories with it in the past that it is to live in an alien spacecraft that lost it. But overall I think it's good enough. However, the aura of alien creatures, it can also make movies mystery hidden fear and danger. The film itself will sag in the cowboy era. But there are these alien technology that has been immortalized not less. Most of the time the movies nominated for best picture I would care less to see, however, this movie is defantly one that grabbed my attention from the start and defantly deserves Oscar&#xfeff; and Golden Globe Gold.

This is a movie about cowboys (excellently played by the lovely Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford) and aliens, slimy "Alien" like creatures. It has a story! Those of you saying there's no reason for the aliens being there are nuts. They are there because it's a movie with aliens in it! And those of you trying to make this movie into some sort of cryptic message movie are also nuts. It's a story about these cowboys that encounter the aliens, fight them, win and then they go about being cowboys again. It's all so simple, no fuss, no muss! I say, go see this movie and enjoy it, it's a good movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is very good reason for the mixed reviews you read online.If you're just a Western movie fan, you'll find this plot absurd.If you're just an Action SciFi fan you'll likely be bored with the slower paced Western parts.The reason you're reading reviews that love or hate it is because this movie is for those that are fans of both Genres. It is nothing more than pure entertainment. Put all preconceptions aside, sit back and enjoy! Even though many Western fans claim there's no plot, they are wrong. Yes, it strays from the typical Cowboys &amp; Indians stories, but that doesn't make it worth 1 star. My Wife and I just saw it and we both loved it. We are both big Western AND SciFi fans.

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this film, I thought to myself?.. oh my, what's this?.. an original thought. A film that is not about a comic book, love gone wrong, love gone right or casual sex. If nothing else, this film was a break from the cookie cutter films that have been coming out lately. The title says cowboys and aliens and that is exactly what you got. There is no deep thought required. This film was just mindless fun that you can just sit back and enjoy. Will it go down in history as being a western classic? Heck No, but in several years to come you might find yourself turning to a friend or a relative saying something like, remember when they made that movie about cowboys and aliens???? I do have to admit that I was very excited about seeing James Bond and Indiana Jones in the same film. Daniel Craig (Jake Lonergan) and Harrison Ford (Colonel Dolarhyde) made a pretty good team and one was just as tough as the other. For a long time during the initial introduction of the aliens I found myself thinking that they are going to have to call on the x-men or at least Sigorney Weaver to handle this situation. There were a couple of mild surprises during the film, but for the most part it was pretty predictable. To be honest with you, I really did not care. I just wanted to see some cowboy fighting aliens. I would be remiss if I did not mention Adam Beach (Nat Colorado) and Keith Carradine (Sheriff John Taggart). I haven't seen either of them on the big screen for quite some time, so I was happy to see their reappearance. The one thing that this film did do well was that it explained all the aspects of the film. For instance, how did that bracelet get on his arm?. Why are aliens here?. What do they want? and why did he lose his memory. I hate it when I leave a film and there are questions unanswered. Did folks get up and cheer when this film was over?? no. Did I think that this is a film that I might want to see again?? no. Did the film feel like it was two hours long?? no. Was it enjoyable and did it get me out of the house for a couple of hours?.. yes. So, for the reasons mentioned above I am going to saddle up my horse and give this film an amber light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What did I think of it? Well the plot was good and I especially liked the Aliens, but the trailer gave it all away and I found myself sitting in the cinema waiting for the bits and pieces in the trailer to play out and I don't like doing that and I don't like predictable movies. I personally don't like the fact that Daniel Craig had two women in the movie and they both died. The jump factor out of five for me was three maybe even three point five, my sister was laughing at me because I was jumping out of my seat many times. I really loved Harrison Ford's role and loved the way he told the Indian man that he was the son he always wanted (I love movies that touch my heart like that) anyway, sorry for getting soppy and sentimental there guys. Overall it was a brilliant way to spend my Saturday evening and it was really entertaining. I definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cowboys and Aliens is a pretty good western and an overall decent movie that will keep audiences engaged and curious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The western genre was all but defeated when science fiction broke through to the mainstream with films like Star Wars in the 1970s and 80s. This is mostly because the tried and true formula of westerns was getting very stale and science fiction offered a way to tell similar stories in flashier and more robust ways. Many ideas and themes from old westerns still resurface from time to time these days(Firefly, Serenity) and once an a while there will be some very good westerns that manage to make their way into the theaters(3:10 to Yuma, Appaloosa, No Country for Old Men, True Grit) and become cult hits. With all of this said it was very intriguing that Jon Favreau as well as an all-star production team and an all star cast would be working together to make a movie that merged the western genre with the genre that essentially killed westerns. Cowboys and Aliens may seem like a ridiculous concept but because of all of the big names attached to the project it seems just as ambitious as it is intriguing. With writers Damon Lindelof(Lost; Star Trek), Alex Kurtzman(Fringe, Star Trek), and Robert Orci(Fringe, Star Trek), producer Ron Howard(Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind), director Jon Favreau(Iron Man), and the all star cast Daniel Craig(Casino Royale), Harrison Ford(Indiana Jones, Star Wars), Olivia Wilde(Tron Legacy), and Sam Rockwell(Iron Man 2, Moon) this movie definitely seemed to have more potential than most other films that were hitting the big screen this summer. Can Cowboys &amp; Aliens mesh the western and science fiction genres seamlessly or will is fall flat and fail to live up to its potential?Check out the rest on my film blog at: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-4p</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical summer movie that delivers what you expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was better than I thought it would be. The aliens being in the Old West cowboys era sounds really corny but its played straight and there are no lame jokes or stupid humor bits about it. The cowboys have suitable confusion and fear regarding the aliens and speculate they are evil demons of some kind which is plausible considering their historical era and what they might have thought back then confronted with this unearthly phenomenon.That said, the aliens themselves are designed badly and look cheesy and disappointing. Its too bad they look so ridiculous because it takes away the believability that the actors try so hard to present regarding the situation. Daniel Craig is decent as the lead character but I've never been a fan of his, however he is OK here as a world weary outlaw who is confronted with a bizarre and unexpected alien presence/invasion.I really liked the Indian Chief, I thought he was very good in his part and the movie became more interesting when he entered the picture. Meanwhile, Harrison Ford does a crotchety old man character who is set in his ways but may have a heart of gold and plays it pretty well.Some nice desert vistas and scenery really enhance the movie and give it an authentic Old West feel. I'm a sucker for Westerns so even with the absurd aliens in it I did enjoy this movie. It has some good action scenes in it and delivers what you might expect for a light summer entertainment outing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indy Meets Bond.... With Demons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just the title alone is awesome. I haven't seen a title this awesome since Snakes On A Plane! I was really psyched upon seeing this film, although I had different expectations from the man who brought you Ironman, I was still entertained.The film immediately opens to Daniel Craig waking up in a panic. He doesn't know who he is or how he got there. All he knew was that he has this metallic bracelet on his arm and he can't get it off. Three old guys on horses stroll by him and they aren't too friendly.... so 007 kills them. Pretty soon 007 runs into Indiana Jones' son (who isn't Shia Labitch) named Percy. This jerk likes to make everyone's lives in town miserable but 007 likes to beat him up every now and then. They both get thrown in jail and we are introduced to Indiana Jones looking like he could be the bad guy of the film as he interrogates somebody tied between two horses. When Indy finally confronts Bond, the aliens attack and steal Indy's son and the towns people's women. This is where Bond discovers that his bracelet can shoot projectiles and take down massive ships. Seeing that he is useful, Indiana Jones enlist the help of Bond, some bandits, and a pack of Indians to help take down this demon (not alien) menace and to save the people they love.Let me start out by saying that I was surprised on how much characterization this film had, especially Ford's character. He starts out as this rough and gruff Colonel who looks like he could backstab people in a heartbeat but his character becomes more human later on, and I found myself rooting for him. I always loved Harrison Ford, but this could be one of his best films to date. He was great!The film is entertaining, but I never felt like it was anything special. It was just a film that went on a certain course that never really felt big to me. I liked the comradeship on the film's third act against the aliens, but I was hoping that the film would take a different course and maybe put the cowboys in the alien spaceship itself, maybe even through space. The aliens themselves look good, but I was constantly reminded of the alien from Super 8 with these things. They pretty much have the same build.The film is entertaining and worth a watch. I didn't walk out of the theater thinking it was great but I didn't think it was bad, either. Still it's a welcome change to see Bond and Indy team up to take on the alien scum of the universe!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Bond meets Han Solo in this fun filled Western/Sci-Fi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the comic book of the same name, by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, Cowboys &amp; Aliens is an exciting adventure for sci-fi and western fans alike.The storyline for this movie was expectantly simplistic. The time and place is in the late 1800s of Arizona, and the aliens come down to try to conquer Earth.To the best of my knowledge, an alien and cowboy confrontation has never been seen before in the cinema. Surely we have seen sort of a hybrid with Star Wars, Serenity, and Star Trek. But, never actually cowboys mixed in with alien lifeforms.I can totally see the merit in why some critics were displeased by this sci-fi/western. Even with such a robust cast like that of Daniel Craig (James Bond), Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones/Han Solo), Olivia Wilde, and Sam Rockwell, the plot is left open with too many holes. Plot holes occasionally work in films, but this one was just blatantly annoying. You'll know exactly what I mean if you see this movie. And if you're able to ignore those open-ended questions, the movie is surprisingly enjoyable.Yet another midnight feature for me this summer and the audience is yet again the same! We hear a lot of laughter at the dialogue and Harrison Ford received a tremendous applause upon his character's first appearance. I was in complete agreement with the consensus of the audience.Harrison Ford reminded me of Han Solo so much. I loved it. I'm a much bigger Star Wars fan than Indiana Jones, so in turn didn't see much of Jones; but I know he was in there somewhere. And, obviously Daniel Craig was your James Bond figure with a Western-twist. Both actors did a splendid job. Olivia Wilde was a delight too. The iconicity of both Ford and Craig was uncanny.The director was Jon Favreau (Iron Man 1 &amp; 2, actor in Swingers), and I thought he did a valiant job once again. I enjoyed how he approached the physicality of battle between the aliens, American Indians, and cowboys. With the thought of never seeing it done before, it was all very plausible. We usually see confrontation displayed beside abundant amounts of CGI-generated special effects, and for the characters in Cowboys &amp; Aliens, it was not the case.I was also highly pleased before this movie that it would not be shown in 3-D. Favreau was very specific about how Western films are not meant for 3-D. So awesome! "That would be like filming in black and white and colorizing it" ~Jon Favreau.I will say that I was hoping for more aliens in this flick. It's about 70% Western and 30% Sci-Fi.7/10 Stars. (It's 8 Stars if ya completely ignore the plot.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow...another bad bad movie from the production house of spielberg after super 8</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>well i ll keep it short and simple - horrible. I have seen my share of both cowboy movies and alien ones. This is not even close to either. Complete waste of talent - ford and craig. I don't wanna add any spoilers here but its just funny to knw why aliens are on earth. I have seen them on earth for oygen (war of the worlds), sun-light (transformers), etc but this one has gone that extra mile.I am ashamed to say I was awaiting this movie since a couple of months now. All that wait for well utter disappointment.Folks do not waste your time and movie on this movie. I would not even recommend spending a buck for the DVD rental when it comes out on DVDs.I may be too harsh with my comments here but you can see how bad this movie has let me down. It true - there is a dearth of good movies out there nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of Daniel Craig films but this one I must admit I actually enjoyed.From the trailer and from what i'd heard around the web I was not expecting much at all from this. It's got guns ,aliens,cowboys,Injuns(^^) and a sexy alien .Yes, it may end in a result you were expecting but so do roller coasters . I'm not gonna give you a full lowdown on each character or the plot, i'm just gonna say if you want a decent action film then you could do worse than choosing this one.The effects are very good ,not too much like some films in these times of CGI. When I see this for a decent price on Blu-ray I'll be buying it . Don't believe the bad hype, judge it for yourselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why people are bashing this movie. I think I've read 20 reviews that ask, "Why do aliens need gold"? The answer: they don't have enough and they want some more. Who cares why they need gold? They do, and that's why they came to earth. The point in science fiction is not the science, it's the fiction. It's how people react to a previously unknown set of conditions.th. If they hadn't then the movie would be about thirty cowboys chasing baby bunnies through the desert.BTW, gold is very valuable in electronics, as it conducts electricity very well, does not corrode, is very malleable, and has a relatively low melting point.If you want to look for 100 technical plot holes in the movie, you can find them. If you want to call the ending improbable, you can. But calling the moving boring in inaccurate. I was totally enthralled for two hours.This movie contains every cliché known to both cowboy and sci-fi movies. The gritty ex-officer, ugly aliens with no language skills. But it's still funny as hell to watch a spaceship chasing a guy on a horse.Just go in and have fun for a while. Let the plot holes take care of themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Summer Popcorn Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you read this review, realize that the only Oscar noms this movie will receive is for its special effects. It was a fine summer blockbuster action movie. No, it was not True Grit or The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. But was it better than Transformers 3? You bet your a$$ it was. Daniel Craig, once again, delivers a solid performance in the role he played. It didn't unleash the potential of his talent (I'm waiting for David Fincher's version of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" to see that) but he perfectly fits as Jake Lonergan. Sure, the plot didn't exactly delve into why these aliens were so interested in gold, whether that be greed like human beings had for it during this era or a different explanation, but it did deliver on the action.Jon Favreau did a fine job blending in the two genres of western and sci-fi. He knew just when to pick up the pace and get the excitement going, and at the same time knew when to slow it down and develop the characters involved. Harrison Ford was...Harrison Ford. My only criticism was that Sam Rockwell was severely underused, much like he was in Favreau's Iron Man sequel. This guy's got talent and will show it off with the right role soon enough.If you're in the mood for an entertaining sci-fi actioner, this movie is a must see. If you want something with a little more substance, then go see "Another Earth", also a good film. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining with a few shortcomings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the title basically explains it all. There are cowboys and there are aliens. It was exciting and had a lot of sci-fi mysteriousness, with a more western backbone to the movie. The apparent problem was that they didn't seem to mix very well. There was the general western theme to the movie, with brief intense pieces of classic sci-fi alienery throughout. So if you want to see some good western shootouts, you will, however, with the other futuristic alien weaponry everything seems too out of place and does take a bit of the western magic away. All in all, you may just want to wait to see it on Netflix. There just seems to be no choreography between the two themes, which makes it... clunky (?) to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do Not Watch If You Are Irish-American</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was, very clearly, an allegory of the struggle Irish-Americans faced when immigrating from Scotland in the 1700's. The white man's oppression of them is portrayed as heroism in this film, and the Irish settlers have been depicted as little more than brainless, gold-gorging, alien monsters. Steven Spielberg probably has never even come close to dealing with actual subjects like oppression, segregation, and genocide, so the fact that he'd put his name on this movie does not come as a surprise. I normally only watch independent, thought-provoking movies, but I thought that, just this once, I would descend to the lower ranks of film film appreciation because I thought the title of the film was very Kafka-esque. I was wrong, the movie ended up being just another Hollywood hate-film packaged as independent, art-house, genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memo to Spielberg: No one is interested in your tired-out fantasies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can definitely expect nothing but loudness and trash from a movie that stars Daniel Craig, Sam Rockwell and Harrison Ford in the leads. More so if it's directed by Jon Favreau where one can additionally expect, with the sole exception of ELF (2004) retarded film-making. 'Cowboys &amp; Aliens' is pretty much a retarded remake of 'The Phantom Empire' (which itself was a mind-numbingly boring Gene Audrey movie). This one just has much more dishum dishum, loudness and epileptic seizures than its source. As bad as it is, the fast forward option on your remote control comes very handy. Unfortunately at the cinema you must wait out the bad spots. I liked the 'CGIs' that were visualized on alien ships. The rest of the CGIs are bad and quite unconvincing. Ford and Craig could not act their way out of paper bags and behave as epileptic cows who got stung on the ass by a swarm of bees. Wilde also does a couple of shake-the-fart-off moves, especially during the saloon scene. She recites her lines like a water-logged hippopotamus. The acting is expectedly abysmal except for Keith Carradine who plays the Sheriff with a T and Noah Ringer who is good enough except in the final scene. I can see why Juhi Chawla turned down the role of Alice.Except for Olivia Wilde's item number and her beauty, I didn't find anything appealing about this silly film. In my books 'Cowboys &amp; Aliens' is a loser. I am not a fan of Favreau's work. The Dark Knight was a film that I could never understand why there was so much hype. A pretentious, incomprehensible piece of retarded garbage, it was average to me, at best. ELF, however, is much better than the rest of his efforts all put together.It is a film that you must see just because the concept is very interesting, but it is not something that you can watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Was Hoping For Much More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ugh, this is one of those reviews I hate writing; critiquing something that's neither very good, nor particularly bad is hard, and that's where Cowboys &amp; Aliens stands. The film starts off well enough, there's some really great build up to both the mystery and to the central conflict; the opening scenes are everything I was hoping from this film. There are some great performances by Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and several other actors, and the classic Western vibe with a strange sci-fi twist works really well here. However, after the first act things start to slowly lose momentum. The narrative is fairly straight forward, and doesn't really have too many interesting twists and turns, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. On the same token, none of the characters really connected with me and the film never gave me a reason to care about them or their motivations. Again, neither of these things are particularly fatal in their own right, I've seen plenty of enjoyable movies that have either a simple narrative or characters who aren't properly fleshed out, but the problem here is that you have both issues simultaneously. It's hard to get caught up in the story because it's mostly straight forward and predictable, and it's hard to get emotionally invested in the characters because the film never gives them the time to connect with each other, much less the audience. As a result things just happen on screen for about two hours, and none of it is necessarily bad in any way, in fact it's sometimes quite entertaining, but as a viewer I was never given any reason to care about any of it and so it just ended up feeling hollow. And that's about all I really have to say. I know this is shorter than my first weekend reviews typically are, but I really don't have a lot to say about this movie, because I really don't feel like it gave me a lot. With the exception of the First Act nothing made me intrigued or emotionally invested or even particularly excited. I had high hopes for this movie, between a great cast, a great director, and an interesting and unique concept I thought this was sure to be one of the surefire home runs of the summer, but instead it's just severely underwhelming. Not bad, but not particularly good either, go see Captain America or Harry Potter instead (or Winnie the Pooh, if you can find a theater that's still playing it, I can't get over how clueless Disney was with the release date on that one, but I digress).

		<shortDescription>A great old fashioned western- with aliens!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An adventure that captures your curiosity and commands your attention. A couple of good stories within the story delivered with the kind of nuance that Ford, and more recently, Craig have built promising careers on. Cowboys &amp; Aliens; more satisfying than Joss Wheedon's "Firefly"... sorry Joss, I liked Firefly- just liked the action in Cowboys &amp; Aliens more. It doesn't always have to be the good guys vs. the bad guys only in a blinding, dazzling explosion of cataclysm but sometimes it can be fun. This is a pioneering revenger replete with brawls, laser guns, saddle-tramps, bandits, lawmen, monsters, underdogs, top-dogs, pretty gals, dusty trails, flying saucers, Indians, and pretty much everything else you can think of thrown in for good measure! The success of this picture stems from the balance and direction Favreau gives his cast and crew, which I can only assume was " Play it straight... remember what you're fighting for in this scene...". It appeared to me that's what they did. Not one weak performance in the film. Its been a long time since I've said that, no doubt it will be a long time before I say it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where is Sigourney Weaver? Just Kidding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest problem with "C&amp;A" is that the Aliens in this movie just aren't that interesting. Just like "Super 8", aliens is aliens is aliens. Nothing new about it. The aliens presence in this film should have been more supernatural. There has to be something different to make aliens scare us these days. The most obvious thing that will occur to you as the movie goes on, that the whole "alien invasion" gimmick doesn't really work, and focus is concentrated on the old west aspects of the story. This is also similar to "Super 8", which tried to be a hybrid of "Stand by Me" and "Close Encounters" or something. The whole science fiction aspect weakens the character development instead of sticking to one genre.But is the concept entertaining? I was being entertained by the decent pacing and casting. Craig saves the movie with his Bond-as-a-Cowboy approach. He gets to show his fighting chops a few times against other humans, (again proving the aliens irrelevant). Ford is welcome being cast as a mean dude. Thankfully, enough side stories with these characters maintains a solid story arc. The alien aspects during the first two acts seem to be barely touched upon (mainly because any serious discussion makes the whole premise sound silly). Again, if the aliens' presence was more creepy and less obvious, the dark force invading the town would keep the film a little better grounded. Unfortunately, by the middle of the second act, the story contrivances - the mysterious lady, the wrist weapon, the kidnapped townfolk, the grumpy barkeep, the amnesia - all get longwinded. Essentially, the premise of cowboys fighting aliens is only good enough for maybe a 90 minute film, but this movie drags on to almost a full two hours. The whole alien battle at the end feels like the last reel got accidentally swapped with "Transformers 4". Little is explained about them (except to satisfy the now ridiculous logic of the story). Why were they kidnapping the townfolk? Why didn't they just kill them? Why did the aliens so desperately need what they came to Earth for? I left before the credits rolled. It was finishing like a typical Hollywood cookie-cutter movie, and it didn't take much to figure out the outcomes of the major characters. It was just too bad that the IQ level of the movie started strong and descended to the level of a 10-year-old by the end. I think the film would have been a big hit if they conceded that the concept did not warrant a full two hours, and instead created a fun summer popcorn movie with Craig commanding the screen and the padding removed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not anything to worry about at Oscar time, but a very good popcorn and soda Summer flick. It doesn't take itself too seriously, some laughs, some scares, some romance, so on and such. The Aliens were an interesting take on our own immoral acts for things we think are valuable and our lack of seeing other humans as valuable, but its not too preachy.I wouldn't take little kids.

		<shortDescription>Somewhere Between Good and Great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me get it out of the way. This movie has cowboys and it has aliens. It lives up to its title. This movie is fun, exciting and intense. It is a very good summer movie. However, this film has a few flaws. First of all, the best part of this movie is Daniel Craig. His character is mysterious, quiet, and a TOTAL BADASS! After the introduction to his character, I was like, "I'm in." And he kept my attention throughout by being so awesome. The bracelet thing that is in the trailer is also really cool. The action in this movie is excellent. It's really well-made and -directed by Jon Faverau. Also, there is a lot more of the Western aspect of this movie than I was expecting, which is a good thing. The story in this movie moves fast and flows smoothly enough, However, in the movie titled Cowboys and Aliens, the story, while told fairly well, isn't really what matters. In my opinion, the biggest flaw of this movie is a scene in the middle involving a Native American tribal camp. Why is it a flaw? Because it tries to throw in a twist involving Olivia Wilde's character that is confusing and unneeded. That really brought the movie down for me, unfortunately. Also, Harrison Ford is not in this movie enough! He doesn't really do anything memorable until the end, unlike Craig, who is memorable during the whole movie. Speaking of the end, though it is epic and cool and all kinds of awesome, there is a point where a character is in trouble and another character goes to help him. I have seen enough movies to know that, "he's probably going to die trying to save the other character." Sure enough, two minutes later, BAM! Dead. Kind of cliché. The fusion of western and sci-fi works for the most part in this movie. The first 20 minutes of this movie is about 95% western, and the rest is 55% western and 45% sci-fi, until the end. I found it interesting how the cowboys are trying to fight the aliens with 1873 technology while the aliens have super-futuristic weaponry. The struggle is really cool to watch, and their eventual triumph is satisfying enough. The end feels kind of rushed, though all loose ends are tied up pretty well. After watching this movie, I was reminded of Super 8 for some reason. I think it is because both movies take an older, less modernly used genre - western and classic Spielberg (I consider that a genre) - and add a modern alien invasion story. However, both concentrate more on the characters than the alien aspect. I still think Super 8 is a much better film, though. This is still a fantastic summer movie. Though it may not be as much of a grand slam as other movies this season, Cowboys and Aliens is still fun time at the theater. 8.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie mirrors how much you care about the characters in a video game: Zilch. I watched tired old movie clichés play themselves out, and waited to see what new twist there might be. There was time to go to the restroom, and wonder what to make for dinner.There's no character depth. So we don't care about any of them, as there was nothing to buy into. There's a lot of blank stares on actors faces. Maybe it was supposed to represent their emotions &amp; reflective personalities. Is that what those camera shots were for? It looks terrible, and the actors should have passed on this job to some no-names. Blame the directors, the editors, the script writers and whoever made you go to this movie with them.The opening credits have: Universal, Spielberg's company, and Ron Howard's company listed. All I can say is: It looks like they were trying to pay homage to George Lucas. Because Lucas did it better 35 years ago, with the shooting technology of that era. While it's true this movie uses the latest technologies, maybe another kaboom will make your jaw drop. It just doesn't make up for a low grade script, and how they wasted the talents of so many actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to attend the world premiere last week in San Diego, and I had such a great time. I saw it with the entire cast and crew of the movie, and had a great audience that made the experience even more worth-while. It was an absolute blast. The movie itself was excellent. It had a great cast consisting of Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Olivia Wilde, Sam Rockwell, Clancy Brown and Paul Dano. Everyone did a fantastic job. The action scenes were great as were the special effects and the cinematography. The aliens were really cool looking, and the chemistry between all the characters was great. I also thought the plot/story was fine, and very interesting. Although, the story was my biggest problem with the movie. I was really expecting some very neat twists from Daniel Craig's character, or some more backstory on the aliens, but sadly there was nothing big from either of those. There were also some clichés that people would've noticed right away that I honestly didn't mind at all. And finally, the directing, as always, was fantastic from Jon Favreau. Overall, I thought this movie was a great summer blockbuster, and I definitely recommend it. I'd say go with a group of friends. It will definitely make the experience better.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jon Favreau has proved to me (once again) that he is an expert filmmaker. Being a major fan of Iron Man 1 &amp; 2, I thought this project could do no wrong, especially with Steven Spielberg as producer. And thank god, I was right.Cowboys &amp; Aliens embraces both sci-fi and western, Favreau truly found the perfect balance between those two genres. The cinematography, actually, pretty much everything visual about the film, was absolutely terrific, pure eye candy. It also knows when to be silly and when to be serious, which is a good thing. One of my biggest fears was the thought of the movie drowning in cheesiness and embarrassing lines, but there was only a few of them, luckily. Like I said, the balance between silliness and seriousness is phenomenal, just like Iron Man.While it's fun to think of it as "007 meets Indiana Jones" I must admit, Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford were really good as Jake Lonergan and Woodrow Dolarhyde, respectively. Not for a moment were I reminded of some of their previous great roles, but only the two roles they were playing in this movie.Cowboys &amp; Aliens was something of a risk, and while I expected a little more action, Jon Favreau did a great job and made it into a great genre mash-up. Overall, I can't recommend this film enough if you love cowboys and aliens. Unless you were ready to choke yourself as soon as you heard about the movie, the average movie-goer should have nothing to worry about.Moose finds this film worthy of a 9.</fullReview>

Jake lonergan (Daniel Craig) was captured by aliens but escaped and when he wakes up on earth, he doesn't remember anything. he runs in to trouble when he learns that he was a wanted man and stole gold from a cattle ranch owner Woodrow dolarhyde (Harrison ford) and learns of his presence only because his son was put in jail for accidentally shooting a deputy officer. Woodrow's son and Jake are put into a wagon and are about to go to federal prison but Woodrow shows up and wants his son and Jake because Jake stole gold from him. then a couple minutes later a figure in the sky shows up. flies closer and closer than disappears with Harrison ford saying "what the hell", then out of no where four or five ships show up to take people. just so happens the aliens took Woodrow's son, a kids grandfather, a bartenders wife, and a handful of other people. then they all leave but one, so Jake has a bracelet that can kill those things and he shoots the ship. next you know a Jake, Woodrow, a preacher, the bartender, the kid, a dog, and a women all set out to get the people they've captured out of the ship. this is a fun movie to watch. its a movie where you don't have to do much thinking, just sit back, relax, and watch. i loved the chemistry between Daniel Craig and Harrison ford who both gave great performances and i like that Daniel Craig got rid of his British accent and had more of a western voice. much like john Wayne's voice just a little deeper. also Harrison fords performance was outstanding to say the least. its a character you see in many other films, but he brings something else to it that stands out. like tommy lee Jones performance in captain America the first avenger. Harrison ford was phenomenal. anyway it was an entertaining film and you will not be disappointed when you leave the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cowboys &amp; Aliens is a very hard movie to critique, but here's my attempt at trying to do so. Let me start off with the plot-a nameless man (Daniel Craig)wakes up in a western town with an irremovable bracelet on his wrist. Then, after meeting Percy (Paul Dano), town sheriff Woodrow Dolarhyde(Harrison Ford)'s incredibly obnoxious son, the whole town discovers there's..drum roll..aliens. Now, what did I think about the film, you may ask? Well, with such an original premise and such a ridiculous, but cool hybrid, this should have been so much more. Director Jon Favreau has always had an eye for even the most subtle visuals, even in films that don't need good visuals (Made, Elf, ETC). That being said, while Favreau continues his streak of visually stunning films with Cowboys &amp; Aliens, nothing happens, and by that, I mean NOTHING. That being said, while nothing happens, I had a fun time with this film. This is one of those rare occasions in my years and years of movie going that I had a fun time in a movie where nothing happens. Ford &amp; Craig are great, not only as their own characters, but they also play well off each other, and the supporting cast including Olivia Wilde, Sam Rockwell, and Dano are great as well. Overall, Cowboys &amp; Aliens will make you happy you saw it, but it won't leave you with much to think about, or hell, even remember.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cowboys &amp; Aliens was an awkward movie in terms of anticipation towards its release. Expecting more than what was already given to you in the title would be silly on your part and the premise already seemed really simple yet kind of brilliant since you probably can't name another time aliens were brought in to the western genre. Anticipation on my end fluctuated; I thought it looked so-so for the longest time, then at one time I was REALLY excited for it, and then my excitement for it had all but died by the time the screening finally came around thanks to less than stellar reviews and word spreading around the internet that the potential summer blockbuster was rather mediocre at best. Cowboys &amp; Aliens is kind of funky in what it actually offers its audience because there seems to be just as many bad or floundering things about the film that there are good.The opening scene let's you know what you're in for as Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) wakes up in the middle of a desert with no memory, a strange wound to his abdomen, and a mysterious bracelet strapped to his left arm that seems to be permanently attached to him for good. Three men stumble onto Jake who think he's just escaped prison and attempt to take him in under the assumption there's a bounty on his head. Jake defeats all three men in spectacular fashion before stealing their clothes and a gun. Jake is essentially an insatiable bad ass. Even as we learn more about his character as the movie progresses, there's never really an explanation why Jake can somehow take out half a dozen men or more consistently throughout the movie. That's pretty much all you get out of Jake, too. If you were expecting any actual personality or emotion from the guy, then you're looking in the wrong place.In fact, all of the leads in this sci-fi action extravaganza are really boring. Harrison Ford basically comes off as portraying himself and is nothing more than a bitter old man who's pessimistic about everything. Then there's Olivia Wilde, who's shown how wide her acting range truly is on "House, MD", but has been nothing but dull in her blockbuster roles. Her character, Ella Swenson, has some interesting aspects but they're kind of all over the place and never effectively come together in the proper fashion to be considered a well developed character. She also tends to have the same stupid look on her face the entire movie without much portrayal of emotion. The most interesting roles lie within the supporting characters. Hands down the best character in the movie is Clancy Brown's Meacham; a quick-witted preacher who knows how to use a gun, has memorable dialogue, and makes himself useful more than anything. Paul Dano is also incredibly entertaining. He plays Percy Dolarhyde, the son of Harrison Ford's Woodrow Dolarhyde. Dano is easily the most despicable character of the line up and his portrayal of the character is just so spot on. It was interesting to see Sam Rockwell play Doc, who is an all around good hearted individual. Rockwell makes the most of his part, but you're used to seeing him play the villain or the vilest character on-screen. This was a welcome change of pace.Cowboys &amp; Aliens is really sporadic when it comes to the storyline, as well. Once we get a glimpse of the aliens, we eventually learn that they've come to earth to steal our gold. Besides melting it and having it float up to a puddle on the ceiling there doesn't really seem to be much else they had planned for it. It's as if they said to one another, "Our spaceship is seriously lacking in solid gold puddles peculiarly placed on our ceilings. Let's find the nearest planet and rectify this dire situation." As you've seen in the trailers, the dummy ships are sent out, capture humans by basically lassoing them with alien technology, and bring them back to the mother ship. It looks pretty cool the first few times, but you get kind of sick of it once you get past the first hour. So what are the aliens having the humans do? Enslaving mankind for some strange alien purpose perhaps? Only if you count having them stand around, stare at a light in the ceiling, and erasing their memory a strange alien purpose. These aliens just have a fascination with things located on the roof. The aliens would look pretty awesome if it wasn't for their eyes. They have these beady, bullfrog-like eyes that completely ruins whatever awesomeness they once had in their appearance. Their chests would also open up where you would see their beating heart along with a pair of three fingered hands that would attempt to shove a victim inside of them. It comes off as being more humorous than anything. It actually just reminded me of Kuato from Total Recall. "Quaid....start the reactor." Cowboys &amp; Aliens is not terrible. It's actually fairly amusing and crazy entertaining when it needs to be. Unfortunately bringing aliens into a western atmosphere is a really awkward transition that isn't pulled off smoothly. The entire movie as a whole comes off as bizarre and fantastically far-fetched the majority of the time. With its weaknesses taking center stage, it's difficult to consider Cowboys &amp; Aliens as anything more than crazy, stupid fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I found myself trying hard to like the film but failing miserably</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot had no cohesion making it difficult for many in the audience to get caught up in the film. That's a big surprise because if you don't empathize with the lead character, what's the point of an adventure film? Because of the director whom I really like, I had hoped that this would be better. I found myself trying hard to like the film but failing miserably. Despite the number of effects, they were very ho-hum as well. Favreau overworked and overthought this movie. What a shame but I guess the pressure was just too great.This disappointment reduces a collection of normally excellent actors in to roles in which they ham it up in mechanically orchestrated poses and predictable situations, not helped by a story that goes virtually nowhere coherent. There really wasn't smart source material to be had and the final product that hit the screen certainly proves that fact. All they managed to deliver was a mostly unfunny, unentertaining and silly romp in wasteoftimeville.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Sci-Fi Western ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so maybe there are not a lot of Sci-Fi Westerns out there, but this one is a lot of fun. After all, should all Sci-Fi take place in galaxies far, far away in the far, far distant future? Daniel Craig gives his typical understated but excellent performance, and he plays well with Harrison Ford, who is never understated but always great to watch. I was impressed with how well the Director gave the movie a real Western feel while merging in the Sci-Fi storyline. If you want a bit of enjoyable escapism I would recommend this movie. I'll probably see it again and buy the DVD when it comes out for the collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The summer movie of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The entire summer movie package - romance and action, AND the story takes place in the relatively Wild West. Plus it involves aliens! At the screening I attended, audience was so enraptured nobody texted or chatted with neighbors. Popcorn grew stale, drinks went unslurped. Heroic moves were cheered, dastardly villains jeered.Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford are more than comfortable in their roles (sequel, please!), and Olivia is a lovely surprise. Intelligent and gutsy, a real "pioneer" woman...Only small disappointment: the aliens. They look too much like the skitters in "Falling Skies".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the director who brought us "Elf" !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I resently attended a movie screening and experienced the worst costumer service I could have ever imagined. Something about Earth mammals VS the Reptilians. It started from first interaction the usher in the front started to yell because he was so fustrated with the large crowd, the organization to get everyone inside was not well planned out. Finally when picking up my cell phone that we all had to turn in I noticed I had dropped my bottle of medicine and asked to check if they could check the name on the bottle, I was ignored three times by one man and attitude by the other two ladies helping hand out the 15 or so cell phones they had collected. Then things got real bad, the film started to roll. This budget feature couldn't hold a candle to space western Galaxina (1980), or even the Star Wars series, which truth be told, are little more than old John Wayne movies dressed up as Sci-fi. But, unlike this, were not shot on a pocket phone.If director Jon Favreau had more of this creativity with the script, Aliens and Cowboys would have been as good or better than Will Ferrel vehicle "Elf". (2004) - Also directed, albeit with a surer hand, by Favreau. (Elf)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>personally thought it was a very fun and entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>cowboys and aliens is a very good film, not GREAT....but very good. its the first of its kind, so remember that when you watch it, and judge it. as far as directing goes, not too bad for Stavreau's first directed film. (or however you spell his name. there are a couple of boring parts in it that i think could have been spruced up with a little bit of camera angle movement, maybe some hand-held stuff. but, still, a job well done.the acting is superb, without a doubt. To me, anything with Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig is guaranteed to be interesting....and Olivia Wilde's insane hotness makes it all the more better :)the plot has loopholes, and a few other nicks in the film altogether. the special effects were very well done, along with all the animation and original creature design.overall, 8/10.....pretty damn good for Jon's first directing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Is Awesome !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night at a sneak preview in Santa Monica. Jon Favreau knocked it out of the park! I never give movies a 10, but I gave it one because it is an original movie, with an old-school style! Finally, we see Harrison Ford how he should be seen, (which was hard to do after "Indiana Jones 4,and "Hollywood Homicide." I'm not a huge Daniel Craig fan, but he reminds me of a young Steve McQueen. I'm not gonna give any spoilers, just go see the film... you'll be glad you did. Great supporting performances by Buck Taylor, Clancy Brown, Keith Carradine, Abigail Spencer, Raoul Trujillo, Paul Dano, Adam Beach, and Sam "The Man" Rockwell! This is the perfect movie !!! I am critical when it comes to westerns, because they are the movies I was raised on... but this movie is like a cross between "The Searchers," "Aliens," and "Indiana Jones." This man knows how to tell a story and make a great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have to love the concept.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to love the concept: Aliens invade the Wild West in 1873 to mine for gold and pretty much obliterate the population in the process. The reptilian bad guys of Cowboys and Aliens should know better because cowboys, especially when played by Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, are used to beating the bad guys, spaceships or not.And therein lies the weakness of the concept: The film ends up being just a third-rate knock off of John Ford's Searchers (Comanches have abducted a white girl, whom John Wayne rescues). In Aliens, Craig searches for the girl, and Indians are a prominent part of the search. The usual guns blaze, explosions abound, a lady needs rescuing, Craig's hero is laconic, and Ford, well, he's just a variation of his angry curmudgeon, which he has played regularly for several years.When the space ships descend on the town, I felt an excitement at seeing a completely different kind of Western, but only unartful abduction and explosions ensue. The stereotypes are plentiful and the aliens a variation of ugly that Sigourney Weaver could love. Craig's magic bracelet, which does an explosive number on the enemy, is a unique device appropriate for any sci-fi movie. If Iron Man director Jon Favreau had more of this creativity with the script, Aliens and Cowboys would have been a better film.Or if the film had been a parody, as in Blazing Saddles, the film would have made more sense. As it is, it's certainly not The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly with its multiple interesting characters and a memorable score.It just is a bunch of Western tropes married to sci-fi notions. If you like Westerns, you may be disappointed. If you like sci-fi, you will be disappointed. And I'm just a lonely critic who would have liked it for both genres.Adios and may the force be with you.</fullReview>
