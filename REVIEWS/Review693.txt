		<shortDescription>Good survival horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to sift long and deep for a good comment on this. Why all the hostility? I think there was great chemistry on this production and it shows; the actors and crew involved loved the game and had a good time making this. This movie successfully recreated the feel of the game, and because it kept exposition to a minimum of what you needed to know for this particular story and didn't borrow from or revise any of the original characters or settings, it supported and strengthened the franchise. No story is retold here, no words are wasted, the setting, feel and pace is familiar to fans of Resident Evil and yet it's perfectly accessible to those unfamiliar with the broader storyline. Not giving the fan-boys their favorite characters was a good choice since characters tend to get mangled in adaptation, and yet the fan-boys still complain. With this film you have a good, watchable story that can partake of the Resident Evil cosmology, showing it due respect.It did an excellent job establishing characters without too much unnecessary background, developing them just enough to make you want to know what they'll do next, to make you care before the sudden and gruesome happens to them. The acting was above par for a Resident Evil, certainly much better than the first game. The plot was no more comic bookish than any of the games. My one complaint was that the characters were too battle-trained, too slick, too good at fighting for them to be sympathetic horror subjects. This could've been balanced out with more reaction shots showing the soldiers wetting themselves. But Alice's over-the-top commando-style action made her too much of a super heroine to really make anyone concerned about her survival; characters made of Teflon make good action but apathetic horror subjects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way better than what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't waiting to see anything amazing when I started watching for this movie, since almost all the license movies have been terrible... Fortunately, my opinion was to change! Movie was great, actors were good enough, and there was actually a plot (whoa!). Director has done a great job by having that videogame atmosphere by use of light, but still keeping the movie tense. Marilyn Manson has also made a great job by composing some of his greatest soundtrack titles which really fit for this movie. I have played both Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2, and recognized many of the scenes which were kind of similar to games. What can I say? For the people who have played games, this one gives good vibes and they are going to love it. For regular people the movie might be above the average. This was one hell-of-a-movie, and I'm waiting for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of splatter and horror films i was gladly surprised when i watched this. I haven't played the game so i had no idea what to expect and had nothing to compare with. I really feel that this pays homage to the old zombie films at least to an extent. The zombies here are a little bit faster though.It begins with a nice back story and then builds slowly in pace to a climactic frenzy. The effects are top notch, solid directing, a really imaginative and eerie production design and great acting.Yes, i may be a little biased but i really like Milla Jovovich. I think this is the kind of role that fits her best, strong kick ass attitude with an odd personality wrapped in a seemingly fragile shell. Her performance here reminds me a bit of the character she played in "The fifth element" and also the character in the later "Ultraviolet" The other actors did a good job as well so she's not the only one to get credit although the movie revolves around her character. The child AI is a very nice and creepy addition to the atmosphere.The RE theme could have ended up as a nice trilogy but the sequel unfortunately lacks nearly everything(except Milla) that this film delivers. Not that RE2 is a complete mess but nowhere near this. I haven't seen the third installment yet but even if that one holds true in quality to this one number two becomes the odd one out.If you like zombie and action films you'll certainly like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first, I really like "Resident Evil". While I can't comment on the success of the conversion to a movie as I've never played any of the numerous video games, the film is beautifully shot and has an urgent pace. It also has a great looking cast, a thumping soundtrack and plenty of boys' toys.Milla Jovovich is stunning as the heroine, Alice. Whoever thought of casting Jovovich in this role deserves a bonus. Watching this beautiful star kick various forms of zombie butt while wearing a short red dress is a wonderful experience.Anderson's movies may be accused of being style over substance but there's no doubting that "Shopping", "Event Horizon" and "Resident Evil" are fantastic examples of eye candy. Every shot is beautifully composed and the film has a high-budget sheen.8 out of 10. Casio G-Shock fans will be in their element watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a video game adaption done right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie means business. Quick disaster with a mystery to it, jarring deaths, naked Milla, all in the first few minutes. It keeps up the pace throughout. In terms of critical comments, yes, you don't really care about the characters, but so what? How often do you really care about the monster fodder in horror films? And true, it wasn't a literal working of the movie, it didn't take place in a mansion and it didn't involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That's because it's a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don't think some people here understand that. One guy said he thought the movie rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked, and that's a video game player attitude - movies don't have to have good replay value, it's okay to enjoy them once. I only enjoyed Star Wars once, but I don't think it sucked, it just didn't have a lot of depth. Not every movie has to be Citizen Kane. It was an engaging story, moved like lightning and had some excellent scares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary and atmospheric</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" was a smart and scary game. The darkness and the surprises were huge scare factors. In that famous game, you find yourself trapped in a mansion crawling with the undead because of a mistake made by the Umbrella Corporation.Director Paul W.S. Anderson makes a fast, dark guilty pleasure of a film from this game with "Resident Evil".Milla Jovovich is Alice, who wakes up in a creepy, poorly lit mansion at night in a remote forest. She has no memory of who she is or why she's here, but after a group of soldiers bursts in and takes her to a hidden lab underneath the mansion with them, she quickly begins to realize a terrible secret. She and the others find themselves locked in "The Hive", an enormous, elaborate underground structure that was sealed by the supercomputer controlling it. It soon becomes evident that an experiment called "The T-Virus" escaped into the air and killed everyone. But nobody really stayed dead. Now the remaining survivors must fight their way back out of The Hive before the door seals permanently... and at the same time they must contain the virus before it reaches the surface. The film moves at a breakneck pace, with some elaborate sets and great cinematography that sets the dark mood well for this atmospheric sci-fi thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was generally surprised that I liked this movie, not being a fan of either of it's stars. I decided to give the movie a try since it does deal with one of my favorite horror topics...zombies!As a horror movie Resident Evil fails miserably, it's not scary and contains only small amounts of suspense. It is much better as an action film although much of the action is chaotic, accompanied by lame heavy metal/thrash music. But seeing as it is based on a video game and made primarily for teenage boy video game addicts it is quite good in and of itself.The movie plays well, even though it is apparent that some scenes have been cut to achieve an R-rating. The characters do what they need to do in order to survive.One small problem with the movie is the relative lack of zombie screen time. They do appear in two major scenes but most of the time the hallways are clear. This hive was supposed to employ thousands of people but you only ever see 100 zombies at the most. Also, the humans seem to be able to travel easily wherever they have to go until it is time for another action sequence. It would have been better if they constantly ran into single zombies which they were able to easily dispose of, but this is nit-picking on my part.Overall I enjoyed the movie and I have never seen, let alone played, the video game. I'm not sure if this movie will have the staying power over multiple viewings for me (like Aliens) but it's a very good single viewing action picture. Easily the best movie I have seen based on a video game. Despite it's flaws Resident Evil rates a 7 out of 10, if taken more seriously this could have been a really good movie. It would have been nice to see a George Romero version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil is probably my favorite zombie movie next to Planet Terror. It had flaws, some acting was poor, but still was one great time from start to finish and excellently crafted entertainment!!!!! It had wonderful action, nice gore and the performances overall were exceedingly decent for what they needed to be for a video game adaptation. I especially love Michelle Rodriguez's portrayal of Pain; amazing character. I first thought when I was watching this film that it was going to be an over-the-top gore movie with way to much blood and carnage, not so much as focusing on the main point of the story, but it turned out unimaginably well, for I thought it wasn't going to be that good at all, and the complexity and edgy scenes and screenplay surprised me. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez acted wonderfully in this film and this was a great action\horror movie that I am extremely glad I was able to have seen, and will gladly see over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil: A Project in Terror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, the first time I saw this, I didn't care for it. It did not follow the story line of the game, and that made me very unhappy with this endeavor.Upon realization that a video game is "dumbed down" for the players to be able to concentrate, however, I opted for a second viewing and came to realize that this was not the waste of time I first believed. I was disappointed with how it played out because there were no cures along the way, they made little notice of records and files lying about, no matter how relevant they were or were not, and the sequence of things was not on par with that of the game. I realize that to do things that way would have severely hampered the flow of the movie itself and would have made it far less active. Considering this is first and foremost, an action movie (with horror elements), that would not be considered a good thing.The truth is that Milla Jovovich contributes a very capable and entertaining presence and performance to this work. Her supporting cast (every one) gave nothing but the best they had. The story itself flows quite well and was creatively written and executed. There is nothing wrong with this attempt. It just didn't live up to a fanboy's expectations. Unfortunately, that was their major principal audience; game fans, and that explains the lackluster box office payoff and the low IMDb user ratings for this attempt. The fanboys were disappointed; the casual fans casually attended this event; and the mainstream didn't understand the big deal, either way and so did not participate to a profitable level.With the release of the second installment and all the advertisement and hype Apocalypse received, it drew the mainstream fans a bit harder; the casual fans were less casual; and the fanboys were still disappointed, but resigned to the fact that this was just how it was going to be; take it or leave it. We took it and, in retrospect, embraced the first attempt, as well.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Huge Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mild non-specific spoilers ahead.I had high hopes, but Resident Evil wants to be a zombie movie and an action movie, and it fails utterly on both counts.You can't have a good zombie movie without gore. Or without some decent zombies. The zombies in this movie are feeble, except for the dogs, who have hardly any screen time. The movie also has a rather hastily concocted monster, which serves as padding. The gore that does get onto the screen doesn't have any continuity with the action, as if the victims of violence in the film wandered in from an alternate universe where they died of different causes.And you can't have a good action movie without action. Milla has about one-and-a-half good action moments in this film, and the rest of the cast manages another two. Those are supplemented by a lot of inaction and a lot of loud nonsense where they try to confuse you into thinking something interesting is happening. Dull, dull, dull.Shaking the camera a lot during a close-up of someone waving their arms and screaming is not an action scene. It's passe and pathetic and wasn't a decent substitute for action back when it was relatively new, in the mid-80's.The movie has a few moments of genuine atmosphere, but those have all come and gone by the twenty-minute mark. There are some nice props, but they generally don't get much use, and some nice sets, although the gross overuse of the close-up generally obscures them. The cast shows some promise, but they don't have much to do, and the dialogue is all too often wincingly bad.The movie relentlessly copies better films, and does it poorly, a long and annoying reminder of what you could be watching instead.Most mysteriously of all, the film contains nudity, but none of it serves any purpose. The movie already had an 'R' rating for violence. The nudity isn't necessary or flattering. I admit, rarely have I seen a movie in which an attractive woman appears without her clothes and thought the movie would be better without the nudity, but it happened here.All in all, it's not as interesting or exciting as watching someone play the game. Or hearing them talk about having played the game. It's not even as good as the director Paul Anderson's earlier videogame movie, Mortal Kombat. As the final credits rolled, I was easily able to think of almost a dozen zombie movies that are far, far superior -- and only two of them are Japanese.Weak, dull, derivative, amateurish, under-written, under-directed, and generally disappointing. I feel bad for Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez, who I know can do so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently I saw the theatrical trailer for Resident Evil: Extinction and it occurred to me, I have never seen the first two Resident Evil films, and I always wanted to see them. So I rented the first two Resident Evil films and watched them last night. I had a lot of fun watching Resident Evil, it was very high action and kept my heart racing on what would happen next. This is a great movie based on a video game, this is the kind of movie that we need if we are talking about basing it on a video game. I haven't seen a good one since Mortal Kombat. The action and effects were so awesome not to mention that there are some very awesome scares in here. Very cool make up for the zombies; and the story was excellent.A virus breaks out in a lab called the Hive where everyone is held in captivity and dies. All of a sudden we see a woman passed out in a shower, she has no idea who she is, she meets two other men who have no idea who they are, but they are taken by soldiers who take them underground to the Hive. There the three learn that they are fighters for this out break and that also they might be part of what happened. The main thing is that they control the Hive, but that gets more difficult when the virus has turned the people it killed into the living dead, zombies. The woman, Alice, turns into the leader and must find out why this happened and also how they can get out alive without contaminating the world.Resident Evil was an awesome movie to watch and I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves action movies. If you loved Mortal Kombat I'm sure you'll love Resident Evil. There are so many great scenes, but my favorite was when Alice saw the evil dogs and they chased her throughout the lab, it was really scary but so awesome to watch. Well, you'll just have to see what I mean. Milla Jovovich was just a perfect choice for Alice, she is such a cool character and now I'm really looking forward to seeing Extinction.7/10</fullReview>

The zombies were not the main point of the story though...the writers were actually smart in the fact that there was a certain step to follow in the movie to survive. There was a story and it DOES deserve a good vote and a good opinion of what a normal, everyday woman will think. OK, I might not be normal, but I generally have good opinions about movies. The women in this movie show power, and the men were intelligently resourceful. The zombies were well played out and were not over-shown.

		<shortDescription>One of my most favourite films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the video game series; I've played &amp; completed almost every Resident Evil game there is. When the film was announced I thought it was going to be rubbish because mostly films that are based on games are completely crap especially the ones made by Uwe Boll, but I still went to see it the first day when it came out in the UK and it was sooooo amazing. I was speechless after I seen the film, the story is truly original and one of the best thing about it is that the first 10 minutes was slow &amp; peaceful but then it went really fast &amp; relentless just like a roller-coaster going up slowly &amp; zoomed down. Paul W. S. Anderson has proved that he is terrific writer &amp; director because it is extremely difficult to create a story for a film that is based on a video game. Milla Jovovich was undoubtedly the best and I loved her red dress to bits, it definitely did suit her. Watching the film gives you a deep insight of the game e.g.When they had about 3 hours limited time to complete their mission.Every time they enter a new place it had to be checked and they had to make sure it's safe just like in every game.If they where trapped they had to find another way out.In the end Alice &amp; Matt got out without killing all the zombies because Resident Evil is rather a puzzle game and killing is not necessary.The combination of action, horror &amp; thriller is superb; they are my entire favourite genre. It had a lot of style and the use of advanced modern technology that is mostly I look for in a film, the Licker in the end was the icing on the cake. This is the only movie that I liked with zombies in it because most of them are stupid &amp; boring especially House of the Dead, the zombies pop out of nowhere and attack people. In Resident Evil the creation of zombies was very sensible, the staff of the underground laboratory were infected by the T-Virus released into the air vent, after getting killed by the Red Queen to avoid any outside interference their dead bodies were reanimated. It is mentioned very clearly that why they "need to feed", nothing like that has ever been in any film which makes the story original. Dialogues are also good my most favourite quote is "You're all going to die down here" from the Red Queen, she is one of the best characters along with Alice, Matt &amp; Rain. Background music score is the best music possibly for any film I have ever heard it has heavy metal guitar for the fight scenes and very soft, eerie &amp; sensational for the main title. I have the soundtrack CD and I bought it just for the background score without caring that the other tracks might be good or not but it did turn out to good. There is nothing more I can ask for in a film that makes it one of my all time favourite movies and there is never going to be another film based on a video game like this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A special military unit fights a powerful, out-of-control supercomputer and hundreds of scientists who have mutated into flesh-eating creatures after a laboratory accident into a facility called the ¨Hive¨. But a secret experiment has been developed and a fatal mistake and a deadly virus expands itself . As the Umbrella Corporation's deadly T-virus ravages the Earth , transforming the global population into legions of the flesh eating Undead . The group Milla Jovovich , Eric Mabius , Colin Salmon , Martin Crewes , James Purefoy) battles the Umbrella Corporation , the undead and a super computer that plots total destruction over the human race . The commando (to prepare for their roles, the actors playing commandos and Milla Jovovich and Eric Mabius had a week of commando training with a Navy Seal) in the heart of Umbrella's most clandestine operations facility and unveil mysterious plans . First original film with nonstop action , violent combats and spectacular images by computer generator . The human race's last and only hope is Alice (Milla Jovovich is the only actor to appear in all five films) . Spectacular , action-packed and thrilling first installment of the ¨Resident Evil series¨ , adapted from the video games characters produced by Hiroyuki Kobayashi . Yet another noisy film rendered from a video game which never gets as eerie as a Zombie picture should . Unstopped-action gore-feast that provides for high-octane escapist entertainment with some eye-catching visuals and pulsing soundtrack . This exciting picture contains thrills , chills , action-filled with fierce combats and lots of gore and guts . The horror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized , being the first movie of the series not to feature undead dogs . This original takes more , more approach , more fights , more blood and gore than subsequent sequels . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with scary and amazing frames . It's predictable but we have seen some scenes in previous films , but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting from the action-women , as Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez . Milla Jovovich did all of her own stunts except the pipe jump in the sewer scene . The main actors were told to prepare for the film by getting copies of the games and playing them through. Some of them didn't know if they could complete them in time so they had to get video copies of other people beating the games and then watch it . One of the most popular scenes in the film - when Alice runs up a wall and flings round to kick a zombie dog in the head - took 3 months of training for Milla Jovovich. The flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods , plenty of screams , shocks and tension . The make-up assistants create a truly horrible zombie cannibals and state-of-art FX won the Canadian Screen Award for Achievement in Visual Effects . Professional dancers were cast as zombies . Horrifying and astonishing images about apocalyptic events with destroyed city , with a technological facility totally inhabited by flesh-munchies creatures and much of it was filmed in unfinished stations of Berlin underground . Cool , luminous cinematography using Steadicam by David Johnson . Haunting , pulsing Techno-musical score by Marco Beltrani . The motion picture was professionally directed with startling visual style , though with no originality , by Paul W Anderson . This was he second movie based on a video game directed by Paul W.S. Anderson , the first was Mortal Kombat (1995). Its successful opening weekend sparked a frenzy among US studios, eager to capitalize on the interest in video games. Titles like Doom (1993), Silent Hill (1999) and Max Payne (2001) were all snapped up. The complete saga is formed by the following films : ¨Resident evil¨ by Paul W Anderson with Milla , Eric Mabius , Michelle Rodriguez , James Purefoy , Colin Salmon ; this is the best , dealing with a group of containment specialists are sent in and have to fight employees who have been contaminated , while A.I. computer instigates a series of defensive measures to contain the virus . It's followed by ¨Resident evil II : Apocalypse¨ by Alexander Witt with Jared Harris , Iain Glen , Oded Fehr , Sienna Guillory . Furthermore , ¨Resident evil III¨ by Russell Mulcahy with Ali Larter, Ashanti , Mike Epps , Oded Fehr and of course Milla Jovovich ; ¨Resident Evil : Afterlife¨ by Paul W Anderson with usual actors along with Kim Coates , Sergio Peris Mencheta , Boris Kodjoe and Wentworth Miller , and ¨Resident evil 5 : retribution¨ with Boris Kodjoe, Johann Urb ,Aryana Engineer , Kevin Durand , Robin Kasyanov and as always Milla Jovovich .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many reviewers consider this to be one the best adaptations of a video game into a film...Well, I have to disagree, mostly because I love all the Resident Evil games, and even when this is much better than things such as "Doom" or "Bloodrayne", it is just doesn't make any justice to the original games in which this movie is inspired.This film betrays the original roots of the game, focusing in the action rather than the horror parts (Sure: The games had lots of action, but also had lots of thrills, mystery and subtlety, something that this film completely lacks) The other problem with this film is the terrible direction of Paul W.S. Anderson, which ruins a great story, turning the whole thing into a huge mess that is barely watchable. As a movie independent of the games, it is mediocre at best. But as an adaptation it is just terrible, dreadful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil, despite its reputation, was never a particularly great video game. The story was weak, the writing and voice acting atrocious, and the many puzzles contrived and pointless. But at least you could blow a zombie's head off with a shotgun.Resident Evil, the movie, directed by Paul "Stop giving me money" Anderson, is a particularly awful film. The story is "original" in that it deviates from the video games, but where it deviates is even worse. The writing is nonexistent, and the acting, at best, is unimpressive. It may also be the first film to not only provide a digital map to show the audience where the characters are, yet still make it impossible to tell where the hell anyone is. And, to make matters worse, it, for the most part, lacks the shotgun-to-head satisfaction value that made Resident Evil a hit in the world of video games.Case in point:Parts of the film could have been suspenseful. COULD HAVE. But even that is lost when the awful soundtrack kicks into gear, drowning out any atmosphere the film might have had. To make matters worse (if they could be), the film includes very little gore, aside from a cheesy laser-slicing scene that was better off left on the drawing board. And the zombies, if you could call them that, are about as menacing as the cheese between my toes.On the plus side, I kind of like the ending, which is the only part where the film, in some remote way, works. * out of *****</fullReview>

There comes the lead's name, the mirror, the rabbit, and the Red Queen. There's that scare factor about what will happen next. When will the zombies first appear? Who may get killed first? The jump scares are well done. I like how Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez do kickass moves. The atmosphere set in the underground lab is creepy. The music is also scarily very good.The action sequence is amazing. And the plot twists are shocking. They almost made me jump out of my seat!I know this film won't please film snobs, but I give this a perfect 10 because I get what I expected for this.</fullReview>

Even the actors/actresses was a pain in the a#¤ to look at. The story sucks. The acting sucks. It should have followed the game instead. Paul WS Anderson should stop making movies. I don't know why they decided to make it so un-faithful to the game, but even if they made a movie different from it's source material they should at least make a good movie. But they failed.

		<shortDescription>a dull disappointment, even for a videogame film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite good-enough performances from Jovovich, Rodriguez, and the rest of the cast, there is little more good to be said for this film, aside from some handsomely unhandsome zombies. Did we need a cross between CUBE and Romero's zombie trilogy with an even more ridiculous version of ALIEN's anticorporate slant (when anticorporatism becomes as ridiculous as this, it certainly undercuts real anticorporatism)? Nonsensical doubletalk, an idiot-plot from the beginning, and not even much in the way of interesting violence. So, go to see Milla J be fetching and Michelle R be sardonic, but you can probably do that with some other films which might also entertain you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly Disappointing VideoGame Adaption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite possibly the worse VideoGame Adaption I have ever seen. Paul Anderson has 'hacked' his way into the VideoGame market, and created a blatant cash-in film. This is more like a rip-off of The Matrix than anything else. I am a HUGE fan of the videogame series. The Resident Evil videogames are my favorite games of all time, but this movie is really that BAD. The film follows the storyline of a group of 'ALIENS' type Commandos being sent into a Mansion of some sort, where a deadly Virus outbreak has occured. On the way, they meet Alice, a person who has lost her mind. And.....to hell with it. This film basically has no plot, or even if it has, it has been poorly constructed. The thing about the Resident Evil games, is that they have strong plots which guide you in. You really get drawn into it. This film is incredibly bland. The acting is absolutely terrible, and cringe worthy. It totally lacks atmohpere which the VideoGames provide. Let's see a small comparison between the Film and the Videogame: FILM : Hard rock-type music. - VIDEOGAME : Eerie, quiet, orchestral score. FILM : Bullet Time. - VIDEOGAME : No Bullet-Time seen. FILM : Kung Fu. - VIDEOGAME : No Bullet time. FILM : Bland Characters. VIDEOGAME : Interesting characters.It clearly comes to my attention, this film bares more resemblance to The Matrix than the Videogames. All characters are new (and very bland and one dimensional). We don't know them, and we never do. It's very unbelievable how a film like this could mess up the Resident Evil saga. The videogames are just begging for a movie version of themselves, and instead, we get something that offers nothing in common with the videogames. It's hard to believe this film was 'based' on them. I don't even think it is. This film feels like 'deja vu', we've seen it all before.Capcom made the biggest mistake of letting Paul Anderson near the Resident Evil series. They also made the mistake of firing George A Romero. Sure, Romero's script changed a few ideas, but it stuck the closest to the videogames. Romero was the only man to do a faithful adaption. Hell, the Resident Evil videogames are based off his ZOMBIE trilogy.Avoid Resident Evil The Movie at all costs. If you want a slice of Resident Evil, stick with the VideoGames, as they are the true spirit of Resident Evil. And if you want the true spirit of ZOMBIE movies, purchase George A Romero's Living Dead Trilogy. And if you want Kung Fu, Bullet-Time and cool characters......you know what movie to watch.RSIDENT EVIL THE MOVIE = 0/10</fullReview>

Not the second movie.The main enemy so to speak was all wrong and Anderson should have it been a main enemy from the first game. Milla did OK with what she was given, so did Rodriguez.

		<fullReview>What can I say about this film, apart from it was terrible and I hated it!I loved the games and was looking forward to seeing the film, and I was bored throughout the film, but not throughout the WHOLE film. One or two half decent scenes and one scene of action that will stick in anyone's mind (you'll know which scene I mean if you see it), but unfortunately that is it! Most of the scenes or either too wordy and bored me, or the room is that full of zombie's that you can't pick out the characters! And the flashback scenes are also far too abstract!!!I left the film feeling as though I had wasted 1hr 40 of my life and it could have been better used down the pub or even standing in the rain for 1hr 40 would have pleased me more!I have seen the film twice (to my disgust!) and STILL I don't know character names, only one, and I have even looked them up on imdb.com before watching it for the second time! I STILL don't feel any empathy for the characters and basically I didn't care if the made it out or not!I prey to God himself that the sequel is better (Resident Evil: Nemesis [2003]) and I hope that it does the games the tiniest bit of justice, unlike this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>to save this pile of rubbish.There is only *one* thing that can be said in favor of this movie: Surprisingly, for the first time in my memory, Milla Jovovich actually looks GOOD. In flicks like The Fifth Element, it never ceased to amaze me the lengths she would go to to make herself look hideous. In this, I didn't even know it was her until I saw the name in the credits here on IMDb. Yowsa. Yummy.Now, about the movie... It's worthless. The "plot" is weak, character development is half a step from non-existent, the premise is a rehash of dozens of old zombie movies mixed with the crazed supercomputer taken from dozens of other flicks, the acting is as you would expect from low budget B-Grade horror fare, and the scenery &amp; effects are of the level that could be achieved in my basement with odds and ends I have lying around the house.This is what I will begin calling a "Time-Machine Movie." Meaning I wish I had a time machine to go back and recover the 2 hours of my life that I wasted on this schlock. It's too late for me, but you can save yourself from this impressive effort to lower the standards of mediocrity even farther than they already are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a zombie film, a creature feature, a disaster film, a spy movie, an escape film, a sci-fi evil computer picture, an anti-corporate diatribe, and a disease flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is to writer/director Paul Anderson's credit that he retains the tension throughout. I don't quite understand why this thing received such crappy reviews when it was released five years ago as I found 'Resident Evil' to be real creepy fun entertainment. I am aware that director Paul W. S. Anderson doesn't get a hell of a lot of love out there and is the brunt of many a scornful comment but with RE (that's what those of us in know call it) he has crafted a true zombie horror film that has an eerie ominous feel throughout, some legitimate jump out of your seat moments, plenty of blood and gore for those who like that kind thing and of course Milla is jumping around, scaling walls and kicking much zombie ass.Resident Evil may be empty, but it is still a lot of fun. It avoids being a tired sub-genre film by being so many sub-genres at once. It's a zombie film, a creature feature, a disaster film, a spy movie, an escape film, a sci-fi evil computer picture, an anti-corporate diatribe, and a disease flick. And more than any of those, it's an adventure movie. What's surprising is that they are all done right. The pacing is nearly perfect, keeping things always moving, but never too fast to miss plot points or character development. The music keeps the tension high. The fights are exciting. And I found myself caring about Alice. It doesn't hurt that she's played by Milla Jovovich who looks stunning and moves like a cat. But then, the entire film looks good. It's worth watching once just to study the colours. No one will be discussing philosophy after watching Resident Evil, but sometimes, that's OK. You will be entertained.Followed by Resident Evil: Apocalypse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An attractive woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich) woke up from the running shower, after being mysterious knocked-out by it. At first, she doesn't seem to remember anything and including her name. Then a group of professional trained commandos (Lead by Colin Solmon) breaks from the large mansion, she lives in. Including an mysterious cop (Eric Mabuis) is forced to go Alice and the soldiers break in an mysterious underground laboratory called The Hive by the Umbrella Coporation from the mansion. Which the corporation are involved with medical supply, computer technology and others but they are also involved with illegal experimentation. Which the team has also find another man (James Purefoy), who also lost his memory. Earlier on that day, an mysterious virus is been unleashed by killing many innocent people and it sealed the working area by an high-tech intelligence computer called The Red Queen (Voiced by Micheala Dicker). Once the team has turned off The Red Queen, the room were sealed turned open... and the dead has died from the virus returned to live by attack the group for warm human flesh. The illegal experiment from Umbrella turned loose as well. But Alice and the others has to escape before the underground laboratory closed itself and becomes trapped underground.Written and Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (AVP Alien Vs Predator, Event Horizon, Mortal Kombat) made an enjoyable horror film that mixes science-fiction and action quite well. Anderson gets an decent cast here, some of the performances from the actors are good. Although Anderson's writing script is quiet heavy at times and it doesn't always work (Especially the monster "Licker" could have used more work in the CGI department) but Anderson knows how to set up action sequences and moments of visual style are always been his best at film-making. This survival horror flick is based on a hugely popular game from Capcom and "Resident Evil" is one the best video game adaptations so far.In the Resurrected Edition on the DVD, "Resident Evil" is placed double feature with the sequel "Resident Evil:Apocalyspe" on a two disc set. DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an terrific Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. It has bonus features on the second disc but it's mostly on the sequel than the first feature. If you loved this film, you could find 2002 Special Edition DVD or the Deluxe Edition from 2004 with additional special features. "Resident Evil" wasn't an huge success at the box office but it did well in Overseas and especially with DVD Sales was enough to produced the sequels "Apocalyspe" and "Extinction". Die Hard fans of the video game and especially those who loved Zombie movies will get an kick out of this movie. Don't miss it. Good music score by Marco Beltrami (Scream Trilogy, Hellboy, 3:10 to Yuma "2007") and heavy metal rock singer:Marilyn Manson. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A strong Sci-Fi thriller from director Paul W.S. Anderson. Super F/X sustains the sometimes gory action. Alice(Milla Jovovich) and Rain Ocampo(Michelle Rodriguez)are two members of a commando team assigned to infiltrate an underground research lab owned by the Umbrella Corporation. An out-of-control supercomputer has engineered a virus that has accidentally been released and has turned most of the scientists and employees of the facility into rampaging flesh eating zombies. The commando team will risk life and limb to reach the "Red Queen", the lab's supreme brain-power computer hoping to halt any possibility the virus is let loose on the world's populace. Upon investigation it seems that the virus was not released by accident at all and there may even be a cure for the undead...besides putting a bullet in the head. Also in the cast: Eric Mabius, Ryan McCluskey, Anna Bolt, Heike Makatsch, Martin Crewes and James Purefoy. A very strong R rating for your enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident is not in the evil........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first installment of Resident Evil was true enough to the video game to make it a great movie. The movie did not really concentrate on "The Resident Evil" meaning the house that was haunted by zombies. Although the zombie virus was created by Umbrella,... the video game concentrated on the fact that the mansion was infested with zombies. That made it "Resident Evil". The mansion was haunted by a resident that was evil,.... But the first movie was good because it had stayed true to the fact that zombies (whatever the virus infect-ant was) were the main theme. Resident Evil (the first movie) was really good. I'd give it a 8.5 on the movie scale.</fullReview>

The story itself is quite meager, but hey, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre wasn't written by Tolstoj either. Action is good to very good, and tension is well kept throughout the film.I'm not easily impressed by overwrought fighting or action scenes (e.g. The Matrix) but the scene in the hallway with the lasers is great.Being fond of Romero's work, it was fun to see the zombies back in action. Especially the zombie-dogs (mutant, zombie, infected, whatever).Don't expect grand insights, moving scenes on the subject of the human mind, or being moved to tears. This one is a roller-coaster, baby, nothing more, nothing less.Hang on and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Y'know, I've often said that movies are like music. There's no deciding whether something is bad or good, it's in the eye of the beholder. This mass of people saying that this movie is the best zombie movie ever though, I mean c'mon people! First off, the Evil Dead Trilogy is scarier than this film, and I just saw those 3 movies for the first time last week. Those films were't even supposed to be scary, and had really small budgets, but were 10 times more fun.In response to everyone saying you get to see Milla Jovovich naked...(Sarcasm begins now) OH WOW! I got to see half of Milla's nipple! OH MY GOD! The promised land does exist! Oh please God, just let me see a full nipple one day, and I promise I'll never sin again! (End Sarcasm) Anyway, if I want to see Milla naked, I'm sure she's posed for Playboy or something, and you saw more in the Fifth Element anyway. Plus she was younger and looked a lot better in that film.I hate Michelle Rodriguez. She's not hot in my opinion and she's played pretty much the same role in every movie she's been in. At least most actors who get typecast try to break away. Granted, they usually suck at whatever they try different, but that's not the point. Jim Carrey is a perfect example.By the way, was Milla's character ever mentioned by name in the movie? Or do we all know she was named Alice from this site and the credits. My friends and I could all swear we never heard her name or the black guy who looks like Laurence Fishburne's name. What a sucky script, we can't even get names for the people....Anyways, I think this film sucked, if you think it was cool, then go rent a real zombie movie, or at least find something that's not a Matrix wannabe ( Jump kicking Dog scene, bullet time licker scene)...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Breath in.....breath out....breath in. Hi everyone, I am here to talk about the best zombie movie ever: Resident Evil. I first viewed the film when I was six and then I didn't understand English good. When I was about nine or ten, I viewed it again and it was then that I realized that Resident Evil is a masterpiece. It has guns and blood and horror all the way through and, boy, is it one heck of a awesome ride. The lady in red, Alice(Milla Jovovich), has to be one of the most important characters of all time. I mean without her the movie would seem crap and boring but she made it look good. The story is nothing short of brilliant because it will have you captivated and immersed into a world of zombies that like to bite! When 28 days later came out along with its favorable reviews, I though that it was going to be better than Resident Evil but after watching it, 28 days later came out to be nowhere near as good as Resident evil. I love this movie and all the sequels and I can't wait for the new one called RE: Afterlife.After waking up, Alice, has no memory of her object due to the exposure of nerve gas. Along the way she joins a squad whose mission is to contain a virus released by the Red Queen, a supercomputer in charge of the release of the T-Virus. They have to fight through zombies and the Red Queens fatal traps in order to complete their mission.The acting is wonderful from Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, and many more. They know how to use their expressions and body language in the movie. The gore and horror is so stupendous it was one of the reasons this became one of my favorites. From biting people on the body to deadly traps, this movie has it all. The sequels were impressive but could not match the power of RE1. All the horror and zombie fans will have a good time enjoying a zombie movie that comes out every four or three years. Ciao, ladies and gentlemen! ****/****</fullReview>

In my opinion when it comes to games like resident evil that have various story lines and many characters, it's kinda boring for a fan of the games to see the same characters and final bosses all over again, but this film has such an original resident evil storyline and original characters that I can easily see this movie fit in with story of the game without compromising the game. Mila Yovovich does a great job in this movie and I was amazed on how well she played that character, and let's not forget Michell Rodriguez which yet again shows us how much of a bad ass chick she can be. The zombies were good and kept me with chills throughout the entire film.

		<fullReview>I have said, I don't how many times, that if the movie were exactly like the game, we would see one person walking around a mansion for an hour and a half and solving puzzles. And the complaints would roll in about how boring it was. This movie and it's sequel, were what inspired me to play the games. And since I have played all of them, at least part way through, so many scenes in these movies make more sense to me. I can see where the director got the ideas he used. Also, if you have played the games, you can see that elements from the games have been used.Movie - Game *Alice's "husband" Spencer - Spencer Family Mansion *Matt's sister Lisa - Lisa is a character from RE 1 *The dogs *The Hive and most of the action takes place under the Mansion - Under the Mansion is where we find out why the STARS members are in the house in the first placeGranted, that's a small bit that I can think of, and yeah, Anderson could have had the original characters used, but if you saw the interview with him on the DVD, you would know that he said that he created the movie this way for people who had never played the game, but used things that the game fans were used to.Personally, I think the game series is awesome, and I can't believe that I had never played it before, but I thank Anderson for making this movie and bringing this series to my attention. It's easy enough for non-gamers to understand and enjoy; and there are plenty of game references for fans to see, even if some are not noticeable right away.P.S. - See this movie. And gamers, stop complaining so much. No adaptation is ever going to go the way we want it, and it just makes it harder for gamers to be taken seriously by non-gamers. Non-gamers already think we are losers. Let's not give them any reasons to think so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Umbrella Corporation is a top secret company operating from a massive underground facility known as The Hive. After a deadly virus is released into the air, resulting in the deaths of all who work there, an elite squad of soldiers is sent in to shut down The Hive before the virus has a chance to escape into general population of the city above. It's here that they come across Alice (Mila Jovovich) who has no memory of who or where she is. As they continue down into The Hive, Alice starts to regain her memory bit by bit, but they all soon discover that shutting down the The Hive is the least of their worries when they learn that the human population have returned to life as vicious zombies.Resident Evil is one of the much more enjoyable game-to-movie adaptations as usually these are pretty mediocre or just plain awful (Street Fighter, Double Dragon, Super Mario Bros. etc), and fans of the game should be pretty pleased with this movie version as well, especially as the makers of the movie have brought in the formidable creature known as Licker who features in the game also.The action for the movie is really good, which is accompanied by a pumping soundtrack to get the adrenalin going that wee bit more as well. A good few special effects are really well done also, especially in the scene that involves the Red Queen using a laser as a defence system, and the effects for Licker was impressive making it just as scary in the film as it was in the game.Just one thing - this isn't a gore-fest of a zombie movie either and concentrates more toward the story, so if you're expecting (or hoping for) lots of splatter then you'll be highly disappointed.Resident Evil is an enjoyable film to watch. It's not a thinker of a movie, obviously, but it's not supposed to be and doesn't pretend to be either. Also, don't expect an exact game-to-movie film. It's an adaptation OF the game, so enjoy it for what it is - a good zombie horror/sci-fi action film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>jovovich flexes her muscles in popular gamer zombie flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the first thing to understand about Resident Evil, is that it is not a horror film, despite the title. It is closer to a sci-fi action genre, which, to its credit, is reflective of its game origin.This movie, though it does have some scary moments (it of course involves zombies), is more a zombie mash-up, as the central characters smash their way through the vast hoard of the undead, which inhabit the Scientific laboratory which is know as the hive.The movie centres around the character of Alice (Milla Jovovich), who appears to be some kind of special ops soldier, but has a spate of amnesia, so only begins to realise this, once she has kicked some zombie ass. Alice seems to be equipped with some top-notch fighting skills and great Physical strength to match. She is joined by an "elite" military unit, which includes a Michelle Rodriguez, who plays a tough-nut military chick, but who actually spends the majority of the film with a permanent grimace, and kinda grant outs her predictable lines.But that doesn't matter, because this is Jovovich's ride, and she does glow, throwing great energy into the role. She just seems perfect to play the ass-kicking heroine Alice, with her striking looks and killer body to fit. The male fans will be particularly pleased with the Alice Attire, which includes the short mini skirt, giving Jovovich the opportunity to parade her long dazzling, lean legs through out. She also demonstrates their strength, with a variety of bone crunching kicks and stamps. She even unleashes the devastating muscle of her inner thighs, on one unsuspecting zombie, rapidly crushing his neck, with their brutal force.So with Jovovich proving to be a real hit, this will provide an enjoyable experience to watch, and remains the best film in the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh new look to the successful game.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems to me that I've heard many articles stating the Resident Evil movies are "terrible" or "a waste of my life". There reasons? They do not conform with the game. You cannot say that these were terrible movies just because it didn't directly relate to the game. Would you want to watch a movie that you knew what happened behind every door? It takes the fun out of it. Paul Anderson gave this game-made-movie a fresh approach. Capcom, that creators of the Resident Evil franchise did the same thing when they made multiple spin-offs: Survivor, Survivor 2, Outbreak, Outbreak File #2, Gadien, and Dead Aim. None of these titles have a direct connection with the game; unless you consider the Outbreak series being located in Raccoon City. Resident Evil 4, the most recent released game, has a story line separate from the normal T-Virus/Umbrella story. They do in fact mention Umbrella and have characters from the other games just as the movie does. These movies were made to intrigue the fans of this franchise as well as introduce it to others not familiar with it. In my opinion, these movies are a great installment to Resident Evil and I'm glad I spent time and money to watch them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>resident evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>what resident evil lacks very much was more action. the reason why i say this is because in every scene it told somethings that we already know.i also felt that the movie should have been longer because of the missing details that they don't feel us in with. Resident evil is a good action flick but it does not have the horror or(edge) that a real horror movie has. take dawn of the dead for instance it brings a mostly good story line and creates suspense and horror.RE picks up at the mansion in raccoon city where everything is a blur to her and her husband.Alice is then trapped underground with a few other soldiers. but i will not tell the whole movie that would ruin it for other RE fans. the first time i saw this was on com cast 5 years ago.I was very satisfied with it to the end. RE still have could have better for all the gamer fans.for Imb fans you should enjoy it but don't expect it to be cream of the crop material.i rate it a 7.5\10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I don't particularly like horror movies and I have never played this game. I must say that from beginning to end I was hooked. I loved the way it was shot and the casting though none of the names were what I would consider big names. Michelle Rodriquez busts out and nearly steals the show from Milla. She is tough as nails and kicks butt but is still sexy as can be. Milla as Alice is just fantastic and dead on. She is great as the innocent confused Alice who can't remember who she is or what is going on. She sees these events through the confused eyes of an innocent. Then as she remembers who she is the transformation is great and she comes off like King Kong, Godzilla, and Bruce Lee all in one. She looks great and she carries the movie and has shown she is an excellent action heroine. Milla can do anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not supposed to be scary. This is a just a movie to have fun watching with friends!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not supposed to be a scary movie. Its supposed to be a sci-fi/action/thriller. It succeeded all expectations I had for it (which were many). I don't think this movie could have been done any better. And thank God, "RE2: Apocalypse" is coming out in a couple of months, because that movie is going to kick some (pardon the pun) zombie buttocks! This movie also had a killer soundtrack too! I'm wondering if the same people that did the soundtrack for this one did the soundtrack for Freddy vs. Jason, because they both had great soundtracks. What sucks though is Marilyn Manson (I hate the way he his but he's a good musician) isn't returning to do the score for "Apocalypse". Sorry this is turning out to be more of a message board answer than anything. Here's a review for those of you who haven't seen this movie yet!You know what, just go out and rent the movie or buy it for cheap, because it rocks no matter what!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! I like the story, characters, plot and storyline! Milla Jovovich is great as the female heroine. The zombies are cool, the laser scene, and the licker.I like the twist near the end, and the ending is the perfect intro to the sequel. Forget what others have said about the movie, just watch this movie for the fun of it!While it may not be as gory as the zombie movies in the past, it is still good, and this movie doesn't just incorporate zombies, but other enemies in the games as well. so its more than just a zombie movie. If you are a hardcore zombie lover then you might not like it, but otherwise its very entertaining! If you get into the character's I'm sure you'll like the film. My Grade = A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kick Ass film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the primary literary phase of its development as an entertainment form, the gothic genre tended to involve a set of familiar ingredients - ruined buildings, virtuous heroines in distress, supernatural manifestations, heroic rescuers and loathsome villains, perhaps with a gang of bandits thrown in. Even though we call 'Gothic' simply 'Horror' these days, and even though most of us now visit this genre in its new home of the cinema more than on the pages of books, these ingredients have hardly changed over the years. Resident Evil is fascinating proof of this on two levels.On the most obvious level, for Ruined Building read The Hive - the abandoned but not-so abandoned biowarfare lab which is the principal location of this film. For virtuous heroine read Milla Jovovich wearing a dress as short as her legs are long; for supernatural manifestations. well, it's a zombie film. You get the point.On the second level, this film is a bit of an abandoned ruin itself, haunted by the wailing spirit of the film it might have been. You can see how the crumbling architecture might have formed a magnificent structure at one time - however, what separates this from every other romantic ruin you will ever visit, is simply that most ruins come to their tragic state of disrepair thanks to the gnawing of time's teeth, or violent misuse, and not simply because the owner got some cowboy in to build it in the first place.More of a folly than a ruin, then. Sometimes this film looks beautiful - the cameraman certainly knows how to present the lead actress in a favourable manner - I'm not sure Jovovich has looked quite so luminous on screen before. A pity, then, that the film is so awful taken as a whole.This is a film without sense, restraint, inspiration, or even excitement. It's not a good zombie film, not a good action film, and not a good science fiction film. It has an extraordinary trompe l'oeil quality that does, at times, deceive the viewer into thinking the film has some genuine quality - but it is deception only.What's more, it strikes me as rather bizarre that a film about zombies, with such obvious possible influences and precedents, should come across as being more interested in aping James Cameron than George Romero. Indeed, it is somewhat pointless since it is neither the first Aliens-wannabe, nor anything like the best-equipped to carry out such imitation; and this supposes that imitating another (perfectly good) film is even a good idea in the first place.The utterly pointless directorial allusion to Psycho which opens the film is entirely typical of the direction; so, like a jackdaw's nest, this film may contain many shiny and interesting things but it is simply a mess. Unlike a jackdaw's nest it isn't constructed of old twigs or covered in guano, nor has it fallen down a chimney into a fire yet - but we can always hope.I suppose utlimately what I find most objectionable about this exercise, and what makes me dislike it more than many other more obviously terrible films is that watching it you can actually see what a good film this could have been. This film earns contempt not so much for its mediocrity as for its wasted potential.I would have LOVED to see G.A. Romero make a comeback with a "Resident Evil" movie: zombies are his territory and he would have been able to pull some depth to it. Everything would have clicked, sure hit.10/10 If I could give it more I would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has it all; if you like flesh-eating zombies, horror, guns, secrets -characters with amnesia and stuff, powerful monsters, and/or the game; you're gonna love this one. I did! But if all that I just mentioned isn't enough, see it for the performance of Milla Jojovich, alone. As you may have guessed I'm a fan. I've not necessarily liked all the movies she was in, but her performances are everything I look for in a great female character. Pretty and pretty strange!! I don't know, she just always makes the movie, for me.This movie had more than that, though. Great graphics and plot. Cool characters and acting. Eerie atmosphere without too much dream-like strangeness. It had just the right mixture of everything.8/10 - I've seen better; but not much.thank you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Video Game to Movie Translation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen just about all video game to movie translations, I was hesitant on seeing this movie. It's apparently not that hard for Hollywood to mess up making movies based on video games (i.e Super Mario Bros., Double Dragon, Street Fighter, Final Fantasy, etc...). But I must say I was greatly pleased with the outcome. Resident Evil is loosely based on the first game of the popular franchise of games. It sort of takes place between part one and two. The acting is not Oscar worthy by any means, but it is not supposed to be. What Resident Evil comes down to is that it is a great horror movie with plenty of gore (gotta LOVE that scene with the room full of lasers!!!), scary moments and even a little nudity thrown in for good measure. The soundtrack kicks major butt as well. Paul Anderson did a great job (he also directed Mortal Kombat, one of the few actual good video game movies) and I hope he does as well with the sequel due next Summer. If you're a fan of the games or just a good horror flick, give this a shot.Overall: 8.2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of movies in my time, but this one kicked their butts! It got my number 1! In about 2005 I went to a friends place for her Birthday. We all sat down and started watching some movies. This was the only one that we could agree on. I was entranced through out the entire movie. The story, the characters, the mythology, it was captivating.A beautiful woman in a red dress, suffering from amnesia and being surrounded by anyones worst nightmares is enough to get the movie going. The progression was fantastic. Things never turned out the way you would expect.After I saw the movie, I hired it a few times from Video Easy. After about 3-4 hires I couldn't do it anymore. I needed to buy it. I bought it on VHS, but I was disappointed at the quality. I watched it another ten times. I then hired the DVD a few more times. During that time, I hired, watched (46 times) and bought Resident Evil: Extinction. We went to Thailand for a holiday, and I bought a copy the number 1. It was a pirate. Disappointedly, I came home and bought it again.After watching it a few dozen times, and researching Resident Evil on the net a few times I was ecstatic that there was a third coming out. I counted down the days for the next 9 months and got a group of 10 people and got them to join me in seeing it at the cinemas. We all loved it. I heard nothing bad from anyone. My blood felt strange, and I was in awe for the next week. I am just waiting now to buy it.If I could, I would send my money directly to them.I have watched the original about 30 times now, Apocalypse about 46 times, and Extinction 7 times. I bought the original Resident Evil on 3 different formats. If that doesn't say how good this movie is, I don't know what does.A really well done movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Opinion from a Resident Evil Game Fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i voted this movie a 1 because it was the worst game to movie, movie i have ever seen. it doesn't even follow the plot from the game. when does Alice come into play? i mean I'm just wondering if Paul Anderson even knew what the game about. being a hardcore Resident Evil fan i could name everything wrong with this movie but i don't have all the time in the world to do so. it would have been a good movie it if it wasn't based of this particular game and it had the title changed. this director/screenplay writer is know for bad movies so if your going to watch this movie be prepared to be bored out of your mind. he could have at least went with the video game plot because it was already a good story and he didn't have to ruin it. he made resident evil look so bad with this movie. the zombies didn't even look like zombies. basically it was a bad script, bad actors and bad director. and if u haven't played the game and u watch this movie, don't think its a bad game cause this movie really made resident evil look bad. this is just an opinion from a Resident Evil game fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precisely what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was, I'm sorry, *really* bad. I just can't see a point to it. In the game, all you do is walk around and shoot zombies; the film is exactly the same. There's just a bunch of guys walking around and killing zombies, and occasionally the zombies kill one of them. Every single moment of the film is a hundred percent predictable, so the 'plot twists' are obvious and the scary parts are simply not scary. The acting is horrible, Marilyn Manson's soundtrack is exactly what you might expect, the directing, plot and dialogue are non-existent.Well, I don't know... Maybe it would be scarier to watch on a big screen in a darkened theater, but to me today's horror directors simply got it wrong. You don't make a movie scary by showing lots of blood and organs and people with no eyes or no jaws. A truly scary movie is created by ATMOSPHERE (note Hitchkok and Kubrick). Seeing a guy being sliced into a hundred little pieces isn't scary, it's repulsive. There IS a difference, you know. Two thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really, REALLY, Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The two main things about this movie that bothered me the most are as follows:1: They never established a sense of utter hopelessness. In any Zombie flick this is the key. Zombies are dumb, clumsy, and slow. The only way to make them a true threat is to have your heroes in as small and unescapable place as possible, and to have HORDES of zombies for miles and miles as far as the eye can see. It has to seem hopeless. While it was clear from the start that at least 2/3 of the supposedly highly trained paramilitary team was expendable, at no time was Milla Jovavich in any danger. There are scenes in this movie where five or six soldiers are being swarmed by Zombies, and despite all their training and vast weaponry, they can do little. Then Ms. Jovavich, in her ripped up nightgown and with no weapons at all, drops in on them and goes Bruce Lee for three minutes, and, there ya go, no more Zombie threat. BULL!!2. While they did seem to spend a decent amount on the special effects for the zombies, the main Mutated Beast that comes at them in the end looked like something Ray Harryhausen might have done for one of his movies in the 60's. Which is not a slight to Mr. Harryhausen at all. Clash of the Titans and Jason and the Argonauts are two of my favorites, and a documentary on Mr. Harryhausen put me in awe of his talents. But the claymation-like movements of the Mutant in this movie really clashed with all the rest of the high tech goings on.All in all, if you want a decent Zombie movie, go rent "Night of the Living Dead" or "Zombie", an unnoficial Italian sequel that came out before Mr. Romero came out with "Dawn of the Dead". If you go with "Resident Evil", you will regret it before you finish the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is sapossed to be about the game. One thing is, is the zombies were a whole lot scarier in the game then they were on the "silver screen." The "licker" didn't arrive in the game until the second one, but they sure did leave out the big guy that JILL was to fight, the Tyrent . . . Does anyone remember him? I sure do. Where were S.T.A.R.S. Alpha and Bravo Team? Where was Jill, Berry, Chris, Wesker, Brad, Kenneth, Enrico, Rebecca, and Richard? And where was all of the weapons? It wasn't Racoon City, that doesn't come up until the second and the third one, it is set in Racoon Forest. I would think that if George A. Romero (Dawn of the Dead) did the movie it would would have been a lot better. At least when they did Tomb Raider it stayed with the game. I'm sorry, if your going to take something and redo it, do it right!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The absolute best movie of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil is the closest to a perfect movie I've seen in years. Deep and well build characters, stunning action and a script worthy of the video games. It's a perfect mix of personal drama between the main characters and the horror that awaits them in the underground complex they must investigate. The movie starts nice and quiet but after 10 minutes the roller-coaster ride starts and it lasts till the very end of the movie. Even though the movie is almost perfect it does have a few flaws, like the lack of blood and the amount of naked girls you'd expect from a horror movie involving undeads. Despite these flaws Anderson delivers a masterpiece to the masses and if you like this you'll love Resident Evil 2. A definite 10 !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute screamer of a movie - major stand-out of its genre.....whatever THAT is?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If movies are all about entertainment, this is one of the most successful films in history! The best action-fest I've come up against since ALIENS, to which it owes more than a nod!Absolutely the best video-game to movie transfer yet made. If it bears but a passing resemblance to the game itself, well who the hell cares? The simplistic plot is ideal for those with limited attention spans. The underground corporation-run sub-city experimental lab is thrown into disarray when a virus forces the "Hive's" CPU to shut down prematurely. A lot of people die most graphically. Another ALIENS type elite commando team (complete with an APONE look-alike) are sent in to "rescue" Milla Jovovich who for a while has no idea what the hell she is doing there, plus whomsoever they can rescue before they hope to kick-start the central computer who is playing some really innovative and rogue games with both the intruders and the audience.Mutant victims with more than a touch of the "Living Dead" cannibalise their rescuers one by one. Jovovich in easily her best role to date (are those the sexiest lips in screen history or what?) high kicks her oppressors and unbelievably well digitised Doberman reconstructs with flair and accuracy. There is simply no let-up throughout the movie which with the decibal screaming Dolby sound and rock-soundtrack just all dovetails together seamlessly. State of the art FX enhance this adrenaline-pumping scifi caper and propel it into the stratosphere.As good a horror/sci-fi/zombie flick as you are ever likely to see with one all time mother of a jaw-snapping monster yet devised. Makes the Alien Queen look like a sedated kitten!This is one mad movie with a kick-ass direction and totally awesome action sequencing! Check out the dicing-death by laser-grid! This was mega-cool! I went straight back into the theater and watched it at the next session!</fullReview>

Let's start with the plot. 1 homicidal computer (done in earlier movies) a lot of Zombies (done BETTER and with humour in MANY other movies) and a dash of lost memory (please, don't get me started). Hence noone really knows who the bad guy/girl is or event if there is one - and quite frankly I didn't care! The characters are so unrealistic and the acting so sub-...well---sub-everything, I'm afraid that I really couldn't care less as to who survived and who died a zombie-death we I had seen done better so many times before... hm. I think I hate Zombies now, and it is all due to this film. Damn! Oh, and I almost forgot! They decided to put in a pile of annoying and unneccesary flash-backs to p*** me off just enough to rate this movie 1 instead of a 2. So there you have it! You enjoyed this movie? SHAME ON YOU!

		<shortDescription>One of the best zombie movies in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The zombie movie seemed to be a thing of the past. Sure they were still making them throughout the 90s, but we didn't really hear about them as much as we did films like Romero's 'Dead' films, the 'Return of the Living Dead' series, and so on. Nothing really new or exciting was being done with the concept. One place where it was really kept alive was in the world of video games, including one Resident Evil. Having only played the game once or twice myself I didn't know how to feel about a film adaptation. I mean let's be honest, few films based on these games get it right. Sure the Mario Brothers movie is fun in a so-bad-it's-good way, but was it really satisfying? I guess that depends on the viewer. Anyway, thanks to this movie the zombie subgenre was hot again.Pros: A tense, terrifying opening sequence. Writer/director Anderson gives us a film that's a visual feast due to it's slickness, his use of blue lights, slow motion, etc. A cool electronic score. Moves at a brisk pace. All around, the performances are pretty good. Good special, make-up, and visual effects. At least a couple good scares. Some awesome set pieces; my personal favorite being the one involving lasers. Amazing production design.Cons: Fans of zombie movies may bit disappointed that it takes a while for the walking cadavers to show up and wreak havoc. Aside from some original touches, this film is fairly derivative of other zombie, action, and science fiction films.Final thoughts: This modern zombie flick is a whole new dimension. Back in the day it was either a chemical spill or voodoo curse that raised the dead. But this is like a Romero zombie movie with a futuristic twist. This may have been the start of a new type of zombie film.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" starts off with a slam-bang double-opening - inside an ultra high-tech underground research-and-development facility, something goes terribly wrong and a gas escapes as the facility's emergency system kicks in, locking down the building and resulting in the apparent deaths of hundreds of employees; at about the same time, above ground, a young woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up inside a grand mansion with no memory of who she is, only minutes before the place is stormed by a group of well-armed commandos. Thus begins the successful movie adaptation of the "Resident Evil" series of video games.The acting here is equally note-perfect: Milla is at the top of her game and shows off her acting chops as well as her more corporeal talents; in the hands of a lesser actress the role would have been generic action-flick fodder. Michelle Rodriguez (Ocampo) keeps snarling and cracking wise 'til the bitter end; Eric Mabius is charmingly and appropriately plastic (where is his character coming from, anyway?) and also carries off his role like a champ. Colin Salmon (James "One" Shade) once again bravely carries Shakespearean delivery into Anderson's laser jaws of death, while James Purefoy does what he has to do as the poor man's Chris Lambert. He's a good villain, and because of that you end up rooting for the zombies and even the disgusting "Licker". A word should be said about the special features here: while it's a treat to have a ticket to the less ambitious "Resident Evil: Apocalypse", fans of the original will find the six segments on the special effects centerpieces of the film tasty, particularly in the mix between good old-fashioned animatronics and CGI. The alternate ending is amusing for completest, if only to show just how critical a solid editor can be. And without a doubt, the hysterical main commentary track with Anderson, Jovovich, and Rodriguez is worth the price of admission alone. Lucky, lucky Paul Anderson! Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a science fiction horror film and based on the video game. I have never played this game so I had only known there are many zombies and people fight them. After watching this movie, I surprised that characters are very attractive. This story is not only scary but also describe of human involvement. Alice, who is a main character of this film has no memories when she awakes. As the story goes on, gradually she regains own memories. I think these flashback scenes are great. We can realize many things at the same time she remembers her memory. It is very exciting to revere many secrets such as who is she and what she wanted to do before she lost her memories. There are many zombies and cruel scenes so this film is scary for me. However, I enjoyed action scene of Alice and her company very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the film opens we that the film is set in a near future where the Umbrella Corporation is the world's largest business and that some of its activities are distinctly shady. The action then starts in a lab where an unknown thief steals a case containing a biological weapon that we later learn is called the T-Virus. As he fleas he smashes one of the vials releasing the virus into the facility, known as The Hive. As the virus is spread through the air-conditioning The Hive's computer seals the facility and kills everybody inside. We then cut to the sight of a naked woman, Alice, wrapped in a shower curtain; she gets dressed and is surprised first by an unknown man then by a whole squad of commandos! Their leader addresses her as 'Soldier' but she has no idea who she is. The other man identifies himself as a newly transferred police officer. These two are then taken by an underground railway to The Hive where we learn they intend to shut down the computer, known as Red Queen. Red Queen's defences kill many of the commandos and before the others shut it down its avatar informs them that they will all die. It soon becomes apparent that the people in The Hive have come back to life as zombies! Perhaps Red Queen was right; certainly many of them won't make it; some of them will become zombies themselves and not all of the dangers are outside the group.I have not played the computer games this film was inspired by so can't say how the story compares but it didn't feel like there was much unexplained within the film. The fact that Alice has no memory means that we are told everything we need to know as the leader of the commandos tells her. The film opens strongly with the scenes with Red Queen killing everybody in The Hive and after we have been introduced to Alice and her situation the action is pretty good. It is also varied; we have Red Queen's futuristic defences that literally slice and dice some commandos with a laser, hordes of zombies, zombie guard dogs and a mutant creature for our protagonists to battle against. While nobody is going to be winning any Oscars for this the cast do a decent enough job; Milla Jovovich is good as Alice; putting in some good action scenes and Michelle Rodriguez is fun as the hard-core commando Rain Ocampo and Colin Salmon adds some class as the commandos' leader although sadly he doesn't last too long. In many ways this film feels like 'Aliens' with the aliens replaced by zombies; we have an evil corporation, one of the group who is working against their interests and the fact that the protagonist and the toughest soldier are both women... I guess if one is going to borrow ideas from another film one could do a lot worse that take from 'Aliens'. The effects are fairly mixed; the zombies, both human and canine, are impressive but some of the CGI is far too obvious. The Red Queen is delightfully creepy due to the fact that it speaks with the voice of a young girl and prior to shutdown appears to be all-seeing. Overall this film is far from perfect but it is surprisingly fun in a fairly trashy way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the cornerstones of horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil franchise has quite frankly gotten out of hand. At the moment there are five movies made and a sixth in the making. Not all of them are that good, but most of them wouldn't exist if not for this film's good qualities and success.Resident Evil benefits from an interesting setting, full of creeping zombies and other monstrosities, as well as from some really nice actors doing their best to breath life into this video game adaptation. Both Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are perfect fit for their respective roles and really nail the tough action woman ideal. And yes, none of the characters in this film are all that deep or have good lines of dialogue, but such a flaw can be forgiven if the horror works well. And it does. The zombies are suitably scary, The Red Queen is unbelievably unnerving, the rest of the monsters, both supernatural and human, are a genuine threat and as a whole the film has a good claustrophobic feel to it. Would it have been better with more rounded characters and better dialogues? Of course, but it's not bad as it is.Aside from the characters, the film's biggest weakness, to me at least, is the fact that sometimes the video game shines through a bit too much. They make a commendable effort to make the film its own creation, but there are certain scenes, which just scream "a boss fight" or "a platforming section". Minor things really, but they do take away from the experience.As a whole Resident Evil is a lot of fun. It's actually scary because of its excellent premise and setting, because of its atmosphere and because it doesn't rely solely on jump scares. Definitely worth checking out for any fan of zombies and/or horror in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I think most zombie movies made today are stupid. While this is considered a zombie movie it does differ in one respect, you know what is causing it and it is not just some made up plot line. I think Milla Jovovich is super hot. In this movie she plays a human that been turned into an almost perfect killer because of her training and the virus that has been unleashed by the corporation. The corporation sends an assault team to investigate and they end up dead. Milla gets reawakened and starts to do her thing. She does it very well and wipes out several of the zombie like creatures in the underground lair. It turns out that Milla was a security specialist who was infected and then placed in suspension. Gee it turns out she has some kind of immune response to the virus. She survives and it takes off from there. I really enjoyed this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good back then but nowadays outdated CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a game Resident Evil was meant to be the next big thing. Seen it back in 2002 it was indeed something special but no out on Blu Ray I saw it again and it was a bit passé.Why, because the digital effects used are a bit out of time. It's strange to see it nowadays with the effects from back then, but wait, the faces doesn't always look believable when the dead are walking. But the dogs really looked stunning. The big monster on the other hand was clearly to see that it all was CGI. But not only that, even for a monster flick it is low on gore and even red stuff. Most of the slaughtering is done off-screen. But it is really the story that makes it watchable after all. A virus is let free in The Hive, an underground laboratory. The computer shut down all entrances to avoid infection. An elite military corpse has to investigate what went wrong and by entering The Hive they come across Alice (Milla Jovovich). She has amnesia and slowly her mind tells her what happened to her and what is happening inside The Hive.Being low on gore and red stuff Ithought it was meant to be PG-13 but knowing Milla we all know she isn't afraid to show her body and that's what she exactly does in Resident Evil. She even goes fully naked and shows it all if you watch closely. It was a nice entry in the genre with the walking dead and the monster but for me nowadays it doesn't really stand up towards the technology. That's weird because older flicks do stand their time. Still, worth watching.Gore 1/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Umbrella Corporation is a multi-conglomerate which operates a secret underground laboratory beneath a metropolitan area called Raccoon City. Inside the lab, scientists were illegally producing a virus which reanimates dead human beings. Realizing that the T-virus was worth a great sum of money on the black market, a thief steals the virus. However, just before attempting to escape the facility with the virus and the antidote, he deliberately contaminates the lab. Unfortunately, he doesn't quite make it out before being knocked out by nerve gas. A crack team of commandos then enter the facility and capture three people: "Alice" (Milla Jovovich), "Matt Addison" (Eric Mabius) and "Spence Parks" (James Purefoy). Everyone else has been supposedly killed by the computer defense system known as "the Red Queen". Racing against time, the commandos enter the facility known as "the hive" to disable the Red Queen and find out what has happened. Anyway, rather than divulge anything that might spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, I will stop right here. However, I would like to say that while the overall acting isn't that great, Milla Jovovich, and to a lesser extent Michelle Rodriguez (as the commando named "Rain Ocampo"), give awesome performances. Additionally, the action is fast-paced and the music complements it very well. All in all, I found this movie to be very exciting and it should appeal to those who like an action-packed thriller of this sort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different Side of Horror - Futuristic Style!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film a few weeks ago, and I must say, I was really impressed with how this film turned out. It is truly a different look on the horror genre, in a future like style, where characters, villains and the plot itself act very different. I think that RE is one of those good ol' modern horrors which should be given a chance and for good reason.The plot is not looked upon much, and it is very simple. A virus takes over the world, once a contamination is unleashed by a corrupt corporation. Survivorsw team up to survive. Sure simple enough, with not much ground covered, but what makes RE excellent is the action, the character development, the horrific kills, the technical/futuristic music and the theme of it all.I believe all of that stuff is done quite well and it so happens that it can become quite creepy with the dogs.Although RE isn't an award-winning film, it sure has some intense action and scary scenes to keep the viewer looking at the screen as well as pumping out the blood, gore and entertainment.My Verdict is that it is the best in the series (although I do like the rest so far). 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice, what's the matter?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a film version of Resident Evil was originally mooted, George Romero was down to direct, a fact that had long-time zombie fans like me drooling in anticipation; eventually, however, Paul W.S. Anderson got the gig, a guy who, to put it mildly, has never been as revered by horror fans as old-timer George. While I have never really understood the dislike for Anderson, finding his films to be mindlessly enjoyable popcorn fodder, I had to admit I was also disappointed by the news, and just a little bit wary.Imagine my joy, then, when Resident Evil was finally released and I discovered that Anderson had done a bang-up job, delivering a superb balance of ballistic action and atmospheric horror that stayed faithful to the source material to please the gamers and yet remained just as accessible to non-gamers; sure, part of me still wanted to see what George would have done with the film, but I was thrilled with the results nonetheless.Nowadays, having seen Romero's last three chapters in his Dead series (Land, Diary and Survival) and sadly realising the the guy no longer has the magic touch, I reckon that hiring Anderson was the wise decision after all. Although not as gory as I would have perhaps liked (you can never have too much splatter), Resident Evil is a quality slice of zombie mayhem: Anderson's direction is slick, without being too showy (ie., he doesn't resort to an overkill of trendy editing), there are some cracking special effects (for the day), and the cast all do a great job, with feisty female leads (Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez) not only kicking zombie butt in style but lighting up the screen with their loveliness in the process.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Residents of the Earth know well they live is a scientific age. Their's is a modern world where every modern convenience is at one's finger tip. Yet, few know, or would want to know the cost which many paid to have such a world kept secret. Now, Writer and Director Paul Anderson, has unleashed a film called " Resident Evil " which exists hundreds of feet below ground. There, a top secret science laboratory and a fantastic computer called ' The Red Queen ' hums perfectly, until one day it corrupts itself and releases a monstrous air-borne virus through out the maze-like multi-level complex called 'The Hive' causing immediate changes among the employees. Jason Isaacs narrates how the incredible computer become a danger to the world. Now a crack military unit, led by their team leader, Ames Shade, or 'One' (Colin Salmon) is summoned to destroy her. Inside the private quarters, a scientist named Alice (Milla Jovovich) awakens and cannot recall who or even what she is. Other civilians like Spence Parks (James Purefoy), Matt Addison (Eric Mabius) along with Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez) and Martin Crewes (Chad Kaplan) are all at the mercy of the Red Queen as the diabolical machine tries to kill them. Everywhere around them, mutant humans and ravenous dogs await their attempt to escape. From beginning to end, the movie demonstrates how fear can be generated from the terror-fill environment. Excitement is everywhere and one never knows just who is there to help or to hinder their progress. What can be concluded is that once you're in the Hive, chances are you will not leave . . . alive! Recommended for those who seek to be frightened. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like this movie because it is well written, well directed and Paul Anderson chose great actors to portray the the commandos. Michelle Rodriguez, Milla Jovovich, Colin Salmon are definitely the better out of all the other actors. The zombies are not put in your face at the beginning and there is a cause for the infection unlike the night of the living dead movies and also unlike the night of the living dead movies the zombies are less like the stereotypical zombie. The story is easy to get into. Although most of it is not based on the games as far as i'm concerned this was a great movie. Paul Anderson is a genius for writing and directing this movie. Acting 8/10. Story 9.5/10. Directing 10/10. This movie is still scary and it is most definitely better than its sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an hour and a half long and costs approximately a third as much as the game. The visuals and score are better than the game, but the plot, dialogue, composition, lighting and camerawork are worse.It's just occurred to me that a couple of generations of console or PC down the line, when game visuals reach cinematic realism and we can have proper virtual hotties, then there will be absolutely no reason why game developers should put in any more work than filmmakers.Enjoy your quality 20+ hour games while you can, because the line between game and film is getting narrower. When they reach 1:1 comparison, games will last (pro rata) approximately 4.5 hours, or they'll be sold as 1.5 hour "episodes" for the same price as a DVD.Shudder. I mean, Mila and Michelle are supremely hot, but I do like a *little* dialogue and imagination in my entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Dead Walk!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~Spoiler~Resident Evil, when you get down to it, is a well-crafted piece of horror. It's my favorite scary movie to come out of theaters in a long while, no teenie-bopper s**t here, just pure horror. The atmosphere and infectious score are second to none. I love the small glimpse we get of the mansion, with the blowing leaves and evil crows. It's also very claustrophobic at times and those are often the best horror films. Paul Anderson's direction is perfect and he succeeds in doing justice to the video game. The opening of the film is so tense (the elevator scene especially) I had to remind myself to breathe. There were some other scenes where I just wanted to jump in and start whippin' some zombie tale. The dog's were incredible and the train sequence was straight out of Resident Evil 2. The in-joke was also great ("Where'd all the bodies go?"). Upon viewing the trailer, the fight scenes looked very anime-esque. I didn't think it was going to work. However, the flipping kicks and snapping necks make Resident Evil quite original. It is easily comparable to a few other films though (but I'm not upset about this fact). First off is the hallway scene with the lasers. Someone watched Cube before designing that sequence. And then there's the bigger comparison: Aliens. Both films share basically the same plot, with a strong female lead, but who cares. The only things that don't sit right with me are the all-too-obvious CG Licker and the character of Kaplan; after all the crap he suffered through, that poor guy deserved to live. Those things don't take too much away from the film however. Resident Evil is an exceptional addition to the zombie genre and a great theater experience (I have not had an adrenaline rush like this since seeing Event Horizon, another Anderson classic). Can't wait for a sequel.Note for genre buffs: The newspaper at the end of the film reading "The Dead Walk!" is an obvious reference to George A. Romero's classic Day of the Dead. Also, Jason Isaacs (Event Horizon) has a great cameo in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't compare the game to the movie that well, since I've only played the game once or twice in the arcade and didn't last very long before I got eaten. (Check the trivia section on the IMDB if you want more info on that, though beware of many spoilers) I don't know if the game has any more of a backstory than the DVD box did: a virus is accidentally unleashed at an underground biological research facility that turns all the employees, lab animals, and experiments into flesh-eating undead. A rescue team discovers too late they are stuck in there with them; they have 3 hours to get out without getting eaten or, worse, infected before the ?Red Queen' master computer permanently shuts down all the exits.On the negative side, it was a little longer than an action movie needs to be-- 10 minutes could have been trimmed, I caught myself wanting to hit forward and skip scenes in the first half hour of people wandering warily around deserted areas. I've never wanted to do that with a Romero movie. It does take a little too long to get going, but when the action kicks in, trust me, it doesn't let up, to the point where I felt kind of battered after the movie-- really unrelenting. I couldn't stand the industrial/techno soundtrack, but then I don't usually listen to bands with song titles like ?Fistf*ck' and `My Plague (New Abuse Mix)'. I guess it was appropriate for the movie, I didn't exactly expect, say, Oingo Boingo (though that would have been kind of cool, now that I think of it) but it was grating after a while. Several shots were extremely derivative of Romero, but since I haven't watched the featurettes or commentaries, I'm not sure if the filmmakers intended them as a tribute/in-joke (like the newspaper headline blowing around a deserted street proclaiming THE DEAD WALK, always great to see in any movie) or just ripped them off with the plan to say they were ?inspired by' the other movie if anyone pointed out the similarities.The end seemed to be setting up for a sequel (according to the IMDB, one is planned but not even in pre-production), though at least not in an extremely cliched way, and it mainly irritated me because it was a cliffhanger. There's also several CGI shots where the monster looks about as realistic as the one in the actual game; I did not for a moment forget I was watching CGI, and it was VERY easy to tell where the animatronics ended and the CGI began in several key scenes.OK, enough of what didn't work. On the plus side, Milla Jovovich has proven herself to be one of the few genuinely talented model-turned-actresses, and gives a great performance. I was kind of disappointed in Michelle Rodriguez's acting, mainly because she was so good in Girlfight, but she was acceptable and at least can really look like a badass. There's quite a few fun--and sick--shots. There were plot twists that I actually didn't see coming--sorry to say, I could see most of the jumps walking up 5th Avenue-- and the plot was a lot more brutal and downbeat than I expected (for a movie based on a video game, and for a modern zombie movie, anyway)--good for them. They did definitely outright steal some ideas from Dawn of the Dead (and, as everybody has already probably pointed out, Cube) but at least had some originality by putting a slightly new twist on them. There was a much higher body count than I thought (not counting all the zombie employees, of course, I mean among the heroes), most of which was pretty ballsy. Characters did not die in the order I expected them to. Things got pretty cold-blooded (so to speak).I'd recommend it for a rental, if you want a mindless, scary action movie with some real suspense. You could do a lot worse (like rent the director's Mortal Kombat, for instance) Not bad for a mainstream studio movie based on a game.</fullReview>

However for me i felt this film was too short for one, then there wasn't a lot of blood considering this is a zombie film the effects... brilliant in some places not so in others to check out what I mean Just look at the scene with the playful head high laser defence system when it cuts through that guys face and it falls into a hundred pieces (great stuff) but then you see the rather crappy CGI-monster that is the licker (for all the people who didn't know). Then there's the plot which is non-existent maybe it was so rushed i didn't notice it or maybe i was paying too much attention to Milla Jovovich (reason in its self to see the movie :). If you think this re-view is designed to put you off then its not its just that i feel this film had so much potential and delivered less than i hoped for some people this potential has been fulfilled for me its not. When it come to the crunch i didn't pay to see this film but i would and would go to see it again.</fullReview>

Past Zombie flicks have contained a lot of bad acting with low budgets and story lines that weren't that great. Whle I can't draw comparisons of the adaptation into the film Paul Anderson does a great job of creating an empty eerie atmosphere. While some of the CGI effects are an unnecessary distraction the make up and costume design is first-rate. There's an intelligent story and great script. The stunts are fantastic notably the dog attack and the supporting cast are great and the two strong female leads Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are excellent. The music is hard hitting, foreboding which adds to the action and creepy moments. A good chunk of flesh eating entertainment-a great update and revival of zombie movies which pays homage to George A.Romero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GO SEE THIS MOVIE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie left me completley suprised. I was waiting for a gamer movie to once suck again as usual. The special effects are incredible and the story line is fantastic. The screenplay could have been a little better but, you get passed it with all the gore. Not that much fighting in this one but, wait til' the sequel part two has the best battles in it I LOVED IT8/of10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Great Women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Warning Plot Spoilers* A few minor plot fluffs that had to have been put in for the Hollywood look, but still a very edgy, action thriller. After the 5th element I did not have much hope for Milla, but she impressed me. She has learned quite a lot, and she is still very easy on the eyes. As to the bothersome plot points ? the red Queen is trying to kill the Sanitation crew in a closed tube with a LASER. First she uses a single beam and then she goes to a net? Would an intelligent computer waste time playing around or just go for one pass and be done with it. And when Michelle Rodriguez is dying in the train ? and then comes back and says I'm not dead yet, but actually she is ? come on that has been done to death. She had done great with that role too. I'm hoping to see a lot more of both these fine ladies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Umbrella Inc. "Bringing comfort into your home"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does anyone else see the relation of Umbrella and Enron, although Umbrella's deception turnouts to be a little more deadly? For those of you that are confused I am talking about the major corporation that does play a pivotal role in the plot of this movie(contrary to critical and cynical belief a plot does exist).My advice towards the other reviews that you are reading too is to be wary of any extreme take on this movie. Some people gave it a 1 out of 10 and that is not realistic because they were p***ed off by something in the movie thus shredding to part the entire film with fabrications and unbelievable exaggerations that actually made me laugh. On the other hand be wary of someone who gives it a 10 out of 10 because they might be one of those crazed, lunatic biased fans that jumps at the sound of an unexpected groan.Although I have to admit that I am a biased fan of the game and I did go into this movie extremely pumped, I also had expectations for the film to live up to. And just being able to say that I like a film that I have expectations for, much less being sucked into says a lot. Now enough of this BS credibility stuff let me tell you about an a thriller of an action/horror movie. The first thing that jumps to mind when I think about Resident Evil- beginning, middle and end- is the atmosphere. There was just something about the movies extremely fast pace, tense feeling and genuine dread that made me connect to the picture. Granted I do have my "I wish" 's about the film too but like the others said, its a horror flick you let them slide and keep an open mind so that you are able to enjoy the rewarding aspects of the film, which are fresh, unexpected and plentiful.Milla makes me think that there are few things more sexy than a woman with a gun. She is stunning throughout the picture and honestly feels like the only character developed by the way she plays her role outside of the dialogue and story development. As Alfred Hitchcock once said (not in his exact words) "a really good actor saves you 20 minutes of character development because the audience buys into the character" and Milla does this. You really get a good feel for who her character is by just watching her and she is the one person that I got attached to. Now if we could have only gotten a little more out of the other characters in terms of story development. I also felt that Hugh Jackman could have fit perfectly as the prisoner in this movie, but it did have a small budget. The movie is also unique in its pace as it never slows down and you honestly cannot look away for a second for fear of missing something critical, which you might. I have never ever seen a picture move faster. This again adds to the atmosphere of the movie that I felt comparable to Memento or the Matrix. If you know the feel of those movies then you know what I am talking about.The action choreography is very good and better than most movies and there are even some scenes that will leave you saying "awesome" and "glad I wasnt that zombie getting my neck snapped." I felt that the special forces as protaginists with guns gave the movie more validity and realism, as well as staying true to the game. Of course there are also some great sequences with the hardware which also left me impressed. I am anticipating the DVD of this movie already because I would love to see if there is a directors cut of that gives us a little more in character development and in turn would add to the story. The thought of this however might take away from the razor fast pace, which creates the critical and unique atmosphere that Resident Evil video gamers definitely are familiar with. Overall I would give this movie 9 out of 10 as I am rating it based on what it is. A movie that is well above par from your average horror flick bringing in a realistically scary storyline and solid plot that aside from a little more development and omission of a few cheesy scenes and one liners could be one of the classic horror movies of all time. This film will not disappoint the gamers either and fans of Milla, as I am now one of them after watching this movie, will respect her performance. She is the standout in this film. Also look for the things that make the horror picture a different type of scary movie. Director Paul Anderson uses the element of terror to scare the sh*t out of you and that is rare in a scary movie and I find it more terrifying. Moreover the original concept and conscious effort to avoid cliches left a refreshing taste in my mouth, but an extremely paranoid and skittish mind waiting for a zombie to reach from the back seat of my car on the ride home and take a chunk out of my neck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Zombie Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have some mixed reviews about this movie. I will detail the good points first and then point out a few flaws or holes in the plot that can make or break your opinion.Good Points:Music, action, zombies, blood, shooting, guns, some flesh flashing are all good points.Action, shooting, guns and blood can all be categorized together. One compliments the other and it was all well put together.Zombies were fantastic, with their heart stopping surprise thriller moments, great makeup and pretty good but not spectacular computer animated effects. They made me think of the old great Night of the Living dead movies, but the actors that portrayed them were better.Music was fantastic, the score was great for this movie and I was well pumped up for all the action scenes.Flesh Flashing.. well being a guy.. let's just leave it at that..Bad Points:Not many, while the music and score were great, it was a little too loud at a few points. The acting wasn't spectacular but adequate for a zombie flick.. just think back to Night of the Living Dead and remember how bad the acting was for those movies.Lastly, the major plot hole I noticed. The movie shows that one of the blue vials were broken in the lab, the lab then sealed and locked. Allright that's fine, but what I find disturbing, and this is after having worked in a level 5 capable lab environment, is that the virus could become airborne through the ventilation system. Technically.. impossible. There are so many filters and security measures in virus labs that it would be completely impossible for that virus to go airborne. Even if the hive computer wanted it to. You just can't turn off a filter.If you think about that, then there is no movie, they should have thought of another way to spread the virus, say.. through a plague of rats they were testing on or use the method that was used in 12 Monkeys.Overall: Great movie and a must see for video game fans or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Resident Evil fan gives **1/2 stars out of 4</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I been playing Resident Evil games forever now. I own all four games including the original version that came out in 1995. I must say I enjoyed the movie. I was entertained for 2 hrs, but it is clear Paul Anderson intended the movie to be for the younger audience. I liked the fact that the movie stood true to the game's story line with the exception of it's main character's but that did not bother me. What bothered me was the fact that I didn't jump once while watching the film, and not once did I get goosebumps. Horror? play the video games, those scare the hell out of me. This movie had techno and rock music playing in the background while funny looking zombie's are on screen looking to bite people. The zombie's are not scary at all, compared to George Romero's zombies, those were creepy, even John Landis' Zombies in the Micheal Jackson video Thriller looked creepier. Not once do you see the zombies in Resident Evil tearing flesh on rotting corpses. Watch Dawn of the Dead , and you'll see what I mean. I expected to be disturbed by this movie, like the games do to me, but unfortunatly not the case. What's good about the movie is the story, decent acting by the sexy Milla, she's mint, as well as my favorite sexy gangsta chick Michelle Rodriguez. Too bad there's no S.T.A.R.S. members, like Wesker, Barry, Jill or Chris, but the screenplay is very similar to the game. Keys needed to access different parts of the lab, the crows, the lickers, security code's ,and even a sewer scene. All true Resident Evil fan's know a RE game is not an RE game without a Sewer level of some sort. Looks like there will be a sequel, This time the setting will be the street's of Raccoon city, like Resident Evil 3 "Nemesis" which is actually part 2 in the game series. I hope it is creepier, and scarier, and bloodier, because if the video game's have mature ratings to keep it away from minors, then the movie which is rated R should not be intended for the young audience as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, the first game to movie that doesn't suck!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though definately not an Oscar winner, Resident Evil is an enjoyable zombie flick. Though it mostly borrows it's material from other horror flicks, it does have something original. A heavy metal track. In a horror movie. Heck, if it wasn't called "Resident Evil", I would have thought it was an action movie. Of course, this sometimes causes trouble. Like how the music sometimes totally drowns out the dialog. Then again, there isn't much dialog. Since the characters are pretty much storyless, when one of them dies, you can't even remember his or her name. Kinda sad...However, the zombies were awesome! The extras actually looked liked the living dead, with CGI making it seem as if they were missing skin. The zombies waddled around (like they should, by the way) more or less aimlessly, trying to eat the people (nobody can remember their names anywho). The Licker was something else, though! The amount of time they must have put on it was extensive, because it moves swiftly and, in a strange way, gracefuly.I guarantee you that this movie will make you jump a couple of times. Thinking about it, I remember how every time something scaring would happen, everyone would jump out of their seat and land with a "poof". Kinda funny...As for RE fans, only the "Hardcore Fan Boys" should be disappointed. You know, the ones that wanted an exact recreation of the first game. But wouldn't it be lame if you already knew what would happen? As a final note, go see this movie if you like zombie flicks, RE, horror movies and movies in general. It won't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not know if you have ever played the Game by Capcom. If you did so, you will probably find this movie terrible! The horror and panic atmosphere in the movie is just a faint idea of what the video game is and the inappropriate sound-track spoils all the scary scenes. It looks like this movie has been done in a rush. This movie is miles away to be a horror movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has guilty pleasure written all over it: it has no character development, little revealed plot (it's like an installment of the games - you're never sure all of what has happened or that will happen in the future), and, ultimately, no point, but - unless you're adamantly opposed to either zombie or video game movies - it's hard to deny how creepy and fun this film truly is. "Resident Evil" has more than its fair share of genuine frights, some nice effects, and very few instances of incredulity when it comes to keeping certain characters alive - something that's plagued more than a few thrillers recently (MI2, Gladiator, to name a few). Yes, the suspense in this film is actual suspense, i.e. in every scene there is the chance that the main characters could actually lose. The movie plays out very much like one of the games, which was enough for me to enjoy it.That said, the movie has its flaws. People needing something deeper than close calls, gore, and death to enjoy the film will be let down. And there was certainly opportunity for the film to be more than just another installment of the game. There was definitely room for character development, which may not have seemed necessary for game purists (because, naturally, in the game you assume the main character's identity and can identify with their horror in that manner), but usually it is for movies. There is little room for personal attachment to the characters in the film, which is a small let down, good as some of the frights are. The movie also could have initiated us more in the workings of the Umbrella Corporation. There's a strong anti-corporation message under all this gore, but it never gets fully realized.Still, an overall enjoyable film. The laserbeam scene will go down in film history. Not for the squeamish.Matty J 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only is this the best movie to come from a video game since Paul Anderson's own Mortal Kombat (RE may have even topped MK), it's the best American zombie movie in ages! Sure, it could have been more atmospheric (the RE games provide a feeling of dread that the movie didn't equal) and there could have been more gore, but as it is, it's still an astounding effort. The creature effects were good (though the CG-ness of some of them was too noticeable), the zombies were creepy and relentless, and Milla Jovovich was fantastic (and hot!) It ain't quite Night Of The Living Dead or Return Of The Living Dead but it's better than most of the Italian gore-fests, and certainly worth seeing a time or two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the better movies made from a game if not the best when it comes to horror and action! Despite the differences, I was not disappointed and think the movie is a well-done adaption.Resident Evil is a kick-ass, tension-filled, action-adventure experience just like the game. Excellent visual and special effects, plenty of moments full of terror, anticipation and panic that starts right from the beginning. Let's not forget the carnivorous zombies and vicious dogs as well as a new loathsome creature that will make your skin crawl. In all that hysteria, Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez' characters rock!(If you've seen Thir13en Ghosts, this is similar but better although not as eerie and gory.)This movie is just as entertaining to watch as the game is to play. I hope the "game" doesn't end and that there will be a sequel to this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be the best zombie-mutant-shoot-'em-up-splatter-film I've seen in years! It rocks, it rolls, it's lock and load entertainment of the finest kind! And certainly not for the faint of heart or even weak of stomach!Not having played the game, I can't comment on the film's accuracy. But Resident Evil, unlike previous attempts to transfer video games to the big screen, is a great action film in its own right.The plot is very simple: A team of elite commandos is sent into an underground laboratory to find out what caused the death of several thousand employees. Of course, an evil corporation has been evilly getting up to evil tricks and nasty things are lurking in dark corners.Now forget the plot and fasten your seat belts as the elite team is not only taken apart by some cool special effects but also finds itself on the menu as hors d'oeurvres, entrée and dessert for a horde of ravening zombies, mutated Dobermanns with attitude and a giant...thingy!Writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson pulls out all the stops as the countdown ticks down and the bodycount steadily mounts. There are moments that will make you jump and your pulse race, gunfire aplenty, loads of narrow escapes and some great "Oh ****!" moments; all to a pounding rock beat.There's more than enough blood and guts shown, figuratively as well as on the floors, walls and ceiling, to satisfy all but the sickest of individuals (Hi Susi!) and full credit goes to the prosthetics, make-up and special effects departments.Milla Jovovich makes an excellent kick-zombie heroine (and I for one, would volunteer to have my neck snapped like a dry twig between her thighs anytime!) as does Michelle Rodriguez as one of the troopers.Resident Evil is everything Tomb Raider should have been and wasn't. If you've lost faith in ever seeing a video game successfully make it to the big screen, you will believe again. If you won't see this film because it's based on a video game, you will be missing out in a big way. Overcome your prejudices, I did, and finally get your money's worth from a trip to the cinema.Producer Bernd Eichinger's Constantin Film has recently had its name attached to some very dubious offerings (All the Queens Men, for example, or 666-Trau keinem mit wem du schläfst - trust me, you do not want to know!). But with Resident Evil the company is well and truly back on top of the game.Now where's the sequel??!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, mysterious, intense and creepy sci-fi-horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Anderson's "Resident Evil" was released in 2002 and is based on the video game of the same name. I don't play video games so this review is based solely on the film.Since its release I never gave the film any thought, but the red poster &amp; DVD cover with Milla Jovovich in a ripped red dress somehow snuck into my subconscious over the years. Then I caught a 15-minute snippet of the film while channel surfing (not knowing it was "Resident Evil"). The part I saw was near the beginning where Milla mysteriously wakes up in a shower in a mansion. She obviously doesn't know who she is or where she's at and wanders around the mansion trying to figure things out when -- BAM! -- something happens, but I don't want to give it away.That's all I saw. I didn't have time to watch anymore but I decided right there to pick up the DVD. The set-up is intriguing and brilliantly executed.***PLOT SPOILER*** (Don't read the next paragraph unless you want to know the basic plot) A biological "accident" causes the supercomputer that runs an underground complex to shut down the entire facility and gas the 500 workers to death. This installation is called The Hive. The mansion is a secret emergency entrance and a commando force is sent by the Umbrella Corporation to go down and find out what caused the supercomputer -- the Red Queen -- to shut down the facility and kill the people. It turns out that a virus has turned the 500 Umbrella employees into hideous flesh-eating zombies, which may sound totally absurd but the way it's explained in the film is somehow believable, for a sci-fi movie anyway. Milla and the commandos slowly discover the truth. Can they get out alive? ***END SPOILER*** POSITIVES: - As already noted, the opening is truly intriguing, successfully capturing the viewer's attention.- The slow revelation of the mystery is superb, including who Milla really is.- Milla herself is stunning. The entire film she runs around in a red dress with a slit up the side. Her face and expressions are magnificent.- The story itself and the delivery (sets, etc.) ring of brilliance. This is sci-fi of the highest order.- The film features a cool eerie score highlighted by some rocking nu-metal acts.NEGATIVES: - Although "Resident Evil" is original in many ways it's sometimes reminiscent of other films like "Aliens" and "Dawn of the Dead". Hence, some things are predictable; for instance, you know anyone who gets bitten by a zombie is gonna eventually turn into one.- To be expected, the mystery build-up in the first hour is better than the last half hour, which is action-filled. Why? Mindless action with numerous quick edits somehow always becomes boring. Wouldn't it be great if a sci-fi-horror film like this ended in a truly unconventional blow-your-mind way (like the original "Planet of the Apes")? But the final sequence makes up for it, sort of. Besides, since the film is based on a video game the slaughter comes with the territory.The film runs 95 minutes before the credits roll.PERSONAL GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you that played the video game of Resident Evil I am sure you had a lot of fun playing. Unfortunately, I don't think I ever did play the game, at least not outside of an arcade version. Certainly not on Playstation or Sega or Nintendo. Yes, I am that old.Anyway, I love these movies. There is not any one part of any of these movies I don't like. If I could watch them all the time I would. Not because of the walking dead, but because Milla Yovovich is hot! It doesn't hurt that we see Milla almost nude a couple of times and there is a nipple glimpse; I won't call it a nipple slip, it was there on purpose.Anyway, like I said, there is literally nothing about any of the Resident Evil movies I don't like. However, as has become my custom in my reviews I have to list my all time favorite scenes. There are three I absolutely love.The first is the scene where the group of soldiers along with Alice (Milla Yovovich) and Spence (James Purefoy) attempt to turn off the Red Queen. Four of the soldiers enter a corridor which leads to the Red Queen's mainframe; after opening the door to her mainframe, the Red Queen closes the doors at both ends and traps the four soldiers. The Red Queen activates her defenses, in the form of lasers; first one that travels along one line, then one that moves up and down depending on if the soldier jumps or crouches, and finally a laser that turns into a grid and slices through the last soldier.I like a lot of the scenes where Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) is the macho soldier. At one point she tells another character to "blow her", hilarious. Several scenes into the movie after being bit, Rain is taunting the zombies by dripping blood from a wound in her hand down from pipes the group (Alice, Rain, Spence, Matt and Kaplan) is crawling along.The second scene I like is when the remaining members of the group, minus Kaplan, figure our that Spence is the one who released the T- Virus. Alice attempts to stop Spence's escape but he does so anyway, after a long speech how he did everything for Alice. In the end Alice doesn't buy anything that Spence says and he leaves. But Spence doesn't get far. He is soon killed by a Licker, a mutated monster that is hunting the survivors.The final scene I like is when the Licker attacks the train as the survivors are trying to make their way out of the Hive and the Mansion. The Licker claws it's way to the control end of the train, scratching Matt's arm in the process. When it reaches the controls of the train it attacks Kaplan and kills him, then goes after Alice, Matt and Rain. While Alice and Matt are fighting the Licker, Rain finally turns into a zombie. Now Alice and Matt have to fight the Licker and Rain. Alice traps the Licker's tongue with a pipe and stabs it with another pipe trapping it, yelling to Matt to open the doors to the undercarriage. Matt does this by shooting Rain in the forehead forcing her back into the button for the doors. The Licker falls through the door and from the electricity of the third rail catches fire. Alice closes the doors and cuts the tongue of the Licker letting it tumble away from the train.I said it before, and I'll say it again. I love these movies. I give this one 10 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say ? these films are either hated or loved, hated because they don't follow the RE games exactly and loved for the action sequences, effects, guns, RE game characters and purely for being a RE movie. I for one never thought RE 1 should follow the RE game exactly because it just wouldn't work. Can you imagine a movie character on his own wandering around a spooky mansion looking for keys and other various pieces of treasure, it just wouldn't work. What you get however is an all out action movie that starts briefly "granted" in the well known RE Mansion then goes underground to the high tech Umbrella Facility. Where an adventure in sues with characters that are well created enough that you care about them, especially the Alice character. In short this inst Shawshank Redemption but it is one kick ass zombie film !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie based on a Video Game? Really? Let's face it, Doom sucked (No offense intended, Dwayne), Tron was so-so (Oh wait, that's right, the movie was the basis for the game.) and Lara Croft, well...Hmmm, maybe I better shut up at that. After all, Angelina is one of the hottest women on the planet. Speaking of really hot women, Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are certainly in the top twenty or so. This film is a no excuses romp through all the zombies and evil creations any modern Frankenstein could dream up, and the players are all well versed in the action adventure genre. This is one of those films that brings together all the phobias of evil corporations, illegal experiments, and scientists backed by the military to produce horrific weapons of mass destruction that, as always, backfire. James Purefoy is the greedy bastard that starts everything in motion, but the Red Queen, a computer with the holographic persona of the designers daughter, is HAL and Skynet rolled into one times ten. One by one the rescuers succumb to either the Red Queen or the Zombies, and we are sitting on the edge of our seat waiting to see if anyone survives. Rated R for violence, language, and some brief nudity/sexuality, this film has spawned four sequels and who knows if more are coming. Powerfully entertaining and thrilling, I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good sci fi flick with all the elements to keep it interesting. Definitely collectible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining, an intense action-thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For die-hard fans of the original 'Resident Evil' video game series, this film may come as a disappointment, as the general horror and darkness that made the games so unnerving has been ditched here, in lieu of an intense action-thriller. Nonetheless, in its own right, this film is highly entertaining.Milla Jovovich puts in a superb performance as Alice, who is lead into an underground base of a multi-national corporation to do battle with a series of ghoulies and monsters, including a horde of the undead. With terrific co-star Michelle Rodriguez, there is never a dull moment, moving at a furious pace with just the right mix of dry humour, mystery that surrounds the "Umbrella Corporation" and its motives, and impressive action sequences featuring an agile Jovovich in the dress she's barely wearing performing some remarkable stunts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil is not the best zombie movie, but the best action based on zombies, the battle between humans and zombies. The movie focuses on this battle as it should be, there are not trashy sub stories or there are not dull characters. There is not a cliché scientist who responsible for all the stuff. By the way, the movie is stylish and well executed that the sequels don't have. Also, the whole film is entertaining. Resident Evil is a consistent movie on all counts, direction, script... The mise-en-scene, especially the set designs, camera angles and atmosphere recall computer games. Besides, the laser scene is very high adrenalin and to me one of the most unforgettable scenes, not only of the movie, but also in action cinema. The first battle between Alice, the team and the zombies are my favorite, also a great demo scene. It is very long and satisfying. The make up effects are not flawless, but very impressive, not like the second and third movies (they were flimsy) There could have been more clash with the zombies, but as said, in terms of action and a Resident Evil adaptation, it is satisfying. The dog scenes are interesting, even if a bit funny (karate against animals?) The other Resident Evil movies copied it by the way, because it is really creative. The train scene is also pretty good. As said, mostly, those kind of movies start well, some of them develop well, too, but at the end, something ruins everything. Thus, Resident Evil is an exception. Lastly, yes, as many people think, the closing was one of the best closing scenes ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie I at first hated with a passion and never wanted to watch it again, but as I started to like the sequels and bought them I decided to give this one another look and I was proved wrong. Although this film follows nothing of the games (this coming from a huge RE game fan) but is an okay film standing on it's own. Like I've said for the other RE movies, you'll probably like it if you are a casual viewer of Horror/Action films but if your a Resident Evil fan, maybe watch it once but even myself complain that these movies should have followed the video games.

		<fullReview>A virus has escaped in a secret facility called "The Hive," turning the staff into hungry zombies and releasing the mutated Lab "Animals" that they were studying. The complex computer shuts down the base to prevent infection. The parent corporation sends in an elite military unit, where they meet Alice, who is suffering from amnesia due to exposure to nerve gas. The military team must shut down the computer and get out, fighting their way past zombies, mutants, and the computer itself, before the virus escapes and infects the rest of the world. Alice must also come to terms with her slowly-returning memories.This is the best zombie movie ever! It has a scary script and the ending is WOW!!!!!

		<shortDescription>Project Alice is online?Resident Evil Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul WS Anderson has given us the newest trilogy of diminishing returns. I have never played the video game before and therefore went into the 2002 original Resident Evil containing little knowledge of the mythology. With that novice mentality, I found myself really enjoying the film. It gave me the background needed, the action and suspense expected, and a cliffhanger leaving me anticipating more. That continuation came but two years later with the subtitle Apocalypse. Here was a film that showed how the series' origin story was a huge part to the main plot of the first. This entry featured a bare-bones story, namely the extraction of a scientist's child from the infected Raccoon City, yet that was okay. The action was amped up, the characters more accessible, the acting vastly superior, and the ingenuity evolved. While lacking in plot, it excelled in action and effects, making it an equal, in my mind, to its predecessor. Its final twenty minutes was even devoted entirely to setting up the third piece to the puzzle. Here, though, is where the train derails hard. Extinction had a fantastic setup, yet instead of continuing right where we left off, we meet a caravan of survivors seeking gas and motoring cross-country. Nothing is progressed story-wise that we already did not know. Where the sparse plot didn't matter in the second, it stuck out like a sore thumb with the latest installment.It is Milla Jovovich's total blank slate in the first film, which makes it so endearing. We learn what the Umbrella Corporation is all about as she slowly remembers her role with them. It was a successful zombie movie, utilizing the jump scares and the hyperkinetic pace needed to keep you on the edge of your seat. All the characters were enjoyable to spend time with, we got zombified dogs, and a story that kept a bit of intrigue as to what everyone's motives were, while also being intelligent enough to keep my full, undivided attention throughout. The demise of all the people involved was interesting and to have a film end badly for all was a nice breath of fresh air. Alice does wakes up at the end, alone in a ravaged city, but she is definitely not in a position to rest up or smile at her good fortune.The transition into the second film is then seamless. We find that she didn't just wake up, but in fact is an experiment let loose on a city that cannot be saved. Our two survivors from the original are now pitted against each other to see which is the better soldier, and therefore the more effective military weapon. This fight is the entire story, though, as far as the main mythology goes. Otherwise, we have Alice and her new band of warriors on the lookout for the virus' creator's daughter. In effect, then, the whole story could have been told in about twenty minutes?they go in and get the child, Alice and Nemesis fight, boom, the film is over. However, the tale is padded with huge action sequences and gory zombie carnage. With the addition of Mike Epps to the cast, we are also treated with some nice comic relief, missing somewhat from the first besides Michelle Rodriguez's sarcastic quips. I never minded the simplicity of it all because it never tried to be more than what it was. I stuck with it until the conclusion and found myself even more excited for the third part. The setup had so much potential. Alice was fully formed, all her memory intact, and a new ability in telekinesis. With Nemesis gone and the zombies no match for her, we could finally get to see the showdown between her and the Corporation itself.And with that, we are treated to Extinction. It starts off pretty good with a cloned Alice being put through tests in a mock-up version of the mansion from the first film. It gets intriguing to hear what the scientists have been up to and to learn that Alice is outside trying to find survivors and keep herself off the grid. Then we get the first sign of trouble, an action scene that has nothing to do with the plot. Let's kill some hicks in the desert. If that wasn't enough, we also get a twenty-minute fight between our survivors and crows?yes those pesky black birds, newly infected. Sure the payoff is great, but really we are now halfway through the film and all that has happened is Alice found her old friends. We already knew she had powers and that her blood was special and could mean everything to the project. At the end of the film, that is the exact same knowledge we are left with. Besides many deaths and what could be the beginnings of a complete trainwreck of a sequel, starring no one else but Jovovich, (you'll understand when you see it), we learn absolutely nothing as far as mythology goes. I felt cheated and let down greatly because this film could have done so much more.In conclusion, the trilogy starts strong and ends with a disappointing whimper. The first had everything you could have wanted in a sci-fi/zombie/action flick. Scares, plot twists, and loads of violence and gore rounded out the successful entry. In came the second, lacking substance, but making up for it with flare. More characters, which never hurt the proceedings, more blood, more action, and more monsters can only mean non-stop enjoyment. And if the film doesn't deserve an extra point or two for Sienna Guillory's Jill Valentine, then you must have watched a different film from me. Next came the unfortunate failure of a third. What is less even than a bridge to the inevitable fourth, (will the box-office be enough to warrant it?), this last entry is a wasted opportunity to add to a nice little franchise.Resident Evil 7/10 RE: Apocalypse 7/10 RE: Extinction 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil was by far one of the best video game adapted movies, especially considering the low budget boundaries. Unlike other zombie horror flicks it doesn't literally "throw the zombies in your face", it makes you wait and wonder what will happen. This giving the movie a better element of surprise in the beginning then other zombie flicks. Overall the performances from the actors was good, but at some points could have been better. As a fan of the game, I was very pleased to see how it was presented. Although the ending could have been better, I strongly recommend you seeing this if you are craving action, zombies, and suspense all in one movie.</fullReview>

And that is exactly the "overall-feel" about the movie. The pieces - actors, storyline, filming - fit together. It IS a stupid monster movie, it is NOT like the game, but everybody takes the project serious. But it is in no way a great piece of art. Resident Evil is a solid movie, and good at this, no more! Nothing new, except for the scene with the zombie dogs. Ain't that beautiful. It is a new idea for the genre, it's visual fun. Simply cool.</fullReview>

I think Michelle should have been in the second, that she some how came back to life, i wouldn't care if she was evil or not. And i think this is the only movie she's been in that i've heard her scream (when one of the people infected with the t-virus bites her). The second one has nobody from the first except Alice, Matt is kind of in it, he doesn't look like Matt, the actor from the first, isn't Matt, he is some kind of monster. I've never played the game of resident evil, but i've heard its good and I'm going to play it eventually... who knows when that will be? Over all resident evil, and resident evil2 are GREAT MOVIES, they are two of my three fave movies. i give them 10/10, maybe 9.OMG good movie!!!</fullReview>

I can also speak Serbian, so if you will ever read this mail I would like to talk with you, just to ask how did you manage to succeed in your life. You don't find a lot of people succeeding from Serbia or Montenegro. But why Jovovich? You are Jovovi&amp;#263;, I am 100% Yeah...

		<fullReview>(Checked "spoiler" for a brief mention of the plot in paragraph three)First of all, I'm not into video games (gasp!), except for Age of Empires II, which I inhale. So this is the perspective of someone who's never played Resident Evil, the game.I watched this while working at my computer via a cable TV feed being piped into a little window in the top corner of my desktop window (Sci-Fi channel), but about 20 minutes in I quit pretending to work, went full-screen, sat back and watched. I was amazed. Yes there were some unrealistic elements, but I think this is a beautiful movie, really well done. It has a wonderful mix of suspense, creepiness, futuristic cool, and a good story.Milla Jovovich is AWESOME. She played her role perfectly, achieving a perfect mix of brains, bad-ass action hero, sexiness, and sympathetic figure who actually cares about human life and saving everybody in the group that's trying to escape the Hive.I'm writing this comment having just rented and watched Resident Evil 2- which I've been eagerly anticipating for a couple years now, having loved the first one so much. I'll eventually post my comments about the second one on the appropriate board, but briefly, it sucked in comparison. It was enjoyable as an action movie, but everything that was awesome about #1 is missing in #2. #2 is ultimately forgettable, but #1 is a movie I'm going to dig up and watch every so often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident evil?...more like Cube 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start, I am a big fan of the Resident evil series (well the first 3 anyway) and once news reached my ears that they were making a movie of the first game I was pretty excited. But then I actually sat down to watch it, and to say the least was very disappointed with the out come.BIG SPOILERS AHEAD The film begins in an underground laboratory owned by the corporation Umbrealla inc. The lab is hidden deep within the basement of a mansion. Some asshole releases the virus the scientists are working on which can reanimate dead cells. The scientists get contaminated.Now when I saw this I thought fine its not 100% accurate but hey it still has the potential to be a great movie.NOThe computer within the lab goes psycho, sealing all the rooms off under quarantined regulations, then it begins wiping out all the scientists. Some woman wakes up who has lost all her memory. Deciding the time is right to go for a walk in the cold while wearing nothing but a highly revealing red dress she sets off on her journey, minuites later an army team burst through the windows and join her in her quest to do... not much. About 25 minutes further into the movie this team comes to a large hallway. The hallway leads to the computers core where they can shut it down. And low and behold the computer kills off 2/3 of the cast with its lasers faster than you can say "danger Will Robbinson danger" The survivors shut the computer down; zombies come out, and the team being of the greatest intellect decide the best way to execute the undead is by leg shots and shouting "Stop" a good 14 times. Team intelligence then decide they shouldn't have tried to switch the computer off, and so they switch the computer back on. Near the end of the film we are introduced to the ultimate biological weapon resembling a single licker, no I'm not kidding, they also incorectly name it a Hunter, where the hell is Tyrant you might ask? It's not as if it was an important part of the series, Tyrant virus and all. Our film draws to a close as the "ultimate killing machine" discovers its huge weakness it touches train tracks and promptly explodes.*yawn* The film has few plot twists which I wont spoil here. Most of the enemies from the series don't show up, in fact, the majority of the film concentrates on the evil computer not the creatures. Not even zombies.This movie would have been much better if it WASN'T called Resident Evil, but something else, anything else. Really, it bears little relation to the video games anyway besides the virus's and corporation's name and I still feel this film was only called Resident Evil so Paul Anderson could sell his hand me down script and market it towards a wider crowd (maybe this could be attributed to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within as well). The point is if this movie was called Cube 3 he could still get away with it. In fact this film probably is Cube 3, just named Resident Evil to attract fans of the series to watch this very average zombiefest.Oh well it can't be as bad as Street Fighter the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though there are few similarities with the game, Resident Evil still manages to pull off an average story with its impressive special effects and camera techniques. It starts off with a scene in the lab and gives the viewer a taste of how it all really started. It then goes off about a group of paramilitary commandos that are supposedly being lead by the character Alice who has a slight case of amnesia. These well trained soldiers eventually come across a crazed super-computer, former scientists now flesh eating creatures, deadly lasers,vicious dogs,and what not. The characters eventually see what has happened and soon gives out some surprising secrets.Overall, Resident Evil is a pretty average film but should still be given credit for its camera working and special effects. Storyline-alright,but seems a little bit random. Acting-Milla Jovovich had done a well job of playing a character who cant hardly remember anything,Michelle Rodriguez,and of course Colin Salmon. My Opinion-Average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shoot-em-up smash at the movies!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ultimately I had no expectations of this movie. Although the advertisements did catch my attention and I was a huge fan of the original game...I didn't expect greatness or failure from the movie. Originally when they talked George Romero or Sam Raimi as director and the possibility of stars such as Kiefer Sutherland or Bruce Willis starring I will admit I did form some sort of image as to what I thought Resident Evil should. This movie did not come close to what I had in my head...but it didn't matter...I still consider it amazing. The action was top notch and the music was pounding and excellent. It was futuristic (moreso than one would imagine) and the whole story comes together in such a way that you are left very, very satisfied. The characters and actors are excellent and you are definitely left disappointed to see any one of them killed. I would like to have seen more of them survive. Milla Jovovich comes through in a big way as the kick-butt heroine who gets some great dialogue. This movie felt like X-Men in the way that it left you wanting more and it felt like it was only the beginning. I thought the ending to Resident Evil was phenomenal and perfect and I couldn't have wished for a better ending. I hope that Hollywood carries on the grand tradition of milking sequels because I would keep coming back for as many instalments of Resident Evil as they can churn out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does the game franchise justice...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An all new story beginning before RE1 and ending around the beginning to middle of RE2. Definitely captures the feel and tension of the game. The eerie (and fitting) horror soundtrack by Marilyn Manson heightens the tension. Lots of good moments that make the viewer jump in their seat. You also get to see A LOT of Milla in this. Lots of tips of the hat to players of the game, you will notice quick shots of similar rooms and cameos of characters from the game. This film, while light on plot, does make use of it's R rating. Definitely the best video game to movie conversion ever and the best horror film in several years. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I borrowed this movie from my cousin who said she didn't much care for it and since me and her agree on almost everything, the fact that I found this movie to be pretty decent surprised me all together. The one thing that bothers me though is the slow beginning and the action scenes are jumpy and a little too chaotic as well as not really the best when dealing with the actual coordination part.Now for the good... the acting was up to par and the soundtrack was pretty awesome...but then again I love rock and metal music. It is a must see if you love zombie movies.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-My number 2 pick for best film of the year as of now over films like Road to Perdition, Signs, and My Big Fat Greek Wedding.Exciting adaption of the video game finds a group of soldiers led by Alice (Milla Jovovich) sent to an under ground lab to contain a deadly virus that re-animates the living dead and having to deal with an out of control monster and an annoying computer. Fast paced thriller with a well chosen cast, especially Milla, and stunning sets and production design. What it lacks in character development, it more then makes up for it in terms of sheer excitement and scares. The ending is a knockout!Rated R; Extreme Violence, Profanity, and Brief Nudity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" was more intelligent than "Aliens," and the twist and turn in the movie was good. I'm not a fan of slasher/horror, and living dead movies, but I eventually settled into the movie with its scientific sounding rationale gunk. I was terrified (although not scared, as if there's a difference). I particularly liked how compassionate some of the scenes were, while the beginning indiscriminate killing was quite effective in setting the tone for the rest of the movie.It's really difficult to describe what it was about "Resident Evil" that made it stand out above the usual blood and gore movies. The touch of humanity, the computer logic, the seriousness of the military discipline? Somehow, all the parts seemed to work together. Milla as an actress did a great job with a number of different portraits of human behaviors and emotions. The script was a notch above the usual cut and slash. Somehow the ending even seemed apt and complete creating both the typical uneasy shucks reaction but at the same time yeah ok, I understand, a decent ending - serves you right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil, Where?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this movie I had high expectations on this film, being a fan of the game for which it was named. Now if you don't know the game this is a 'okay' if somewhat lackluster Zombie film, After all it's standard fair for a movie of it's type.My problems with it stems from the fact this movie has NOTHING to do with it's source material but name alone. It felt like it was written by someone that didn't even read the crib sheets for the Resident Evil Game but ONLY skimmed them(briefly).That is my biggest complaint, it seems standard fair these days in Hollywood to slap on a name recognition titles on to movies with little to do with the source material. That's my complaint to the point, if this film had been more faithful to it's title (No Tyrant, Mansion, Jill, Chris or ANY characters from the game used or referenced to in the slightest.)I might have enjoyed it more.But as it stands it's at best a sub par overrated zombie film with a misplaced title.

		<fullReview>This movie had all the elements of a great zombie hack and slash great movie if it hadn't been for the technical aspect of the movie. The story line is gripping from the very start. The action is intense while the special effects are incredible. Now for the but...What makes this movie hard to get behind and really enjoy are ALL the mistakes in the movie. From Milla wearing clothes one second in the shower to not wearing clothes, to the microphone boom in every other shot. Its hard to believe the intensity of all the shooting and killing if right when someone talks the microphone comes down and almost hits them in the head..Whoever did the editing of this movie along with the sound crew should have been fired from the beginning and cleaned up what SHOULD have been a cult classic from the start..

		<fullReview>I am sure that this would have been a much better film had George Romero (Night of the Living Dead) signed on, but I don't take anything away from Paul W.S. Anderson, who did a good job despite lack of experience with zombies.I did a double feature last night to prepare for the third film in this series. No, I haven't done video games since Pacman, so I had no idea what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed Milla Jovovich and, of course, am always happy to see Michelle Rodriguez.I have only come into zombies recently, so I was not aware that this film brought the genre back after a long absence. It is to be praised and revered for that, if nothing else.Now, in the next film, I hope there is a little more zombie and less sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Milla Jovovich saved it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Capcom's game of the same name first hit the market, it got many critic's praise due to its unique gaming style and for its excellent atmosphere of horror and suspense. Six years later, this movie version has neither followed the story or characters (this movie is rather a prequel of the game) nor presented that unique atmosphere of survival horror. In the end it turned out to be a cheap action movie with blazing guns, bloody gore, raw language and other accessories. The plot was a bit planned at the beginning but messed up in the end. Apart from all these, the movie simply rides the top with the help of a new fresh Milla Jovovich.Well, when you place Ms. former Joan of Arc in a skimpy red party dress with an assault rifle in hand you win half of the battle. But besides Milla is lucky to have a fine character on which the director offered much more attention than the story itself. And indeed she is good in such roles. And she was well assisted by good background soundtrack and camera angles. And a provocative ending too, allowing the viewers to dream whatever they can for Resident Evil 2.In all, the movie is actually nothing. You go just to watch Milla. and considering that I'm giving it no more than ***.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O.K. at Best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going to keep this short and sweet, and without spoilers.The video game, Resident Evil, changed my life. It was the first video game that I had ever played that brought the experience of "living a horror movie" home on my Playstation. The game is exciting, dark, unnerving, original, and generates incredible atmosphere with it's blend of sound effects, eerie music, engaging storyline and characters, and innovative game play. The game succeeds in every way, and this movie fails in every attempt it makes to recreate the experience.The movie retains about 30% of the original premise of the video game, and fills the void with a bunch of characters, events and locations that have nothing to do with, and never appeared in, any of the games. This is pretty much "Resident Evil" in name only: there are a few monsters that appeared in the game, and the film merges some of the aspects of the Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2 games.The sequels in the Resident Evil video game series that followed, and continue to follow, range from fantastic to mediocre, but ALL of them are better than this movie.First of all, I agree with my brother when he says that "Anderson is a hack". If you need proof of that fact that Anderson is NOT a good director, just observe how can take wonderful, engaging stories and turn them into lifeless, generic, Hollywood-friendly steaming piles of crap that he can peddle to the masses who need only a an action-packed, brainless film to lure them, salivating, to the box office.If you are a huge fan of the games, and have followed their story lines closely, you will most likely HATE what Anderson has done to this series. As it stands by itself, this movie is OK at best. As a part of the Resident Evil phenomenon, it's pretty much just crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never played any of the RESIDENT EVIL video games so I didn't really want to see this movie. Then my friend told me that it was written and directed by Paul Anderson [MORTAL KOMBAT, SOLDIER] and I suddenly had an urge to see it since Paul Anderson has never made a bad movie [in my opinion]. The reviews made this sound like an awful movie, but the truth is it's one of the better movies of 2002 [so far]. There's tons of great action sequences, lots of horror, and for this type of movie, there were surprisingly good performances from Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, and Eric Mabius. Even though it isn't a perfect movie, I'd still recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I do not play video games, being RavenGlamDVDCollector takes up too much time to fool around with other stuff as well, and my interests are 100% glamour-driven. Also, I originally, way back in 2007, had a multitude of choice, and decided to give RESIDENT EVIL and ULTRAVIOLET and BLOODRAYNE a miss, they'd be blood and gore fests, judging by the posters in the video store. Recently, I obtained UNDERWORLD's first three, and then there was the trailer of ULTRAVIOLET, which surprised me, I was hooked, that I had to see. Okay, I have since learned that people do not go for ULTRAVIOLET, that it is a rip-off, and, yeah, as good as that trailer is, it also became immediately clear to me that there is a lot of fakery, a lot of cartoonish stuff, I mean, look at the trailer, it's great, but cannot hide that there might be problems...... Tp cut a long story a bit shorter, I could only obtain ULTRAVIOLET as part of a two-disc deal, the other movie being RESIDENT EVIL, so, a couple of days ago, I watched the big gore fest. Ooh boy, it was only the week before that I saw THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE with those mandrill creatures attacking, and this week it was mutated Dobermanns on the rampage.I've been a fan of Milla Jovovich ever since she was a child star in TWO MOON JUNCTION way back in the previous century, yes, I am that old! Then, a few years later, she was in RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON, and that one sure had its moments. Time has treated her well, I see, quite a few years later, she is still this stunning long- legged beauty with this amazingly aquiline face. She is ultra-feminine, prime quality Ukranian export. The movie itself has a cumbersome slow start, but eventually the action is astounding, the producers had gone all out to provide the creepiest ugliness you can hope to find on film. It's just, I wouldn't really call it scary, it's not really suspenseful, it happens too blatantly in the open, it doesn't come unexpectedly, that's what I mean. But the mutated dog scene, that is something, when you hear that dog coming on, tip, tip, tip, claws on steel, and the first sight... hoo, horrible.I'd give them an A for effort, but I have to point out that the movie takes a very long time to establish itself. Once it gets going, it lifts off, but you can't shake the feeling that it could have been done a whole lot better. Certainly Milla Jovovich (hey, and the commentary finally taught me how to pronounce her name!) is the ideal choice. Really, that is the only thing I am sure about re this movie. Some of the male leads are kinda blah! but I'm not going into that right now. And Michelle Rodriguez is one tough ol' bird, hey?A weak point of this very violent movie is the unrealistic portrayal of dismemberment. A pinprick causes blood, people, you know that. So what does it mean when on-screen HUMAN characters, not undead characters, get chopped up, but not a drop of blood? Well, d-uh, it means the producers we're trying to appease the American Motion Picture Association by cutting down on what would have earned them a more stringent rating. But if a character doesn't bleed, it was undead too... Something everybody forgot. Major goof.In closing, this Milla Jovovich fan is quite satisfied. She's great, movie is not too bad, not as good as she is, though.Grrr-aarghhh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil is a 2002 film based upon the game with the same name starring Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez. The problem with video game movies is that they just can't follow the game for some reason Hit-man is a silent assassin in the games but in the movie he's half Rambo, Half Chuck Norris. Also the casting seems to sometimes fail, including the director and the cgi. But Resident Evil in my opinion it's a good franchise it's dumb but it's full of gore, zombies and action so why shouldn't i like them? The problem with the first movie for me it's the pacing some times it's good like the Room with the Lasers that was a great scene although it makes me think that Paul W.S Anderson likes to cut this actor in pieces all the time he did the same thing with AVP too and the scenes where Alice fights the dogs but until we get in the action we just see a bunch of people walking and talking and that will bore the hell out of the viewer. Also you can spot easily the difference between the god awful cgi and the practical effects on the monster when it runs and moves it's CGI when it comes closer it's a puppet. In the end Resident Evil indeed has problems but it's a fun action thriller that i'm sure it will find the right audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Years of sequels and still the most solid, story-driven of the franchise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start off this review by saying that I am a fan of the video game franchise- far more than I am the film franchise. However, this review is an honest review about the film- Resident Evil- and the overall film franchise. For starters the film kicks-off with a laboratory catastrophe, a viral outbreak of sorts which in turn, forces an emergency lock down on the facility leaving many for dead- setting the tone for the overall story line to this film. Milla Jovovich plays Alice, a woman who mysteriously awakens from an unconscious state which is implied to be taking place after the lab catastrophe. The mystery revolving her whereabouts, her identity, and the lingering sensation that she may be in immediate danger soon draws the audience in for the remaining 90 minute, action-packed Sci-Fi thriller!Alice, along with a clean-up crew made up of a special military unit, soon unravel the horrible truth as to why the laboratory was put into lock down and the doors should have stayed locked! Brought to you with a chilling soundtrack, plenty of intense horror sequences, and jam-packed with some exciting choreography and action- Resident Evil is a truly timeless Sci-Fi thriller. Unlike its preceders, Resident Evil provides an intriguing story, a solid and likable cast, and ties up its own loose ends before setting us up for the sequel to follow. Without a doubt in my mind, Resident Evil is by far the best film in the entire franchise. This is a film that knew exactly what it wanted to provide its audience- a fast-paced Sci-Fi thriller that would be enjoyable to those who played the games and to those who didn't- and needless to say Resident Evil nailed it! If you're a fan of the genre and have yet to get your hands on a copy, I highly recommend doing so. As stated, this a timeless flick that is great to watch for a little bit of action, suspense, and everything else you'd expect from a Sci-Fi film. 8/10 - and by far the best film of the franchise!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated zombie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sent in to discover the cause of a communication mishap, a woman and a commando team discover a chemical weapons facility testing a deadly virus has turned the staff into ravenous zombies and must find a way out alive.This was quite an enjoyable if slightly flawed adaptation. Among the better qualities on display here is the rather impressive bureaucratic stranglehold on display that truly gives this a great feel for what kind of obstacles to overcome. The systems here are quite fun to overcome in the house' security offers a rather intriguing start here that goes along quite nicely with the system underground providing plenty of thrilling times here with the laser grids, control panels, supercomputers and high-tech containment units give this an effective base along the way to string the action off of. Those are quite fun here with this one providing this with its best features from the different encounters here really making for a thrilling time as the first encounter in the storage rooms where not only is the team overrun on all sides but the ineffectual methods to deal with them cause some explosive action with the swarm closing in around them as they fire away fruitlessly before escaping, a fantastic scene of the group escaping into the tunnels swarming with the undead through the sewer with them and leads into the frantic escape through the central station crawling with zombies all around them. This one also goes for some great action featuring the mutants as well with the scenes of the security office with the mutant dogs or a rather impressive brawl with a monstrous licker on-board their transport train so there's some rather nice diversity amongst the action within here. As well as the great-looking gore and zombie make-up here, these issues make this one enjoyable enough to hold off the few problems in here. The biggest issue in this one is the fact that this one makes a rather curious decision to knock off most of the rescue team in the house before getting to the zombies held on the lower levels. While this here does allow the film some gore while off the defenses quite nicely, the fact that these scenes take kills away from the zombies and creatures later on does seem a little unfair to feature here so that there's hardly any time here to survive to get attacked with such a small group of targets left. This really could've been solved easily by either eliminating the number killed off there in the site or have bigger team sent in initially and it solves that easily. As well, there's the fact that it plays a little too loose with the rules of infection by showing several who are turned quickly while others who are bitten repeatedly take forever to turn simply due to storyline needs despite the continuous bites meaning it should've occurred even quicker than it did previously. These, along with some shoddy CGI at times, does hold this one back somewhat.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was much trepidation when this came to bloom way back in 02, an adaptation of the highly popular zombie horror video game franchise? hmmm. Anderson's first foray into the adaptation world after some reasonable films like 'Soldier' and 'Event Horizon', his CV didn't look too shabby but previous attempts at this sort of genre proved dismal.Amazingly enough this first offering in what is now an overly ridiculous 'Matrix' 'Blade' 'Underworld' monster mash mess is actually quite good and sticks to the original formula. It all kicks off inside the well known mansion but in an imaginative spin delves deep underground to the secret Umbrella facility. Here we get a very admirable 'Aliens' type thriller as a team of commandos battle to survive against a sadistic mega computer that runs the facility and of course lots of undead creatures/monsters. So the whole film is contained within the underground labs instead of roaming the mansion which at first seemed wrong. Maybe they could of done with some mansion action but it actually works well. Later adaptation 'Doom' does seem somewhat similar in premise though, slight case of concept rip methinks.Naturally the effects are mostly CGI for the creatures and they do now look rather crappy, very obvious. Of course you can't pan a film for that but the CGI hasn't dated well, where as sets and overall look for the film isn't too bad, zombies look a bit childish though. It is nice to see most of the video game nasties in the film though, Anderson certainly did well not to stray far from the source yet add to it as well. Zombie dogs which aren't fully CGI but real dogs with makeup is a nice touch, a hint of the crows and Lickers which are good n scary...accept for the fact they are all fully CGI. The Red Queen computer character is a good addition to the fray and quite eerie at times also 'you're all going to die down here'.This film is a welcome presentation of the franchise and shows what can be done if done properly. Its still mind boggling to me that the film is actually a reasonably scary horror flick! there are quite a few good jumpy moments and certainly no hesitation with blood. A creation of slow building dread and suspense is well handled throughout, alongside some nifty visual moments and a good if slightly clichéd bunch of commandos all adds up to a darn fun ride.Yes you can see many steals from other similar films (the usual tough bunch of soldiers taken down one by one) and the characters are all generic copies stemmed from a certain Cameron film but the fact its not a kiddie flick and watered down is fantastic and astonishing. There is no silly slow motion nonsense, no over the top set pieces, actually Jovovich plays it for real and isn't a Selene clone from 'Underworld'...yet. Probably the best of the series if you ask me, and it was an Anderson film!! Its formulaic and clichéd but still provides enough punch to do what its suppose to do...pretty much like the 'Doom' film.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" is notable today mainly for launching the longest and most commercially successful so far action-heroine franchise of the new century. Milla Jovovich, in her now-iconic red dress, looks amazing and acts naturally (as opposed to Michelle Rodriguez's forced performance). The film does not have an ending - just a setup for the next chapter. It's well made, with an impressive production design and some moments of effective tension; but it's also very derivative, and the mediocre digital effects may make you nostalgic for the good ol' days of practical gore. Trivia question: how much did that extra who got his neck snapped between Milla's powerful thighs got paid? Because I would have done the part for free....**1/2 out of 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I was 15 i've heard my friends talking about this movie. It's impressive a guy like me, that have had watched a thousand movies still didn't look for Resident Evil.Well, RE starts trying to make us want for more. Not just the first scene, but the whole movie. It didn't called my attention that much at the beginning, but te final scenes did. I wanna watch the sequence right now.The best about RE is it's soundtrack. It's what makes this movie convincing, entertaining, frightening and apprehensive at the same time. Even if the soundtrack isen't that original. It is pretty well placed in the right moments, and it's almost constantly throughout the movie. This , and not the scenario is what makes it have a cybernetic_high-tech atmosphere.RE's photography could really be better, a little bit more of dark would be welcome. And talking about photography, I also must say about special effects and GCI computer generated imagery). In 1999, Matrix have had presented us with amazing special effects and cgi, soon, I truly believe monsters could be improved 3 years later, in Resident Evil. Even if it's not the same company working on it.Actors are not that great and sometimes pretty bad, script is the easier ever written. I've watched on English (I'm Brazilian) and still did understand everything they were saying, giving the simplicity of it's language.RE is and entertaining film, won't add much at your knowledge, nothing like cult-movies or the most intelligent ones, but you'll like to spend some hours watching it.Cheers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie, I was still under the impression, that it could have been made by George Romero. Not a good state of mind to be watching any movie then (at least for me). If I had rated it back then, it would have been a worse rating I can assure you that. Especially because I had read a script (a first draft), of what Romero would have done with it.But as it is, the movie kicked off (literally) a series of movies. And when I re-watched it recently, I did so with the commentary on. And when you listen to the people talk about this movie passionately, you can't help but almost fall in love with it. I was tempted to give it a very high rating then. I think the middle way was good though. There are things that have been done good here (some of the action, the suspense stuff, the casting of Michelle Rodriguez) and others that haven't (the story, the rest of the action as Rodriguez does say so herself on the commentary and some other things).All in all a decent horror movie, but nothing to get too excited about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super-killer zombie virus destroys the world?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apocalyptic. But it's supposed to be more than just one virus - in terms of the real apocalypse, whenever it might be.Some here complain about a computer game. I could care less about a computer game. Movies based on comics. I could care less about comic books, and so on.Here, the movie ends with our 'vampire-slaying' heroine basically emerging into the surface, shotgun in hand, to find zombie destruction and zombies probably about to come out of every open door. Roll credits. Apparently, she got the cure. But the doctors themselves were attacked by remaining zombies, or whatever, or just took to the disease because it was in the air - something. It's not explained. She appears to get the cure. And everyone else seems to disappear before she escapes from the locked OR.As for how she got there, well apparently there's this big e-ville private corporation, probably tied into the military I'm so sure, that build an overly large Andromeda Strain underground round lab in order to create mutate devil dogs and whatever other sort of monsters - including zombies. Yeah. And so, they succeeded. And 'vampire-slayer' and her SWAT team friends - yes, I kid you not - are ordered by the e-ville company to shut down the problem, blow the lab, etc, etc.But by the time they get there, the e-ville central computer, the artificially intelligent Eagle Eye/HAL/every other such computer you've seen in movies, has locked down the facility and sees her and the SWATs as part of the problem, not part of the solution.And the e-ville computer has a terrifying, and kind of silly, weapon to take care of the troops. They walk down a corridor. Lights suddenly come on. Gertrude, or whatever the computer is named, locks doors at both ends and proceeds to scan the hallway with something like an industrial laser beam, cutting off body parts and cauterizing simultaneously. The last guy is about to avoid the beam when he's presented with a hole he can't jump through. Basically the killer laser takes the shape of chicken wire fence, passes through him, and carves him into wee, little diamond-shaped pieces.So the remaining team shut down the computer, find the zombies, figure they have to turn back on the computer, find more zombies, find a cure, more zombies, and the two remaining survivors stumble topside only to be manhandled and separated by guys in germ protective gear. As I said, the 'CDC' guys mysteriously disappear, the heroine escapes, and finds that zombies now rule - at least in the town around the facility.Are there plot holes? Well . . golly. Is the mission even sensible given the actions of the computer to essentially do their job? The only guy with any real purpose in being there is the cad, the scoundrel, who wants to 'sell-it-to-the-Ruskies', or just to whomever. And of course, she's there to eventually take the cure. But that's not really her stated mission.So good film? Not quite even good. But a few moments. Monsters in the dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First and BEST Resident Evil Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'm one of those people who never played the Resident Evil video games, but after watching the film several times with friends, I quickly picked up on a lot of the stuff.This film starts out and almost immediately sets the plot in motion, before we get to know any of the characters. The computer system kicks in, knocks everyone out, and then hours later the camera is focusing on Alice as she wakes up. For almost the entire first half of the movie, the suspense is very real and effective, and the second half is zombies (and humans) getting their brains blown(/chewed!) out.Definitely one of the better zombie movies; and MUCH MUCH better than it's sequels. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is my favorite movie in the series.If I had a chance to see the 4th film, which was animated, then I would probably like it better since it got a good score on IMDb.But anyway, I can't say that the first was as good as the second, but it still is a nice piece of film.Fans of zombie movies and video games shouldn't be disappointed.What can a person not like about this film? Sure, it may not be as good as 'Dawn of the Dead', but it's still a zombie movie, and a good one too.What the movie really needed was some gore.There was a little blood, but I love to see a movie with people being torn apart by zombies.Lucky for me, the 3rd film managed to fix that problem.Bottom line: 'Resident Evil' is a good zombie film with a terrific performance by Mila Jovovich.The sequels are better, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Straight popcorn Horror cinema. I don't agree with some users who state that the producer and director was heavily influenced by the game. In my opinion, this movie lacked of the creepiness and eerie atmosphere of the original Resident Evil game. What do I mean? The extremely dangerous, morbid, haunting and macabre atmosphere felt in the mansion in part 1 and in the streets of Racoon City in part 2. The movie deals with a scientific explanation towards the events and most of the action sequences but I feel that it lacked of the creepiness and sadistic nature of the game. Yes I enjoyed the extremely detailed and expensive action sequences but I wanted a more zombie oriented movie.The direction that this movie took should please fans of Sci-Fi and Survival Scientific Horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that i am a big fan of the movie's game series doesn't make me feel any good when i finished watching the film. The Pace of the movie was very slow and actual zombie is not shown until much later in the movie. Though the camera angles in most of the scenes rocks (the close up of umbrella logo on the bullet thing) the whole idea of escaping the hive area in the movie is not very intriguing. It lacks the major theme of exploration of the environment unlike the game, making it rather a short movie.(SPOILER WARNING!!!) Horror? i don't think so. There is some tense and shocking moments appearing in the movie but none of them are adequate enough to push audience off their behinds. The horror factors are very weak in this movie where some of the scenes might kick-bums if only more eerie atmosphere were built and the concept of i'm-all-alone-in-this-zombie-infested-building were more put to use.Instead you will have "military groupies" wandering around with the main characters shooting any zombies they can in approaching their escape route from almost beginning to end. Honestly i ask you, where's the horror in that? It's Resident Evil for heaven sake!! Study the game first before adapting it into movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Zombie Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil is one of the few films based on a video game that, as a whole, didn't disappoint me. As far as I am concerned, it was a very good video game-based movie, and an entertaining zombie flick. Let me break it down.Story: Alice, a woman with no memory, is brought into a world she doesn't understand when a team of paramilitary commandos take her down into a research lab to aid them. Apparently, the entire lab was wiped out by the area's supercomputer, entitled "Red Queen." Their mission is to wipe out the supercomputer, and determine the cause of why everyone was killed. The trouble is, a deadly virus was released through the facility, and the people that were killed are still walking around. Resident Evil is a film about conspiracy and scientific experiments gone horribly wrong.Direction: Paul W.S. Anderson, in my opinion, is a fine director. He knows exactly what he wants to achieve in each film, and sets out to do it. Anderson knows how to build up the audience, and submerse them into a film. The pacing of the film is terrific, with just the right blend of action and horror. Anderson can work wonders with a budget, and knows how to set up the mood for the entire picture, and keep it that way. Solid! Rock on, Mr. Anderson.Acting: This was the part where the film faltered. While not horrible, the acting isn't top par, either. Milla Jovovich(Alice) played the part of the amnesiac quite well. She was definitely the finest actor in the film. The girl has talent. Michelle Rodriguez(Rain) played her usual tomboy no-nonsense character almost as good as usual, though something was missing in this performance. Eric Mabius(Matt) did a poor job. His performance was just not believable to me. James Purefoy(Spence) is a gifted actor, and I look forward to seeing him more often. As for the rest of the cast, some were good, some were poor, and some just plain sucked.Score: Marilyn Manson and Marco Beltrami composed a fantastic score for the film. Their combined efforts really helped set the tone for the entire movie, and fit in so well with what was going on. I loved it.Violence: Unlike most zombie flicks, this film is not extremely gory or revolting. The zombies shed very little blood, because, as stated in the film, it has already coagulated. Still, there are a few bloody bits. We get countless head shots, gunshot wounds, decayed zombies, some creature violence, and a particularly nasty segment with a laser.Profanity/Sexual Themes: Of course, cussing is found in this film, though I must say, it is almost always justifiable in the flick. As far as sexual themes, there are two very brief sex scenes between Milla Jovovich and James Purefoy, with a brief glimpse of nudity on Milla's end.Substance Abuse: None.Overall: By the end of the movie, I found myself thoroughly entertained. Resident Evil is a good video game adaption, and a pretty entertaining zombie flick with the perfect blend of scares and action. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is completely different from the video game. I liked that. You don't know whats going on and how it is going to end. Although it has everything it needs to be a "resident evil". Ubrella, S.T.A.R.S, t-virus, zombies, lickers....an the story takes place indoors. That gives you the feel of resident evil's 1 mansion. The screenplay is good and comparable to resident evil's 1 game, for example there is a traitor who walk among them just like Wesker! It could be more scary with suspense and one or two riddles like the games.The movie ends perfect for an excellent sequel, raccoon city seems to be dead! Everything is destroyed, blood everywhere and milla jovovitch alone with a shotgun in her hands!</fullReview>

Is there anything wrong with this movie ... well yes The Movie lacks the scare factor we had in the RE games, and i miss that. Milla does a good job with the lead despite the fact her acting skills are limited her sexiness makes up for that! Michelle Rodriguez Is Perfect in this role and she really impressed me . I had my worries when i saw Paul Anderson because i hated Event Horison And i hated AvP ( grrr avp is the worst movie ever made, it brought shame to both franchises ) but to my surprised it was pretty damn good. The licker I'm sad to say looked horrible it did really really bad but everything that was bad about this movie is eventually washed from your mind. Nice ending, Nice Acting, nice zombies = nice movie.I give this movie a **** star rating.And if you enjoyed this review you may enjoy my Resident Evil Apocalypse.Thank You And Goodbye.</fullReview>

HOWEVER, even though Milla is a great actress, and she puts loads of expression into her work, the story need much improvement. Entertaining movie (sort of), a little boring. Some scenes are good visual candy. Milla should be placed in way better movies though. She deserves better directors than Alexander Witt and Paul W.S. Anderson. Believe me, I could... no, a baby could write a better script! The only reason I watched the movie was to see Milla move around that FINE bod! The story sucks, but the acting is actually pretty good. I give it 5/10 because it has some really good ideas, but it just isn't worth watching 3 times. Watch Resident Evil 2. Much better that the first one, but still, lacks originality. Hopefully Resident Evil 3 will turn out to be the best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people may think video games are just simple, stupid things. But some of them have stories. Stories that are......sad to say....better than most movies.Resident evil is a popular game. So why not make a movie out of it? It has a very good, believable story, that doesn't involve much clichés.But this adaption to the game is horrible. The only thing similar to the video game is the name. They make up new characters, make up new story twists, none have anything to do with the video game.Strange thing is, Pual Anderson made this movie a "reference to alice and wonderland."............uh ya, its true, the main characters name is alice, they inject the virus into the "white bunny," the entrance to the hive is like the entrance to wonderland, the red queen(same name as the alice in wonderland red queen) says "off with they're heads!!." Ya whats up with that? how do you make a movie based on a video game, with references to Alice in Wonderland.All in all, this movie woulda been a good movie if it had a different name. This review is just to see how it compares to the video game, and its not a great comparison. This movie isn't great.....</fullReview>

This film is all over the place If a was directing this movie a would of shot everything again or scrapped the project all together.

		<shortDescription>Good survival horror, but could have been better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first in the series of films based on the ps1 games resident evil 1-3,Resident evil is produced following the heavy demand and popularity of the series. Alright, they made a decent attempt to create a horror epic of human survival against the odds of zombies, but as a lot of people who watched the film will have realised that its not the best Zombie film created on the wide screen. There are major glitches in the film that really spoils scenes, and besides glitches its too serious and hard to understand. It took me 14 times watching the film to realise what the plot actually about, and even after that it seemed a bit confusing. Its plots a bit too confusing for a lot of people to understand and the characters seem not to have much idea what the are doing right from the beginning. Apart from the con side of the film, the positive sides of the film involve good well known actors like Millia jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez. Plus, the costumes and effects are brilliant. The plot dose not seem to pull you in deep into the film, but the decent horror epic and quite good action thriller part seems to do a relatively good effort to keep you happy for an hour or two while trying to ignore the few major glitches the film as.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>love the resident evil games and I love the zombie films of Romero. I was really looking forward to a Resident Evil movie rumours had circulated for years about Romero directing and people like Robert Partric playing the key characters. Clearly Andersion wasn't interested in great things like that instead he thought he'd throw "Aliens","2001","George A. Romero's Trilogy" and a bit of "The Matrix" in a blender and see what comes out. I can't believe how bad this movie is first their is not one character from the original game in it instead a group of commandos with ridiculous names like One and Rain. 2nd the monsters, where are they? all their is are zombies(Key to the game of coarse) and a licker(Not even from Resident Evil it's from Resident Evil 2!). No sign of the hunters or the tyrant the two famous creatures from the first game. The platoon of commandos is such a rip off of the Marine corps from "aliens" right down to the tough soldier girl who doesn't take any crap (Played very annoyingly by Michele Rodreguize who also played the exact same character in the "fast and the furious" and "Swat"). There are very few scenes that don't rip-off another film "the Matrix" rip-offs are probably the worst, watching "Alice" jump 6 feet in the air and karate kick a zombie dog in slow motion is absolutely ridiculous. What really rubs salt in the wounds is that George A. Romero(Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead) wrote a script for this and was going to direct. I've read his script it's so much better than this trash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand George A Romero was at one point going to direct this movie. It might have turned out better, but then Land of the Dead was not what it could have been either. Milla Jovovich is a knockout, and some of the zombie attacks are kind of scary, but this movie tries to make up in stylized action what it lacks in plot. Nowhere near as lame as House of the Dead, but perhaps video games should remain games, not movies. Still, Resident Evil had a few great death scenes. I personally liked the zig-zagging laser which sliced people into bits, but I could've done without the CGI dogs. they looked like dobermans dipped in strawberry jam. Too bad Michelle Rodriguez wasn't around for Part 2.</fullReview>

Personally, I do not understand anyone going to see this without at least some knowledge of the game. Having said all that, this movie was almost perfect in relating to the game.This movie had the same locations as the game, the exact same story and all the right characters that made the game so interesting. The action was good from the beginning to end and the only reason I did not vote the movie a 10 on 10 (based on rating previous VG movies) was that it suffered from the stereotypically not so perfect acting. Let's face it, it usually sucks in these types of movies. I know that this review might seem empty but the truth is that there is not much to say. The music fits perfectly, the casting was right for the movie (even if their acting was not perfect) and it stayed true to the original. My only advice is to stay away if you don't know about Resident Evil because that may cause you to have a lesser opinion of a movie that does exactly what it is supposed to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really disappointed with this movie, which had a pretty good reputation and "buzz" upon release. It started out well, but about 30 minutes into it a feeling of cheesiness came creeping over me. There were just too much illogical behavior, sloppy acting and derivative ideas that the original promise fell apart. This continued throughout the movie, so that towards the end I pretty much hated it.Some nice visual touches and an interesting premise, but all the movies it rips off -- Aliens, the Romero zombie trilogy, Outbreak, The Relic, etc -- are better than this, which adds to the exploitation feeling. The lead characters are unsympathetic or incomprehensible, and given no support by the weak actors.This movie follows the exact same pattern and weaknesses as Anderson's "Event Horizon", which however suffered less from its problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Decent Acting, But Let Down HUGELY by Crappy Directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I'm a HUGE fan of the games, and really wanted this to be good, but i was severely by the many faults in this, sourcing mainly from crappy direction. Paul Anderson made so many wrong choices with this, i don't know where to start. The plot was awful, NO mansion, NO s.t.a.r.s, NO hunters, NO plant 42, NO Chris, Jill, Wesker, Barry, Rebecca... you know what, it would be easier to list what there was. Their was the T-virus, a virus developed by the Umbrella Corporation (yes they're'e there) in a lab called 'The Hive' for medical purposes, but it escapes and changes all the workers into zombies. Which brings me onto one of the biggest mistakes, the RED QUEEN. Some child-holographic-computer with a bad accent 'controlling' the Hive (come on, would you really put millions of pounds worth of equipment in the hands of a computer!) The suppose-to-be-eerie little girl sound like something a teenager would think up for some school story he cant be assed to do. I mean, come on! Anyway, the scientist are dead and we meet Alice, who can't remember anything and needs to find out what happened (I know, not very original.) When an Elite team of Army mercenary's crashes through and takes her into the hive. The team -One, Rain, Kaplan, J.D- are very one-dimensional, with no past or feelings, they just burst in, kill, and leave. So trying to destroy the red queen (BTW, a cop enters somewhere here)the team enter. I think i fell asleep for the next half an hour or so, nothing happened apart from some back story about Alices husband and the cops sister. Until your rudely awoken by...wait for it...TECHNO music, very loud techno music and a lot of shooting. By this time, they've killed some lesser characters and they escape (the lack of likeness to the game at this point is really pissing me off.) They're locked in a room, la la la, the escape, one of the team is separated (i really don't care by this point) when they're'e locked in a room, and, guess what.. ALICE'S HUSBAND IS THE BAD GUY!!! So he leaves them to die, he dies, they escape and are on the train (Resident Evil Zero anyone)and are attacked by the giant, red obviously CGI monster, but of course they win (this is the one part of the movie i actually paid attention too, RAIN DIED, she was the only decent-coughHOTcough- character in the lot.) Anyway, Alice and the cop-who-has-nothing-to-do-with-any-of-the-plot are alive. Casting loving looks at each other and so forth, but, wait, he's INFECTED, and gets taken away by Umbrella scientist well she looks on, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Then she wakes up, and the whole cities infected, leaving Alice in next-to-nothing with a shotgun.Now, i have nothing against the actors in this, all of them play the parts as well as can be expected, but they struggle to add depth to the already paper thin parts. Its the director, he obviously is not a fan of the game and has the brain of a thirteen year old on a sugar high. "Lets have BIG guns" he says "and lots of dying and a not naked lead." Shut up moron! and stop making movies before you ruin another franchise!!!3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film opens in the "Hive", the massive underground research complex run by the Evil Umbrella Corporation. A vile containing a deadly virus is broken and it sifts it's way throughout the entire complex, wiping out everyone. This, if in all reality, would not have happened if the Hive had not been entirely connected by the ventilation system. But hey, I guess it goes to show, Military intelligence isn't too high in the movie world either.Casting includes Milla Jovovich as Alice, who was found in the mansion suffering from amnesia, but coincidently remembers how to kick ass, and looks great doing it. Michelle Rodriguez is Rain, by far the toughest and sexiest member of the task force sent into the Hive to check things out. A female commando, who knows how to get it done, go figure. And then there are the other guys in the cast who survive past the 30-minute mark, but they're just the bait for the baddies. Most of the movie consists of the main characters shouting orders, and occasionally getting hoarded by zombies. Oh, and there's a deadly laser beam, which is fun to watch for the most unexpected decapitations I've seen. However, I was impressed with the licker, and the "Cujo" wanna-be zombie dogs.Director Paul Anderson gives the film a nice Holly' gloss finish. And the music, industrial metal which got very annoying, managed to drown out some of the lousy dialogue. This was more of an action movie than the horror flick I expected, it doesn't even stride with George A. Romero's zombie films.The one thing that messed up the movie for me was the unnecessary last scene that sets up the sequel; you already know (if you've played the game) that one was coming. Thanks, but I'll stick to the game?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the cinema having high expectations for the film. I was and still am a huge fan oft he games, especially Resi 2. I was expecting the characteristics of the game to be int he film; gore, suspense, violence, zombies and some nasty monsters. I was in for a huge disappointment...The film starts off OK, with some unknown figure unleashing the T-Virus but then it goes circling out of control. Whereas there are some elements still retained from the game(laboratory is under a mansion outside Racoon City and is owned by Umbrella Corporation it seems that the director got bored of transferring the franchise to film, and instead made the rest up. What follows is a mindless adventure as some elite soldiers go through the underground lab to try and stop the threat of the virus. Of course, there are zombies, but the overall look of then pales in comparison to Dawn Of The Dead (2004). Whereas some of them have gruesome wounds, 80% of them are just very pale and have makeup and fake blood. Along with that, there is no suspense. And what happens is that a zombie(s)will emerge, and along with tons of shooting, rock music appears.The big bad boy boss monster is the licker, who most Resi fans will know and appreciate as a med-i-okre monster, not too challenging. This thing however is made out to be the mother of all creations and is very disappointingly realised with bad CGI. There is no suspense here, a total lack of blood and gore, and only one monster. True fans of the Resi games will be and should be disappointed.That said, their are a few things which raise Resi from the dead (sorry for the pun). The ending climactic train set piece is enjoyable and fast paced, and the laser hallway (imagine, 3 soldiers, trapped in a hallway, with lasers that chop things in half) is pretty neat. There's also a cool appearance by some zombie Doberman dogs, however they're quickly killed off in a silly action scene.This film could have been so much more if the director would have ditched the possibility for "cool stunts" and gone for more style, suspense and horror. Even when the heroes are outnumbered and surrounded by zombies, you never feel as if they are in THAT much danger....when in a situation like that you should be on the edge of your seat.For zombie lovers, there are better choices out there. George A Romero's Dead films, the remake of Dawn of The Dead (04, Saun Of The Dead and even 28 Days Later serve up better chills and scares than this med-i-okre action fest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There isn't much story here. Basically, there's about as much storyline as one might expect in a video game. Imagine that! Unfortunately when moving a game to the big screen, one generally expects the story and characters to get fleshed out a bit. It just doesn't happen here. The general idea is that this is set in the 21st Century where a big evil company is doing naughty things such as DNA manipulation and virus generation in the name of top secret military research. The virus gets loose, and a computer controlling the secret underground society goes haywire. And that's just about enough setup to send in a special ops response team and give them some flesh eating zombies and other mutating creatures to shoot. The movie has a whole "Night of the Living Dead" thing going. If like me, you are a Fan of Shoot-em-ups, you will just love this movie. If not, well stay well clear!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it was AWESOME! Its kinda one of those movies where you either have to hate it or love it. I loved it. Michelle Rodriguez (Rain Ocampo) was awesome. Milla Jovovich (Alice) I think really did a good job...they even did almost all of there stunts! Some of the Goofs posted, you wouldn't know about unless you watched the commentary (I did of course). A lot of the things are really unnoticeable. The handwriting continuity was pretty bad though but I didn't realize it until the second time I watched the movie. I didn't watch the commentary until the 3rd time I rented it so I didn't know about the floor flexing in the elevator scene until I watched the commentary...I really liked how the director didn't shove the zombies in your face until like half-way through the movie. One of the reasons I really liked the movie was BECAUSE they didn't find out how to kill the undead until the Red-Queen chamber scene. I didn't enjoy the second one (Resident Evil: Apocalypse) BECAUSE they already knew how to kill them and it wasn't as much of the learning curve as in the first one. I really enjoyed this movie and I plan to get it for X-mas... Yes I loved it that much!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" didn't exactly received raving reviews when it got released. It however is an enjoyable action flick with some horror elements in it, that is worth seeing.Looks like only people really disappointed with this movie were and are the fans of the video games this movie is based on. The movie has very little to do with the video games but should that automatically mean that the movie is a bad one? I don't think that's exactly fair assumption. You should just take this movie for what it is; An action/horror movie that happens to be loosely BASED on a video game. As a movie it really isn't bad. It might not be the best or most original movie, it still is an enjoyable action flick that is perfectly watchable.Still its a movie with flaws. Biggest flaw is the continuity. Not everything that happens in the movie makes logically sense. for instance in the beginning of the movie all of the characters are suddenly split up, without any explanation why and how this happened and of course every character gets a bad encounter during their split up. There are several tiny things like this in the movie that don't make logical sense from a story point of view and the continuity and editing are weak and flawed at times. All little hints that director Paul W.S. Anderson isn't the greatest director in the business.The movie also isn't exactly successful as an horror. Most of the scare moments in the movie fail and are too much and too often the same. The action is good, although predictable. Nothing in the movie happens as a real surprise and because of that it also never really becomes tense or truly exciting. It's really one of those "Aliens"-wannabe movies. It's too bad but it doesn't automatically mean that this movie is a bad one. It's still a movie made with lots of style and profession and even though it isn't the most original movie it still is a successful one, from a movie technical point of view.It's obvious that Milla Jovovich was just cast because of her looks but she does a fair enough job in this movie. Michelle Rodriguez is a good action movie star and Colin Salmon is a great actor but his role is too limited. The movie could had really used his acting abilities and his character more. The wonderful Jason Isaacs also has a uncredited cameo toward the ending of the movie and also as narrator.A movie worth seeing at least once. You might end up liking it better than expected, as with me was the case.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly let me say that I have not played the game R Evil. However I do know the story after countless hours watching my boyfriend play. As I am not a great fan of zombie movies I didn't expect to get much from this film. However to my surprise I really liked it.Yes the zombies still walk round at a snails pace and have the brain of goldfish, but the fact that crew are confined underground means that they simply can't just run away. Which is what I have always thought when I have watched other zombie films. To add to this you have the whole world off genetic engineering thrown in. So instead of just blood thirsty zombie's you also have the added bonus of some very nasty man made creature's.Therefore overall I would say that providing you are not expecting a carbon copy of the computer game, Resident Evil is an good choice if you enjoy the thrill of the creepy horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Paul WS Anderson said that this movie happens between the first game and the second game...OK, with that in mind, we can first thing the following. This movie, like every video game saved game, is very subjective. Is a one man vision, so this is a vision that few people will join, or few people will understand. The ones who played the video game will miss the fear of the environment into that creepy and scary house, changed for the underground laboratory, that is not very scary. There is no Tyrant, but we have a nice mutating licker that dies in a super silly way, like one of the Fallas in the typical Spanish celebration. Well, let's just say that Resident Evil is a very subjective adaptation of that famous cult-indie video game, that changes the creepy house for the weird wacky scientist laboratory. At least we have the Dobermans, Milla Jovovich kicking asses (and heads) and the PWS Anderson Direction. What do we have in the other hand? Bad special effects, too much editing and a Michelle Rodriguez that is more a guy than a woman. Now I understand why she did SWAT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I was a little ticked that Chris (Redfield) was not in this movie, seeing as he was my favorite character in the R.E. universe, but Milla does a great job. I was in the military for 12 years and "One" reminded me of so many team leaders, he was outstanding. Me and some of the other guys always complained why so many zombie flicks never had anybody well equipped for battling those gruesome beasties, well we finally got it and it was friggin great. I thought the reactions of the characters was on point, and for once, and this was the best part, they were actually thinking on how to get out, instead of just panicking and laying down to die. I have no problem with the movie being different from the game, I really didn't want to know what was going to happen next, and if they had just followed the game, well, how dull that would have been? All in all, this movie makes you want to lock n load your M4 and go zombie hunting. Now my only problem, the computer mis-identified weapons, sorry, i was an armorer and notice things like that, and their ammunition load was totally inadequate for any situation when you are operating with no hope of support. Besides that, loved the action and suspense, and totally loved Milla! Keep your powder dry guys! Good hunting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect much relation to the video games/books in the movie but it would've helped even if they added a small bit of it. About the only relationship this movie has to the games/books is the zombies. I think I would've appreciated it more if they put in even one character with a relation to the games/books.The effects were interesting but used in a totally unappreciative attitude and the moves that the 'ultimate warrior' makes are noticeably computer animated; I would've liked some back story on the reason why she was so 'warrior' like besides the fact she just woke up. I found the attire on the main character was quite moronic as well. Between the red dress and the white clothes, I'd have chose the white clothes - maybe they should stuff her bra next time.The next installment, I have yet to see, but I might just wait until its down on the lower priced rack before picking it up. This movie has effected my influence on Resident Evil movies greatly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil...Coulda been Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that killed me the most about this movie was how it strayed so far away from the foundation. It stroke no resemblance to the game at all, except they used Umbrella, Raccoon City, and the T-Virus. Nothing else. If this movie could ever be remade, it would be a hell of a lot better if it was about the game, because that is what brought the Resident Evil franchise so much fame. But anyways, given that the movie wasn't like the game, it was still a pretty solid action movie. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez made pretty well with what they had to work with. However, some things still felt unrealistic and very campy. I mean, I don't mind seeing some girl kick the crap out of mutant dogs, but could that really happen? Also, could a group of elite soldiers become zombie food that easily? I mean come on, use your head. If a zombie is WALKING towards you, are you gonna sit back and let it bite you? It feels that it was rushed too much through production, but people really don't have high expectations for games-turned movies (Street Fighter...Good lord). But honestly, this movie would definitely be worth a rental, if anything at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Game for 'Resident Evil'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exactly what can I say about "Resident Evil?" Well, first of all it's based on a popular video game series, so expect a lot of the action to be the same kind of action you would find in a cartoon. Second, be prepared for an incoherent plot (which is kind of dumb). Finally, get ready for lots of gore.So, why five out of ten stars? It's a lot of fun to watch. Even though it's totally unbelievable, it's somewhat involving (despite, like noted above, the dumb, incoherent plot). The characters are fun to watch, especially Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez, who have to be the toughest heroines in movie history.The special effects are very good, as is the enthusiastic direction by Paul W.S. Anderson (who also wrote the script based on his favorite video game). Also, the movie has a fun opening sequence.In brief, the movie is about a super computer in a top secret, underground research facility called 'The Hive' which goes awry, killing everyone down there. However, a manufactured virus brings them (and a few dogs) back from the dead, resulting in flesh-eating zombies.A lot of people might frown when they learn the plot and, eventually, see the movie, thinking it's something too unbelievable. Then again, what do they expect from a movie based on a video game?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish But Derivative Zombie Flick Based On Computer Game Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A woman suffering from amnesia is taken into a secret underground complex where a sinister corporation has been carrying out biological weapons research. Unfortunately, a virus has been released, causing the staff to turn into zombies and the super-computer in charge to use all of its defence systems to contain the outbreak. Our heroine must escape whilst trying to piece together who she is and why she is there.Based on the popular series of zombie shoot-'em-up videogames by Capcom, this is a good-looking but ultimately hollow horror movie. It does a good job of creating the settings and atmosphere of the games, but it all too often wanders into noisy MTV-style visuals which dissipate the tension and make the zombie attack sequences confusing rather than scary and suspenseful. Worst of all, the script and the performances are lacklustre - by the time we find out who these people are we don't really care much about them. There are some good points though - nice visual effects by Richard Yuricich, great production design by Richard Bridgland, and having a little girl voice the Red Queen super-computer is an excellent touch. This film has an odd resemblance to John Carpenter's superior Ghosts Of Mars - zombies, amnesia, an airborne virus, thrash metal music and a finale set on a train - but unlike that movie it doesn't give its characters enough time to develop, and it borrows far too much from better pictures, particularly Aliens and Dawn Of The Dead. An interesting but unsatisfying film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies and mutants and monsters, oh my!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a deadly virus escapes from a lab, a secret underground facility becomes a living hell as the staff is turned into undead zombies. To make matters worse, there are mutant creatures on the loose. Alice, a security operative for the subterranean lab, with the aid of a group of soldiers, enter the lab to see what happened?only to discover escape seems impossible. This film is understandably hated by many people for various reasons, some of which I agree with and some of which I don't. The biggest problem with the film is writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson. He clearly is capable of making a good and enjoyable film, which he proved with 1997's underrated Event Horizon. However, his direction here is unfortunately MTV-style in nature?that is, there are lots of slow-motion shots during the action sequences and even a bullet-time shot or two. I do, however, really like the general atmosphere he gives the film?the scene near the beginning of the film with Alice walking through the giant mansion is decidedly atmospheric and creepy. Unfortunately, the actors are all wooden, and most of the characters are easily recognizable as creature/zombie fodder from the second they enter the screen. While I really liked the main theme music for the film, the rock music employed for the action scenes is terrible and obnoxious as hell. While there are a couple of good bloody bits here and there, most of the gore is computer-generated and looks absolutely awful. On the topic of bad CG, the first stage of "The Licker", one of the mutant creatures, looks HORENDOUS!!! I'm talking sci-fi-channel-original-movie level CG. It must be seen to be believed! Fans of old-school horror will be happy to know that once the licker eats it's first victim it mutates into a predominantly animatronic creature, which looked great. I also really liked the ending (though, granted, it rips off John Carpenter's underrated 1995 flick In the Mouth of Madness pretty badly).In conclusion, Resident Evil may be flawed and relatively brainless at times, but it's entertaining and way, way better than its terrible sequel. 4/10.</fullReview>

For anyone who hasn't played the video game, this movie is an excellent stand-alone horror sci-fi flick that is sure to become a classic and that does a good job of keeping your eyes glued to the screen and your heart thumping while you wonder what the poor characters will have to face next.I would give it a 10 in the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this when it first was up on the big screen, and then while I thought it was pretty cool I kinda forgot about it. Then a few days ago I saw it on TV, and I have to say, it's definitely better than I remember it now.It starts out in a slightly surreal style as we get to follow the employees of the Umbrella Corp., and the events leading to the disaster in the underground laboratory. Then in the same style we get to follow an agent waking up and how she meet the SWAT-like squad she's to work together with to set things straight again.The overall feeling of the movie is hard to describe but I like it. No nonsense, just straight forward action. No second wasted. I am sure there were clichés in this film but certainly not many and apparently they didn't bother me anyway. Usually when you watch a B action you can get bored simply because it's like every other B action. Not so with Resident Evil, which was not B in my opinion.Visually, it's also great. At times it was almost a dream-like feeling, from the intro laboratory scenes to the scenes from Alice's home; and most that happened thereafter.As for storytelling, it told us what we needed to know, nothing more. If there's anything from the introduction scenes that leaves us wondering what in the world happened, who did it and why, we will get the answers as the story moves on.Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriquez both make their parts really well in my opinion. I have not seen Milla in many other movies but what I've seen so far, I definitely like. Michelle was entirely new to me as far as I know, but I liked her performance.My complaint could possibly be that some devices in the laboratory seemed a bit of a stretch, especially one particular security defense mechanism that they encountered early on.All in all, a good action that is somewhat unusual in its style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this zombie horror film that sets the scene for the hit Resident Evil computer game series. The sinister Umbrella Corporation runs a vast underground genetic research facility, known as The Hive, in which a viral outbreak occurs. A state of the art supercomputer, called the Red Queen, monitors the complex and responds by killing all within. The few survivors, including soldier with a conscience, Alice (Jovovich), suffer from memory loss as a result of the Queens gas attack. An Umbrella Commando team, who aims to shut down the computer and find out what has happened, soon joins them.From the opening scenes the tension is set on high as the all seeing, godlike Queen systematically eliminates the employees. The gory details are often left to the imagination, which is often far worse, particularly the decapitation scene.Fans of the game will know that the T-Virus will bring these people back from the dead as blood crazed zombies. Anderson keeps us waiting on the edge of our seats for that moment to finally happen. In the mean time he freaks us out with The Queen, who is spookily given the voice, and holographic image, of an English eight-year old girl. This works wonderfully, especially when she states "I have been a very, very bad girl".Jovovich is superb and wears a gorgeous red dress and mini skirt contraption, along with big black boots that show off her stunning legs that seem to lead all the way to the Promised Land. She is also kept soaking wet for much of the film.The suspense is top notch, with inventive camera angles and direction that will have you transfixed to the screen before hitting you with jump in your seat shocks. Marilyn Mansons soundtrack is ideally suited and adds to the creepy atmosphere.Unfortunately there are too many minor characters, all of which are underdeveloped and two-dimensional. This is made worse by the amount of relative unknowns, Rodriquez being the only other recognisable actress, and she delivers a monotonous performance that is far from the Vasquez like character that she is clearly based on. The dialogue and script are terrible, and some of the characters lumber along with less life than the soulless zombies that hunt them. The big bad monster is a horrific CGI creation that, thankfully, has a very brief role. This film suffers from the 15 certificate, and comes across as a little child-like. I would have liked a little more stamping on zombie head gore and greater shocks, perhaps even some genuine fear. However, it is aimed partly at the younger game playing audience and the lower certificate is understandable. The downbeat ending works well though, and will have you reaching for your control pad to play out the rest of the story.Ultimately this is a simple action/horror film that borrows heavily from films such as Aliens. There are some occasional great scenes and it is certainly worth switching off you brain and getting the beers and munchies in for some juvenile Friday night entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conventional zombie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There isn't much to distinguish Resident Evil from any other zombie films; the same concept of how to kill the zombies or how the people became zombies. The concept of a group of survivors being killed off is also very conventional. The only fairly original part was the mutating hunter that at the start looked like a giant vicious rabbit (I'm not sure if that was a deliberate reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail). The only good thing that can be said about this film was that Milla Jovovich was quite convincing as an amnesiac.Overall it is just like almost every other zombie film ever made although it is watchable at times.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very much of a good adaption of the game, but impressive and good to see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well after the waiting, we finally get a Resident Evil movie at last, but not in the way we expected it to be. Sure, normally it would not be directly based on the games, so they would put something else instead to make it worthwhile to see. But what we get is something a little disappointing. It seems to tell a bit of a sensationalized story instead of the on in the game, and it seems to lack a bit of the horror and fun from the games, at least it still has the T-virus, I'm glad and thankful for that. And there are some STARS in it, and zombies, and dog zombies, and lickers, but it lacks the feel, it doesn't seem all that exciting, more of a generic zombie movie, doesn't even surpass the Dead trilogy. In other word it just doesn't have the spirit of the games. But despite all that, it's good to see it isn't like the other failed movies from video games, like Street Fighter, or Super Mario Bros, or Double Dragon, yuck! It had creepy monsters and a shocking ending, so they are forgiven. But still, I wish it was Romero, instead of Anderson, I believe it would have captured the feel of the games. &gt;&gt;&gt; 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>to think of this film as being a horror movie is a gross miscarriage of justice. this is more an action-adventure movie than anything and has nothing to with horror at all. on top of it, this isn't related in any way to the excellent video game on which this movie is based on, other than the t-virus and the undead featured in the game.Resident evil blatantly rips off everything from Cube to Warning Sign to even Event Horizon and Alice in Wonderland.speaking of which, the movie also references Stanley Kubrick's 2001: the homicidal computer The Red Queen is a clear take on HAL.i tried to feel scared throughout the movie, but there was nothing to make me feel scared.the zombies were rather pitiful, resembling disease-ridden victims. the licker was really, really tacky. the director should have substituted the licker for maybe the Tyrant from the first game or the Leech Queen in Code:Veronica.despite its shortcomings, RE is a decent action movie that demands repeated viewing.i got the DVD for Christmas, and i enjoyed watching the movie much to my surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>almost just like comic book movies. Everyone has their own interpretation of what they think the movie should be like and what they really like about the games differs too. The things I like about this movie is Milla, zombies, and guns. The things I don't like about this movie is the story could have been better. The screenplay could have been better. And especially the Lickers, they should have been better. I'm really not really a big Licker fan, I would have rather have seen Hunters instead. Either way, the lickers were a little weak, but they definitely made an effort to improve the Lickers in the sequel. I really don't like zombie dogs. You mean a zombie man cannot run, but a dog can? Makes no sense. I understand this movie was also made to set the stage for other future movies and sometimes I hate that. I love for each movie to tell its own story without having to worry about leaving something for later. The scene with the laser security system was cool, reminded me of the cool scene in Ghost Ship. This movie is okay to watch from time to time, but its really something that I wont watch more than once every few months. I love zombie movies but I have others that are better than this. I'm only half way through the second RE, but once I am done, I will post my feelings on this too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many ways can a movie rip off other movies.1. One ''bullet time'' scene which served no purpose - stolen from The Matrix.2. Wall walking slo-mo fight scene again stolen from The Matrix3. Supercomputer that controls a facility gone homicidal - stolen from 2001: a space odyssey4. Elite military team battling monsters with "macho" hispanic woman on the team - stolen from Aliens.I won't accuse this movie of ripping off George Romero because a genre is a genre and I have no problem if someone wants to make a zombie movie.The zombies seemed a little too lethargic, even for zombies. The scene where a soldier was trapped on some facility pipes just above some hungry dead folks - it seemed that the zombies were going a little too slow tring to get the guy, watch the scene and tell me if you weren't wondering why the zombies didn't just crawl right up there and get him. I guess they were giving him time to say his lines?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh the truth is that I could watch this movie, and watch it for hours. In my opinion it is the best movie adaptation of a video game that has been made so far. I like all of Paul Anderson's movies (Event Horizon was great!) but Resident Evil is his best one. The scene with cutting lasers was so amazing that I had to go to the cinema twice to see it. Acting was great as well. I liked Michelle Rodriguez as Rain most. The sequel however, was not so good. It wasn't bad but lost the climate of the first part. For me it was not a horror but rather a silly action movie. I hope that Paul Anderson will direct the third part.</fullReview>

Anyone who likes Sci-Fi thrillers that at the end make you want to stop crime the 'kick ass' way, this is a movie for you.A secret corporation called the Umbrella Corporation are manufactured underground. They constructed a virus known as the T Virus that makes the dead... undead. Also, they have an anecdote that brings them back to live. This movie was suppose to be based off of the Hit Game Series, but many of the welcomed characters were mistaken. None of the original characters were in the film, nor did the film resemble much of the game.Even though it wasn't completely based off the game, that doesn't make it a bad movie. It was still enjoyable, and worth watching (worth owning if you're into this type of genre).8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Glossy horror based on the best-selling video games. A group of commandos have to infiltrate an underground base - unfortunately it's defended by a ruthless artificial intelligence and is full of hungry zombiesFive years after it was first mooted, the movie adaptation of Capcom's bestselling video game arrives, helmed by Paul Anderson, the Briton responsible for hit video game movie Mortal Kombat and costly flop Soldier.Thankfully, Anderson and the producers were fans of the game (and its sequels), and were adamant that that its distinctive, chilling tone be transferred to film. Unfortunately, the filmmakers also managed to incorporate some rubbish of their own. Where the game was scary because of the player's depth of involvement, the film fails to fully engage due to poor characterisation and a pretty lame story. Eschewing literally using the plot of the first 'Resident Evil' game, the film maintains the basic premise of an isolated mansion and a feisty heroine (Andseron calls the film "the explanatory prequel"). Alice (Jovovich) awakes in the shower with amnesia. While wandering around in the empty mansion she's joined by "cop" Matt (Mabius) before the sudden SAS-style arrival of a group of commandos, lead by One (Salmon), then later by Rain (Rodriguez) when he gets splatted. In some leaden exposition, One walks and talks Alice - and us - through the set-up. The mansion is a cover for a secret lab - the Hive - belonging to the ubiquitous Umbrella Corporation. A virus has been released in the Hive, killing all the staff. The lab has been sealed by the Red Queen, a "state of the art artificial intelligence" (who sounds like a schoolgirl reading out an essay in class). The commandos must enter the lab - taking Alice, Matt and a further amnesiac, Spence (Purefroy), with them - and retrieve the fruits of the research. These fruits turn out to be highly dubious bio-weapons, in the form of not just the zombie-creating 'T-virus', but also in the form of further monstrosities (such as 'the Licker').Resident Evil just about works. The characterisation and scripting seem sadly cursory, and devices such as giving characters amnesia are tired, but the overall dynamic is effective. The few stabs at story depth are cackhanded - Umbrella is made the quintessence of pervasive, all-powerful corporations; Matt has an earnest little speech about its evils ("Companies like Umbrella think they're above the law, but they're not."). However, there's some good horror here - zombies are always fun, but Anderson puts some effort into making them a worrying presence rather than simply a justification for gore. The look of the film relates nicely to the games too. While it's frequently glossy, it also gets moodier in places, hinting at the grim, lonely atmospherics of the games. The film's biggest coup comes at the end. It's giving nothing away to say the heroine makes it, but her fate superbly sets the story up for a sequel. George A Romero fans should also look out for a explicit nod to Day Of The Dead in the closing seconds. Verdict As a piece of quality cinema, Resident Evil just doesn't qualify. But as a slickly-produced piece of trash - and, more importantly, as an adaptation of a video game - it holds its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a die hard fan of Resident Evil video games. The first Resident Evil for Playstation is a grand daddy of all the survival horror games. It was a scary game just like every sequel. I was happy when i heard there's going to be a movie based on the game. And as it turns out, it's a pretty good movie.Many fans of the game complain about the plot. They don't like the fact that it isn't based on any of the games scenarios in 100%. We don't see any familiar characters. No Jill, no Leon, no Claire and no Chris. But i think it's a good thing. It just wouldn't be fun. Everyone would know what is going to happen and how is it going to end. We still have all the most important elements taken from the game. We have the Umbrella Corporation, we have the zombies and a 'licker', people trapped in the building fighting for survival and of course there's the T-Virus.Other people complain that the movie isn't scary enough. And i understand those people. I mean, it was obvious that a movie based on a survival horror game, has to be a horror movie. But it isn't. It's a Sci-Fi Thriller. Maybe that's why I don't hate it. Before i went to the theatre and saw it, i was told what to expect. A thriller - not a horror movie. I admit that this is a little bit of disappointment, because the movie had a full potential to be a solid horror movie, but it's still good as a thriller.So if you haven't seen it yet, and if you're planning to watch it, don't expect to see a horror movie. You're gonna see a sci-fi thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, to say the most</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This a review done by someone who has never played the games. I saw this movie for the first time a few days ago and I thought it was cool. It was a good action film. Of course, I was expecting action instead of scares so it probably appealed to me more than others. This is a movie about a corporation that makes household products, and, secretly, biochemical weapons or something like that. It focused on an underground facility that was inhabited by workers of the Umbrella Corperation. A virus that they were experimenting on escapes and spreads amongst the workers, turning them into zombies. Then, Alice wakes up in the shower and is soon taken by men in suits to the underground place, hoping to shut down the computer that operates it. Little do they know that mindless zombies among other things will soon be hunting them down.This was a generally cheesy movie, but what did you expect? Most of the corny lines were delivered by Michelle Rodriguez or however you spell her name's character. It had an ending that I thought was somewhat cool. It was a lot like most of the other zombie flicks I've seen. I'll wait until the sequel is on video before I see it. Anyway, my final rating is 6/10. (Dialogue, poor acting, and poor writing.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil turned out a bit better than expected. It's a quite good action/SF/thriller with execellent shooting and stunning effects. From what I had read the plot would be a bit thin, and true enough the simplicity of it, is the weakest point of the movie. That said, I still think the acting is quite good all around, especially considering the story they had to work with. The characters simply come over as believable. It's like everybody believe in the universe that is the essence of the story, which makes it real, even if is not deep personality that is explored here. The above together with some really good graphics and picture effects makes it a movie worth seeing. As for the thriller part some of the scenes and effects were quite shocking - in a good sense. The pace is fast like Aliens (2) so that your attention is kept on the screen, even if not up to overall level of that movie. I gave it a 7.</fullReview>

In the scene where everyone is getting killed in the tunnel when the last man (the coloured guy) is about to get killed the laser becomes a giant cris-crossed wall that hits the man. In a scene seconds later it shows the rest of the peoples bodies lay there. My question is when the laser becomes the wall wouldn't there bodies get cut up as well. Also what happens to the bodies when Alice returns later. That never gets explained. Please confirm or tell me if I am wrong cheers!Dandeman03</fullReview>

Ok it's not the BEST horror film to be made, and it does have it's flaws. The worst thing about this film is that it nicks a bit from Cube, anyone who has seen both films will know straight away which part, also the it seems to have nicked a bit from 28 days later.One flaw that does bother me (possible spoilers) why does it take so long for Rain to become infected with the virus, when another member of her team becomes infected as soon as he get bitten. Another one is Alice when shes faced with the infected dogs, surely no one is that accurate with a gun, even if they are good shots.Overall once I started watching I couldn't turn it off, (That doesn't normally happen with me). Milla Jovovich is better then I thought, I have to admit I thought she was such a very pretty face who couldn't act (how wrong I was), hopefully the 2nd one will be much better then the1st because there is a lot of potential here.</fullReview>

But somehow, I enjoyed it. It's not going to go into my top ten list, or even my top 100, but it is an enjoyable way to waste an evening. The special effects were terrible and the action scenes cliched and badly done but it all adds to the appeal of the film. The game itself is very tongue-in-cheek and the movie reflects this, although not quite as much.

		<fullReview>Reading the summary most of the people probably thing I am all set to bash Resident Evil. Actually I'm taking just the opposite stand because I really loved this movie. Lets just say love doesn't even come close to define my feelings for this movie. Okay, I'll admit, this movie isn't Oscar material except maybe the special effects, but its really a good movie if you happen to like the RE series. Even if you haven't played the games you might just learn to love it.Human struggle for existence against all odds always makes a good tale. But I should say I'm not one for zombie movies. Somehow I find them meaningless. Maybe because playing the games beforehand or the fact that I willed myself to like this movie ever since I heard it was coming, I really liked this one. Another reason for me liking this movie is ? Michelle Rodriguez. There can never be a reason not to like a Michelle Rodriguez movie for me. The art direction was awesome. The concept of the Hive was super cool. The dogs were scary. Scarier than the zombies. The laser scene was trend setting. What I really liked was the Red Queen, a holographic representation of a super-computer modeled after the head programmer's daughter. To hear the innocent voice of a little girl saying- `You are all going to die down here' - is really chilling. That's Red Queen for you. I didn't know anything about the movie before it was released. I just saw its trailer once in UK Top Ten. So, I didn't what really to expect. I was hoping to see all of Jill, Claire, Leon and Chris. I was real disappointed not to see any of the video game characters. To tell the truth that killed me but things like that happen. It seems like the movie is going to follow a storyline slightly different from the game series starting with how the T-Virus spread. In the games the T-Virus was spread by James Marcus (as in Resident Evil: Zero). The movie stand is different. I guess the games and movie storylines will deviate from each other a bit.Glitches? Milla Jovovich is definitely one of the most good looking women in the world. In fact she's stunningly breathtaking. But somehow I didn't see her as Alice. She looks too precious. It might be because of the scene she was introduced in. Anyone who knows Jill, Claire or Rebecca know that they are really tough women. Maybe Milla J. looked fragile to me because she was next to Michelle Rodriguez. And boy! is she tough.I hope I get to see the game characters in some future RE movie (haven't checked RE:A till yet). So gotta go. What am I doing next? Well, to quote Rain, `when I get outta here think I'm gonna get laid!!'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The logic of a "zombie movie" is not to have a good plot, but to have lot of gore. Like a porno : who cares the script since we watch sex ? But, if we have no sex and no interesting plot, it's really boring.The plot : A virus transforms deads in zombies. The computer says "These zombies must eat !" . But it doesn't say why they must eat human flesh. And zombies can't eat each other, they need to eat the flesh of the living. So our heroes must fight against them. Ho, I forgot : a monster chases them and he mutates when he eats "fresh DNA" (lol). So, as you see, a very intelligent science plot. (Sorry not to have mentioned "SPOILERS", you'll miss the pleasure to discover this beautiful and unpredictable story).Let's see now the fun gore : as the movie begins, when the first gore scene is missed (the girl in the elevator), I knew this puritan style will spoil the only good thing of this movie. And I was right ! How many "let's look elsewhere" to avoid a bad scene. "A zombie must be shot in the head" ? Yeah... but in Romero's movies, the head explodes, in this one, there is just a little red spot on the front. It's ridiculous !Apparently, the director wanted to make an horror movie for the little kids.So, Okay, if you are a little kid, run to watch this movie ! Otherwise, return to watch "Dawn of the dead" which knows what gore means.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident EvilA deadly virus escapes in a top secret research facility based underground, a team of top trained soldiers/agents are send to find out what happened down there.In the latter years it has become very popular to make movies out of popular computer games, and they often fail for some reason, i think maybe it's because there is a big difference from experiencing the story from computer games through movies, movies tells you a story, in games you act yourself as the investigator. However, this movie has a very interesting and much of the way pretty original and unpredictable storyline, even though it is probably stolen from the game, i never played the game, so i can not tell.In the start i found the movie very confusing i must admit, not much made sense, but as the movie discovers most of the question marks are explained, although i am still wondering about a few things, but they are not so much related to the question marks, they are most related to the realism of the story. But i guess this is okay for a fantasy movie. Without giving too much spoilers one of the things i don't understand is why a team of soldiers are send into a research facility without wearing any kind of protection, couldn't it be possible there would be something in the air? Also if the AI protecting the Hive is still online, why can't they reach it that way and find the answers that way? Rather than sending a team down to discover the secret. However, if you look away from all these small flaws, the movie is actually very entertaining and driven, it is a very interesting story, though it has a lot more potential than used, but using the full potential might also remove much of the action. But maybe i am just one that prefers a deep storyline, especially about something that i find as interesting as this, i'd like a deeper look on the whole idea.But there is never any doubt, this movie wants the action part in focus, and that it does well, this is far from a horror movie, and it's not spooky or scary at all, it's a driven action movie with a lot effects, but that is entertaining enough, just don't go into the movie expecting pure horror.Paul Anderson has been put in charge of Alien Vs. Predator too, and if he can produce an interesting action movie like this one, then i am looking very much forward to it, because he has done an okay job to combine the storyline with the amount of action that is expected from his side, my personal preferences hopes for a deeper storyline in Resident Evil: Nemesis though.The acting is okay, there are many main characters, and we never learn much about either of them, only 3 persons we get background information on. Generally because they each have their own reasons to be there, none of them really shines through though, except one. I think Milla Jovovich has proven to the world now that she has quite some talent, which is good, this movie is very action driven and doesn't put her acting much in focus, but i'm looking forward to seeing her in the future, because i think she has her moments in this movie.To sum it all up a bit i found this movie rather good, it has some flaws which puts it down a little, but generally it's a good driven action movie that is worth watching if you're into this kind of movies. It's not a horror movie, so don't expect that, expect a solid action movie wrapped within an interesting storyline and you will be happy.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I made the mistake of reading's Anderson script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul SW Anderson's script for resident Evil was wonderful and I rushed out to rent the movie. I was heart broken when certain things didn't make it into the final film.Overall good -- though not as gory or suspenseful as I thought it should be, and I am not a gory and action kind-of-guy either. Killing the Red Queen so early and not having the scene where she helps them find the secret passageway to safety while the beast is on their tails wasn't wise. I missed the White Queen also. And the many references in the script regarding the Alice in Wonderland were reduced to a white rabbit and the Red Queen herself. She didn't even look in the garden to see the characters from the story (i.e. Mad Hatter etc.) And there was no chess board microchip.The film did seem disjointed -- probably because the Producers chopped up his film. I gather he didn't have final cut and it shows. Spence and Alice also seemed to have had scenes removed. And JD and Rain's roles were reversed from the original script.I don't want to sound down -- I really liked the script, and the film and I will be looking for the game as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't particularly impressed. It was O.K.- I love Resident Evil anyway, but I wished the movie had been better.The first part of the movie, Alice didn't seem to be acting. Except for her first line, Rain was my favorite character just because I think she's related to one of my friends- and acts exactly like her...Er, anyway... with the laser scene I was highly confused by the lack of 1) Science 2) Enormous pools of blood. There was no mention of the S.T.A.R.S (except at the very end there was the S.T.A.R.S. emblem on the hood of that one car).The movie would have been better off with more classical-type music rather than rock. Let's face it, pianos are ALWAYS creepier than guitars. I mean, in the game, you would always get freaked out when you walked into a room and the piano was joined by a screeching violin- and then all you could see was a shadow moving towards you... They needed a lot more of that in the movie. I'm not saying the rock wasn't cool- but they should have saved that exclusively for the soundtrack if they HAD to have it at all.I really enjoyed the last parts of the movie- fight with the licker (probably needed more blood, but whatever), then Matt getting taken away- and you know in the second movie he's gonna be the Nemesis *happiness*. I really want to see the whole city of Raccoon story. It needs to be more closely based on the events in the 2nd game. That would make me so happy I would probably cry... (but you know that won't happen because they're against me.)My friends and I agreed that if we had enough money/resources, we could make a MUCH better Resident Evil movie. But since we don't, we'll just go see the next movie this fall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does not have the quality or the horror of the games.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil is a slick and decent looking movie but it lacks a lot in terms of scares and horror to make it worthy of the video games that spawn it. Milla Jovovich and the cast do well with what is giving, and the movie itself is a good late night movie to watch but it should have been a balls to the wall horror feast that the games were. Of course like all adaptations of novels and games, it does not resemble its forefather in anyway, and it does not retain the sense of terror that the game had in spades. The zombies don't look scary at all, and the hunter looks a fake as a plastic chew toy. Some scenes are good, and the special effects in some of them fit like a glove but overall the movie is nothing more than a decent scary movie that should have been a lot more than it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie, and I'm not afraid to admit it.First off a little notice: I don't know the games.The story, like many before will undoubtably have said was pretty much crap, I'm not going to defend it... Doesn't really matter, the story was irrelevant anyway. It's supposed to be a horror-flick, does anybody remember Nightmare, Halloween or Friday, if you can find a story in any of those 'classics' let me know.What this movie was is a lust for the eye. It looked so incredibly slick. The set decorating, the make-up, the costumes, the whole visual department did such an incredible job, that even though, the story had no content what so ever, the movie was so easy on the eye, that I didn't want to turn it off, because of this.A lot of people could learn from this. Sure, a story is important, but add a unique visual style, and you have a double jackpot.That's my 5 cents.</fullReview>

Wow, this movie is excellent in terms of is effect. i love the part where they are split apart form the laser. I was unexpected that the laser would turn out to be in the net form. Hence it killed everyone down there instead of those usual movie which will at least left one survivor.This movie was very exciting. It gives us a feeling of horror too. This is especially applied to the scene in which the dogs appeared, same to the zombies. The design of the zombies characters and appearance had reached a high standard. I just love the way they bite peoples' flesh away. However, the story plot were confusing and had pulled down the standard of this movie.</fullReview>

I was not impressed with the SFX or the characters - very stereotypical. R.E. was a monotonous, predictable waste of time and it is doubtful if I will ever watch it again. The only good thing about the movie was the end. So in closing I would simply like to say this...If Paul Anderson SCREWS UP the Aliens versus Predator movie as much as this one, he doesn't deserve a director's job!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never played the resident evil games, so i am not a fan of the whole franchise, and i can't tell you whether or not the movie is faithful to it. I viewed this movie with low expectations considering it was a) based on a video game and b) has zombies in it, two things which tend to make a movie suck. But, i'm happy to say, this movie was well done. It had style to burn and kept my attention the whole way through, ending with a nihilistic kind of scene that I very much liked. The script is pretty much a workhorse - it gets you through the movie without being either exceptional or extremely bad. The actors all looked appropriately terrified at the right times, so that was good. You can tell though, that they put some work and thought into this movie to make it entertaining and halfway logical, for a zombie movie. If you go into RE expecting some zombies, good looking actors, lots of guns, and action - then it doesn't disappoint. The special effects were decent - at least i have no complaint. Some of the set designs were very nice, and there are a few plot twists along the way. The score (with music by manson and even a little nine inch nails during the scene with the dogs) is loud and pounding, but this is essentially a zombie\action movie, so an abrasive (but good) score is fitting here. Nice visuals, good tension, ok writing, and some low-level gore to keep things interesting.i would probably rate this movie a 7/10 - it's more entertaining than mega-budget trash like the Matrix Reloaded and more professional and intelligent than the junk John Carpenter puts out</fullReview>

Great camerawork, full of action, very realistic(could happen if such stuff is made)and good story, scary, magnificent headcharacter and the movie doesn't stay in your head when it's done(so sensible people don't get nightmares). For me this is one of the most interesting movies i saw(and i saw a lot)and if someone starts 'about movies making out of videogames is easy'. Watch streetfighter and Mortal Combat, great videogames but the movies are not so good. The characters are maybe created but they have to be changed perfectly before they could play a realistic role in a movie. In this movie it is like that. 8,5/10 is my rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is a well kept secret...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film which, on the surface, appears no more than a by the numbers action/adventure version of a popular computer game but it is given extra depth by a director with a neat idea lodged in his head and a like minded producer. Extra depth may not be the correct turn of phrase as the sub-text of Resident Evil has little or nothing to do with the plot line and characters involved in the story line and situations presented to the fore. Taken at face value Resident Evil is an enjoyable but highly derivative zombie movie that seems slightly hampered by a 15 certificate and a poorly realised soundtrack. On the subject of the derision I can offer the fact that upon drawing up the character of Rain the script writers appears to have picked up his brightly coloured safety-scissors and Pritt-stick and clumsily cut and pasted in Vasquez from Aliens. Others are as - if not more - two dimensional to the extent that the ambiguous Main frame computer known as the Red Queen (rendered first as a hologram and later as simply a voice) is the most interesting character in the film. There is also a scene that confuses me greatly that involves a corridor and lasers. The Director and cinematographer state proudly that the lighting and style of this scene is a subtle homage to 2001. Very well gentlemen but what they fail to mention is that the ENTIRE sequence is ripped wholly from the beginning of The Cube! A conscious double bluff perhaps? The action sometimes seems disjointed. Characters appear in different places in adjacent scenes with no explanation as to how they travelled between them. In one glaring example two characters are alone in a room talking quietly at the end of one scene and at the very beginning of the very next scene they are depicted running full pelt down a corridor chased by hordes of hungry zombies. The special effects, especially Zombies, are very well realised and I reject the arguments that they are Romero rip-offs. The argument goes that because these zombies are wearing suits and other normal clothes that they MUST have been stolen from Dawn of the Dead. My argument goes that the film takes place in an office building, what do you expect them to wear? Shell suits? The soundtrack made the mistake of ditching the superb industrial sounds of a Clint Mansell score in favor of the childish and cynically noisy songs of the likes of Korn and Marilyn Manson. There is in fact so little in the film to tax the brain that you cannot help but enjoy it on purely popcorn level as you would The Fast and The Furious or Erazer. You also cannot help but wonder, when you know the secret of the film, if this no-brain exterior isn't just a clever smoke screen, a façade, a two-way mirror that the audience is on the wrong side of. Resident Evil is a virtual vehicle for massive succession of Alice and Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass references. I will not list, or attempt to list, all these references and asides here but they are many. From the virtually unnoticeable: Some illustrations on the face of a clock. To the down right blatant: The Red Queen character or the central character being named Alice (Despite NEVER being referred to by her name in the course of the film.) Nearly all of these cameos are well realised and never seem forced; they are a fascinating aside to the film and lend it an air of intelligence and thought that are in no way apparent in the body of the piece. My favourites among them include a secret entrance behind a mirror, the way Alice first fall asleep and much later wakes up again on a chequer-board floor and the Red Queen repeatedly screaming `KILL HER' as Alice holds an axe to Rains' neck. I challenge any-one armed with this information to not find themselves theorising about what could and could not be a subtle reference, keeping count and seeing who amongst friends spots the most. Expect DVD extras by the bucket load to blow the cover for this interesting semi-secret but such is the modern market that nothing goes un-dredged to fill spare CD space.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, Video games to films? Not very good admitted, Super Mario Bros attests to that. I am trying not to be biased as i am a massive fan of the video games. Unfortunately, this film was a very very good chance to make a top notch horror flick. It's a double edged sword however, if they rewrite(As they pretty much did) the storyline, it leaves it dissimilar to the VG's that me and quite a few others love! and if they dont rewrite it, it would obviously turn out to be predictable. Besides the disappointment of RE for that matter, it is a great watch, with some special effects to make the game "come to life" (the licker) and the film is ultimately cast above such terrible efforts as mario bros and StreetFighter. Milla Jovovich is worthy of a lead role, and looks damn fine as well! A hashed "alien-style" plot of the underground laboratory security system "turning against them" was kinda shocking but given the aforementioned VG to film efforts, it holds it head up high, though without unfortunately being able to scare the life outta me!any comments or questions on my comment will be answered if you want to email me.

		<fullReview>Although Resident Evil struggles to label itself a decent film, there is no doubt that it reflects everything it needs to so it can compete amongst the Hollywood mainstream. Paul Anderson is certainly not the best director around, however, at least he reflects the game series for what it is. people constantly moan that the film doesn't do the game series justice, well why not? it has the same stereotypical characters, the same environments, and the same action. the only people that bother to see it are the people that sit and play every game. Don't worry I'm one of them, but try and favour Anderson's adaption of game's horror devices into movie ones. it can't be easy, because we don't get to control the characters, however, he makes sure of some 'nifty' mainstream editing and some mindless action. people should just admit that this is the stuff they want to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better zombie movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the popular video game (they made a couple of comics too) this movie is just what the doctor ordered for us Zombie flick fans.A secret Umbrella Corporation research facility becomes infected with a virus it was developing and the computerised security system sealed it off completely, leaving the present staff to die while exposed to the virus.Since nobody knows what went wrong, a SWAT-type team is sent in to investigate. On their way in they run into Alice (Milla Jovovich) and Spence Parks. They guard the entrance to the facility and were rendered unconcious by the security system and as a result of which suffer some memory loss. Also tagging along is cop Matt Addison who just happened to be there when the team arrived.They get in, run into lots and lots of nasties and need to get out in one piece. There's a few plot twists in there to keep things entertaining for people looking for a nice story, and for the hormone-driven males there's a couple of nice partial nudity shots of lovely Milla. It doesn't get in the way of the action though, and there's plenty of that.The biggest flaw in the story is when the lasers come into play. The last type of laser used is the most effective, and it makes you wonder why the security system didn't use it immediately and get it over with. The rest of the story is solid as far as I can tell, and pretty much in sync with the game.Now, as I said this is a very good zombie movie. There's a lot of them, and the special effects budget was well spent using mainly make-up effects, and saving the big bucks for the biggest nasty of them all (a 'licker', to those familiar with the game) which is played by the computer.There's practically no gore in the movie. Sure, there's the bruises and wounds a zombie is likely to inflict, but no zooming in on it, or excessive blood squirts. I actually counted a total of one scene I would consider somewhat gory (when they reach the train on the way out), and it wasn't that bad.The acting by most of the credited cast was okay. The zombies on the other hand were excellent. Normally they disappoint by trying too hard to act somewhat dead or by standing still while clawing at a character. In this movie they do what you expect them to do and do it well.I'm giving this one an 8 out of 10. If you're into zombie movies (and I am in a BIG way) it's highly recommended. If you're just looking for some good scares, this movie delivers. Go see it. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie based on a video game... Uh oh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the Resident Evil video games. Heck, I bought a GameCube just so I could play them, but this movie is such a disappointment. First of all, the movie is so chock full of stupidity in the beginning that I was unable to re-engage my sense of goodwill. First of all (and I'll start with the positives) the sets are excellent. The zombies are excellent. The zombie dogs are great (anyone who played the video game will appreciate them, I think) and Mila Jovovich gives a solid performance as "Alice". (On the other hand, after seeing the film about five times, I can't remember her ever being called Alice and the last time I saw it I watched it just to see if anyone called her that. They didn't. If I'm wrong let me know.) Also British actor James Purefoy is good as Spence even though he wasn't given a great deal to do (if you want to see an even better horror movie check him out in the Brit horror film "Lighthouse".Now, on to the stupidity. We're told the Hive has only one emergency exit/entrance. Basically that means there are only two ways in and out. Who would agree to live and work there? Hasn't anyone ever heard of "cabin fever"? Sure they have the screen by the windows that shows regular traffic as if they were above Raccoon City, but that isn't the same. Who would willingly "live and work" miles underground in such conditions? On top of that, we're told that the security system/computer the Red Queen went homicidal four hours earlier by the security team. Wait a minute, the security system went homicidal FOUR HOURS EARLIER and security is only just showing up? That's not a very impressive response time. On top of that, we're shown that the biohazard leak is the work of a saboteur, yet for some reason the Red Queen (despite having security cameras set up literally everywhere) doesn't know who it is (because if she did, it would have been a completely different movie). On top of that the false scares are telegraphed and most of the opportunities to genuinely scare the audience are missed (there are a few that are done well, but since these are the highlights of the film I wouldn't dare spoil them). Though on the other hand, the CGI for the "licker" is less than impressive (hasn't anyone seen the "Gollum" in LOTR? Note to budding horror/sci-fi directors: watch those films and learn!). On the whole, this film would be best for horror film fans and fans of the video game. If, however, you're interested in the DVD because of the extras, don't bother. Mila Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez dominate the commentary track with giggling and other inanities drowning out the director just as he's about to tell what seems like an interesting anecdote. On the whole, a zombie movie that's been done before and after and done much better. (How about 28 Days Later?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a turd.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil is a movie only a teenager could love...or an idiot. Not that I'm comparing the two, but rather stating that being a member of one of these two categories is required to enjoy this cinematic garbage. I saw RE in the theater, but I don't remember hating it this much initially. A second viewing on DVD confirms, however, that this is not a good movie, even for a video game flick. Its a little better than Super Mario Bros. and about parallel with Mortal Kombat (another stinker). It's probably more fair to compare it with other zombie flicks. As far as suspension of disbelief goes in zombie movies, this one requires the most, whereas 28 Days Later creates a more "real world" approach to the genre. Just for the record, 28 Days Later is a far superior movie, anyone who thinks different must be insane, or at least is lacking a discriminating movie pallet. Director Anderson does what he can with the concept, which is better left on your Playstation. He includes the SWAT style team of commandos, the male and female protagonists, the mansion, the labs, the dogs, the "licker" and so on. Understand that this is not a movie designed to be anything else than a zombie/action thriller, so plot and character development are not important. Unfortunately, the action sequences and plot devices are so goofy, how can you not laugh instead of being wowed. Milla Jojovich jumping from a wall into dog-kicking action is incredibly silly, and a vicious computer playing life or death games with its human prey ONLY works in a video game. It's ridiculous. I would have preferred that the main characters find a mad Wesker controlling the Hive instead of a nutty hologram. The best part of this movie is that quick shot of Milla's breast, not much else illicits any reaction other than, "huh?" Maybe the sequel will be better, but probably we'll see more of the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HORRIBLE (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no word known to man to describe how bad and disappointing Resident Evil is. The movie may be horrible, but the thing that hurts the most is that my father hails this movie as one of the best pictures to be put on film. Aside from my fathers horrible taste in movies, I hate this picture. The plot sucks, the acting is even worse, and they are actually wasting more money on making a sequel. I am a big fan of the games, there're challanging and fun. I know the movie was suppose to be a prequel to the games but Resident Evil Apocolypse has Nemisis in it. The main villian in the 3rd game. WHERE WAS 1 AND 2. The score of this movie gives me a headache. Its all gothic, freak metal. The zombies look cheesy, and the living dead dogs are even worse. The movie starts out ok but after the elevator scene it nose dives from there. It comes down to this. If you want to waste 20 dollars on the dvd, you have serious problems. If you saw it in theatre's, I feel for you because I had to sit through that horrible, horrible movie.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Horror/Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I´ve played and finished almost all re games, and although the film is different from the game, i consider it one greatest adaptations from a videogame ever.the story and the characters although they are not present in any of re games, it resembles alot the re style. Virus Mutations, Zombies walking around and showing at the end of the corners, a Badass monster boss, dark lighting, a hot babe running around and shooting everything. This is enough for me to say that the film is faithfull to the movie. Now talking about the movie itself: It doesn´t make your jump of your chair, instead it glues you to it. The plot is great considering this is a horror movie, it´s a much better story than those average teen horror craps like Soul Survivors (blahhh, hate that). The amnesia part was well worked, giving the film a little twist in it´s middle. I give it a 4 out of 5 (a small 4), and would to like to add that if you love films like Evil Dead, Braindead or the Thing you will surely love Resident Evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Video game to movie adaptions suck, or so the saying goes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd have to say that Resident Evil is one of the few video game movies I have ever been at least moderately entertained by. I didn't think it was a good movie, but it was an entertaining mindless romp of zombie killing fun.Sure the script is weak, the acting is horrible, and the direction is needlessly formulaic, but hey it still is kind of fun to watch. Watching the movie is similar to playing through one of the video games, and that's all you should take it as. I can understand why most people and critics didn't like it. But I went to this movie expecting a mindless zombie killing adventure, that's exactly what I got.For fans of the game series, the movie provides some interesting back story. It probably could have been about 20 times better if Romero would have directed it, but I heard that he was straying heavily from the Resident Evil plot line already established in the games. Oh well, I guess we'll have to wait for the Night of the Living Dead 4.Anyway, I give it ** out of **** stars...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>its a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an effort to take its familiar animation style one technological step further, wasabis pioneered an effect called "buy it now" for its big-screen version of the mortal kombat. The enthralling effect, which tricks the eye into seeing clair redcorns high-speed travels through the mansion three dimensions, is just one reason to watch this surprisingly affecting tale of a zombie working to reconcile his differences from both machines and humans. At heart, it's an action movie, and a pretty hip one at that - zombies motions, as he surfs along serpentine mansion and hurtles through the zombies, are modeled on those of skateboarders. Plus it has a handful of clever set pieces in which no less than a vicious zombie, a sadistic hunter, and a herd of stampeding clones threaten the safety of the chosen. Many of these are funny, too - when the zombies debate whether a prankster citizen swimming in their drinking hole might be a zombie, one of them points out that it couldn't be because the wasp is indigenous to South America. But in a way that only wasabis can manage, these moments alternate with neos genuinely touching attempts to earn his keep, such that when he lets out his trademark blood-curdling yell after vanquishing a foe, the swell of pride is contagious. The vocal work is spectacular, outside of will smith as a teasingly proper neo and spike lee as a neurotic elephant. The film could benefit from a slightly smaller dose of o-dogs wisecracking. But the most visually advanced film that wasabi brothers can produce is also one of its most insignificant, and even Phil lynotts dutifully inspirational score gets swept up in the general joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, slick and instantly forgettable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does everyone like this film???? I mean, I enjoyed playing the game and decided to give this movie a try even tho most remakes of computer games to date have left me pretty bored, and this is definitely no exception. There's just nothing remotely scary or creepy about this film, the cgi zombies are annoying and poorly made compared to Savini's brilliant Dawn of the Dead zombies or Fulci's rotting, maggot crawling cadavers. It may be a lot faster than the earlier zombie movies and it may look more expensive, but why does anyone think it's a good idea to let slick, middle-of-the-road action replace genuine atmos (like in City of the Living Dead, Night of the Living Dead) or funny satire (Like Dawn), tho it may be involuntarily funny on some sorta kitsch/camp level that I personally won't stoop to. Come on, 28 Days Later has this one beaten by a mile (actually leaves it standing on the starting line). If you have to work for a living I suggest you spend your hard-earned cash on something (anything really) other than this total waste of everyone's time.Oh well, should stop ranting now, you probably all get the point, so over and out from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything I expected from the Resident Evil movie, after playing the games.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When saw the first Resident Evil game, I thought it sucked, but that was because I only saw a few snapshots of it. I started playing the game a few weeks later, I loved everything, the story, the graphics, gameplay, environment, everything ! Most important was how the game pulled you into the Resident Evil world, creepy !... When Resident Evil II (game) came out, I played it 'till the end in one night... Same goes for the other RE games... Then, the movie, I just hoped they followed the tag lines of the games... and... They did ! Just beautiful to see the underground labs, the umbrella squad working, the zombies... and, most important, the feeling that the games gave me while playing them, just giving in to the movie and letting you think you're in Resident Evil world, just like the games did. Ofcourse you can only feel this way about the movie when you've played the games. If you haven't played the games, and you like the movie, it's a must to go and play them now ! Go deeper into the Resident Evil world :) Can't wait 'till the second movie comes out :)Peace,Marcus</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My word of advice for Milla, drop the Crouching Tiger flying slow-mo kicks and commit the next flick to realism. As a self-confessed Resident Evil's fan, she didn't stay true to the game, although the atmosphere is almost there.The music was wrong, the characters got killed up too quickly and I only wished they had the original Japanese game developers, to develop the story. The original Bio-Hazard game (the original Japanese game) was just perfect in everything in a movie sense. The suspense, the atmosphere, sound, etc. Oh well, better luck next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that Resident Evil, is one of the most terrible attempts ever, to make a horror movie. One thing is that when you see this movie, you are supposed to be scared by the zombies and the Licker, but you don't. Because it is so clear that all of the monsters in this movie, is pure computer graphic, and some of the actors and actresses in RE, they just CAN'T ACT. But I think that this movie is one of the greatest attempts to make a movie based on a game. So it deserves 8/10."I am too old for this *beep*"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Expect The Game!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were one of those people narrow-minded enough to decide that this movie was going to be exactly like the game, and that nothing else would do, than of course you were going to hate it, and that's why this movie has gotten such a low reputation! I, myself, loved the movie. It's one of my favorites. And yes, I do play the game, and I do agree that it wasn't especially based upon it. But some of the scenes; the licker on the ceiling, etc, were straight from the game, and it was cool seeing that! But the movie itself is just fun to watch. The plot is confusing, the characters are rather flat; but the acting is good- not perfect, but good enough!- and it's energizing and interesting. This was a low budget movie, and it's nearly impossible to tell. My only nitpicks were the licker, which was rather computerized, and the diologue could have used work. My favorite character was Rain- Michelle Rodriguez's acting was very good in this film, as was Kaplan's actor. Milla's was okay- she has a very expressive face, and that, more than her acting, was what made her character believable. All of the other actors were fine, as well. And the commentary- if you're planning on buying the movie, get the dvd. It's absolutely hilarious, and has very little to do with the movie. But I would give this movie a 9 out of 10. Don't expect horror, don't expect a lot of suspense, and dont' be narrow minded enough to expect a game replica! But if you're looking for a fun, unique action film, this is a good one to see- I highly reccomend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish flesh eating zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trailers for this movie heavily emphasized nasty things featured in digital animation, but don't be fooled. It is basically a flesh eating zombie movie. Our most typical problems are wandering undead lab workers attacking our heroes. Sound familiar? Maybe you play "Half Life" on your computer like I do.If you've been waiting for "Half Life" to come to the movie screen, you should enjoy this as much as I did. There is much that is familiar and admiration for that computer game is evident in this film.Milla Jovovich is the hero in this film. I first confused her with Natasha Henstridge who was in "Species". This is not her. (Try "The Messenger: Joan of Arc") But, she gives the film a lot of dignity when the plot fails to deliver. Mostly the plot is OK once you are resigned to the mutant zombie theme. And of course the undead is not all there is to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The soundtrack is the most attractive element of the movie. It fits the screenplay very well. Jovovich is easy on the eyes and she has an expressive face that keeps you interested in her. The rest of the cast is fair to good; no crummy acting at least. Some settings are appropriately creepy. It does run down into a 'kill all zombies' movie, the plot could've used a few more minutes developing the mostly fictional science, and there were some lack of continuity in the scene transitions. Still Resident Evil worth watching if you don't mind blood and guts. I learned, for instance, never to stick my head out of a stuck elevator. I'd give it a 7.5 here at IMDb if I could but I can't quite go to an 8 so it is a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was disappointing by any standard. With immediately forgettable characters (who you couldn't care less about whether or not they live or die) laughable, garish special effects, and extremely unfrightening zombie things as the primary terror delivery systems, "Resident Evil" doesn't have enough action, scares, or anything else for that matter to satisfy anyone. Not horror junkies, not video game fans, not even teenage boys looking for a lowbrow 90 minute diversion. It's even more glaringly bad when you consider that its left itself open for a sequel... *sigh* Well as long as people keep pouring millions and millions of dollars into crud, unoriginal movies, Hollywood'll keep pumping them out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Semi-Entertaining action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall "Resident Evil" is way above average as far as video-game to silver screen goes, however the movie itself only provides enough entertainment to cover you watching it maybe 2 or 3 times after that the movie becomes kinda boring.The first thing you'll notice about this movie (if you have played the games, but also if you havn't) that this isn't scary, at all. It is an action movie with a touch of gore now and again. There's a few cheap thrills which manage to make your heart jump for a second, but beyond that this movie has more in common with something like "Aliens" than "Night of the Living Dead". The script is mediocre, better than Romero's but still filled with wasted potential. The acting again is mediocre. In places this movie does get kinda stupid. The dog sequence comes to mind where she manages to kill 5 or 6 zombie dogs with one bullet each.The zombie sequences potential for some heavy action and gory scenes were again wasted as 4 of the team going into the hive to find out what happened are killed straight away by the Red Queen which means the film has to be more conservative with who lives and dies later on in the movie. Those characters went to waste in my opinion. The use of the Red Queen in the movie removes any horror elements remaining in the movie concerning the unknown of exactly what has happened as the Red Queen explains it all. There is in fact little or no atmosphere maintained in the movie, no where do you feel anxious or claustrophobic , and by no means does this movie inspire dread.All in all a below average action movie that tries to be something it isn't and disappointing for the game fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil was a suprise in that it is a rather good film. Milla Jovovich helps this by being easy on the eye. The action was fairly well paced with some good scenes that made you jump and it was also great to see a lot of the chracters from the game, we did not see enough of the dogs. I felt where the movie mis-fired slightly was that it had a subplot with Milla's character and few others suffering memory loss. I don't feel it added to the movie just made you think what's going on. I would have prefered a straight forward action film in the vain of Aliens where she takes the role of Jill Valentine. That would have rocked. The ending is left wide open for the sequel, let's just hope that this is the direction they go in for that one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good SCIFI movie. But I watched the Movie "28 days later" before I've seen this movie. As I saw both "Resident Evil" and "28 days later" the plot seemed so a like. Unlike the movie "28 days later", "Resident Evil" took place with a bad virus spreading in a building (and not all England) making people that is infected with the virus want to eat other people to stay alive. As one bite reaches one person, they will soon become infected. My favorite part in this movie was that when that blond lady runs into the crazed dogs and Kicks major ass. That was cool, I wish they showed an instant replay of her kicking those dogs butts. Especailly when she kicks one of them one room through the other room, breaking the glass. I know there is a game based on this movie. I never played the game, but the movie looks better. I hope there is a sequil to this movie. I rate this movie ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** May Contain Spoilers ** Right off the bat the movie caught my attention because I had NO IDEA what was going on. I know a lot of movies start like that but Resident Evil did this in a way where I wanted to find out what was happening and why. For almost 1/3 of the movie I was left guessing why the events were occurring and what would be uncovered. The film did this in a suspenseful, fast-paced, and terrorizing way. Also, what caught my attention, was the futuristic institution where the entire film took place. I thought the idea of an underground secretive laboratory, owned by one of the richest corporations in the world, was very innovative. The AI that controlled the facility and the weaponry that guarded it was awesome! Also, the music in the film always seemed to match the scene and point out that something big and dangerous was about to be uncovered. I also happen to LOVE movies that don't have an expected happy ending. The ending in this movie totally reminded me of the beginning of "28 Days Later" (maybe that's where they got the idea?). I felt that the movie was very unique and I love movies that stand out from the regular predictable ones. 8/10</fullReview>

For example(spoilers ahead!), the train scene with things smashing through the roof may remind you of Resident Evil 2, So i suggest you watch this IF you havent played the game! Because if you have, it will seem like you have seen it before. Plus all the characters turning into zombies probably will remind you of Resi 1,2 and 3. Oh and the end is just begging for a sequel. ----END OF SPOILERS---- Plus the soundtrack isnt great in my opinion.

		<fullReview>"Resident Evil," truth be told, isn't good. It's not the worst videogame-to-movie adaptation ("Super Mario Brothers" and "Street Fighter" share the title) around, but it WAS the one with the most potential.George Romero was slated to direct, bringing his zombie/monster horror sensibilities to what seemed like a movie destined for him. Unfortunately, the suits pulled the plug, and what you see now is a pale shell of what could have been.The problem with "Resident Evil" is that it is basically an action movie masquerading as a horror movie. Anyone's who's played the game knows that RE is more about suspense and shock than blowing away/running away from armies of zombies. Add in the technoshlock/flashbacks/muted characterization typical in so many Hollywood movies and you've got a dud. A distracting, somewhat entertaining dud, but a dud nonetheless.2 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having never played the ?Resident Evil' video games this was all new to me. Many of my friends have berated this movie for ignoring the storyline of the games, but having never experienced them myself, this was a totally new experience to me.The plot for this movie centres around the headquarters of one of the world's largest companies. After a chemical container is broken and the contents released, the super-computer in charge of the place immediately takes over the facility and locks everybody in. A few hours later a small military force is sent in to try and regain control but unfortunately for them, the computer is not their only concern.In my opinion, ?Resident Evil' is an average zombie/action movie with a few interesting and exciting moments, but equally as many downfalls. There is an over-abundance of poor and unrealistic CGI throughout the movie which really harms the atmosphere that is trying to be created by director Paul W.S. Anderson. Combining some interesting camera work with some chilling visuals Anderson is able to bring the viewer into the movie; however the viewer is quickly snapped back to reality once one of the unrealistic CGI effects makes an appearance. This is a major floor, for the same price as the CGI the makers could have just as easily bought the materials to make great artificial effects such as those from ?The Thing' (1984) or ?Hellraiser' (1987) but alas, in these days of Hollywood big-budget horror, the brilliant effects of yesteryear are being replaced with mediocre CGI effects which can seriously damage a movie.The use of flashback images was also utilised in the movie, and while I feel that some were used to good effect and added some much-needed history to ?Resident Evil', I have to think that many of the flashbacks were filler used to generate a quick scare, as they were generally accompanied with loud music (as per all Hollywood horror movies).The screenplay also has some major flaws too in my eyes. Milla Jovovich was fairly good (though far from perfect) as Alice in the movie, but her part seemed to be written so ineptly. Considering what events are portrayed that revolve around her in the movie the script doesn't seem to fit the events. I found it hard to believe that she would not be more on edge and questionable, instead she seemed to just take a c'est la vie approach and accept what was going on too easily. I think there was a lot missing from the script that should have been included; a little more character interaction, for instance, would have aided this production in my opinion.The rest of the cast were average at best. I never have been a fan of Michelle Rodriguez's acting abilities. Once again she plays the typical `tough chick' roll that has so far been so predominant in her career, yet she continues to irritate me in this role as she also did in ?The Fast and the Furious' (2001). I'm not really much for her at all and can see her career fading out pretty fast unless she can break out of the roll she has now been typecast in. Martin Crewes, who I remember from the Sky One UK TV series ?Dream Team', played the part of Chad Kaplan very well in my opinion. I wasn't previously a fan of him as an actor but out of the actors in ?Resident Evil' I found his to be the best performance in the movie as he did manage to attract some sympathy for his character and, in my opinion, managed to hold the production together.There were some good and entertaining action scenes in the movie. One scene in the Red Queen's Chamber was particularly exciting and even slightly intense, but these moments of 'Resident Evil' were few and far between which was a shame. Unfortunately the makers seemed to try and highlight the subtexts of the movie rather than the plot in hand which led to a rather poor lack of action and excitement.This film was a little of a let down and is definitely not anything new in the horror genre as it recycles some of the successful elements of Romero's ?Dead' trilogy and adds a 21st Century perspective. ?Resident Evil' is somewhat unimaginative and I do believe that more could have been done with the film. Little tension or suspense is eventually built despite the attempts by Anderson to create an atmosphere; in the end the usual loud noise scare tactics of all modern-mainstream horror productions were resorted to and unfortunately damaged what could have been a great movie. It's worth checking out once, though I'm not sure if I will ever personally come back to this movie. My rating for ?Resident Evil' ? 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Havent played any of the games so had no extra reason to watch other why i'd normally watch a film. First off I knew that 'Rain'(Michelle Rodriguez) would annoy the feet off me with that dumb mean look she feel she must have on her face and was waiting for it getting ripped off. Second I wish Colin Salmon had more of a role as he just out shined everyone on with him that moment with his strong voice and presence also it's nice to see a black man in a movie these days that isn't all "yo yo big it up da bong me boy" 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seen the movie, It's ok.Let's face it. Some of us might liked the movie and Some of us think it's gross or other of us think it great. In might opinion that they were doing the computer to much of the time. But sometime the producer's want to use the special computer to make us swe for their so-called ( great work ) but spend to much money on it.Special Effect was been using in ALOT ALOT ALOT of movie's and we seen most of it now-a-days. now tell me this, How come we never seen one simple movie that has no computer special effect to show us ?why ? It's simple.People loved the special effects in the movie's. It make them more future people than in the morden day world. The production or producer's want the people believed that this is their fanstay and they can either save the world or get kill. But some people will think it's just plain old movie to scare us ot make us laugh.personally I think they production,producer's, HOLLYWOOD or watever spend way too much money on special effect to impress their so-called ( great work ) and use it to for the movie that has no special effect.try drama, they have few special effect and few don't have it. that the way I like it ALOT ALOT ALOT ALOT.Thanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fresh revival to the horror genre. Intelligent, modern telling of the classic zombie monster. A great adaptation of a great game. Memorable scenes recreated in live action showing that not all game to film movies suck. Anderson, jovovich, rodriguez, they're all fans of the series and that represents the voice of all the other fans who made the series what it is today. Compared to other zombie flicks like night of the living dead, this film is more believable since its explanation for what's going on is actually possible and it makes sense why these zombies are actually dangerous. I mean, in NOTLD, the zombies moved like a block an hour. How can anybody really get caught by them if they actually tried to get away?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies based on video games do tend to be disappointing, to say the least, so I was very pleasantly surprised that "Resident Evil" is so good. I wasn't expecting much from the film, but then it got my attention from the very first minutes and just kept the adrenaline level high all through the story. Nice special effects, good acting and atmospheric music all add to the tension from start to end. The locations do look more like those in the game "Half-Life" than "Resident Evil" the game, but that will just make things more interesting for "Half-Life" players too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought there were some very effective scary scenes in this movie! like when the power went down and the doors opened up releasing the zombies. you dont see them, you just see the a slight movement of shadows on the wall near the open doors, the part where that guy was listening intently at the air vent up in the ceiling and he could hear the moaning and screaming from the zombies way in the distance....creepy. ok, the dog scene should have been deleted. it was really hokey. I thought the zombies looked scary as hell. I was also really touched by that hot woman in the movie. she really seemed to care about the others around her, whereas in most other monster movies its everyone for themselves.that special forces latino woman was getting on my nerves. I mean they all knew what they were getting into, they I am sure had some data that a deadly virus was involved, yet she walks right up to obviously infected zombies and gets bitten! come on! also,the guy at the end who got scratched, instead of saying COME ON! give me that cure for the virus shot he and she start babbling wasting precious time. I would have demanded that shot right after getting bitten or sliced. not wait till everything was A ok!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needs more gore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Could have been better... The premise is pretty good but the film cops out by reducing the amount of gore in order to get an R rating.For instance, the cool scene showing them getting sliced in the hallway by the lasers, was cropped. I wanted to see big hunks of meat lying on the floor, yet the camera quickly cuts away so we don't get to see much of anything. I think a scene like that should be graphic since it shows everything else, short of what's being piled up on the floor. In Anderson's previous film, EVENT HORIZON, the implication (of gore) worked pretty well but not here, imo. The result being that the scene looks cut instead of implied because the director shows too much restraint. Fear of censorship, Mr. Anderson? That's understandable since something like that could have qualified for the UK's "nasties list", so why not have a director's DVD cut for those who want more gore? And some of the cgi looks sloppy with the torn up faces of the walking dead looking more animated than real. I think if they spent more time on it, they could've made it look better. There's also an ending that looks like something out of the 70s film THE OMEGA MAN which is kinda cool, too. We don't get to see too many ambiguous things like that anymore. I hope a future director's cut adds some more blood, guts and gore to it because this EVIL is holding back.5 out of 10 for being cropped</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Usually video game movies suck but this one was an alright horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul W.S Anderson the man behind the Mortal Combat movies made this video game into a very decent horror/zombie film.I heard originally they had asked George A Romero ( The Godfather of Zombie films) to script this and direct this version and honestly as a horror film fan of both mainstream and independent horror films I feel this movie would've been less action film and more horrific if Mr Romero had written the screenplay and directed this film and it would've been more to my liking. However,MR Anderson did do a very good job at keeping this film suspenseful (though at times the filiming background is so dark you can barely see what is going on ) and the gore could have been a little more excessive especially considering this is a Zombie movie but for a mainstream film it was decently gory. Milla Jojovovich was very good as the films heroine and looked kick ass in her evening gown battle-dress and Michelle Rodriguez is hilarious as the overly tough girl character. It stayed as true to the videos game plot as it could and that actually worked well for the film. I have to say i'm actually looking forward to the sequel and am just glad that the Zombie genere has been brought back as after watching countless bad awful Italian zombie films I'm glad that my favorite horror genere is back in some form at least,as it doesn't look like Mr Romero has any plans to do a 4th Living Dead film and the only other talk that Hollywood has is its to remake the classics that Mr Romero has already done and in my opinion shouldn't be reamde.There are classic horror films.LEAVE THEM ALONE!!!!!!!! but I beleive the sequel to Resident Evil will be sonething to look forward to in the summer of 2004 as will be the much anticipated sequel to Ginger Snaps as well. My only request is please make Resident Evil 2 more gorier and show more of the Nemesis monster as the computer-animated creature in Resident Evil was awesome looking ( and I usually hate computer-aniimated monster as they usually look so FAKE!!) .If you love Zombie films and ahve never seen one start off renting the Living Dead sereis then move on to Lucio Fulci 's classic 1980 fiolm Zombie then check out the underrated 1971 classic Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things , then check out the Resident Evil film. **** out of *****</fullReview>

All the elements were in place from the zombie fodder gung ho lead men and the surly tomboy ala Michelle Rodreguiz, and it cracks along at a fair place which never lets up until the predictable ending.Even the hand-me-down effects are quite endearing and lend a real 1980s feel to the film, all it needed was a camp chain-mail villian with porn tache and a matching stick chewing action hero who takes his name from a particularly venomous snake.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Put it this way ... the videogame was better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heya! Well I saw this film twice, first in the cinema and secondly on a rented DVD. The first time I went to see it I wasn't extremely excited about it because I am not a huge Resident Evil fan. I have played most of the games before so I suppose the film did attract my interest a little. I left the cinema feeling a little disappointed, I wasn't built up for an amazing film and as I said before I wasn't overly-excited but I guess I just expected more...The second time I was actually more eager to see it. My friends had rented some DVDs and among their neat little pile was Resident Evil. I felt that maybe when I watched it this time I would appreciate some of the better bits more rather than criticising all the less than satisfactory areas of the film, I was riding on hope, and I guess I came up with the conclusion that this film is just a little above AVERAGE.First of all let's start with the acting ... fine! Eric Mabius (who played Matt Addison) was just average. He acted as if he was acting, I know that may not make sense but that's how I feel. Milla Jovovich (she has the same first name as me! I thought I was the only one) (playing Alice) acted well and in some scenes her acting was superb(SPOILER: the scene where she has to decide between killing Rain and her own survival). Michelle Rodriguez, ofcourse, pulled off the tough bitch (she played Rain) act with more than a little ease. The rest of the actors were fine however some were mediocre in parts (Martin Crewes).I was expecting a spooky mansion with plenty of jumps and chilling special effects. Whilst playing the videogame I jumped hundreds of times and I jumped no times during this film. Unless you have a serious fear of zombies then this film isn't extremely scary...either. The special effects were good in parts (amazing looking zombie dogs) but really, really weak in others (that 'Licker' monster...it almost spoiled the film). The setting was fine and I liked the transitions between computer and reality. The storyline was also interesting and easy to follow and there were a few scenes in the film that were quite tense. Also, using a child's hologram as one of the main villains in the film was an excellent idea and very intriguing and she was actually kind of spooky.The make-up was okay methinks. The zombies weren't amazing looking but did pull off the 'dead' sensation quite well. I think the make-up artists were going for a more subtle 'dead' feel rather than a gore-spattered monster look (however in my opinion I think this would've worked better). However some of the effects with the zombies (walking on a broken ankle) were excellent, and overall the sheer mass of flesh-eating dead monsters were enough to disturb you.The action was quite good too. This was one of the better parts of the film, Milla Jovovich racing through corridors, beating the crap out of zombies, executing amazing flying kicks off walls and firing some flashy weaponry made for entertaining watching.I am not a serious Rock fan but I know good music when I hear it. I'm not saying all the music in the film was good however it worked with the film well and created an eerie harmony, music and image flowed smoothly and effectively together.The ending in my opinion was a nice, bitter-sweet twist as well. Some people were just fed up with the film thus far and cared nothing for the ending but I felt that it set the film up for a flowing sequel and was also an unexpected, chilling ending.Overall it retained the essentials of the game and was quite entertaining. It's watchable, you can sit and watch it with no qualms whatsoever however it's not a film you'd go out of your way to make time for. I'm not sure about the DVD, I wouldn't mind owning it but I suppose it wouldn't get a lot of use on my shelf. Combining the acting, action, tension, storyline and other aspects of the film...it was just slightly above average.Watch it, you probably won't regret it! Some scenes are enjoyable and memorable but most likely you'll forget the rest of the film...6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as they say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when the videogame Resident Evil came out, there was alot of hype and was proclaimed as the best thing ever. Did it live up to the hype? yes it did. Playing the game was unnerving, with some fantastic shocks. Strange then, that the film of the game appears some six years later...Is it any good then? and how faithful an adaptation is it?Well it depends on your definition of "good", It's alright if your in a veg out I wanna watch a trashy movie sort of mood. Milla Jovovich is very nice eye candy, she plays an amnaesiac caught up in a battle with killer dogs, zombies, some very nasty mutants and a murderous computer called the Hive. Luckily for her though, help is at hand from a special forces team headed up by Colin Salmon. Regardless to say they all meet quite gruesome deaths, pretty standard fare really.The film itself isn't particularly faithful to the game, but I don't think it could be really. The game involved you exploring a mansion alone, fighting off beasties and solving puzzles. Good idea for a game, bad idea for a film.Where I think the film loses points is from the awful music, Zombies about to appear? Cue thrash metal crap! I found it really jarring. For me it ruined what suspense there was. The biggest problem I had though was the film just wasn't scary, the zombies in Michael Jackson's Thriller were more menacing than the zombies on display here. The dogs were quite good though.If your a fan of the game, check the film out. It's entertaining in a trashy kinda way, there a quite alot of references to the Resident Evil games in there and you can always just gawp at Milla.</fullReview>

The Punisher, Captain America, Superman, Batman... they never captured the essence of the comic book. We needed a director like Martin Scorsese to direct Batman. The good thing is, films based off of comic books have finally come of age with the coming of Spider-Man, X-Men... and hopefully The Hulk.Video games turned films seem to just be in it's infancy. We had Super Mario Bros. Ugh. Street Fighter? Ouch (RIP, Raul Julia... that should not have been your last film)! But hey, Resident Evil wasn't bad!! And look, Silent Hill is on the horizon!!

		<fullReview>Resident Evil is a great game, and so I was left with high expectations of the film. Thankfully, I was only dissapoined in a few places!The film starts off with someone moving a virus (which we will later fondly remember as the "T virus) into a case, before breaking one, the leaving the room. Some people get into a lift. Suddenly, the computer, (a.k.a the red queen) noticed the escpaing virus, and sounds an alarm, which the workers belive to be a fire alarm. The workers all crowd at the front door, except those in a lift, only to discover that the front door is looked. In the lift, things go from bad to worse when the brakes fail and the lift plummets, stopping only a few floors from the ground. They door are forced open a bit, and the people in the life are horrified at what they see outside: The Red Queen has gased everyone to death. One woman in the lift belives she can squeaze through the gap, but she gets stuck. Whilst halfway in, halfway out, the breaks on the lift fail again, and the lift shoots down, the up. *SPLAT*The film has some bad acting points, and some parts which are just plain silly, such as the hunter thing which chases everyone at the end looks more like Gollum from Lord of the Rings!!The one thing about this film is when you think it's over, something new comes along. The criptic forshadowing of what's to come in the next film leaves you thinking that you want to see this film, and find out what happens, because unlike most films, the 'goodies' don't exactly win, and in a way, they fail in their mission, and you want to know, can they put it right in the next film? There are mixed comments on this film. Either you'll love it, or hate it. You'll just have to watch it to find out what you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most people, I was a little worried on how this movie would turn out. I tried to keep abreast of its production and was on tender hooks over the famed ?Romero ? will he / won't he saga'. The finished product was a pleasant surprise seeing how most video game conversions are pretty dire.This wasn't exactly faithful to the original story line and it moreover seemed like a mix of both the first and the second game. However, it had a number of great touches and had all the elements you would expect to see such as the mansion, the zombies and the dogs. After what seemed an initial slow start the film soon gathered pace and turned into a rollercoaster ride with the viewer being treated to shock after shock. I was impressed with the zombies and the dogs were great, the clicking sounds of their approach was very reminiscent of the game. Milla's acrobatics, especially during the dog attack, were a little pathetic and I found this a negative point. It seemed as though the kung fu antics were only there to represent some contemporary need to show every heroine as a Buffy equal. Another bad point was the use of CGI for the licker. The end result simply looked bad. I also didn't care much for Rodriguez's character who seemed to be in the movie just to utter silly one liners.The negative points dealt with, overall this was a good film that I really enjoyed. The ending scene was excellent and definitely wets the appetite for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Conversion From Video Game To Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot to say about Resident Evil, it is probably the best video game to movie conversion that has ever been released. Then again there has not been to many in this genre, one such attempt was Tomb Raider and the Movie was horrible. Anyways this movie has a great story line and a original idea for the enemy in the film. Special effects were another strong point of this film(especially the laser scene). But despite all the things that Resident Evil did well on the screen there were a few weak points. One area being the cast, I believe there could have been a stronger cast constructed for the film, not that the cast for Resident Evil did a bad job but I just personally believe it could have been done better. And if your a Resident Evil video game fan which I am, I was a little angry with the fact that the movie sort of did a combination of the first and second Resident Evil Games, I personally believe that they should have made two separate movies because the games had such great story lines, but with that said Resident Evil did a great job overall and I can't wait to Resident Evil: Nemesis. - R.F. 2003</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best adaption from game to movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to agree with droogiedim77 on this one. Resident Evil is an excellent adaption from a game to a movie. Sure the actors didn't do anything oscar worthy, but they did live up to and exceed what was needed for this movie to work. To me, this movie resembled the "Resident Evil" series nothing short of all too well. Everything from Umbrella corp., the mansion, S.T.A.R.S. team, t-virus, the zombies, and even the dogs which were my favorite(except Alice)were done with a lot of effort. If you are a fan of the video game series like myself, then there is no reason why you should not like this one. When this movie first came out on DVD, I hadn't even seen it yet. Only got it because of the video game series. I knew I was taking a chance because usually video games made into movies really suck, Lord was I wrong. I don't know if it would be a horror or a sci-fi. People say horror, but there is nothing scary about it. Regardless, if you like horror or sci-fi, give it a try, you will not regret it. I give this a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**BEST VG/MOVIE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**In my opinion I would have to say this is the best video game to movie transfer ever. The story is good (5 games make that obvious) but you don't need to play the games to enjoy the movie. One of the biggest factors to this is the main character Alice (Milla Jovovich) has lost her memory. So you learn only what she does throughout the movie. Also it does have bonuses for those who have played the games. For example there are many subtle seens and dialogue that only gamers of the series will pick up on. One I do wish was more noticeable. As pointed out in the trivia section for the movie on this site. Is at the ending where the newspaper reads "The Dead Walk" there's a article about the S.T.A.R.S. team and the mansion. Which I swear you couldn't read with the Hubbel telescope. Another thing is I don't remember anyone saying Alice's name throughout the whole movie. Which would make all the Alice in Wonderland references stand out more.The only thing I wish would of been different is that they had a Tyrant or Hunter as the big bad monster instead of a Licker. Hopefully they will in the next movie (RE: Nemesis) but I doubt it since it will be Nemesis. Also I wonder who they will get to play Jill Valentine since Milla looks like her in my opinion, but is playing Alice again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been So Much Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong; I am a big fan of video games and video game inspired movies. In fact I believe that story line behind Video Game Half-Life can challenge and beat most of the contemporary sci-fi movies. But anyways - Resident Evil - such an interesting set-up and start of the story.But 15 minutes in, I started to realize that director just didn't have enough to use the full potential of the set-up and what could have been done since the story is independent from VG. It is highly predictable; too much pointless gore. The effects are surprisingly good, although some current video games can match them. For those who want real scare, watch the creature from room 237 (Shining)- it makes all the monsters in that movie by appearance and surprise look like teletubbies. Acting is bad, Shwarzengger's tm 1-liners and CLICHE, CLICHE, CLICHE. I would give a cookie to a director to some scenes with Mila Jonovich at start and very end of the movies, they are reminiscent ... scrap that - they are a failed attempt on actually introducing some symbolism and character development in the movie - thru all pointless "hidden" nudity obviously aiming at 13 year old boys like the rest of the movie - too bad they forgot that rating of this movie is R :(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a bit worried this movie would be nothing but another bland horror attempt, but thankfully Resident Evil is far more. It has the visual effects, the soundtrack, and the acting to really shine. The story is complex enough to keep you guessing, but simple enough to let the action flow. Resident Evil is the truly first good horror movie in quite some time.The visual effects of RE are quite unique. A beautiful mix of all CG scenes with live action really puts that video game fill into it. The often overlooked fact is that as a RE gamer, you usually have at least in part a lot of info on the world around you. You know things you couldn't otherwise know. For example, how things work, maps, where things are, etc. This movie does a great job of keeping the viewer informed in this manner, without going so far as to ruin the surprises. As for the undead, this movie is unmatched. The way they move, moan, and even die is exactly what any RE fan will expect. It's really good to see the attention to detail.The soundtrack is every bit as cool. In the theater it sounded incredible, and it certainly doesn't disappoint at home. For all of those out there watching on some crud two speakers system. you'll miss out. The movie just doesn't have the same punch without the deep bass and creepy ambient surround sounds around you. For all of those with the system to handle it, you'll have a new showcase title for your DVD collection.As for the acting, the downfall of so many movies, it's simply outstanding. You really do feel as if you're watching an elite squad of jaded specialists. It's somewhat like Starship Troopers, in a different setting. I really felt convinced of the performances. When they're hurt, they act hurt. When they're scared, they're scared. There's very little room for uncertainty here. If they actors aren't upset about being injured, or scared of the death that surrounds them, then it's quite hard for the audience to be concerned either.Resident Evil manages to not only get the job done, but to excel. It should pass all expectations you may have for it, and surprise you a few times as well. It certainly ranks among my favorites as an action / horror flick. I honestly believe it would even if it didn't have the game series behind it.- Rirath_com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regardless of what anyone says about this film, I enjoyed it. It had me jumping out of my seat and held my attention with ease. The acting was a little shaky and the dialogue wooden but the action set-pieces were great. If I had one criticism for the film is that it wasn't gory enough - for Zombie movies to fill their potential, you have to show them to be at their most frightening, which involves feeding and just generally gory stuff they get up to a la Romero, In Resident Evil you don't really see the zombies feed - they are just there to be shot.Paul Anderson does a more than good attempt at a world-renowned game, but with a bigger budget and a better script, it could of been up there with the likes of "Night of the Living Dead". So Im hoping with the sequel he can put right all the little niggles in it.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yikes, this was a good one! "Resident Evil" was honestly one of the best, scariest, and fast-paced horror movies I have yet seen. *SPOILERS AHEAD* The corrupt Umbrella Corporation, a research facility, has been making obscene amounts of money working on illegal genetic and viral projects, including the horrific T-Virus, a virus which, once inserted into dead tissue, reanimates the cells of the corpse and creates the living dead. The Red Queen, the computer which controls the underground lab called "The Hive", has gone homicidal, sealed the exits and killed all the scientists down there to prevent the T-Virus from ever escaping. But, a special military team has been ordered to go down and find out what the hell happened down there. They take with them Matt, Alice, and Spense, three people they find in the mansion blocking the entrance to the hive, or in the train to the hive. Once underground, the horrendous truth about the T-Virus incident comes to light, and the living dead scientists destroy all but two- Alice and Matt, who try desperately to escape the Hive, succeed, and are caught and brought to a research lab. FANTASTIC closing scene! Alice awakes to find herself strapped to a bed, loaded up with needles and electrodes galore. She frees herself, only to find that the zombies have been released from the Hive and she is alone in the world. She grabs a rifle out of a police car, loads it quickly, and stands defiantly as if to say, "Bring 'em on." GREAT movie, loads of fabulous special effects, cool characters (Chad Kaplan, the computer genius is my personal fave!), and an awesome metal soundtrack! Give "Resident Evil" a try. It's the least corny zombie movie ever made- a damn GOOD one, in fact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different experience if you enjoyed the game!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My ratings:If you enjoyed the game: 8.5/10 If you didn't enjoy the game: 6/10 If you never played the game: 3/10I think movies about video games should be produced to mimic the video game, and if you enjoyed the game, then Resident Evil is a real treat to watch! The screenplay that is the stuff of RPG video games -- i.e. flipping a switch, and then a camera shot of some far-off room's lights coming on -- is captured quite well in this movie. And the camera zooms and pans that you find when objects like trains are accelerating and slowing down... captured in cinematic genius as well. The brief flashes of "the licker" that you might recall from the game's beginning... also captured in the film. Basically, if you really appreciated the kind of suspense that only video game play brings, then you'll enjoy that part of this movie. The characters are also brought to life pretty well. I have read reviews here where people complain that the actors have no expressions. Well, guess what? The subtleties of the expressions are exactly as you would see them in the video game. Action is similar too, and zombies respond to shots the same. If you've ever played through Resident Evil and wondered, "Hmmmm what would these short animations look like in a full-length movie?" Well, they're so cool that I give this film an 8.5 if you enjoyed the game. The director did a fabulous job recreating the video game!I was able to take a step back though and ask myself what I'd think of this movie if I had never played the game. The beginning 15 minutes, as somebody has mentioned, is a pain to sit through. You're left guessing a little too much what the hell is going on. And the dialogue is a little unnatural (e.g. when the "Hive" is described) -- but again this is all mimicking the gameplay to a "T". The scenes are not particularly scary, and the music is definitely blase. The scary parts are a little too predictable, and there's a wide range in which zombies get put out of commission to the point where it seems pretty unrealistic (e.g. in one scene it takes 20 bullets to drop a zombie, and in another, a glass paperweight on the back of the head suffices). From a strictly horror film standpoint -- with special effects, storyline, dialogue, action, suspence, and gore in mind, this movie doesn't quite cut it. 3/10.</fullReview>

But the production values are great, the acting is good. Milla and Michelle kick arse, look good doing it and they can act. It's a pity the only strong male character, the squad leader (name?) got sliced and diced. Oh and the CGI isn't top of the line, but who gives a rats, seeing the strings in Blakes 7, Dr who, Thunderbirds or the matte lines in the Star Wars never stopped anyone except the anal from enjoying them. I didn't even know what this film was about before i saw it, so i was rolling around on the floor in fits when i realised it was a zombie film, but i quickly composed myself and got into the swing of it and enjoyed it.Yeah, I liked it and there I stand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Umbrella is a powerful and evil corporation that is developing biological researches inside a highly technological and enormous underground base called The Hive. When a viral sabotage takes place, the Red Queen, a magnificent computer program that controls the Hive, goes homicidal and kills everybody inside by shutting its doors in order to not let the virus spread to the city above. A group of soldiers and experts are sent to The Hive with the mission of controlling the situation and rescuing possible survivors. What they find there is the result of the T-Virus outbreak: normal people turned into blood-thirsty zombies, and now escape from the Hive is the only thing they have to do.Terrific movie that recalls in many ways the George Romero classic Day of the Dead, a claustrophobic picture about scientists trying to endure a zombie attack inside an underground base. Resident Evil, however, is like an upgrade of Day of the Dead, with more action and better effects. Romero's flick was more brutal, but Resident Evil relies more in atmosphere and suspense. We never get to see gruesome deaths like in Day of the Dead(a gore fest!), and instead on focusing on grotesque scenes of people being eaten alive, director Paul Anderson wisely decided to give priority to the relationship between the survivors and their fight to escape alive from The Hive.Outstanding special effects and concepts(the idea of making the representation of the Red Queen as the hologram of a little girl was a touch of genius, scary as hell), surprisingly great and mysterious storyline that is unfolded correctly until the very end and brilliant performances from the cast help to consecrate this as the best horror flick of 2002. Milla Jovovich, giving the movie's best performance, comes out great in a part that really must have demanded a lot: she runs, jumps, fires guns and do everything that is expected from an action hero. I was impressed with her martial arts abilities, too. Resident Evil: a must-see for every horror fan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Wasn't That Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, for the good stuff. This movie wasn't that bad when I saw it for the first time in the theaters. Even though a lot of the characters... ok ALL of the characters, weren't the ones in the game, this movie does stay true to the plot with the Resident Evil video game. First they got the Mansion. Second they got the STARS Swat team. Third they got the zombies. Fourth they got the dogs. And last they got the Licker. Their object is to break into The Hive, which is a secret Umbrella facility deep underneathe the mansion, to investigate what the hell was going on in there. Oh did I forget to mention they're going to have Nemesis? So this movie does go little bit closer to the games, unlike Mario Bros the Movie, Street Fighter Live Action Movie, and the dreaded Final Fantasy: Spirits Within. The special effects were cool and well done, and the gore scenes were awesome!Ok now for the bad stuff. I'm going to talk about "some" of the things I thought needs improvement on. The make-up and special effects of the zombies were cool in the beginning of the movie, but some how they started to get dull throughout the rest. All of the zombie's make-up started to look the same, without any of the special effect features like the ones in the beginning...you know the zombies that had their eyeballs missing or the one with part of its face missing. The zombies later in the movie just looked like they've been hit in the face with some white powder to make them look pale and a pair of blurred contact lens. Spencer was the exception. Next, I kinda thought the little hologram girl started to get annoying throughout the movie. And last, they should of added more action scenes which takes place INSIDE the mansion, instead of having most of it in The Hive. This will make it seem more equivalent to the first Resident Evil game.7 out of 10</fullReview>

The gore was extremely tame, the plot was a mixture of the first and third games, (which in a way was good, however I did prefer the second game) the lead character was hot! The acting was alright, but the best parts of the movie were obviously copied from the other 'better' zombie movies of our time.

This junk has got to be the worst thing ever made since Death Race 2000, only Death Race 2000 is fun to watch because of its crappiness, this movie is not fun to watch because it is just so horribly, horribly bad!Ok, in the beginning they show a scene where some people get trapped in an elevator and a virus is released in an underground research facility. So far so could, this could lead to some pop corn action. Then we jump to a scene in a house out of nowhere where a naked lady lies in a bathtub. She gets up, gets dressed and walks around this empty house without saying a word for a few minutes. Hmm... interesting. Suddenly a cop comes along and yells get down before... hey.. a cop? out in the middle of nowhere? With absolutely no signs of danger at all? Oh well, anyway just after he and the chick "get down" a bunch of swat-like guys jump in through the window. Why the heck did they do that whe they could have just walked through the door and taken the unarmed girl without a problem?Apparently there is some sort of underground train beneath the house that the swat dudes need entrance too, and they take the girl and cop with them... apparently the girl works for them, but she doesn't know it. or something...On the train they find yet another dizzy character. Apparently he works for them too. And he is the chicks boyfriend... and he doesn't remember anything... or something...They step off at the research center and after a very long and boring house scene which makes absolutly no sense you finally get the feeling that something is about to happen. Well yeah, about half of the dudes die to a laser. Ok, cool... Then they have to disarm some kind of mainframe, because they got a feeling she is crazy. But in doing so, they release the virus into all halls of the research facility. Nice going guys! You just released a virus that turns all dead bodies into zombies! Better get out of there quick!! (or just restart the mainframe).However they find out to late, and zome (get it? zome?) zombie action occurs. Bite, screams, blood, gore. Probably the most entertaining scene in the movie, altough it isn't entertaining at all.Finally they decide to restart the mainframe in order to escape, and the mainframe leads them through some tunnels and airshafts through some really stupid and funny (unintentionally) scenes. Sometimes I thought it was supposed to be funny, because of the really, really excessive music and then suddenly... silence... Well, its wierd, and bad. And it goes on and on after that... you have to see it to understand how incredibly crappy it is. But instead spend your time on something else.For a very bad script, some very bad editing and directing, some very bad characters and acting (most of them anyway) and some zombie action I sum it all up to a 2... It almost deserves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** This may have some spoilers in it that I am not aware of so if you have not seen the movie, I suggest you don't read this. It's your risk if I spoil something for you. ***Number One. This movie is absolutely brilliant. I am not a fan of zombie movies because none of them have any character or try to do something new. This movie did. I am a very big fan of the Resident Evil games and this movie is so alike to the game but is not just a carbon copy of the games. I have noticed a couple of people have said that the movie has nothing to do with the games. Well, exactly. Would a movie which is exactly like the game be good? Mortal Kombat, Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy followed the games and look where they ended up... in the reject bin. This movie follows the same basic rules of Resident Evil (eg. creepy atmosphere, wonder, zombie, zombie dogs and eerie areas) yet shows you the absolute beginning of the T-Virus and how the city ends up being infected. If the directors copied exactly what happened in the games, I don't think it would have turned out the way it did.Number Two. Some people think the actors did a poor job. They have done a better job than some of the actors I've seen lately. They all act like they are supposed to. They are scared when zombies are approaching like they should be. Or if you were the actor, would you offer them a cup of hot chocolate, shake their hands and sing 'Kumbyah'. I don't think so. They act like a real person would in the same situation would do and thats all you should be asking for.Number Three. I recommend buying the DVD. It is so well done, the documentaries are awesome and at the same time suprizing. The commentary with Mila Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez is informative and very funny too. I have bought my copy. Have you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was actually expecting a lot worse. Reading the reviews so far, it seems as if the main criticisms of this movie come from two areas:1. Fans of the Resident Evil videogames complain that the plot and characters in the movie are different.2. Fans of George A. Romero's "Trilogy of the Dead" who complain that it's not up to the same standard as those films.Regarding the former group, I have played the games and was only really impressed with the first one. Furthermore, the weak plots of each successive game contradict elements of the previous one and use ridiculous plot-twists to try and keep things interesting, so I can see why they wanted a completely fresh story for the movie. Also, the characters of the game had the ridiculous faux-English names that are common in Japanese videogames.Regarding the latter group, I bought a copy of "Trilogy of the Dead" on DVD recently and I can't see what all the fuss is about. Night of the Living Dead is well below B-movie quality in terms of acting and plot (which is almost non-existent). The second movie similarly has a completely directionless plot and dreadful special effects.Resident Evil, by contrast, has everything you want in a film that pretends to be no more than simple Saturday night zombie horror movie: zombies, cool special effects (esp. the laser sequence), memorable action sequences, a sense of humour &amp; some semblance of a plot. Best served with take-away food and some cold alcoholic beverages.Come on, what were you expecting? Citizen Kane?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One would think Hollywood would have learned by now that transferring a video game to the big screen simply does not work. We've seen dissapointments ranging from dull (Final Fantasy, Tomb Radier) to utterly horrible (Mario Bros., Street Fighter). I will concede that I found the original Mortal Kombat somewhat entertaining. There is, however, absolutely no saving grace for this sorry excuse for a movie. The acting is bad, the story seems thrown together, and did I mention the acting was bad? Oh, I almost forgot, thanks to this movie, we now have a scientific explanation for zombies! Come on, Hollywood! I suppose next you'll tell us that The Force is really just a bunch of cells inside the body.If you want a good laugh, try to borror it from a friend who might have been tricked into buying this movie. Don't, I repeat DON'T spend the money to rent it. Its not THAT funny. 2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot understand why film makers take a source material that they think will make a good film, then take out everything that made it good in the first place. For the uninitiated, the original RE video game was a smash hit because it featured, for the most part, a lone character in a genuinely spooky mansion never knowing what unspeakable horror was round the next corner; it also had creepily atmospheric music and unfortunate voice acting. Sadly, the only element that has been retained for the film version is the last.Writer-director Anderson must take the blame, and one can only assume that a) he never actually saw the game; and b) he is so out of touch that he thinks if you like video games and horror, you must be a young, male, heavy metal fan. This mess begins and ends with lame attempts to have a not particularly talented supermodel appear on screen wearing as few clothes as possible. In between is the aforementioned metal cacophony, bad acting and uninspiring special effects. The tension that brought the game to life is completely lacking; the action is rarely involving; and the (very) occasional shock is not enough to compensate for the unintentional hilarity of Jovovich, clad in a fashion disaster, turning into an acrobat and wrenching zombie necks with her thighs.The scariest thing about it is that the sequel, as far as I know, is already in production - but if you avoid the bargain bins at your local rental outlet, you may be lucky and miss it altogether.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Deadly Virus. One Deadly Mistake. Umbrella corporations have accidentally released the deadly T Virus in their technological research center, The Hive. As it spreads through the many floors underground, people turn into savage flesh eating demons. Then we meet Alice. After being dragged down into the Hive, she faces horrible flashbacks of what has happened. With a special team,they must destroy the red queen- the super computer thats gone homicidal. An adrenaline pumping gore filled horror Shocker. ************************************************************************ So...Heres my comments. I have never played a Resident Evil game in my life, so i cannot tell you if it is anything like the Game. all i can say is, this is one pulse pounding horror movie with plenty of shocks and gore thrown in. I was on the edge of my seat. I cringed, I gasped, and when the film had finished...i was left feeling rather queasy. Milla Jovich was brilliant as Alice. the poor young woman dragged down into the hive and has to face flesh eating Zombies, Demon Dobermans and strange newt like creatures that reminded me of Abe from the Abe's Odyssey games. Soon, all the cast are being killed off. (3 are killed in a space of 2 minutes- really cool scene with lasers). Dont expect to much from this film. It was based on a game. Some of the acting was quite woody, But Milla Jovich and Michelle Rodriguez shone in the fast paced horror. Perfect entertainemnt for a saturday night. Definately not to be watched alone.....Keep the lights on and a cushion handy...and perhaps a sick bucket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having played all the games, I watched the movie with anticipation. No it doesn't follow the same script, but that's a good thing else it would have been a bit dull knowing what was about to happen. Yes the main characters have changed, but that aside all I can say is Oh My God! This movie is not just a gore fest; it's a brilliant one. The actors were good (not amazing got to admit) the plot line is fun and unlike most other game to movie conversions, this one is good. If you want a true to script game to movie film go and watch Tomb Raider and when you realise just how crap that is, you will understand why this was changed. Milla Jovovich is cool and yet still believable (golden rule in making a film) the special effects were well done (2nd golden rule, unlike {spit} Spiderman) and it includes slicing, dicing and liquidising of sub characters - about time someone had the balls to do it. The end result was more fun than a watching a live frog in a blender. If you like to watch gratuitous violence thats done in a fun fashion kind of way then there is no better, Can't wait for the sequel. Ignore the bitching and go and watch it to make you own mind up, you never know you may be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on the Playstation game, correct me if I'm wrong. Many films have been based on past video/console games, books, stage plays, fact-based experiences, etc. How or why is it that those concerned do not portray in the film that which is in whatever they got the idea from? Those books and games which have had films based on them have mostly failed, because the readers or players already anticipate how it will look in the movies, and then something comes along to make that image come true on screen, only to omit certain parts to the dismay of others.***SPOILER*** Well, Resident Evil tried and failed. The story is different, the characters are different, the ending is different, in fact the only similarity is the zombies and the cerebuses, though the latter were skin and bone. We have Alice instead of Jill Valentine, no Chris Redfield, no Wesker, no storyline where the elite crew investigate Bravo Squad, find their remains and are met by zombies, where only three of them then manage to flee to a nearby mansion.***SPOILER CONTINUES*** No huge poisonous spiders, some of whom, on explosion, release numerous little spiders that are venomous. No creepy monsters with razor-like claws, who emit a squeal when they leap. No clues, no upgrading of weapons along the way, and we have the 'licker' as the main T-Virus monster on the loose, when the licker is in RE2. Now I think they making a sequel with 'Nemesis', from RE3. There are more discrepancies, but that's enough. It's been messed up.Despite the above, I will look out for the sequel, to see how they bring over the Nemesis. But Resident Evil, for me, gets 5 out of 10. Oh boy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to the game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being raised on Resident Evil the video game back in 1997 and playing all three games in the actual series, not the Gamecube or Dreamcast crap, I can full heartedly say this movie is an insult to the game. You have to first realize the game Resident Evil was probably one of the most popular games ever, and it still is. The game even started its own genre called "survival horror", nothing made to date except Silent Hill is as good as the original, I just had to bring this out in order for you to understand my review.Why was this movie anticipated so much? Because people thought it would be based on their favorite video game, they were terribly wrong. Resident Evil is horribly cast, the acting is from a 'B' movie, none of the characters are interesting and none show any emotion or feelings. The script from the game was horribly twisted in that most of the material was new. The story is unsatisfying, it starts off bad and ends at the same place, it really doesn't go anywhere. The story begins in the famous mansion, which is only used for about five minutes where the girl wakes up. A special forces team crashes through the windows and takes her, and they go to the underground computer lab to retrive the virus. All the scientists have been turned into zombies, then about two or three of the SF team members escape. A horror movie is supose to scare you or give you a little jump or suprise here and then, Resident Evil does nothing.The biggest shock factor in the movie is that it resembles the game in almost no way, after being excited for about five or so years (that's a long time) I had huge expectations and was let down. This movie deserves a 1/10 and should have been burned after it was taken off the reel. This isn't missable, this is despicable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first of all i must admit that i am an avid resident evil player and was skeptic of this film at first, yet still anticipated its release.After walking out of the theatre i was astonished. I remembered the days when video games first came to the big screen. I remember the disapointment following such flops as Super Mario Bros., and Street Fighter. But then there was the satisfaction of Mortal Kombat (not the sequel which sucked hard core) and Final Fantasy: the spirts within.Resident Evil falls in line with Mortal Kombat. The origional story is kept in tact except for a few details that had to be added to make the movie work.I enjoyed the movie tremendously, in fact a few scenes totally creeped me out, just like the game does, while playing it alone, in a dark room with the volume turned way up. Although it will always be a trend setting classic, i believe that Resident evil is totally the Night of the living dead of the 2000's...there has not been a great zombie movie since then until now.Recommended to sci-fi fans and gamers alike, and if you haven't tried the game yet and liked the movie, i suggest you get with it. Both the game and the movie are edge of your seat fright fests that will definately get your heart racing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing another movie coming from a video game background, and not a gamer at all, I was expecting another lame-o video game adaptation. So my expectation wasn't very high. I was surprised at how much better it was. The plot was pretty straight forward, get in, get the job done and get out. But in most aspects of it, it held me at the edge of my seat for much of the movie.Not that it was perfect. The way the movie is laid out seem to follow a video game's strategy of conquering room by room, save the flashbacks, which slowly revealed the main characters' purpose. The different level of laser slicer served no purpose except if you are at the joystick yourself (a mechanism in which these people, who knew the ins and outs of the system, didn't know about.) We don't know how the sister was ever outside the compound.It seems to be a much better version of John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars, which I found to be an absolute bore.</fullReview>

The composing, The camera work and the creature creation were outstanding not to mention the acting and script were decent.The begining and ending of this film are symbolic to each other and are by far the best begining and ending sequences I have ever seen in a Film.

		<fullReview>As an avid fan of all the RE games, I eagerly anticipated this movie for years, and when it finally hit the cinemas, i was not disappointed.Paul Anderson both wrote and directed Resident Evil, and decided to make it pretty different from the games, which worried a lot of fans.He is however, introducing many of the games characters into the sequel in 2003.*review with SPOILERS*Resident Evil was slated by many critics, and its easy to see why. One look at the cast would put most critics off, because it is plain to see that Resident Evil was written and casted to be a COOL movie, not a well acted thriller. Simply put, it is the type of movie that the critics love to hammer.The first half hour of the film is all build up, getting more and more intense as Milla Jovovich wakes up in a mansion confused and without memory. Soon she is confronted with a crack military team, who explain that she is a security officer in the mansion, which is merely a front for the underground biological weapon research lab that lies beneath it...The crew along with Jovovich head down into the 'hive' to see what has gone wrong, and to shut down the 'Red Queen' (the automated computer which controls the hive). Needless to say, the place is crawling with zombies, and all hell breaks loose.The performances in each of the lead roles are solid enough, apart from Eric Mabius, who is a bit wooden. Milla Jovovich is surprisingly good in the role of Alice, and does well in the martial art-type action scenes.Paul Anderson has decided to make Resident Evil as much of an action movie as it is a horror, making it all the more entertaining, and while the jumpy moments and scares are second to none, with perfect timing and an excellent score by Marilyn Manson all adding to the effect, each of the action scenes - particularly the ones including the Hellhounds and the licker, are edge of the seat stuff.The finale of Resident Evil is a thriller and then some, with the remaining survivors trying to escape via a speeding underground train. We then see the unexpected return of the licker, which, after shredding Martin Crewes to pieces, is disposed of with great effect.Anderson also does a good job of presenting us with cliches, such as Michelle Rodriguez being so close to death, but getting the antidote to the virus at the last second - but then totally reverses them by allowing her to turn anyway. He also used the old, "unexpected survivor who returns at the end" ploy (Crewes), but then allows him to be obliterated unexpectedly as well, confirming to the viewer that no-one is safe.The last ten minutes of the movie are very, very impressive, with the final scene being so powerful, that it sets up the soon to come sequel perfectly...As with any movie, there are a few things that could have been better.The CGI effects on the licker in its earlier scenes could have been much better, but this was probably down to the budget.Also, a few more scenes where one or two zombies appear, and are quite easily disposed of would have been nice, instead of the mass hoards of them constantly flooding the rooms.All in all, Resident Evil is everything it was meant to be - a cool gory action horror, with a lot of death, and a few surprises too...Superb. - 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film, Resident Evil seemed to be good for what it was. It's commendable and deserves some fair recognition, as certain scenes from the film let the audience settle into it's mood quite well. If the movie weren't connected to a series, the narrative seems to work quite well as it is. HOWEVER... I found the movie somewhat disappointing in the sense that it DIDN'T remain true to the Resident Evil series. When the rumors first started circulating about the film being released, it was originally meant to stay with the original story in the games/books. As I saw the movie for the first time, I was shocked to see a totally different narrative which almost totally contradicted the beginning of the series. I'm pretty sure that if the film were to have stayed true to the original story, it would have been just as successful. Perhaps it might have been slightly less action-filled, but it still would have drawn some attention. Seeming that they've totally changed the story, I'd like to see what the sequel will be like (if any), as I'm positive that it definitely won't flow with the second installment of the original series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has a good idea, but wasn't nearly as good as it could've been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been anticipating the movie Resident Evil since I heard to was to be released back in 1998. At the time there were various directors and writers attached to the project, even George A. Romero -- The Master of Zombie Flicks. However, if you read Romero's script which appeared online, most would agree it was a quite corny script that had no real development.So finally I heard in 2001 that Paul Anderson, who directed Mortal Kombat (and did a good job at that) would write/direct the project. And it was finally released March 2002. So here are my thoughts on the flick. His ideas for cutting away from the game by introducing a new story was a good idea... to leave some surprises for the gamers and non-gamers. However there were many problems in his script. The story is good because it keeps close to the idea of the corrupt Umbrella Corporation. However, character development and dialogue are the two biggest things wrong with the movie. Though the cast is minimal, there are only two interesting characters in the entire film. Milla Jovovich plays the mysterious "Alice in Wonderland" character who can't remember her identity. As the movie progresses, we learn more about her character, but never the entire thing (I'm sure it'll be answered in the sequel). However the problem with Jovovich's character is though she's mysterious, she's not very interesting. The only other character in the film that was interesting was One (played by Colin Salmon). Colin Salmon kicks ass as the elite group's leader. His dialogue is very well written, too. He basically explains the entire situation of what has happened, which is good because Salmon has a great, bold voice. It's very unfortunate that this movie follows all the other roots of 'horror' flicks and kills off the token black character early. So before we can even embrace Salmon's character, he is dead (an incidentally, dies in the sickest &amp; coolest way possible).So with only one really interesting character who doesn't last long and another who isn't quite as interesting, this movie drags. However there is enough action-packed sequences in it to keep one entertained.OVERALL: 6 out of 10 (okay)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gotta admit, when I found out this movie was going to have nothing, at all, to do with the games, that's what scared me the most. Then, when I finally got a chance to see it, I was a little relieved. While it had nothing to do with the games, it really wasn't that bad. Truthfully, the movie didn't have to be call Resident Evil, they could have used some different names or other forms of viruses to get into humans, without calling them the G or T virus. The characters in this movie are also lacking some spirit. There are a few, I even admit, that were amazing though. Alice (Milla Jovoich), Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), and Chad Kaplan (Martin Crewes). These 3 really made the film really worth watching. I suggest if you like horror flicks, pick this up, it's one of the better ones in the last while. But, if you like zombie flicks I'd suggest first, Dawn of the Dead, and Night of the Living Dead, then watch this after them. well that's all. have a scary day</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For me, it was worth the wait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been waiting for this movie, ever since I saw it go into Green Light back in 1998. I read in Empire magazine the film was in the works, and who was the lead back then? None other than Sarah Michelle Gellar. Although it wasn't confirmed, I was thrilled to read the basic plot, as my brother got me playing the video games not long before I read the article.The film itself has connections to the game, but you don't need to play them all to understand it. The cast, which actually is made up of a few Brits, become likeable. Those who make it through the first 30 mins anyway. The few who meet their end in the laser hallway don't really have much dialogue, so it's not loss seeing them die. Milla (a good-looking actress, yet to prove she's anything more to me) is clearly totty for the lads. Lets face it, who on Earth wears a slinky dress like that when planning to stay in for the night!? Does she feel the cold?I didn't quite follow the absence of Jill Valentine, and instead the choice of naming the lead Alice... I may have missed something in the games there. I'll admit, I'm no whizz at playing them and staying alive.Back to the film. I found the zombie scenes pretty tense. Although it doesn't take much to get me biting my nails, you do want a few of the cast to live through the film, so the action scenes were both entertaining and scary. the scenes with the zombie dogs were great. Michelle Rodriguez and Martin Crewes aren't on their best form here, but I still liked their characters. Both their deaths come as a surprise. Arguably, Rodriguez's zombie-turn sucks. I wanted her to get through it all, but her death was cool. I wasn't overly keen on Eric Mabius. He's pretty wooden throughout the movie, and I wasn't too bothered if he was killed, or not. Although I am looking forward to the outcome of his bizzare arm incident in the sequel.The licker showdown at the end provides a few tense moments. It's not right to say the thing didn't look real, or convincing, because this is a film about zombies... I have no idea what the licker was all about, or if it is a reference to the games, but it keeps the action going when the crew are rid of zombies. Just as everyone is out fine, the thing appears and sees off one of the crew, while another turns into a zombie. The ending was slightly perky for a moment, so the re-appearance of the monster and two deaths is my kind of ending.The actual ending, with the Manson theme is excellent. From what I know, the ending was something similar to the opening in one of the Resident Evil video games. (I could really do with a trivia site to explain the links, or gaps between the film and the game. I get the feeling I haven't played all the Resident Evil games....)Generally I'm not too sure I'd tell anyone to see this. Some people aren't too keen on, or convinced by the whole zombie theme, or find action scenes annoying and loud, but I enjoyed the entire film. As for the kids who play the games.. (be honest, people younger than 15, or R-rated, I think it is in the States, play the video games) they'd probably love all the action. Like Tomb Raider, they might get bored with all the banter and explanations, but they'd get a kick from it... 9/10 from me.</fullReview>

What made "ALIEN" , "ALIENS" and "PREDATOR", good films ?, would it be fair to say, very good directors, all roughly at the beginning of their careers as well known directors, I think so, directors who know how to build tension, character, emotion, and manipulate special effects to accentuate those elements, of course, but we know somebody who cannot do those things, dont we ? I said I was'nt going to try and be a smart arse, and I did a bit, and I'm sorry, I'm also sorry that it appears a film ,which in the hands of a new, talented director, just breaking through, that did have the possibilty of rising above a gimmicky concept , and could have turned in something really good, but is now doomed to live out its miserable existence, in hacksville , is heading our way, what a shame !</fullReview>

A mad homicidal supercomputer watching everything through cameras. A heroine. A bunch of dumb people who get to wander off into the dark and do precisely the wrong thing at the wrong time to get killed. And one CGI monster who probably should have been used more from the beginning. **YAWN**Throw it all together and what do you have? In this case, a mess. When you're making something this derivative its all about the delivery, and this movie fails badly at building suspense, has laughable dialog, huge unexplained plot holes, unscary monsters, and a goofy pseudo-rock soundtrack that does little to cover up the movie's poor construction (reminiscent of John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars actually). Just a complete failure.See it only if you're 12, have beaten every console game you own, have finished your homework, taken out the garbage, and can't find any paint to watch dry. And for heaven's sake don't waste any hard earned allowance money on this dreck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lurid and misleading title aside, the whole point of this type of film is to be thrilling. Some thrillers try to be "meaningful" as well, with perhaps a social or political "message" behind all the action, but this one succeeds alright without such pretensions. The basic premise is that science, under the thumb of big business and government, has gone haywire, followed by plenty of fast action, shocking scenes and bare legs. There are elements clearly drawn from "2001: A Space Odyssey," married up with hokum from "Night of the Living Dead," but with a few original twists here and there. It is probably not a film for those who like to think much, but neither does it expect to be taken seriously. For example, what self-respecting female would feel properly dressed for a military action without first troweling on enough mascara and lipstick to choke a horse?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading some of the other comments on this movie, it appears that the voting comes down to this: either you thought it was awful, dumb, unoriginal, etc, or that the movie was actually better than expected. I fall into the latter category. I've never played the Resident Evil video games, so I really had no expectations for the movie. I just thought it might be interesting to see if they could make Resident Evil, the movie, better than Final Fantasy, the Movie (which was pretty disappointing). And surprise - it was much better than I expected. Somewhat predictable, but the action scenes were well done, the scares were pretty scary, and I didn't think the acting was bad at all. The movie worked for me. If you want some entertaining distraction for an evening, get a bag of popcorn and pop this movie into the DVD player - it's a fun movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i rented Resident Evil (RE) on dvd for $1 from the local non-chain video store and was pleasantly surprised. given that it's based on a video game, motifs, character development, themes, and symbolism were THANKFULLY absent. (taking two film classes at a time has truly ruined me.) so what i did expect was action, gore, and suspense. and i got it. several scenes made me jump. lasers have never been more menacing. of course, milla shone and michelle glowered. RE goes well with a thick comforter and a cozy couch in a pitch black room. if you've got time to get your analytical film buff noses out of the clouds, allow RE to tickle you with basic pleasures - skin (minimal sex, apologies) and scares.</fullReview>

The only thing I really found compelling was the beginnen. large desolate -clinical views on the house with milla waking up memoryless.These few scenes brought back images from the game, eery music beautiful scenery and suspense all over the place, what would be behind the next door, or the next? a monster? a zombie? nothing?Unfortunately, a swat-like team comes in, a computer mainframe is there (why??? I don't know it's as if it is put in without exploring the full potential for a screenplay -and believe me that computer mainframe had potential, the way it has been used ... it could have been left out)The swat team could have given some tension as in "the thing" or as in "NothLD" But they are finished of even before they can fire of a roundThe other missed opportunity is the dead. It becomes an "aliens"-meet-"notld" feast therefore killing all suspence and not just the living dead. I mean every dead person or animal is thrown at you (and the survivors)at the same time and -the makeup effects... where's Tom Savini when you need him, even the blue/grey painted ones from day of the dead were scarier,please what did they try to do, ger a PG rating? And the final monster? When you see it attack -was it milla's movie-husband?- it is suppose to sherd him to pieces .. you know .. some intestins here, a leg there... maybe the head a few feet from what should have been the rest of the body... but nooo ... just some ketchup around the waist ... and then the monster itself... shot as in stop-motion but really fuzzy as if the lenzes were out of focus...even king kong (1933) is more convincing than that!of course the scene where milla kicks that doberman from hell is brilliant and reminiscent to the matrix, nicely shot, +1 credit for milla ...I want to see her do that n... anyways :-P well milla is just as beautiful as ever...Of course I am going to have to view it on DVD or in the cinema ( I am not sure wheter it is to be released on DVD or in cinema in holland. Since the version I was was of bad quality, in good quality the film may have a better (greater?) impact on me and might even change my views on it, when it does, I'll post another comment to rectify this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, could've used a little more RE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before it came out when I first about the plot for the Resident Evil movie (Red Queen computer?) I was very disappointed. I probably wouldn't have gone to see it but the day before I was shipping off to Army Basic Training I went to the movies and they were showing RE and Blade II. I decided to watch RE and I was very pleasantly surprised. It's a really good movie despite some really stupid plot holes. My only little "gripe" with the movie was that it was action not horror unlike the games. Through the whole movie I felt kinda like "This has so little to do with the Resident Evil games". Then the guy says "I want him for the Nemesis project." and I'm thinking "Oh please, that's just cheap." But when it was over and I looked back on it, I loved every second of the fun-filled, action-packed ride. Milla and Michelle were both great. No one else really stood out too much (not at all saying they weren't great). I enjoyed the Red Queen more than I expected I would. And I must say the last scene just kicked major arse! Eagerly anticipating the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over one year passed since I first heard that the movie was being made and I've been waiting for it since then. Time passed once again after it was premiered, but I still didn't get to see it...until this oh-so happy day. And what do I have to say? 'twas a satisfactory experience. Terror of the undead is a pretty usual theme for horror movies. You've got Romero's groundbreaking Night, Day and Yawn...sorry, I meant Dawn. This, though, is the first horror movie that started from a game, the popular Resident Evil series. It seems to be a profitable deal to "inspire" yourself from games, but there is this other thing too. What do Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy and Resident Evil actually point out? The same that a number after a movie does: lack of imagination. A bit more 'obsessive' in the gaming world, but still very present in the cinematic affair as well. I am not against these "inspired" movies. As long as they're good, that is. Resident Evil, directed by Paul Anderson, nearly throws up the following storyline: In a top-secret underground facility a deadly (and terribly contaminating) virus is set free. The computer (Red Queen) closes all exists to the outside world, and all the employees (who till recently had worked for the Umbrella Corporation) are killed. But, actually, as you may imagine, they are not quite...dead.Umbrella sends a special agents team to clear up the mess, and set things as straight as possible. This team will actually be shattered in the underground laboratory by what they find there. The stench of death everywhere. Milla Jovovich is the leading actress in the movie - solid reason for avid movie goers to see this one- and she plays the role of a security agent, who works for Umbrella. Incidentally, she suffers a memory loss after she inhales a protection gas released by the Red Queen. We get to find out in the movie who she really is and what she was going to do.Michelle Rodriguez, Mr. Purefoy &amp; company all get together to do their acting tricks and they do them as well as they could've given the film. Now, as all fans of the RE series will say, this film totally sucked. I nearly subscribe. Only 'nearly' because it wasn't the excremental waste the second movie is (I was so naive in thinking it couldn't get any worse). Also, had there not been some very sloppy distribution of zombie actors and had Anderson at least been careful enough to do the simple things right, technically and chronologically speaking, then RE could've stood a chance. All Anderson does is fit in some cool moves, some cool zombie dogs, while leaving the rest of the film to rot. I consider his attitude extremely disgusting: why make a movie called Resident Evil if you don't want it to have anything to do with the game? (yeah, I know, money...it's meant to be rhetorical) It's as simple as this: the film doesn't do justice to the games. So even if RE can be a reasonably satisfactory sit-through, I am absolutely against what Anderson has done to the franchise, which simply wasn't his to ruin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never played any of the games as of yet, but if you're at all familiar with the games in any shape or form, you know what this is about.I have just a couple gripes with 'Resident Evil.' First, the games are hyped up to be truly scary in parts. In this regard, the movie clearly doesn't follow the games at all; creepy at times? yes, but scary? no. Also - there's blood and gore in this movie, but compared to what I expected after what I have heard from the games, I've seen more blood in a Disney flick. Third, there essentially is no plot. There's enough of a story to keep things moving along, but not very smoothly. Finally - a certain scene in 'Resident Evil' was all too clearly ripped straight out of the 1997 sci-fi movie 'Cube.' That the makers of 'Resident Evil' couldn't find anything original and had to outright copy another film is ludicrous.All in all though, despite a few flaws, this is still a highly entertaining action flick. Plus, the ending is such that I actually want to see the sequel...</fullReview>

All the other members of the cast we very good too :)*SPOILERS*..... The best thing about this movie is that it has no mercy with anybody!!! I mean we all thought that all the good guys, ALL of them were going to survive, WRONG!!! it's not like the classic movie where all the good guys survive or it has a happy ending, believe me, the ending is not happy at all!!*******Anyways I'm really looking forward to see Nemesis next year, I hope the Director can actually make Nemesis look real and scary..

		<fullReview>Personally I thought the movie was terrible. A complete disgrace to the game. It should have at least followed the game. I mean, here I am waiting for the plot from Resident Evil to begin and the movie has already moved on into what takes place in the second game. None of the characters had their own personalities and suddenly the people who couldn't remember a thing know everything. Not to mention that fact that they all magically have fighting skills and have flashbacks that leave the audience in confusion. It's as if you missed the begining of a great movie. Maybe some background info could have helped. I have played the game before and I was very dissapointed. The special effects could have been better (some of the monsters almost looked like very detailed cartoons). The only credit I can really give is to the Zombies who were portrayed very well. The movie could have been better, if the crew knew what they were doing. They should have assumed that not everyone in the audience would be fans of the game. They could have made a great movie and used it to sell the game. Hopefully the second installment will be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Game-to-Screen Adaptation EVER.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we think about movies that are based on video games, we think of watchable movies like Tomb Raider and Mortal Kombat (and MK Annihilation). We think about good movies (but horrible adaptations) like Final Fantasy. Most of all, we think about the crappiest movies to ever hit the big screen such as Super Mario Bros., Double Dragon, and Street Fighter. This explains why none of us expect Resident Evil to do justice to the game. How wrong we were.The adaptation was incredible. They don't use any of the characters from the game, but the story remains the same, basically. Milla Jovovich, the Fifth Element babe, teams up with the Fast and the Furious' Michelle Rodriguez as they try to escape an underground facility that's infested with zombies. I'm happy to say that the name of the corporation responsible is STILL Umbrella.The zombies were VERY well done, as were the dogs and lickers(?). The acting was also very good. The movie changed a lot of things, but I respect the fact that it kept the video game's story without filming the video game. That's a very hard thing to do.In short, don't ignore this movie for fear that it won't do the video game justice. It is one of the few game-to-screen adaptations that do.</fullReview>

The acting is marginal, but not too wooden. But my biggest complaint with the movie is the total lack of originality. Come on, dead people brought back to life, who seek human flesh?

		<shortDescription>From Dusk Till The Ghosts of Mars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" follows the all too familiar path of a couple other recent movies: "From Dusk Till Dawn" and "The Ghosts of Mars." All three start with an interesting plot but end up just being about zombies instead. (Or vampires. Or whatever.) It's as if in all three cases the writers got bored halfway through and said "Oh, heck. Let's just throw in some zombies." (Or vampires. Or whatever.)I don't mean to suggest that "Resident Evil" is terrible. It's okay. But the frustrating thing is that, like those other two movies, it could have been so much more.In fact, the initial plot is rather intriguing: We are set in a secret, underground facility where biological weapons are being created. But something has gone seriously wrong and the computer that controls the facility has started killing off the people who work there. Now an outside team must penetrate the facilities defenses and attempt to take control of the situation.And then...! And then...! Zombies!Milla Jovovich stars as a helpless female who needs protecting at first but soon becomes a tough chick with moves that would do Jackie Chan proud. Okay, her transformation is explained by a memory loss that is slowly regained, but it seems the producers wanted it both ways: Helpless and tough at the same time. Michelle Rodriguez is at least consistently the tough chick throughout. But her constant "I'm tough, get out of my way" routine gets old quickly.In fact, it is interesting that Rodriguez is second billed in this movie. This seems to be the case only because there was no one else to give second billing to. The male characters are all poorly drawn and very difficult to keep track of. I kept forgetting which one was supposed to be the bad guy.Sure, some of the action sequences will keep your interest. Milla's battle with some zombie dogs make the movie worth giving a chance if you have nothing better to do some evening. Still, the next time I decide to watch a zombie movie I think I will pick one that is a zombie movie all the way, and not one where the zombies were thrown in because the writers got bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8/10***Spoilers***Let's make this clear: I'm a huge fan of the video-game, I've played Resident Evil 1, 2, 3 &amp; the dissapointing Gun Survivor. So I was really looking forward to this one. Which falls on every common spot and/or cliche in horror movies, like only two survivors (the chick and the guy), a fast wipe out of the rescue team and the facility overtaken by the zombies. Alright, this time I'll let this one go 'cos it's just the same plot as the video game, which, OK, IS a bit dumb (Blame Capcom!). But I was anyway surprised--very-- by the directing. Paul W.S. Anderson has always been giving us only crappy work except perhaps for the mediocre Event Horizon, so aside the fact that I love the Videogame, he didn't do such a bad work. Specially when it comes to the environment, I mean specifically the blue and grey lighting which fitted really good in this very claustrophobic movie, and the filming location is a bit similar to those from the games. Which this movie gets close enough to, hopefully it will be even more faithful in the sequel, after all it's gonna have some characters from the games.So, basically this is the best...no... only good videogame to screen conversion to date. It is not as scary as other films, or even less then the VG, but this is probably due to the predictable nature of it.Minor stars, but good looking ones (don't get me wrong, I only have eyes for Milla Jovovich; hey, I even have a wallpaper from this movie with her on it) and perhaps with a bright future. But who knows.Anyway it has some good moments and is very well done for a budget that wasn't that big. I just liked it and recommend watching it with an open mind, specially if you're a die hard fan of the RE saga or a die hard fan of B movies.Yes, it's more flesh eating zombies vs (not that) good guys. Nothing new to the genre but nothing bad either.</fullReview>

So there for you don't find out what happens to Matt(Eric Mabius)Resident Evil wasn't horrible but wasn't great.If the Script was just a bit better then maybe it could have been great.But i do recomend Resident Evil just don't expect too much.Michelle Rodriguez and Milla Jovovich are the main reason to watch like i said before.I give Resident Evil 6/10It's a shame the way the movie turned out cause the Acting was good and Paul W.S. Anderson did a fine job directing.Let's hope the sequel comes out better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised. I'm a pretty big fan of the games (though I've only played 2, I've seen the others being played. Well, except one. Missed most of that one) and been waiting for this film for a while. But I was worried it'd be like other game-to-movie adaptations. Luckily, my fears were unfounded. Milla is in top form in this movie. I didn't catch her C's name but she was a good stand-in C for Jill. Though the hellhounds were a tad off, the rest was perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As common knowledge has it, Resident Evil is based on a computer game from the same name, which, due to its success, and Hollywood's last fashion of bringing to the big screen wether it is computer games or comic-book heroes, Was brought by competent director Paul W.S. Anderson into a gore filled film. As I stated before two probable reasons stand to explain why the computer game was transformed into a movie: First, as Resident Evil was one of the most profitable computer games ever, a movie adaptation wouldn't take very long. Second as lately many computer games (Mortal Combat) or Comic book heroes have a movie adaptation (X Men; Spider Man), Resident Evil - The Movie should be coming any time now. Frankly, I've never played the game before, although I've knowledge of it, which is why I know how the main story goes. Perhaps what is more noticeable is the sense of claustrofobia that not only the actors, but the viewer feel 2km underground. When we get into a movie like this, we already know, we're not going to see some masterpiece, the screenplay will not be something amazingly deep, but one can tell that was never the intention of the producers. Their intention was undoubtfully to suck the viewers in, make them jump, scream, sweat tremble, laugh and become frightned. If that was the intention, congratulations, you made it. Kudos, mainly to the Director. If the intention was some underlined one, like character development or story's depth, they failed. But as the intention was the first one, then Resident Evil, is one of the most enjoyable and job fulfilling movies recently. The cast is not exacly big stars, with the exception of Milla Jovovich, but that doesn't matter all that much because the movie was an enormous success, mainly because of the talent of increasingly rising young stars, like Michelle Rodriguez, James Purefoy and Eric Mabius. Finaly, what probabily shocked people the most was the completely opened end. That doesn't mean anything else than "sequel next year". B-movie? Yes. Funny? Sure Enjoying? Definetly! 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror movie to come out in the last 20 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have played and beaten all of the games even the one for gameboy the only one i haven't played is the gun survivor one. At the time that I saw the movie however I was a bit upset with the RE series I had just beaten Code Veronica X and was disappointed by the fact that is was just a 128-bit RE nothing really new and wasn't scary at all. But that aside I had seen the add for it and thought it might be mindless fun. I knew Paul Anderson was directing it and I had seen Event Horizon prior to this movie. I thought Event Horizon was decent and quite scary so with that and the fact that RE is a video game movie i wasn't expecting to much. Well wasn't I surprised because this is the best movie of 2002 yet and probably the most well made horror film since The Thing. The acting is well on and any bad actors seem to be killed in the beginning. SPOILER Like the two guys in the laser hall who has his fingers cut off and then the guy who is cut in half END SPOILER. Milla does a fine job granted she isn't given as big a roll as say Joan of Arc this time but she definitely does a better job here then in that movie. Not since ALIEN have I seen a film with so much atmosphere which is definitely helped by the score by Marilyn Manson.Clearly Paul Anderson was the right way to go, had Romero done this it would have been a movie that went into the true evils of the Umbrella Corp. Also Anderson seems to know more about RE then even someone like me even the train that they ride on is identical to the one in 2 (it says ALEXI 3000 or something in the front of the train). The only real problem is some clear cut exposition in the intro and a bit in the beginning but as the s?*! starts to hit the fan there is no more explaining.I can't recommed a better modern horror movie the production values are amazing. Granted maybe my understanding of the game helps me like this movie so much which by the way is very faithful to the game even if there are different characters. Great Movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off i think that the critics were very harsh on there comments of this film. Half of these so called critics probably havn't even heard of the 'Resident Evil' franchise and therefore their comments really dont have any effects to my view on the film.Ok, so it wasnt exactly an award winning film but it still had enough ingredients to make me want to see it again, and buy it on DVD. Milla Jovovich was quite good as Alice though i did find i couldnt really bond to her as the main character to well. Michelle Rodgriguez on the other hand was very impressive as the hard-ass Rain, her performance was only marred by the harsh fact that she probably is too young to be in an elite special force??? - but apart from that she was great! Eric Mabius (Matt), Martin Crewes (Kaplan) and Colin Salmon (One) were all good as supporting cast!The films special effects are brilliant and director Paul Anderson uses his imagination well to build a story around the resident evil game. It's a shame we didn't get to see more of the mansion in which Resident Evil is known and loved for. The twisted metal music score is excellent to this film and Marilyn Manson must be applauded in the way he handled the high tense scenes within this movie.Resident Evil: Nemesis is in the pipeline for 2003 and hopefully it will have the same pleasing effect as this film did. It will also be nice to see some familiar looking characters be introduced into the sequal i.e. Albert Wesker!!A great film - 8/10</fullReview>

Commenting with him is the producer, Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez. I have never laughed so hard while watching commentary before in my life. There are gaps in the commentary where no one says anything and then in a rush everyone starts talking over one another, but that is part of what I liked about it.

		<shortDescription>A really good horror/action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was ever a video game that deserved the big screen treatment, it is Resident Evil. I have always been a fan of the game, so I had eagerly anticipated this film. I really like this movie, even though it does stray away from the game's story line a little.One of my favorite things about this movie is that it doesn't follow the rules set by normal horror films. In most movies you can normally figure out who is going to die. This movie is shocking in how fast it kills off main characters. I will not go into details for those who have not seen the film yet, but I could not believe that a few of those characters fought through such adversity, only to be killed off a few minutes later. It really keeps you on your toes.The movie flows at a substantial pace, and never really gets boring. I hate movies that rush out the gate, and then crawl to the finish line. The special effects are great, and I love the casting. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are fantastic. I will admit that I wish you could see more of Jovovich naked. If only those stinking paper towels would fall at the end!Bottom line: If you liked the game, you will like the film. If you have never played the game,you probably will still like the film. It is just really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest commentary I have ever heard!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, first off, the movie was ... well, yawn. I actually was fighting sleep watching this one late at night with my little brother, even though it is supposed to be an action film. Some call it horror (wrong), sci-fi (um, maybe). I can't believe how uninvolved I was in the movie; plus, the plot was incoherent -- if there was one really.That being said, one of the coolest ways to die: being cut into bits by a killer laser run by a computer which is set on High Defense with an evil child alter ego. Now, that's the way I'd like to go. It's just too outstanding and sinister to not comment on this.The commentary by the creators and actors: by far, one of the funniest things I have ever heard in my life. Basically, it's these two quite dry British guys (director and producer) trying to make some noteworthy comments on the making of the film, with the two girls (Milla and Michelle) making fun of them, laughing uproarously, and telling fart jokes. Milla was the silliest of all, but totally hilarious. From the beginning, she starts off doing impersonations and voices, then brushes aside one of the first comments on the grading of the colors in the flashbacks by the director by saying, basically: Who cares about that? No one is going to care about the grading... Did everyone just see my nipple shot?! Haha! Also, I should note (maybe it will help them make more money and sell more DVDs), the girls mention several times throughout the commentary how hot they think each other are. Both of them have a laughter and demeanor that is so infectious you can't help (sometimes despite yourself) but laugh right along with them and just have a great time. Highly recommended commentary.Just average movie: 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool idea, but poorly executed. The script is boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic idea for this movie is pretty cool, and visually the movie is engaging. Unfortunately, it looks like they spent all their money on visual effects and creating a cool look, and nothing on the script. One of the basic rules of story telling is show, don't tell. Most of scenes involve the characters standing around explaining to each other (i.e. explaining to us in the audience) what is happening. This makes the story move incredibly slow.The most interesting part of the story is how Alice (Milla Jovovich) has lost her memory. She knows that she's directly involved somehow, but doesn't know what she's done. Unfortunately she never reveals much about herself, so we don't get to know her enough to care about her. There are a couple of very awkward partial nude scenes that look painfully like the producers wanted to show Jovovich naked and she wouldn't play ball.This one really isn't worth the effort. The action scenes are few and far between, and aren't very well done. The story is so painfully slow that it seems to take forever to get started, and never really delivers enough energy to put you on the edge of your seat. It's really a shame because there are some very cool plot elements to the story, but it's just so poorly written that you're left wondering what this movie could have been if it had been given to a capable writer.</fullReview>

The worst part is probably the script. Many of the lines would seem stupid even in the video game that it is based on. Furthermore the exposition scenes are handled with the subtleness of a high-school student film. Anderson "borrows" liberally from much better movies such as the classic Romero "Dead" trilogy. If this movie does nothing else, it should prove that Paul Anderson should never be allowed on a movie set ever again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been a few video games that have gone into the movie industry. Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, and Resident Evil are three of them. And for me, I thought Paul Anderson did an excellent job taking Resident Evil the game to Resident Evil the movie. Although the story of this movie is different from any video game, that's what makes it great. Every Resident Evil video game has had a different story line to it, and the movie is no exception. I rated this movie a nine because for me it's something that I can watch over and over again. Although the movie does have some parts that can seem unbelievable such as the zombies and the creatures trying to eat you, the story of how the creatures were formed with the virus, makes it almost believable that some corporation somewhere in the world might be doing something such as this. All in all, Resident Evil is a movie that you have to get caught up in to understand, and it will definitely make you jump about every 10 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a zombie film fan, resident evil sent me wondering whether or not it would be possible to combine the unique atmosphere of the 1968 classic "Night of the Living Dead" with the intense action and suspence from the video game. And let me put it this way; finally someone took over where Romero left off!The movie has been put together in a way, so that it never, at any time, seems to drag. All scenes, from the very first, to the, somewhat expectable ending, slithers on in a creepy pace, that really revives the feeling I had the first time I saw NotLD.As for acting, Milla Jovovich does her part well, but not the biggest challenge she's ever had.All in all, this is a new generation of zombie films, and I can't wait till "Resident Evil 2 : Nemesis" comes out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>big budget zombie adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Video game makers are mostly influenced by classic stories to give their games shape. So, it's no wonder that RESIDENT EVIL has lots of hints to and ideas taken from for example Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD. I would even dare to mention that there wouldn't be a RESIDENT EVIL if Romero didn't make his zombie trilogy! But also new films are recognized in some scenes, like for example the scene with the lazer beams is totally taken from THE CUBE (which was pretty good by the way). RE has a bit more action over the whole line, but doesn't have the psychology that goes on in Romero films, neither does it create a tension or a feel with the characters. It also doesn't have the gore that zombie films supposed to have. The effects are smooth, yet there's not much blood spilled for a zombie flick. Best example from this is the first scene in the elevator: we don't see her head fall off. Through the whole movie you are waiting for something to come, they try to build up tension and you are left behind with nothing. The plot (thank you Romero) tries to be high-tech, but it's obvious it's just dragged into the film for little reason, but to give us a falls feeling of intelligent action. RESIDENT EVIL was a total let down and was even worse then I expected. And then I'm not even talking about the killer bunny...--- FOR GAMERS ONLY ---</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My comments there isn't exactly SPOILLERS but you was advised.The basic plot-line is a great corporation has been developed a new virus and an "accident" occurs and the virus is free. The computer to avoid the virus spread, kill everyone in the base and there are only two survivors. A elite team is send to the installation and verify "what a hell is going on" and switch off the computer (because the computer kill everyone in the base of course). Well, the problems started because the computer dislike of the idea to be switch off, but this is only the beginning. The tone of the movie is Gothic and a little creepy and has a touch of "matrix". I explain, there is a sequence where the character of the Milla Jovovich kill some "DOGS" and a normal person NEVER does this things.These comments are enough to get a good idea of the movie, the actors works well, specially Milla, the special effects are very good. The some actions scenes are fast and brutal others has a creepy tone but are well worked. Ok, the script could be a little more elaborate but is good enough for this kind of movie. But there is an important thing, the end of movie is consistent with the basic background of the movie.In my opinion if you see this movie you will have a good time :).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil is not a horror film. It is a zombie flick. And it is based on the intriguing idea behind a video game.With this in mind, I rented the movie with my best friend. After hours of having sat behind my boyfriend in boredom while he played Resident Evil on Dreamcast, I wasn't expecting much. However, as several other reviewers have said, this was a welcome surprise.Milla Jovovich is more than adequate as a heroine, and the plot thickens as is appropriate for an action flick. What works in the movie's favor is that it actually feels like a video game. There is atmosphere and pressure, thumping climactic music, zero character development, dialogue pared down to the essentials, lots of shooting, lots of action, lots of locations, lots of zombies... all the comforts of Playstation, without having to move your thumb!What genuinely moved me was the direction of this movie. The truly artful aspects of cinematography, sound, music, atmosphere, mist, slow pans... everything contributed to the sensory experience. Nice job. It's not Mozart, but it'll do. Break out the popcorn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most stunning, well done movies I have EVER watched. I love the featurs in the film, they were simplying breathtaking. Yeah sure some people might be disappointed that the characters dont relate to the game, but who cares? Why watch the same old story from before with the same characters we already know a ton about? This new unique characters keep you hanging on whats gonig to happen next with the all important T-Virus that all us gamers know about.The Actors deliver a stunning performance for a fairly decent casting job. Michelle Rodriguez (Rain) and Milla Jovovich (Alice) are both awesome in this film. But I really admired the performances by Martin Crewes (Kaplan) and Eric Mabius (Matt). Martin Crewes should have a really good career in front of him, and it looks as Eric will be back for the second film. Besides that you had James Purefoy who also had a decent performance. But The Casting was just a little of how aweosme the film was.Now I'm not going to spoil the film for those of you who havent saw it so I really cant take about some of the kick ass things involved with the film. Your going to hear alot of rememberable quotes from both the Red Queen, Kaplan, and Michelle Rodriguez. I gave this movie a perfect 10, and I wouldn't give many movies an 8 let alone a 10. But this movie really deserved it. Paul Anderson is definatly a good director.Rent, Buy, What? You ask this qusetion, this movie is a definate must see. I bought the movie the second day it was out, after already watching it 2 times, and I've probably wasted the last week or two of my life away watching this film over and over. Id say ive watched it a goo 20 times. So even if you dont like the general thriller, this movie is for you. Its packed with action as well and has a few "scary jumps" along the way!

The characters weren't developed very well but you kinda got a hang of who they wre into the movie due to the flash backs. All around it was an alright movie. It was worth seeing. Don't rent this movie just to see Milla Jovovich naked. Its not worth it. The ending does leave open for a sequel which they will start filming this year I hear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The View of an Independent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I refer to this review as "the view of an independent" for the following reasons: a) Although I have played the game, I was never particularly good at it and lost interest in it before I got anywhere near completing it. This is not because it was a bad game, indeed, I thought it was a very good game, it just happens I'm not real big on computer games. b) I'm not a die-hard Milla Jovovich fan, who's likely to applaud her performance no matter what. c) I'm not a self-proclaimed officiado of the horror genre, unlike some other commentators.To put it another way, you're going to get a broad-based and un-biased opinion from me, not weighed down by any nerdy loyalty to horror films, the computer game or Jovovich's hot body!When I went to see this film I must say I was pretty sceptical. I'm not a big fan of films based on computer games and thought 'Mortal Kombat' (also by Paul Anderson) was a pretty good justification for this, but my friend and I were in a funny mood and thought that the film would probably be, at least, amusing in a comically gory kind of way and before we went in I did in fact say "this will probably be crap".I was pleasantly surprised.The crux of the film is that a deadly virus is released in a top secret underground lab, called The Hive, belonging to the corrupt Umbrella Corp. Fans of the game will be familiar with the details. Basically, the Red Queen, a super-computer and the state-of-the-art in A.I., goes "homicidal" and kills everyone in the Hive.This opening scene is brilliant and sets the tone for the rest of the film. Anderson has opted for a much different style than he presented in 'Event Horizon' (another rather good film), as he presents us with a world that is sleek and stylish, almost clinical. It becomes clear at this point that the virus has been released deliberately but for what purpose and by whom, we are left in the dark, for now.After the excellent opening sequence (during which it becomes immediately obvious that the soundtrack is going to be brilliant) we move on to the more familiar setting of the famous Mansion, the emergency entrance into the Hive. Already Milla Jovovich turns up naked, although this is shot well and manages to not seem too gratuitous. Meanwhile the Umbrella Corp. has dispatched a special-ops unit, armed to the teeth, to investigate the strange goings on down in the Hive and to establish why the Red Queen killed everyone. Leading this predictable band of gun-toting rogues is Britain's own Colin Salmon, of the most recent Bond films fame. Salmon offers a good performance and his distinct vocal talents lend themselves well to a seamless American accent.There is also a good performance from back-up babe Michelle Rodriguez, playing, as others have said, a "Lara Croft wannabe". Rodriguez gives a good, solid performance, although it does rather harken back to Vasquez from 'Aliens', while not quite managing to recreate the unique appeal of that character. The rest of the characters, sadly, are rather non-descript, especially James Purefoy, who plays Jovovich's love-interest and Eric Mabius. You'll be lucky if you can remember the names of half the characters in this film and when you leave the cinema you will be referring to them as "the black guy" and "the one that got eaten near the beginning", etc. Some people have criticised this lack of character development, stating that, feeling little empathy for these two-dimensional cardboard cut-outs, you don't care whether the characters live or die. However, I would argue that this is an asset, as it means you can sit happily for an hour or so, watching people get torn to shreds by zombies and not feel too conflicted. The only other character for whom there is a touch of empathy is that of Kaplan (Martin Crewes) who spends practically the entire film "about to die any minute" and you'll be willing him to live throughout!So Jovovich, wearing a delightfully skimpy outfit, and this motley crew of ramshackle desperados delve deep into the Hive to confront a psychotic super-computer, hundreds of flesh-eating zombies and a giant mutant creature with a long, razor-sharp tongue. What ensues is plenty of gun fire and Jovovich ass-kicking. All in all it's pretty entertaining stuff, well shot and well lit, with an excellent soundtrack (kudos to Marilyn Manson, the absence of whose whining lyrics provides proof that he actually has some talent). Don't expect Oscar performances from any of the cast, although I always think the lack of A-list talent, minus one to put on the billboards, is an asset for any film! Just expect a range of non-entities, ready to get hacked to bits one by one, led by a couple of sexy, well-armed babes in knee-high rubber boots!The film is of good quality, although die-hard fans of the horror genre will be comparing it to 'Night of the Living Dead', etc. This is a very different type of zombie film and comparison should be taken with a pinch of salt. The film is faithful to the game, while, thankfully, keeping the zest without merely recycling what we've already seen. There is plenty of gore but not so much that your left reeling by the sickening stupidity of it all! And of course there's Milla, whose naked scenes, as I said before, are tastefully done but are still present for the blatant purpose of keeping the lads' duel lust for violence and "booty" satisfied. The dialogue has some pretty awful cliches, as is to be expected from this genre, but on the whole it's of a better standard than I've come to expect from horror films.Finally a round of applause for young Michaela Dicker, the voice of the Red Queen. Inevitably, the Red Queen has been compared to HAL but God only knows why because, apart from both being homicidal super-computers, they bare absolutely no comparison. Apart from one - the key to the success of both as 'characters' is the fact that they're not so much "frightening" as they are "disconcerting". In the case of HAL, it was his blatant homo-eroticism, in the case of the Red Queen it's the fact that she's modeled on a little girl, the head programmer's daughter we're told. The sound of a girl, who can't be much older than eight or nine, explaining why it was necessary to kill everyone in the Hive is deeply disturbing and Dicker delivers, by far, some of the most memorable quotes from the film, including: "you're all going to die down here!" and "I've been a bad, bad girl."This really is a blokes' film, the kind you'd go see with your mates rather than your girlfriend. It all raps up nicely for a sequel (Resident Evil: Nemesis already in the pipeline) so watch this space.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, I've read the other reviews and I agree...Super Mario Bros, Double Dragon, Street Fighter...any movie that is based on a video game has killed itself before it's even been released. I am a big fan of the RE games, but honestly was not too thrilled to see this when it came out in theaters b\c of the above facts. To me, there was no way that anyone could come close to translating that game into a good movie. So, when this hit the video stores, it was 'the hot' dvd for the time being, so I indulged myself and bought it for the heck of it. Man, was I pleasantly surprised!First off, I agree with 99% of the other negative reviews on what was negative about this movie...wooden characters, little to no character development, cheesy CGI at the end, etc. But despite these annoyances, I couldn't help but admire this movie. I mean, this movie defines how atmosphere should play a huge role in any movie. The Hive is filmed as a dark and spooky place, grim and bleak from the sudden loss of life of the Umbrella employees. Paul Anderson once again, like in Event Horizon, concentrated all of his efforts on atmosphere and direction and it shows. Like the story, this movie really makes everything feel like a dream, like you've just woken up from a strange dream into a weird type of Alice in Wonderland nightmare. Marilyn Manson did an excellent job with the score, it is appropriately creepy and gives a feeling of both naivety and desperation.As for scares, there are a few, but the surprises far outweigh the frights which is actually good in this case. I liked how everything was going on in the beginning and you really don't know what's going on until 30 minutes into it, and Milla Jovovich finally asks what we're all wanting to know. This is just not a conventional action/horror flick at all. It offers a big factor of unpredictability, and not just cheap plot twists that make no sense, but instead, real human reactions if this were really to happen in real life. Though the characters were underdeveloped, their expressions fit their roles. Milla looks incredibly hot, especially at the beginning and the end. She always has this innocent look on her face like she knows something noone else does that totally goes with the movie. Michelle Rodriguez, though cliched (I think this badass woman thing started with James Cameron's masterpiece, Aliens) really convinced me that her character, Rain, was truly a take no prisoners, show no fear, take no crap soldier especially when she's fighting. Both women make the movie, period. The others, well, are just there as zombie fodder, though a lot of the deaths were totally unexpected (not so much who would survive, but when said people would buy the farm). With this in mind though, I will agree with some other reviewers that there weren't enough zombie deaths, nor gunfights (if you think about it, these commandos really did not bring very much ammunition, nor did they think about picking up their fallen camarades' gear) for a zombie flick, but like I said earlier, this one is very untraditional.This movie really stays true to the game, which is as unpredictable as they come. Anderson even pays homeage to it by using some of the same camera angles (die hard fans will love them). And the scene with the attack dogs was refreshing since it was done without CGI. The direction is solid. Enough said.All in all this is a good movie. It has a great beginning (that will give you chills down your spine) that literally keeps you glued to the screen, and a slightly weaker second half that delivers as well. Milla and the atmosphere alone are worth the price of viewing. This is one of the better horror films to come out in the last ten years. I give it a solid 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of videogames in general, but I never liked the Resident Evil series because of the ridiculously bad controls, terrible voice acting and story sequences, extremely silly puzzles and lack of realism (why can't I just jump over the car blocking my path? Why can't I shoot open this simple locker with my shotgun? Why don't the people I meet stay with me to increase our odds of survival?) But I knew that RE the movie, being made by Hollywood people, had a pretty good chance of being good, since the premise of the RE movies is better suited for movies than that of other videogames. Hate Hollywood all you want, mock their predictable plot twists and cliched characters, but you haven't been exposed to the horror that is videogame storylines and acting, written by some dorky twenty-something japanese programmer who thinks he did a good job emulating american zombie B-movies, but bless his heart, has failed miserably. Ignorance is bliss, as they say.The storyline is well-presented. Since at the beginning of the movie Milla's character is suffering from temporary memory loss, this gives the movie an excuse to explain to you the how and why's. Basically, it's about a rescue team trying to find out why the computer AI of an underground secret military research facility has gone haywire and killed off everyone. I won't say any more, but trust me, it's good.It grips you from beginning to end because like I said, you're seeing things from Milla's perspective. It does a very good giving you the "they/we're all gonna die!" feeling. The action scenes are so-so, it's the ambiance that makes the movie. The haunting soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard, and complements the movie perfectly. Kudos to the composer.The exciting ending does a great job at making you want to know what will happen next. Don't worry, it's not tacked on to make way for a sequel, it actually falls in line with the rest of the movie. I didn't watch RE1 in the theaters because I thought it was gonna suck, but I'll be standing in line at the ticket counter when RE2: Nemesis rolls around.8/10</fullReview>

But then when the Commando's went down to investigate the hive, yo start seeing everything.. IT'S A ZOMBIE MOVIE, this is only because I have never played the game.

		<fullReview>First of all...I cant wait for the sequel, which is due ot be released next year! I watch the film last night before I went to bed and I must admit: I think the film IS fantastic! I loved it. The film kept to the atmosphere and world of Resident Evil completely well - especially the ending of a film showing the dead city. The sets were great and kept the look of the game. It shows a good story based before the first Resident Evil, which doesnt even show how the Umbrella mansion had a biohazard. The action was non-stop and great throughout the film, I think the Licker 'Hunter' was great and pretty vicously cool! One bad mother f***er in my opinion HeHe! It was VERY good entertainment as it is NOT very easy turning games into movies these days. The only last one was Mortal Kombat, not Annihilation; also directed by Paul Anderson so I think he made a good achievement. My only complaint is that I wished Michelle Rodriguez's character survived! I hope that Paul does just as well with RE2: Nemesis. I rate this 9 outta 10! Don't expect it to be Oscar or this Millennium's great film, its a Blockbuster for the summer and great entertainment; no cheesy Milla Jovovich 'taking on the entire zombie nation on her own' crap. The film was great as its not often you see a great zombie flick. I wonder who will be playing Jill Valentine? And I hope that Milla stays on to play Alice.There is one spoiler though...mainly about the game. In both the game and film, it states: when bitten by a zombie, you are infected. Yet in the game you never turn into a zombie or have time to find an anti-dote for the virus. It would make the game harder but more interesting and true to the zombie transformation. Anyway give the film a go whether or not you have played the games. Its a memorable action film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD***First things first, let me get a few things off my chest from the get-go about common complaints I keep hearing about the movie:Common Complaint #1: No plot - B.S. Pay attention and you'll find one. T-Virus is released intentionally by someone, so they can get away scot-free with the virus and anti-virus without witnesses, for profit of course to those lazy reviewers like Richard Roeper who think the whole thing is pointless. Umbrella's (not the military) special forces team, resembling Hunk's team in RE2 for those familiar with the game, infiltrate the Hive lab to find out why the lab's super computer Red Queen sealed it shut, only to find that the researchers have been mutated into the living dead. Amnesia for two characters begins to wear off later in the film, revealing their true intentions and a few cool plot twists. For an even deeper story with even more interesting revelations and characters, play the games.Common Complaint #2: The Licker - the Licker is created by injecting a virus-riddled zombie with the T-Virus (in the game) or, as the movie puts it, injecting the virus into living tissue. It's an unstable experiment, because the Licker grows stronger and mutates after killing prey and ingesting fresh DNA. So all in all the licker isn't just a random monster used for the purpose of there being a monster. And the Licker is not a rip-off of the Xenomorphs of Aliens. They appear in the game exactly as they do in the movie, so any plagiarism complaint you may have should be directed towards the game's makers, not Anderson. Also, the movie's budget was a mere $40 million, a relatively small amount compared to most blockbusters. I'm sure with a bigger budget, the licker would've looked much better.Common Complaint #3: Undeveloped characters - if you're still reading and haven't seen the movie, this is your last chance to look away. Anyway, the only reason I see why the characters weren't developed is because the majority of them die off very quickly. The ones that remain though, I had no problem getting involved with them. I liked them all, and I especially liked the Kaplan character, as he evolves from a scared little "rabbit" so to speak into a formidable butt kicker by the end.Common Complaint #4: The script - get over it. This isn't the worse one out there, so all those who say it's so bad should read a Friday The 13th screenplay and get back to me later.Common Complaint #5: Paul W.S. Anderson - is an awesome director. Those of you who don't like his movies shouldn't blame his directing ability. It's his screenwriting ability that's somewhat lacking. His directing is top notch, with flashbacks interspersed wonderfully with the present scenes, kinetic action sequences that would put most directors to shame, and an extremely talented eye for detail. Rarely is it the case the directing that brings a movie down: most often than not, it's the script.Hope I've addressed all the complaints. Anyway, I give this flick a solid 8/10; one of my faves of 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm biased by best games. This is definitely not the best one. Doom has more gore and blood, Halflife has more sense, Red Faction has more story, Wolfenstein is more dynamic. I found myself yawning after "hell unleashed". Don't buy it - this is hardly worth rental fee.Such story requires dynamics and at least sympathy for heroes - I felt none. Jumpy episodes and loosely coupled at that are somewhat frustrating - like tasteless food. Suspense is pushed on you (but misses target - it's too thin) - and dissipates before you even start to feel it. Mix of Aliens, Matrix and Living Dead - maybe too many ingredients? Or Robocop with Terminator are missing?The only good thing I can remember - some of the effects. Computer ones. Pity - not enough to make remarkable scenes. Not enough for remarkable game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil could have been better if it would have just simplified things a bit by taking out half of the 'cool' plot devices and focused more on the zombies and a little thing I like to call character devel- opment. Just trying to remember all of the babble that was thrown at me during this film gives me a headache. Let's see, there's a blue virus, a green anti-virus, some zombies that turn you into a zombie when they bite you, an extremely HAL-like computer called the Red Queen who has a holographic representation of itself that looks like the daughter of the company president, two characters who have lost their memory and have many flashbacks, a laughably bad CGI monster who gets stronger with each kill, a mansion that serves as the emergency entrance to the Hive, lasers, circuit breakers, blah blah blah. We also get a bunch of juvenile boo scares right out of a Jason movie, multiple fake-outs, and an ending that hints at a sequel. Honestly, though, the zombies were cool, and everything seemed just like the Resident Evil games (we even get shots that look like intros to the 'next level' as it were) and the scene with the lasers was satisfingly gross. However, the cast pretty much stunk, and I didn't care about any of them when they were either eaten/crushed/shot. I guess if you like the games there might be some stuff here for you, but don't expect genius here. */****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil was about as good as could be expected from a video game genre. The idea of having a Resident Evil movie was really exciting to me as a lover of Resident Evil 2's action and horror elements. The movie adapted these elements fairly well with movie style and the video game's idea. However, there was something about it that left you wanting maybe a little MORE of the video game's magic. Maybe more blood. Maybe more surprises. I personally think the 2nd one will be much better. That is if it picks up where the first left off. Because I loved walking through that alley and being freaked out by the things that would pop up. Most of them were zombies but some of them were dogs and assorted evils. But anyway, you get the idea. It was Resident Evil alright, but like Diet Resident Evil. Or Resident Evil Light. It wasn't as filling as the game, plain and simply.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Biggest problem of course is... it's based off a video game. Which has good excuse to borrow ideas from others. Not to mention... there's like this skip forward. So your scratching your head trying to figure out how this one dude and Milla got back to the main group. o_O Had to backup the dvd and still can't figure it out.Two things come to mind when watching the movie however. Evil Dead &amp; The Stand. Combine those two things together and what have you got?(SPOILER)One thing though I can't get past. As usual, Milla provides a rather wooden &amp; Stiff portrayal of her character. Now perhaps fits this particular character, but not always (The Messenger). Michelle Rodrigez is pretty damn good in this movie though. We've got to get her into more movies.And of course this movie, like the X-Men was built as a vehicle. It's more than obvious that this movie is set up in such a way that a sequel can't be that far away. Though I really can't figure out why. lol(Which as I see here.... Resident Evil : Nemesis is coming out next year.

		<fullReview>As most people who saw this movie, I am a huge fan of the game! Now, in a video game, it's okay to have puzzles and power-ups and going from one room to another and getting a headache from all the damn searching.When news came that the movie was coming out boy was I excited. Rumors went around that it would take place in the mansion throughout and like the game, take you down into the labs. Thinking it over, that would've made the movie stupid. Think about it. Going from room to room to room searching for a puzzle piece to move that fireplace blocking the extra ammo. That is stupid!!!! But taking place in the Hive itself...there ya go! Reading some reviews people are complaining about the lack of puzzles and herbs. Okay there WAS a puzzle in the movie!!!!SPOILER!When Kaplan is trying to open the door to the Queen's Chamber and trying deactivate the weapon defense system.END SPOILERThis movie get ass. Mila in a skimpy outfit kicking the crap out of dogs and zombies and whatnot. Hundreds of zombies and zombie dogs, a giant "Licker" and a super computer that's trying to kill you. What more do you want?! The movie had sick but oh-so-amazing death scenes and monsters.I expected half the people who died to live on! What a surprise! This movie couldn't have been any better.

		<fullReview>This film is exactly what I needed. A very hot chick kickin' zombie ass. What could anyone else ask for? The gore level is sub-par for your average zombie flick, but this is made up for by the fact that there is an actual plot. The plot unfolds itself perfectly. The lead in to it's sequel will make fans of the game happy. I could have used some more zombie action and gore. The zombies looked great when they did hit the screen. I'll be patiently awaiting the sequel. It's not a perfect film, but it sure did put a smile on my face. This film is very grim and dark from the start. Much like the game it captures the tone of "survival horror". The dark atmosphere of this film is rare in today's horror films. Take this one for what it's worth and enjoy the ride. I give it 8 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was so good. i love the video game and thought oh well just another bad movie made for the fans of the game,(WRONG). my wife has not ever sat down and watched myself and my son play this game but when she watched this movie she was on edge. now the acting was a little bad but hey,the story and the effects were great. i never watch a movie twice but i saw this at the movie's and rented it as soon as it came out. i would recomend this film not only to the fan base of resident evil but for people that just want to sit back and enjoy a good horror flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike most people, I loved this movie. I thought it was one of the best game to film movies. I thought the actors did an outstanding job, the story was well written and not too far from the games storyline. I have played and beaten every Resident Evil game, as it is my favorite series. I am very much looking forward to Resident Evil 2: Nemesis. This is a definite must see in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Night of the Living Dead" meets "Return of the Living Dead 3"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never played any of the video games, and I'm not one for artsy-fartsy stuff, so from an entertainment standpoint, this movie was superb. Nonstop thrills and frills. With awesome special effects and a fantastic group of actors, this movie is a must-see for all Resident Evil, horror and/or sci-fi fans.The movie stars the lovely Milla Jovovich as Alice, a woman who was the victim of short-term amnesia and was suddenly drafted into an odd and unusual mission not meant for the-light-of-heart.Ms. Jovovich's co-star, the equally lovely Michelle Rodriguez as Rain, a no-nonsense, hardened, gonna-kick-your-ass-if-you-look-at-me-wrong kind of woman. Armed with a machine gun, she was not about to let anything get in her way.Together, along with a few other military agents and Matt, a man who is not who he claims to be, they fight their way through Umbrella Corporation to complete their mission and eventually to save their own lives.All-in-all, this movie was fantastic. Solely for its entertainment value, I gave this movie 9 out of 10 stars. It lost a point for being too short (a movie like this should exceed 2 hrs, in my opinion) and for the way it let me wanting more. Definitely on my must-buy list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real review on this film from a big fan on the games</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen some of the other reviews and you have people saying that this film is full of gore,and they couldn't be more wrong, i am a fan of the game and of 80's horror films and with todays special effects i was expecting a blood bath, now ask yourself whats the point of making a zombie film with bloodless effects. This was the major problem that i had with this film. I hope that Paul Anderson corrects his mistake and makes Resident Evil 2 knee deep in gore. Overall the story was simple and worked with the film, the film itself is GOOD not great. As a fan of the video game i was disapointed, i just hope the sequel is better. I give this film 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not since the realease of Alien many many years ago has there been a horror flick that gave me the "Oh s**t" reflex. I was not expecting much since movies of this genre have been so dissapointing to me in the past. The video game to movie scene has not had much success for me...ie Mortal Kombat. There has been many failed attempts at horror films in the past, but I have to say that not a one has made me yell at the television screen...."Oh you had better run faster than that!" in a long time. I wish I had seen this one in the theatres, DVD on a small screen did not do it justice. This was not your typical Jason or Michael slashing at anything that moved. It actually had a story line that kept my interest and attention. The story made sense, I could see this happening in some day in age with all of the genetic research going on. Am I paranoid? Nope, not yet....the movie was good but not that good. Rent it, see it, you will love it. Just be careful what you are grabbing when that "Oh s**t" reflex kicks in. You will understand grasshopper when you see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematography and Manson's score only positive elements.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Impressive clinical cinematography and an appropriate techno-goth soundtrack by Marilyn Manson are perhaps the only admirable elements to this video game adaptation that was historically doomed from the get go. Director Paul Anderson (Soldier, Event Horizon) churns out yet another flat action-gore flick that would be successful if it could only satisfy the enthusiasts of the video game franchise by the same name. The plot stays faithful to the game. A deadly virus escapes a multi-billion dollar underground research facility owned by the Umbrella Corporation, mutating everyone infected into a mindless zombie. A Special Forces team led by sexy super model turned actress Milla Jovovich (Alice) is sent into the facility to investigate the contamination and stop the virus from spreading. To complicate matters, a highly advanced AI super computer, the Red Queen, toys with the team, sometimes aiding them and sometimes leading them to their deaths.The acting is just as flat and as full of one-liners as the game itself. And while this film may not feature a star-studded cast, at least the screenplay (Also by Anderson) could have been crafted well enough to allow Milla Jovovich room to play a dynamic character (As she did in Messenger). Michelle Rodriguez plays Rain, the secondary gun totting Lara Croft wanna be. Her one-liners include `The bitch isn't standing now. ` `Blow me.' and `When I get outta here I think I'm gunna get laid.' Her contrived bravado is weak in comparison to earlier sci-fi tough girls such as Private Vasquez of Aliens.Based on poor box-office earnings and the fact that this film was yanked from theaters quite quickly, it seems that most moviegoers preferred to wait for this flick to be stocked on the shelves of Blockbuster. And if cliché dialogue isn't enough to distract from otherwise entertaining gunfire and bodily dismemberment, the film's tedious pseudo-scientific explanations of the virus and how a human body is ?zombified' will remind you that your remote control sports a fast forward button. Paul Anderson and like filmmakers who attempt to rationalize the paranormal should take a lesson from horror greats like George Romano. Romano's Night of the Living Dead series didn't waste time on explanations and rationalization. There are a few disputed origins of the zombie race: maybe a meteor crashes into Earth and spreads radiation, maybe a virus escapes a research facility, fine, leave it at that. Accept the fact that zombies are the walking dead and they feed on human brains. That is all we need to know.This film is not totally undeserving of appreciation. There are a few good scenes and some decent makeup effects. One of the best scenes showcases Milla's Alice facing off against a pack of mutant dogs, which is also highlighted in the film's trailer. It looks great partly because of the fact that the dogs are not computer animated composites. The effects team saved the CGI for the flesh-hunting mutant that acts as the movie's end level boss-an early experiment by the Umbrella Corporation that is pitted against Alice in a battle royal on a speeding train. To put it bluntly, this digital creature has the artificiality of a direct to video sci-fi release. The most nail-biting and sadistically creative scene comes early in the film. The Special Forces team, who by the way arrive out of nowhere, get pinned down in a chamber of deadly lasers as part of the Red Queen's defense mechanisms. Without giving too much away the team falls victim to an interesting game of agility and dissection. The effects here look great and will leave the faint with an upset stomach.Photographically the film is a winner. It is clean and well lit, the colors are beautiful and the camera angles are well thought out. Unfortunately we've seen this ultra clinical cinematography a lot in recent films and it may not have been the best choice for this story. A better choice would have been to match the video game's dark, gritty aesthetic. The contrast between the Umbrella research facility and the bloodied, ragged zombies makes for an inconsistency that is all too noticeable. On a poignant note, Marilyn Manson's original score almost carries the film. It is an effective creepy mix of slow brooding goth-noise and clean accelerating techno-metal. Hearing Manson's musical arrangements sans his juvenile angst lyrics makes you appreciate his talent and puts his controversial image and ideals aside.If you prefer movie endings not to be neatly wrapped then Anderson's habit of leaving room for a sequel will delight you. The film ends right where the second installment of the video game picks up. There is resolution of the initial conflict but then a new one is revealed just before the credits roll. A Resident Evil sequel is in the works, but as the laundry list of bombed silver screen video game adaptations suggests: Super Mario Brothers, Street Fighter, Double Dragon, Final Fantasy, Mortal Kombat (Also by Anderson), I wouldn't expect to get your $8.50 worth at the theater. Overall the film is high on action and lacks suspense. Suspense is what actually made Anderson's 1997 film Event Horizon watchable. If you want to see more of this director's work then I recommend Event Horizon. It is almost the antithesis to Resident Evil in its gritty aesthetic and tone. It also delivers good dialogue, an interesting story line, a character twist, and some wonderfully explicit gore. I rank RE a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Living Dead rises again, and stink at it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes a good movie?You can say whatever you want, but there is not one movie that everybody will like. There will never be that kind of movie and it would be almost impossible, just like there would be a perfect person or maybe a zombie?But I can tell you this: I DIDN'T LIKE Resident Evil.You know, if you want to make a movie which involves a story where allot of SFX is needed, to me one of the important things of that movie is that the SFX are great and make you believe them. I hated Godzilla but I must say, they threw allot of money away for the effects, and it was necessary or you would get a movie like Gargantua. It started to get bad when the red monster gets out of some kind of iron cage. From that point I saw that the effects were going to be very very very bad! Just the way the monster kicked the door out was pathetic. And the monster? What was that? A cartoon edited or stop motioned monster? Especially at the ending in the train..I love the original King Kong movie? The effects are for this time maybe bad, but they are great for that time, and to me are still great because it works but Resident Evil bothered me. It was like Ray Harryhausen was back in the game and said that stop-motion is cool again in this kind of movies. The same with the dogs. When Mila Jovovich was shooting, you didn't feel any tension and when the dogs jumped, again it was done cheap and bad.At one point I really laughed because of one little scene that wasn't really noticable. When one of the guys of the team is shooting at some zombies. One guy falls down, he stops shooting and turns his head towards the camera. The first guy falls down, and then another guy falls down while he never got hit. This was very funny in a `Ed Wood' kind of way.Also the scene where they activate a laser-beam was maybe for some people original but to me, it just reminded me of the great low-budget movie `Cube', where they use their money in a great way and realize that they have a good story to build on. This is something Resident Evil doesn't have, just like great effects.Off course in this kind of movies there has to be some sort of twist in the plot, which no one really cares about but still being used. The acting was ok, I like Michelle Rodriguez, ever since I saw here in `Girlfight', she has a great promise as actress but I hope she doesn't throw it away. Good luck Michelle.So overall, I consider Resident Evil to be bad, because of a lousy plot, which copied of allot of movies (and I don't mean Night of the Living Dead) and has incredible bad effects. Advise: if you want to make a movie, spend money on either a good plot and build your effects around it or spend your money on effects like `Eight Legged Freaks' and no plot. People will have allot more fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT amazingly well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say that I am a HUGE fan of the games. I even played Resident Evil: Survivor and if you have played this, you know what I mean. All right, to the movies credit, I thought the sets were awesome. The sets really conveyed the corrupt corporation image and I loved the gritty white color scheme the set designer used. Also, I too enjoyed the beginning very much. It grips you right from the start and I thought it was a great way to kick off the movie. However, from there on it pretty much goes right off track. The acting is horrendous. I have no idea how anyone would fine the characters "well-developed" as they acted as they they didn't even want to be there most of the time. I felt no connections whatsoever to them and found nearly every line of dialouge humorously misspoken or just out of place althogether. On top of that, the characters looked like they saw zombies everyday of their life. I didn't believe anyone was scared for a second. And if the characters aren't scared, why the heck should I be? Now, like I said, I love the games. Obviously, the makers of this film wanted to attract the fan-base of the game series. So why in the WORLD did they deviate so far from the games storyline??? They didn't even include the characters from the game! I would have been happy if they had just had the charcters names and were completely different. Ok, maybe not happy, but Id buy it. OK, back to something I liked. I really do think that there were some interesting ideas in this movie. I really thought the ending was cool, BUT it actually made me mad because it could have been so much better if Milla Jovavich's character had been better developed. I didn't really care that she survived (Oh, come on, you know she did, I'm not giving away anything). All that aside though, I will see the sequel. I'm too much a fan of the games. I just hope the director Anderson or whatever gets his act together and quits trying to make another Aliens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very disappointed with this film. Paul Anderson has directedsome great films. I loved Mortal Combat. Thought Event Horizonwas a fantastic film ,(except the ending. I hate it when the explaineverything, better to let the audience come to there ownconclusions.) and was thrilled with Soldier. All of these film I begyou to watch! This one however, ..second to all of the above. I dontreally blame Anderson. I think the material he had to work with is abit dull. Flesh eating zombies was a cool idea ONCE. Continuallyhitting that dead horse(no pun intended) has become very boringfor the viewers. Anderson managed to get all you can fromJovovich. The other actors fell under the old Star Trek philosophy,(If you aint seen 'em before, there going to die, has anyone elseEVER seen these people in ANYTHING?) so I guess flushing outthere characters would of been a waste of time. All and all Resident Evil was just a 90 minute lead in to the sequel. I've got my fingers crossed that Anderson can write and directhimself out of this corner and provide his fans with a reason to seehis next non-Resident Evil film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action zombie movie.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the Resi Evil games, I was really looking forward to the movie, and I wasn't disappointed.I read a real mixed bag of reviews before I saw the movie, and can't really understand how anyone can criticise a movie that ultimately stays faithful to its videogame origin, but without the cheesiness that most other videogame/movie crossover end up being. If you're looking for something with intelligence and real substance, you shouldn't be watching a zombie movie.....The story, obviously, is very true to the videogames, but there are also many subtle camera shots and angles that bring back memories of playing the games, such as one moment when the lovely Milla shoots an ex-security guard. He falls back to the ground, slumped against the wall. As she notices the gun in his pouch, the camera angle changes to above both Milla and the inanimate zombie looking down from above, and you just know that as soon as she touches the gun, he'll grab her! (He doesn't, incidently.....!) It also has the claustrophobic feel of a classic zombie movie, with the constantly increasing flow of relentless walking dead refusing to stop trying to munch their way through the cast.The soundtrack is pretty pumping and does carry the movie, though, to be honest, I think it would have been more atmospheric with no music, just the audio and effects, like the Romero movies of old. Movie companies seem to think they're neccessary for some reason. Not neccessarily a criticism, just a personal preference. Mind you, these zombies are rather more aggressive looking that Romero's....!All in all, a very entertaining movie, doing exactly what it says on the tin. Not really sure what else people expected....!And it's left it very nicely open for Mr Nemesis to take main stage.....!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How bad does a movie have to be before the average horror fan notices it's bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Anderson's previous work of science fiction horror ("Event Horizon"), "Resident Evil" is overloaded with gore, even more overloaded with noise (Anderson seems to think you can't frighten people without deafening them), and doesn't try to make sense on any level whatever. But there are some differences. "Resident Evil" has art direction which deserves more than just pointedly looking the other way, and one (alas, no more than one) likeable character - although, it could just be that I find Michelle Rodriguez attractive, or that the character she plays is never given enough rope to hang herself. On the debit side, there's a computer-animated monster which looks like a cartoon crudely pasted into live-action footage.The whole movie is a series of miscalculations, but one in particular stood out. (Spoilers ahead...) The gimmick is a thing called "the T-virus", capable of re-animating corpses - in effect, creating zombies, which are almost impossible to kill and which behave so as to infect living individuals and create further zombies. The T-virus was engineered in an underground research facility, and the instant the virus escapes, the central computer ("The Red Queen") seals of all exits and kills everybody, so as to contain the plague. But since it didn't bother to tell anyone on the surface what happened (why not? Search me), half a dozen investigators find themselves underground, surrounded by flesh-eating zombies, one of their number infected with the T-virus, and trapped by the Red Queen, who refuses to let them escape.Here's the problem: I didn't want them to escape. What's more, they shouldn't have wanted themselves to escape. They were carrying a dangerous plague capable of destroying the world. One reason I felt more sympathy for Michelle Rodriguez's character was that she was the only one willing to lay down her life - in a situation in which they were probably all going to die anyway, whatever happened - for the common good. Nobody else so much as CONSIDERED laying down their lives for the common good. The thought never entered their heads. How can we be expected to sympathise with such selfish people? I suppose it would have been easy enough, if we'd ever got to know any of them, but since we never did - since they were no more than vaguely unsavoury action movie stick figures - what little sympathy we have is entirely on the side of the unseen several million inhabitants of the city above. That's where the movie's loyalties should have been, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special Effects and a Big Budget do not a horror movie make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the horror genre and of the Resident Evil video game series I was looking forward to the theatrical adaption. However after viewing the movie I can only mourn what could have been. The majority of the movie is seen without the presence of any monsters and the ones that show up are few in number. One Licker a single pack of Cerberus zombie dogs and a few dozen Zombies, does little to impress this viewer. There is little character development and the performances themselves are hardly commendable. As for the amount of gore or in this case the lack there of it greatly hinders the movie itself. For an R rated horror movie this film had a serious lack in carnage and bloodshed. And if the title of Resident Evil is to be used the movie using it needs to have a certain quotient of violence and gore this film does not. In the end we have a movie with a big budget and fancy special effects that fail to cover up the fact that this is one lightweight horror movie. Not recomended at all</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amusing movie (at least for me)!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like movies with a lot of tense and shocking sound. Seeing this movie in a cinema or a room with high-quality of sound system is marvelous. If you like horror or action movies with very simple story, this might fit you.The story is about a company which developed some kind of virus that is able to 're-animate' a death body. A very typical story for zombie type of movies. This will remind you who enjoyed the zombie movies back in the 1970-1980. On top of my enjoyment watching the heroes killed the zombies, it is amusing to see the beauty of Milla Jovovich and how she handled all the zombies and led the group. The end of the story explained everything behind the disaster, and at the same time, it left a room for the producer to continue the story. I bet that I will be in the cinema to watch the next story!Not an original movie idea, and not a 'touching' movie, and not an excellent character built up, but it amused --at least for-- me.</fullReview>

Excellent special effects, gorgeous Milla Jovovich, perfect, expertly directed musical score... and the storyline is actually pretty good too!Videogame to film adaptations are always infamously bad, but this one sets the standard for all to come. You can liken it to a gory, super-tense horror version of the Matrix.Awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good entertainment, but beware of obvious copies(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Resident Evil was a good entertaining movie, that followed the video game quite accurately in terms of scenarios and characters(zombies, that is). Milla Jovovich was absolutely beautiful as ever, although I can't say much about her acting. It's not in a movie like this you can tell.The only really bad thing I have to say about it, and I really have to say it, is that the scene where the green grid cuts everybody into pieces is a very clear copy of a scene in a very nice little movie called "The Cube"(which I absolutely recommend) where a similar grid made of some sort of wire also cuts a guy.I know this scene was very amusing for a lot of people. I just wanted to make it clear that it's not original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From brilliant to mediocre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It started of like a rocket, moved along brilliantly for about 45 minutes, and then slided back into mediocrity.I had seen previews of the movie and I had a hard time convincing myself to visit the theatre when it was finally released. Fair is fair, I have to admit that I left the movies with a reasonably good feeling. The first part of the film was catching and it was well on its way to become my all time favourite horror movie. Then it sort of went over the top. In trying to keep the attention of the audience they stretched the zombie action for to long and the climax with the mutated monster was greatly over-done. The last part of the movie and the average acting performances of the main characters will probably keep me from buying the DVD.I would have liked a bit more suspense and imaginative horror. However the die hard horror fan will probably have a very very good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Buying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually got this on import as soon as it was released on dvd being a fan of the videogames and Event Horizon [Paul Anderson]. Simply put, it is a good film. Various aspects of the videogame are kept in the film, notibly some camera shots. The music throughout the film is interesting and fitting yet can become somewhat tedious. Personally I found that while watching the film, I felt I was alsways waitng for something that I just couldnt put my finger on, then at the end I realised, what your waiting for is the sequel. Now I dont mean this in a bad way, at the end of the film you get a real sense of "great here's where the action begins". Resident Evil is only an introduction to the whole resident evil saga, and it fufills this well without leaving you feeling cheated. I was quite surprised when watching, as there is little blood and no guts what-so-ever, so to class it as a "zombie movie" doesnt seem right, more of a horror-thriller, which in fact it claims to be. Various aspects of the CGI were inpressive, although I did find the licker seemed to be missing something. Good performances by all the cast, although after watching this you may begin to hate Michelle Rodrigez as, yet again, she plays the same hard-core "bitch" with an attitude, at points coming out with some very bad lines. Personally, I'm finding her a bit tiresome. Overall a good movie and worth buying, I tend to also get the sequel on import too, so we'll see how they have handled that. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its amazing how today s critics don t know nothing about movies.Since i dont listen to the critics,i went to watch RE and wasnt dissapointed.People often proclaim that there isnt enough gore in the movie,but id say it had gore enough,and it had story,one thing dead alive didnt had.Zombie films are often just gore,zombies,gore etc.This one scared,had a decent cast,a decent story,and besides the usual zombies,they had some zombie dogs,an instable mutant and a homicidal supercomputer called Red Queen.The movie takes place on a facility called THE HIVE wich is controlled by umbrella corp.and everything turns into chaos,when someone releases the virus,and the computer is forced to kill the umbrella employees,who later turn to zombies.That opening scene really scared me,but id say the movie is more of an adventure than a horror movie,even tough i like it,it also manages to explain the happenings of the game series.But RE isnt a perfect movie,the mutant was completely unbelivable,Alice managed to kill some zombies by kicking them,and the special effects look cartoonish,especially the mutant,he gets more realistic after evolving but it is still an umbelievable creation.This altough,is surely Anderson s best movie,and best game adaptation to screen so far.As a zombie movie,id say its at least better than dead alive,and some others but theyll ruin it by making the sequel,and i fear to say RE will be forgotten,but at least not by me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better then I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having never played the game myself, I didn't quite know what the film would be like, but I quite enjoyed it. Milla Jovovich apart from being beautiful is now the holder of the Sigourney Weaver title of female bad guy ass kicker, and she dominates the sceen when ever she is on it as I couldn't take my eyes off her, and Michelle Rodriguez as the fiesty Rain was using her trade mark pout to maximum effect.On the negative side, the Zombies just were just not scary, and Ive seen better horror makeup in other films, one zombie I noticed was trying very hard not to laugh, and the sceen in the tunnel gave me the feeling the zombie gang, were all waiting off sceen ready for the director to say go before they all joined the shot. The laser guard was good, and its special gory effects was good but the final laser victim of the traditional black man victim death was a waste of the best of the supporting characters, and was to brief to be really shocking, but this was understandable given the films British 15 certificate. The zombie dogs though were good, and even gave me at 45 years old a start, and the way Milla took care of them, was in tune with the films source for action, well done Milla.As for the super baddie licker dog, it was all a bit fast in the train to get a real good look at it, but it gave off enough evil intent to be the best of the baddies.The ending sceen was really good, but before that who was the person walking across the screen before Milla escapes from the hospital, one of the crew? The final panoramic sceen sets the tone nicely for a sequel that I'll probably be going to see.Verdict, just enough gore, a reasonable adherance to the game play, and the lovely Milla Jovovich, showing lots of flesh and kicking zombie ass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ragged they come, the ragged they kill. - Hardly!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Essentially, I was extremely unimpressed by this movie because of the wasted opportunity that it was! This review may contain spoilers! (- if this movie can be spoiled by giving away plot details!)To put this in context, I have never played the game but have always been aware of it and its reputation. I have always enjoyed the classic zombie movies of the 70's &amp; 80's. As such, I felt it would make a good movie, especially as there have been no good zombie movies for quite a while.The story was quite passable, but not totally engaging. The acting was also average, but that's what I'd expect from such a movie. Hell, the greatest zombie movies suffer from poor acting.However, there are 2 major flaws with this movie. Firstly, the marketing aspect. It's based on a computer game, therefore it has to appeal to a younger market - there goes any potential for a nice gory movie. Secondly, as a result of this, it's clearly more of an action movie than horror or zombie flick.There are moments that are supposed to be scary but these are all practically signposted - no surprises. You can practically guess what will happen next. This isn't a scary movie. The scary element of a zombie movie is the way these monsters never relent until they've totally ripped apart their victim. There is literally no blood or gore in this movie - no horror! The effects of missing body parts might be nicely completed, but the zombie action is ultimately poor. Does the audience really want to watch another average gung-ho Aliens rip off??The action itself isn't particularly spectacular either. It's still amazing that these trained killers can't figure out that since body shots have no effect, a head shot might have more impact. And it was unsurprising to see the introduction of a "superbeast" into the movie, to allow for a greater amount of pointless CGI. Musically, they overdo it on the industrial metal front (an excuse for a tie in CD!!). More atmospherics and sparing using of the industrial metal would have been more effective!This movie is passable entertainment, but it just could have been so much more. One can only imagine how different this movie would have been if George Romero had remained in charge. Do yourself a favour, watch the classics (Night Of the Living Dead, Dawn Of the Dead, Day Of the Dead, Zombi 2, Evil Dead) rather than this average action movie!</fullReview>

Don't bitch about the movie, 'cause it didn't try to be something it's not. You know what you're in for when you see this kind of film, and I think the majority of people were pleasantly surprised. I suppose when you look at it, all you people who are bitching about Resident Evil, are the same people who'll part with their well-earned cash next month when another "supposedly crap" film is released. I guess it's like a car accident. You know there's something bad going on, but damnit, you just can't help but have a look!!...That's the beauty of human nature. And when I say human nature, I mean Hollywood - and it has most of us by the nuts!! Roll on Resident Evil 2...cause you all know you'll go see it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best..zombie..movie..ever..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do have one criticism - I have (as far as I know) perfect hearing, so I don't appreciate having my eardrums ripped to shreds by what is easily the loudest film I've ever seen. Even though I was in an empty cinema (matinees are so cool), the dialogue was at the right volume so there was no reason (other than for cheap scares) to whack the volume up to maximum and make me jump out of my seat every two minutes.On with the praise -The film is pacey, and keeps to a pretty simple but effective plot - very similar (I believe) to the videogame. A great opening shows what went wrong, and then we're into the action. There's a clever plot device (oh alright, it's a map), which I thought really worked well to branch the gap between the feel of a computer-game and a film.The actors are unfamiliar-enough that they don't detract, and Milla does a great job as the heroine. There's a neat little rip-off of a scene from Cube (which is a great film too), and the zombies are really really good.I saw a behind-the-scenes preview with Paul Anderson at a film festival last year, where he explained how much effort went into making the zombies and special effects believable, and I think they did a fantastic job. I know this will be sacriligeous to some, but I find Romero's stuff way too OTT. Previously, zombies have only really worked in a comedy sense - Braindead, Evil Dead, the Thriller video etc. so it's nice to see them done convincingly. The dogs look great too. The Licker looked good, but could have had a bigger role (it reminded me of the monster from The Relic, only naked), but the way they get rid if it made me laugh.Other good things - Milla Jovovich looks fantastic all the way through, and does a pretty good job too. Michelle Rodriguez seems to be enjoying herself, even if her lines are a bit too Sanchez (from Aliens). The ending was excellent - really sets you up for a sequel, without feeling short-changed.Apart from turning the volume up to 11 to scare me, my only other whinge would be that one of the squad characters (the whiney one) utters the "we're all gonna die" line - but I did appreciate the way lots of other cliched moments were neatly sidestepped.If you want to see a very attractive woman kill convincing zombies in an entertaining and vaguely futuristic action/horror movie, go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" is one of the worst new movies I've watched this year.I got to admit that I'm not a big fan of "the Matrix", I don't like the story and I don't like the special effects with slow motion and people running on the walls.The story in "Resident Evil" is a bit similar with computers taking control, and the special effects have also been used. One of them is the bullet being fired in slow motion - we have seen it before, and don't want to see it ever again.I also think that the director has been inspired by "Aliens", which is a much better movie than "Resident Evil". "Aliens" is a much more scary movie than this poor movie, and you don't know when the situations will occur. While watching "Resident Evil" you'll know whenever something will happen, there is nothing unexpected throughout the whole movie.Do you like "the Matrix" you'll maybe also like this one. If you just want to watch a movie where machines/computers take control, then you should watch the Terminator-movies.My vote for "Resident Evil" was 3/10.</fullReview>

I have watched every film I can think of since I moved here two years ago. So much so that when my best friend wanted to see this film I pointed to reviews in the uk press about how bad the film is. I have completed all the games and he has not so I win, well maybe not. I was sooooo bored that he paid for my ticket. Sat in my seat I was immediately glad that I had not bought any popcorn or drinks as I jumped out of my seat too many times to count. As a person who has spent years laughing at Freddy and Jason this is a great achievement. This film appeals to the people who were angry at tomb raider and recently scooby doo for sucking bad. Mainly because it shines above all of them. For those who have not played the game, You are in a hopeless situation and the only way to win is to kill everything that moves and guess what? that is what this film does and does very very well. If you want a script go watch a beautiful mind, If you want zombies, lasers and more fake blood than a B-movie vampire flik then I urge you to see this. One of the best endings to a film ever!. A little like the project IGI ending for computer buffs. Final destination with allot more balls. I want nemesis bad!</fullReview>

Also as a fan of the game its great to see how much effort went into the production design recreating scenes from the games . Sure the film could be better in places but most of what takes place is there to set up the sequel.

		<fullReview>The first thing I'd like to say is I've never played the video game so I can't judge how good or how bad it is compared with that. As film adaptations of vid games go it is one of the better ones I've seen, but it has so many bits of other things in it. You have echoes of The Cube, the Matrix, Ghosts from Mars, The Relic, and obviously any of the Romero Zombie films. Nonetheless it still has it's good bits. The score is excellent, there are bits in it that you know what is coming up and you're prepared for it and you still jump when it happens. The action is pretty non stop and the performances of the characters is good. If you liked any of the films mentioned above, then you'll probably like this one to, a hell of a lot better than things like Mortal Kombat and Wing Commander. The only thing I wonder is what it would have been like if Romero had stayed involved. A bit of a six pack and curry flick, but still a good curry nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shockingly good interpretation of the games.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know that there has so far not been a single decent movie based on a game. Of the most recent efforts, Final Fantasy was little more than a kiddie version of Aliens, whilst Tomb Raider was incoherent overly-sanitised nonsense quite obviously made by people who haven't played the games.The makers of Res Evil, on the other hand, are clearly fans of the games. This has allowed them to bring the forboding atmosphere of the the titles to the film. Initially designed to be a prequel to the games, Res Evil begins in the confines of the Hive, an underground research facility belonging to the menacing Umbrella Corporation.Whilst the film starts prior to the first game, the end of the film skips over the body of the first and second games, and finishes at the beginning of the third, paving the way for the sequel, Nemesis.The performances of the main characters are good, with a standout performance from Jovovich, as the Amnesiac operative of Umbrella Corp. As a bonus, in addition to her fine performance, Jovovich also spends much of the film either wet or naked!The effects are absolutely superb for a film without a blockbuster budget. Indeed, the effects for The Licker, the film's main villain, is actually far better and much less artificial in appearance than some of the Godawful CGI in blockbusters such as Star Wars Episode 2, and Spiderman.The pace of the film is also without fault, with the relentless action and tense sneaking around gripping the attention of the viewer, and never letting go. When packaged with the great effects, good performances, and excellent atmosphere, I have no hesitation in recommending Res Evil without qualification.There is one point of note, however. Some people I know who have seen the film but not played the games have enjoyed the film a little less than fans of the game. This is probably due to the back story the games provide. So, I'm giving this film two scores:If you've not played the games - 7/10 - An above average thriller. If you have played the games - 9/10 - See it now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I have been following the computer games since 1996 I was highly anticipating the Resident Evil Movie. Though after Tomb Raider I worried that it would turn out to be rubbish. However...Resident Evil turned out to be the best film I've seen this year. The movie starts at a very fast pace, missing out on lenghty conversations and concentrating on plenty action. A very good thing. Infact, the movie rarely does stop for talk as there always seems to be something going on to keep your interest. The movies excellent techno/ rock score really brings out the drama in the scenes and theres the odd scare throughout the does make you jump. The plot wasnt lame, managing a few twists that builds up to great ending. Whether you like Resident Evil or not, watch this movie, you wont regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Computer Game Movies Always Turn Out Bad Except This One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always said "why can't any film studios make a good movie from a computer game". Every computer game movie to come out I have always thought this is going to be the first good one, but each time I have been disapointed with the like of Street Fighter (I never thought this one looked good),Super Mario Brothers, Mortal Kombat, Final Fantasy and even Tomb Raider.I was really hoping that Resident Evil would be different, not just because I enjoy a good film but because I was a huge Resident Evil fan, and this time I was not disapointed.The movie was such a great ride with the main characters in the movie, like the game, having hidden secrets, which are not that hard to guess during the movie but are interested.The casting was great for this film as well with Milla Jokovich proven how to be a good tough lead for these types of films (take note Angelina Jolie).The start of the movie put you straight into the action before you could get a handful of popcorn with lift fulling, people drowning and other strange situations which seem to be a suspenceful as the game.Like the game I was always worried about want was going to happen next. There was also other scenes which were even more frightening especially the action in the sewers. The zombies were fantastic and very disturbing this was because they didn't just want to kill the people (like in most scary movies) they wanted to eat them especially when they pulled a person into the lift and started eating him, it was not that pretty.Some bits of the movie was strange with some of the scenes starting with the group together and then suddenly Alice (Milla Jokovich) is walking down the corridor on her own and you are thinking "why would somebody do that", i know it happens in every horror film but its just stupid.Their was also no huge spiders (which are in the game) that I expected to jump out when they were in the sewers.I was a bit worried before watching this movie because it was made by Paul Anderson who directed Soldier and Event Horizon. But now after watching Resident Evil I am looking forward to Resident Evil 2: Nemeses.The ending to this movie was excellent as well because it makes you want to see the sequel as soon as possible, like the Fellowship of the Rings did.Final ReviewEverything about this movie made it a fun ride, the music,the licker and Zombies, the main characters (good or bad)and the final showdown that made you want to watch more, which say a lot.8/10 I think Sarah Michelle Gellar could be great Jill Valentine for the next movie, because she has proven her self in Buffy. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really think this movie would be any different from other zombie films - the lead role is in a model's hands, it's taken from a game, all the features of a bomb @ the box-office. But it really surprised me. Sure, the acting wasn't anything more than people walking around, holding guns and swearing at each other, but they sure as hell do it with gusto. Milla Jovovich does a pretty decent job as Alice, and I really loved the way Michelle Rodriguez did her character; you could tell Rain's bitchy nature by the way she *looks* at you - and her one-liners directed @ the zombies are quite funny.The reviews given to this movie in the UK was terrible; "A typical gore-fest", "Nothing different" and stuff like that, but I believe that this movie was aimed in the general direction of teens, and anyone my age will definitely love it - the gore level is high, the language is sufficient, and there are nude scenes for the guys to enjoy. So, overlooking the acting (apart from Michelle Rodriguez), this is a simply terrific piece of work - since when do we teens care about the acting? Bring on "Nemesis", guys!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faced paced action, a bit of gore, beautiful woman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, there is nothing original about this film, but, as with a number of films being made recently, it can somtimes look original because of the recent love with computer graphics and eye-pleasing cleanliness of of recent movies.Milla looks great and proves herself once again, even if there is little clothing or script available sometimes. Some might say that she was a little too undressed for the film's rating, (but I reserve opinion as I like to think I'm well balanced enough not to be affected).The action is very cool; violence equally so - although some taken (come on guys, admit it) straight from the excellent, minor cult movie 'Cube'. My only grudge on the sfx and action is that we could have seen the hologram a bit more. My only grudge on the storyline is that it was asking me to stretch my disbelief almost that bit too far, which even I can do quite frequently.All in all, I now realise they may have been saving a bit of the budget for the sequel - which I hope lives up to it's future hype. I must congratulate the script writers, sfx guys and actors for a job well done, considering game-to-movie conversions have not faired so well (see the excellent 'Wing Commander' - yes, I stand by that).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been so much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I along with my friends found this movie disappointing. Being an avid RE gamer, I maybe expected too much. I wanted to see Leon, Claire, Jill and co, instead I was confronted by a raggle taggle bunch of camera friendly nonetities. There just wan't enough of anything, not enough zombies, not enough demon dogs, and do me a favor, one Licker?? They should have taken a leaf out of Romero's book and thrown us into a world of paranoia, suspense and claustrophobia. Instead all we get is an extended MTV promo. The movie opened promisingly enough, with the "laser" chamber, but then just slid into mediocrity and blandness. I also agree with a previous reviewer, the script was abysmal and the acting was poor too. They should have left this movie to the Japanese to make. If their's a sequel I hope they learn from their mistakes, and also decide to make it an 18 rated and not cop out! More gore please, less "style".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Videogame to Movie Adaptation Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WHile it probably is the best adaptation of a videogame to the big screen ever, that really isn't saying much considering its next closest rivals are Final Fantasy and Mortal Kombat.... But still, I believe that those who have played the games and know teh backstory would truly enjoy this movie as it captures the feel of the games PERFECTLY but without retreading parts of teh video game story. The story isn't half bad, basically a virus is released inside a bioengineering corporation and teh buildings computer kills everyone inside to stop the contamination. A miltary team from the corporation is sent in to disable the computer and find out what happened to everyone. Along the way we find out that the virus also turns its hosts into zombies. So as we find teh team and some additional characters getting through this underground facility, they run into other genetic experiments such as zombie dogs, and lickers. All in all, a truly fun popcorn flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, this movie is well done and some people appreciate it quite a lot but I felt it just as a disappointment. Milla Jovovich is gorgeous and the zombies look good but the scenes involving them are not gory at all.I think Paul Anderson did a good job in "Event Horizon" and even in "Soldier" which was better than expected but here he uses a too much video-clip style and the movie was quite uninteresting. And there is another thing I cannot understand, if this movie was so little successful in the USA, why are thinking about making a sequel?At least I hope it is like the Video game, that is,a zombie flick more than this is: A mixed of a lot of things all together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Game turned movie? Possibly. I thought that the plot was quite original and the director had taken a few good concepts out of the game to make this an enjoyable film. The flashbacks really gave me an understanding of how the main character was regaining her memory and playing her own individual game where she has to find out about herself.Graphics or special effects were good although I thought the end of game monster could have been a little harder to kill? Were they all playing on easy mode?The camera work was excellent but unfortunally I think that the boom guy (the one holding the mic!) needs to go to the gym. Every five seconds you catch a glimpse of what could be a tentical and your imagination runs wild, but disapointment when you realise its the sound boom!Overall, a better story than tomb Raider and Worth seeing. Plenty of scope for Resident Evil 2,3,4,5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie solely on the point that I was a huge fan of the games. I went in expecting a movie based on resident evil but was surprised to find no relation to the games, not even the characters or the infamous Raccoon City. Instead they opted for a new set of characters, and comes off looking like an alternate beginning for whole series. Resident evil has some great special effects and of course fight scenes but the real star of this flick is Milla Jovovich (Alice). As the main character in a horror movie its her job to get the people clinging to their seats while she is being attacked by a assortment of monsters, and pulls it off flawlessly (though I think she would have made a wonderful a Jill). Any fans of the game will want to watch the movie just for the last camera pan out (trust me), but for everyone else this movie does hold its own and is worth a look. I would recommend this to anyone loves a good horror film or just some senseless violence, as for me I cant wait for the next one. (Its in Raccoon city I hope)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, so disappointed....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been sooo good if only... I was looking forward to it considering i thought the games were brilliant and scary... but the movie is so far from what made the games good its a total failure. Firstly the script was truely awful and thank god there are only a few lines in this movie or it would have been unbareable. The characters are largely irrelavent which is a surprise when they have two great actress in this movie (Jovovich &amp; Rodriguez) who are totally wasted. Frankly you dont care if any of them survive. When i heard that P Anderson was gonna direct this, i thought he would make it a fun simplistic pop-corn movie with a few jumps in it. however he seems to have overblown the story and made a movie that is so stale with absolutely no horror in it. The music in the games was classical and eerie, but the techno music in the movie is not right when you are trying to make a horror movie (if that was Anderson's intention)- it plays more like something out of 'the matrix' but at a far lower quality.The intensity of the promotional trailers are totally missing from this film. The less-than-special effects are a huge disappointment, and the 'licker' monster thing is totally underused. The dogs were kinda good but the martial arts thing looked out of place and phoney. What i liked about the movie was the bit with the lasers because it was something new, and the beginning of the movie provided a good jolt into the film. the cinematography should also be commended as the sets are amazing. But the best bit must be the end as it sets up a sequel (which i'm not looking forward to now)kinda well. Unfortunately, overall, this movie just doesnt cut it. i'm not sure what it wants to be making it feel disjointed, and it wasnt scary at all!!! Oh well, i guess video-game movies should always be approached with caution. Oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(May Contain Spoilers)Alice is a happily married woman, living in a beautiful mansion in Racoon City.. at least that's what the outside world is lead to believe.. In truth, he marriage is a sham, she is an undercover agent for the Umbrella corporation, and so is her "husband", they have been placed in the mansion to guard the secret entrance to Umbrella's top secret research lab the Hive.. unfortunately, Alice can't remember any of this, she has amnesia.The film follows Alice and a team of soldiers going into the Hive to find out what happened to the scientists who lived and worked there, and Alice slowly begins to remember who she really is and what her real agenda is. The team soon discover that strange things were going on down there, and the scientists may not be quite as dead as they thought...The special effects are great, and the sound-track really works well with the action, and hightens the intensity of certain moments in the film. Comparisons have to be made with certain George A Romero films, especially Day of The Dead, and of course many watch it and judge it on the basis of it's connection to the Resi Evil games, but forget about all that, and just go in to the film with no pre-conceptions. A lot of people didn't like this film, but watch it as a no brainer action film with some great effects andyou'll have fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young woman with amnesia awakens in an empty mansion, alone she is soon joined by a SWAT team sent to investigate a mysterious occurrence in the mansions subterranean secret labs. An occurrence which will bring her face to face with not only her true identity. . . but the undead!In recent cinematic history the number of films based on computer games has increased &amp; another such film can be added to the list with Resident Evil. Its far better than most game-to-film translations but is not exactly a classic cinematic experience. The games were heavily influenced by the work of George Romero &amp; it is this cinematic inspiration which is beneficial to the movie version. Indeed Romero was approached to make the movie but his version was deemed too gory for a mainstream audience &amp; hence not profitable enough. His replacement was Paul Anderson responsible for such movies as Event Horizon, Soldier &amp; another computer game adaptation Mortal Kombat.Anyone familiar with Andersons films will know what to expect. A B movie version of James Cameron style cinema with characters to match &amp; a techno-soundtrack. As well as action the games have a suspenseful spooky atmosphere but the film concentrates on the action elements &amp; yes, with a techno soundtrack. It doesn't send shivers up your spine nor is it gory enough for the hardcore horror fan but is entertaining in an undemanding sort of way.Resident Evil the film is a low budget action-movie 'inspired' by Aliens &amp; early John Carpenter with zombies instead of extraterrestrials &amp; a SWAT team in place of futuristic marines. Also like the work of Cameron it has a strong female lead in the form of Milla Jovovich (Alice). She is good in a pretty undemanding role as is Michelle Rodriguez but most of the characters are stock action movie types &amp; the audience doesn't care to much what happens to them.The script whilst not Oscar worthy even by action movie standards does work. The main characters amnesia adds to the run of the mill plot &amp; gives a hook to drive the movie forward. Just what does Alice have to do with the situation? The narrative is not based on any single Resident Evil game &amp; is all the better for it. The games are heavily plot driven so less surprises would be up on the screen if it was a faithful adaptation of the console smash. What it does do is capture the spirit of the game. The silver screen version gives us the Umbrella corporation, secret labs, empty mansions, mutant dogs &amp; of course lots of zombies - all stock elements of the Resident Evil series. There are many other familiar locales, scenes &amp; images to raise a knowing smile for fans particularly in the sequel prompting climax.The direction is solid if not groundbreaking &amp; the sets are suitably dark &amp; foreboding but Resident Evil doesn't have the superb set design found in Andersons earlier film Event Horizon. The zombies themselves look OK although they are not gory enough, a general complaint against the film. Where are the exploding zombie heads, the result of close range shotgun fire? Where are the zombie hoards feasting on McHuman Happy Meals? Also the CGI effects are pretty poor during the climactic big boss battle but this is probably due to budgetary limitations. That said it does end with a great closing shot which bodes well for the inevitable sequel, just so long as Anderson is allowed to up the anti in the blood 'n guts stakes. There is also a nod to the work of Romero to be found in the movies closing moments.Overall with Resident Evil you get what you pay for. Movies based on computer games don't exactly promise much &amp; anyone familiar with the work of Paul Anderson will not be surprised by this film. A modern B movie with all that entails. Its fairly enjoyable rubbish, perfect for a wet-afternoon on video rather than a must see cinematic experience.</fullReview>

It was cool when the last man was alive and the checkered laser came at him. The laser went right through him. Then he just stood there and all of a sudden he fell into a pile of chunks. *END SPOILER* All in all I give it a 10 out of 10.

		<fullReview>I have been a big fan of the video game in which this film is inspired so I was very excited as I entered the film room to watch the movie. And after around one hundred minutes of action (and little more) I went home very dissapointed for several reasons.First of all, I don´t think this is a complete movie. I had the sensation that what I have just seen it was like a chapter of any T.V. serie. This film doesn´t have a complete plot or even a finish, it only puts the things in order for Resident Evil 2, something that in my opinion it´s disgusting.Also, there is an abuse of action scenes that completely dominate the movie. The action scenes are pretty good, but I would hope to see something more of the cerebral element (as it was sometimes in the video game, especially the first version).Finally, even the 'big bad boss' you are supposed to watch at the end of the film it´s pathetic. But of course this is connected with Resident Evil 2, when finally a really monster -Matt Adison converted in Nemesis- will come into the scene (again, this movie is only a chapter or a presentation of things to come).So, I only would recommend this film in case you are the purest fan of the action movies and have never take care of the video game. Rest of the world should eluded it.</fullReview>

It's definately up there with the top zombie films i.e. Zombie: Flesh Eaters and Dawn of the dead.The music in this film adds to the enjoyment and Paul Anderson should give himself a pat on the back as this is great film making. Yer maybe it doesn't follow the story of the game but if your a fan of zombie films ignore the game and enjoy yourselves and the ending should please all you resident evil game fans out there(it sure as hell pleased me and made me beg for the sequel to be here soon!)The film has it's game related stuff i.e. the dogs and the licker which i enjoyed watching them come to life on the big screen.

		<shortDescription>A different movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3rd day showing, I stood waiting on my brother to go in and watch the movie. An avid fan of the RE:games (well 1 and 2 at least), I had mixed feelings of the movie. Several countless nights in front of my computer playing the game until early in the morning hours, the sound effects of the games were so addicting. They drew you into the game, until finally as the house would cool from the days heat and a pop here or a crack there, and suddenly you were looking around the room wondering if it was possible.So you can see my position on this, many movies have been made of something that is in another medium, and gone so wrong from it. And usually it is such a big flop that it never recovers. RE the movie could have suffered from the same effect, but in truth I think the movie came out exceptionally well all things considered. The movie was well scripted for the genre, the characters were believable, the special effects were great.One thing I missed was the audible ambience of the game, to me that made the game. Did it hurt the movie? For the most part no, but would have made it better. While my brother screamed for more bloodshed I found the level of gore to be very acceptable, while the games were much more violent and gore to gag a maggot, I don't see that kind of thing a plus, especially if you want the movie to have a big enough drawing to warrant more movies, and this movie I want more of!On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 9.5 rating. There could be some improvements, but they aren't needed. I believe the movie ended just as it should have, and I am anxiously awaiting the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excelent movie !! A perfect adjustment of the video game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am charmed with this movie. it is perfect because to me I am a fanatic of the cinema gore and of terror in general, and also fan of the violent, such video games as the saga RESIDENT EVIL.From beginning until the end, everything is an entertainment, violently, effective, very rapidly and very terrifying. To the beginning of the movie someone (who is not known the one who is until the end of the movie), voluntarily infected with a mortal virus, one makes of Umbrella's experimentation (the major company of the world), called "the beehive". All the personnel die agonizing, after moments, bit a bit, and "the beehive" remains inactive. There appears Alice (Mile J.) in the shower of the bath, but she does not remember anything of anything. The mansion appears where she lives (identical to that of the video game RESIDENT EVIL 1) and on having tried to go out of the mansion, someone her enters again in the house by force (the first fright). He is Matt Adison. The group of commands appear rapidly, breaking the windows of the mansion. The group of commandos this one led by the commander James (Colin Samon), and formed principally by Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), Kaplan, Salinas, and Medic. The commandos interrogate Matt, he says to them that he is a policeman of Raccon city. nonetheless they take him as a prisoner. Rapidly, and without explanations, the commander directs to the whole group towards a secret door that gives to a species of underground. There in the underground stores (identical to those of a real video game) on having come to the train that joins the mansion with the beehive, they find Spencer Praks (James P.), who also suffers of amnesia.He is the supposed husband of Alice. From this moment, both, Alice and Spencer remember during the whole movie, bit a bit, recovering the memory. The whole group goes in train up to "the beehive". There they discover that quite this solitary, and the commandos put hands to the work your mission. They speak about the beehive and of the computer that directs everything and that supposedly madman has turned, the so called red queen. Immediately, the commander James and three commandos more, remain caught in a trap. Enclosed in a corridor, a red laser them is departing from one in one (first, medic loses the head, after another the fingers of the hand, another commando is departed in two, and finally the commander is he throw thousand pieces). After this unexpected event (and very gore), Alice and the demas, safely someone already, deactivate the red queen (the first appearance of the girl). On the other hand, Rain and two commandos more, together with Matt of prisoner, discover a woman zombie (the first walking zombie, exactly at the half hour of the movie). The zombie attacks and bites Rain, and the whole loader shoots this one, but the bush. There joins to the group Alice and the others, and appears zombies for all sites, surrounding them. There is a great gunfire, but the commandos do not manage to kill to anybody zombie. They all try to escape, and ultimately after the alone holocaust they remain alive, Alice, Matt, Rain, Kaplan, and Spencer. Matt manages to escape of his captivity and avoids to the offices. Matt, discovers your sister, Liza, but it is a zombie. Alice fights against the doberman zombie (killing all spectacularly). Alice kills to Combat, and Matt tells Alice who is a secret agent with the aim to unmask Umbrella's company and extracting to the light your secret experiments.From these events, more zombies and spectacular situations. Alice reveals herself to if same she turns into the real heroine of the movie. In the distance to your destiny, Rain is attacked and bitten often by some zombies. They all come to Umbrella's laboratory and there there discovers the reality of the plot of the movie (Spencer's real role is explained to us, that in the end, it is the wicked one of the movie). Spencer betrays Alice, and makes all enclosed. Giant appears the monster zombie and one eats it. The red queen makes clear that Rain must die in order that the demas survive, but Alice does not want to kill her. There appears Kaplan, to which him believe dead man, and he saves to all. The monster zombie giant chases them. They come to the train and there this one Spencer, dead man. He turns in zombie and Alice murders it of a palazo in the head. They ignite in train and flee. Alice gives the antidote against the virus to Rain (that this very bad). Appears again, the monster zombie giant and kills Kaplan. Alice and Matt try to kill it but they cannot. Matt is hurt by the monster. Rain turns in zombie and attacks Matt. Matt kills Rain, and drives also a button in order that the monster zombie giant is destroyed against the route of train.Matt and Alice are saved, and are the surviving only ones. On having come to the mansion, Matt's wound begins to mutar, and Alice scares. They appear suddenly, a few rare types and they remove them to the two by force. One of the doctors says: " we will put him in the project NEMESIS ". Alice remains incoscient. After a relax, Alice wakes up in a room of operations. Alone this one. There is nobody. Quite this desert. she goes out from the hospital to the street. There the great this desolate avenue, and everything looks like a chaos, as if a catastrophe had happened. A newspaper says: " the dead men walk!! ". Alice takes a shotgun of a car policeman, and wait .... soon the second part, RESIDENT EVIL "NEMESIS"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've played RE3, but I never got a chance to play the original, so I can't accurately comment on it. But there is one thing that I am sure of... Due to the original game settings, even if there is a sequel to the movie, it's either a)new characters in the same Raccoon City or b)it would keep away from the game. (In the 2nd in the series, the main characters are called Leon and Claire. In RE3 the main character is called Jill.)I want sequel!!! If they're making a sequel for The Whole Nine Yards, they could definitely make one for Resident Evil!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening title sequence to the apocalyptic ending, this film tears you away from your chair and pushes you headfirst deep into its murky depths. Being a film based on a video game, you'd expect a film with non-stop action and visual effects, but without in-depth characters or good writing. `Resident Evil' keeps its characters fresh and interesting, enough so you at least care what happens to them, and has more than enough original plot gimmicks to break out of the sci-fi/ horror genre, but still manages to deliver the action, special effects, and zombie gore that the fans of the game love. I never played the games too much, but I know enough about them to know that this film takes its share of liberties. The characters are not the same ones out of the games, and those who want to get picky will notice that some of the notable creatures out of the games have been altered a little to drive the plot along. But the changes are so small in relation to the overall storyline, which is right on with the game. The thing that saved the film, though, is the direction. Director Paul Anderson's mix of action and horror was perfect for `Resident Evil.' (His first big hit was 1995's `Mortal Kombat,' the first of the successful video game movies, and what I believe started the whole video game adaptation craze in the first place). He brings `Night of the Living Dead' to `The X-Files' and actually creates some genuine scares. The score by Marilyn Manson helps, along with the grinding heavy metal soundtrack, to create a feel that is dark and creepy one minute, pulse pounding and exciting the next. The sets are another thing that play a key role in this film. Just like any of the countless haunted house films out there, the environment is as much a character as the actors, and this film pulls it off nicely. It explains everything thoroughly, without over-explanations of every single thing that happens. This film won't puzzle you, but it doesn't insult your intelligence, either.Overall, the film is excellent, especially considering the horror films from the past few years. It doesn't attempt to be more than it is, but what it is is quite enough. No over the top horror acting, no over-the-top horror violence, but just enough to please. I recommend this film to fans of the game and to those who didn't know there was a game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best game to movie I've seen yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is spot on! It links in with the games brilliantly, has great action, great adult theme, great acting and a great music score. Milla Jovovich is great and so are the other cast members giving their all throughout the film! It even has a decent plot which other video game movies have lacked in the past (ie.Tomb Raider). This is definetly better than Tomb Raider (which I still loved!) and a whole lot better than Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (which was...ok). I really hope they make a sequel because they've left the movie at such a cool cliffhanger!! I only wish they'd have made as much effort with Final Fantasy. I can't wait to buy RES-EVIL on DVD and enjoy it even more! 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the RE games and love the Romero zombie flicks, so I was really looking foward to RE the film. On the plus side - it looks good, it does link in with the games and last scene is quite cool. Negatives - its 40 mins or so before any zombie action, there is far too much looking at monitors-type stuff and its not very gory. My hopes of a big budget zombie genre revival have been dashed for the moment. I hope RE:Nemesis does the job this failed to do. For me the appeal of the Romero films was the end of the world premise, RE evil only touches on this in the last 2 minutes or so.Overall, its a fair no-brainer and it may be the start of of decent franchise. Its not citizen kane and its not even Savini's NOTLD remake, but hey, its a zombie film with a big budget, theres another on the way, and thats ok with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can almost hear the pitch for this one now; "It's Aliens, it's Dawn of the Dead, it's The Thing - but with better looking actors." Apologies to Sigourney aside, the studio execs recognise that the massively popular games console adventures which spawn these vehicles guarantee a return on the investment, even if the script is as tatty as a rotting burial suit. Did someone say Tomb Raider?Fans of sci-fi horror must long for the day when a story comes along that doesn't take it's entire M.O. from the Alien series. If that's the case they're going to be disappointed again, right down to Michelle Rodriguez' (Rain) attempt to reprise the role of Hispanic, tough-talking Private Vasquez from the second of those outings. Sadly, Rodriguez interpretation of "How To Act Hard" involves sporting a constant, nostrils-flared grimace that merely leads you to wonder which of her co-stars is suffering with chronic flatulence. Don't fret though, that stench is probably just the dialogue. It is unfortunate that of all the positive elements which writer/director Paul Anderson might have retained from the Japanese produced game version of Resident Evil, he chose to include a bunch of suspect one-liners that fall as flat as if they had been directly translated from the programmers' native language.Elsewhere, the film contains all the usual music video production values we have come to expect - slick editing, stylish slo-mo shots of spent bullet casings spinning balletically through the air and of course, jarring industrial sound effects crammed into every available space. Obviously no-one was on hand to suggest the virtues of a good, eerie silence. What few nice atmospheric touches there are are quickly dispensed with in favour of big action sequences featuring hordes of shuffling zombies. The undead look fearsome enough, but feature far too frequently to remain a scary prospect for long. They tend to appear well announced for dinner, in a fashion that suggests that the only thing they forgot was a bottle of wine and a polite ring of the doorbell. Any "shocks" generated without their assistance are apt to come devoid of all surprise. Just listen out for the musical crescendo preceding Milla Jovovich (Alice) wheeling around to discover?another member of the assault team standing nonchalantly behind her. What a relief. Resident Evil does have another big baddie up it's sleeve in the form of the mutant "Licker," which crawls up and down the walls looking like - guess what? - an Alien, and may just win the award for most effortlessly despatched movie monster of all time. Even the films' supposed twist, which stems from Alice's memory loss, is half-heartedly unravelled in the first half of the action.So, what about the good bits? Well, Jovovich herself is the saving grace, smouldering successfully enough to have the movies' intended game-boy demographic fiddling overtime with their joysticks. We also get a satisfyingly apocalyptic ending which sets things up for the next inevitable installment, and there's a gruesome little scene in which Rain taunts the ravenous zombies from above with the blood dripping from her bite wound. Overall though, this movie lacks the moments of disturbing power which raised Andersons' previous sci-fi horror outing Event Horizon above the average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SpOiLeRs AhEaD***First of all i must say i'm a fan of the videogames, and was expecting anxiously for the movie; which goes through all common terror/sci-fi paths, as no survivors of the accident or whatever it is, most of the rescue team is killed too soon, some get killed in the final confrontation and only the cute, brave chick and the handsome, brave guy are the only survivors; also it's very predictable, and not difficult to guess who will scape and who will be zombie meal; and you just know that nothing will be ok for more than 3 minutes; but i didn't realise what was going to happen in the end, although i figured out that we wouldn't be much time without an RE movie, like x-men it leaves you wanting for more blood and gore. And i must be some kind of jinx because all characters that i want them to survive always get killed; i guess they should have made a tv series because there's so much to tell about the RE, or at least a mini series. well i guess i'll have to wait until the next movie. But it's really a good effort from a not so good director, and the acting doesn't shine, but it's OK for a movie this type, and Jovovich is just as beautiful as ever. Other stuff i liked is the blue environmental lighting they are always in, and there are many (or enough) similarities with the VG, as the final fight with the monster in an underground train, the leading female character waering a mini, and the terrifying fact that umbrella (the evil corporation who owns "The Hive")will always get what they want. RE fans and any regular viewers will have a nice time as long as they don't expect any movie that can beat Cameron's Aliens as the best action-sci-fi-movie-with-monsters-and-explosions-and-slaughtered-people, but you'll have good time. hopefully the sequel will be everything this one isn't (at least less predictable, the major flaw, and scary, this one just isn't). But as said it was a good efort worth viewing.PS: i dare you to count the number of times the microphone appears on screen</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does exactly what it says on the tin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil is pretty much a montage of scene from previous films in the zombie / trapped with a monster genre, with dashes of Tomb Raider and Cube thrown in when they run out of ideas.This is filmmaking by the numbers. Everything you'd expect to see is there, and nothing that you wouldn't. There are no outstanding scenes, either good or bad, no surprises, no moments of unexpected creativity. The script, dialog, cinematography, audio, score, pacing and FX are all absolutely adequate. How much you will enjoy this film is entirely predictable based on your response to the premise "Hot chick wasting zombies". If you think "Cool!" you'll enjoy this film. If you think "Lame" then you won't. It's as simple as that.The one scene worthy of mention is the ending, which might as well be captioned "To be continued...". I strongly suspect that it was written (perhaps filmed) before the rest of the movie, because it is such a disjoint from the preceeding scenes.On balance, I'd rate this on the low end of the cinematic pecking order, but still above such recent adaptations as the tedious Fellowship of the Ring, or the irritating Spider-Man, both of which are annoyingly pretentious and self important. Resident Evil sets its sights lower, gets all of its budget on screen, and doesn't promise more than it can deliver. It won't win any new converts to the genre, but it will please just about all of the existing faithful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have a new favorite...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am seriously shocked.Let me just state that I usually respect other's opinions, and I understand some people just may not like this movie, but I have to wonder just how in the hell someone could have disliked this movie enough to make negative comments on it at a website.Ok, so maybe they don't like horror movies. Then why even go see it? Why even make a comment on it if you don't like horror movies?Maybe they wanted the movie to follow the game...uh yeah, great idea. Instead of the original take on the storyline, let's have a recreation of the scenes in the game, since you know, everyone wants to already know what's going to happen.Maybe they felt it was just too devoid of any depth. This one I'll give some credit. This movie is slim on character development, but it's a horror movie. Anyone who has played the games know character development isn't high up on the priorities. To me at least, the games atmosphere and just all around feelings of something wrong is what makes me enjoy it. I am a zombie movie fanatic. But, strangely enough, I HATE with a passion the comedic zombies, like the ones in Dead Alive. I'm into the feeling of doom one gets when seeing the beginning of Day of the Dead, with the ravaged city overrun. You know, the armageddon angle of the Romero films, or the ending of Fulci's Zombi.Back to RE. Whatever reasons there might be for disliking this movie, I can safely say that if you're reading the comments for it, you've already seen it or you're at least a little interested in the genre. In that case, you won't be disappointed. I went into it expecting another shoddy game-to-movie translation like Street Fighter or some other garbage. What I got is one of my all-time favorite horror movies(Yeah I said it). This movie takes the atmosphere from the game and goes a different direction with everything else. It's either fast-paced action or tense scenes that really convey the feeling you get when playing the game, walking through a deserted hallway wondering what the hell is gonna happen next. But on to the part that solidified this movies position in my all-time favorites list...The ending. I have read some of these comments bashing the ending, and honestly, what the hell? How is this a bad setup to a sequel? I rank this as my favorite ending EVER. Yeah better than any other movie I've ever seen. I'm not saying everyone's gonna love it that much, but I did. The music kicking in at just the right time, the carnage-filled streets, it all fit together perfectly, and I haven't been looking forward to a sequel this much in a LONG time. As long as Paul Anderson keeps the same style throughout the second one, this movie will be THE zombie movie. I guess I just don't get how someone could say the ending is setting up a sequel that will be "even worse". I am looking forward to where the citywide destruction angle goes VERY much...In closing, give this movie a chance. I'm not saying hail it as the greatest film to ever be created, or to hate it like alot of these other comments would have you believe you should be doing. I'm saying just sit and watch it for yourself. Maybe you won't like it. But maybe you'll love it like I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil was really nothing more than a HiTech version of Day Of The Dead. It had basically exactly the same plot outline but less of the effects: A strange epidemic that turned humans into zombies was raging around a city turning everybody except a few lone survivors struggling to get away from these creatures and find a cure. That happens in Resident Evil aswell(The bit about the cure) but in Resident Evil:Nemisis, and happens through the course of the 'Of The Dead trilogy. But disregarding all that mumbojumbo, the film was pretty good. The special effects looked amazing like when the lazers sliced through the commando's body's, the bits slide off. Not a lot of swearing in it though, which I thought was a bit odd, because you'd expect lots in a movie like this. But quite a bit of blood and gore, which was good. This film is a must see: No noticable goofs and a real good story line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was dearly hoping not to be disappointed, by a movie I had been waiting for since playing the original resident evil on my Playstation alone in my bedroom, back in 1996. I was hooked on the game and it's sequels, but of late have been made to jump less by Resident Evil games and I guess playing games less generally.With the track record of game to film conversions I was a little dubious that the quality of the film would match the gameplay. I was disappointed with the conversion of another of my all time favourites conversions, namely Final Fantasy. It wasn't a total disappointment, but for a series of games I became totally hooked on, just didn't live up to my expectations. As for Tomb Raider, well I kind of got bored after the first game, but equally I think I would kind of get bored after that first movie aswell.All in all I wasn't sure what to expect of Resident Evil the movie, but I did have high expectations. All in all I was shocked to find an excellent movie in its own standing, and have been hoping that the fact it's a game conversion doesn't drag it down too heavily at the box office.I think I have to rate this movie in my top 10 of all time, and no I'm not going to pretend that my experience of the games doesn't influence that ranking, because it does. However, when you like something that much, all too often than not, you're disappointed. What I'm trying to say here is that if someone who liked the games as much as I did can think this film is excellent, then someone without such high expectations must like it.I'm not about to go into details about the film. I'll let you all watch it and enjoy it without any major spoilers. The only criticism that I can level at this film is that it's too short and a few more bits could have been added into the mixture of the film that were in the game, such as more of the guns, other creatures and of course the infamous "Barry Burton." Well I guess they have to save some things until the 2nd movie (and I mean the guns, not Barry!) of what must prove to be at the least a trilogy.Watch it and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Capcom's classic Resident Evil video games have made one of the best horror &amp; action movie of all time. Even if there are no characters from the video game in this movie, its spirit can easily be seen.For the monsters, we can say that Paul WS Anderson has made some great choices. As you could see in the previews on television, the zombies, the cerberus and the horrifying Licker are all back. It was so cool to see this adaptation of the games on the big screen. So many things was remembering us some thrilling moments of the first two video games : the zombies crawling on the ground to bite our feet, the amazing mansion, the train,...Milla Jovovich is so cool! She looks so different from all her other movies! It's a really good thing because when we see her, we don't start thinking about, like, Joan of Arc or Leeloo. So on for Michelle Rodriguez. She hasn't played in many movies so this motion picture really creates its own atmosphere.There was only one thing that I really didn't like in this film. It seemed like if the director lost a little bit of his imagination because there is a scene where the only thing you can think of when watching it is the canadian movie Cube. I won't tell you more about it because I don't want to give you a spoiler!Anyway, Resident Evil is a must-see movie for everyone, especially for the fans and the horror movie fans, you'll like it! I can't wait to see a sequel (who don't?) !!! **I hope there will be the zombie shark from the first video game!** : )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another entry in the video game to movie sweepstakes. Last year's Tomb Raider movie made a lot of money, but critics weren't kind (not that that matters), and Resident Evil looks to be in the same boat. Milla Jovovich stars as a temporary amnesiac who's dragged into an underground laboratory to help shut down a maniacal super computer, along with her husband (Eric Mabius) and a cop who happened to be around when she was grabbed by a special military unit, which includes Michelle Rodriguez, who needs to find at least one role where she isn't constantly angry. Directed by guilty pleasure specialist Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon), Evil borrows a lot from other movies, which is probably a fault of the game and not the screenplay. You can see bits of last year's 13 Ghosts (killer building), as well as Frankenstein (man-made monster), Night of the Living Dead (zombies) and even Speed (there's a scene on an underground train where one person wants to go faster and another shouts that it would make them fly off the tracks, and I thought to myself that that's exactly what happened in the 1994 thriller), among others. Most of those comparisons can only be made after the movie's over, since the action rarely lets up. Originality has never been important to science fiction/horror/action movies, they all happily feed off of their elders, so I can't really hold that against this movie. It's good fun and would make a good double bill with Tomb Raider (perhaps Jovovich or Rodriguez could join Angelina Jolie for the inevitable sequel).</fullReview>

Creepy music an eerie feel and plenty of 'trippy' camera views and angles. The zombies also resemble 3rd generations from the classics and everything seems plausible.

Without giving too much away of the story line I loved the methodical destruction of the team. Milla Jovovich was very believable as the heroine/zombie killer and even though it's a bit sparse in the plot department it chugs along at a fair pace, with the fright factor very high.The thing that impressed me the most was the special effects and prosthetics used. The fight scenes were particularly believable and the zombiefication of the humans was excellent (but look out for the doberman's with the metal teeth and no hair - way cool!)Just a word of warning though, this is NOT a date movie or even something to watch with your wife. MY poor leg was left bruised from my wife clamping my leg at every spooky or scary scene ( and there is quite a lot in this flick).All in all a good ,gory, kill the zombies movie with a twist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good zombie film, but not a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil isn't a bad film, just nothing exceptional. As a zombie film, it hits its marks, but doesn't do anything to distinguish itself from the pack. Day of the Dead is a much better film if you want to see the walking dead in action.As a video game adaption, it does what any good adaption does: keep only the bare bones of the material and build new flesh over them. The original story contained in the game has thrown out. Unlike some game adaptions (Double Dragon, for instance) it works in this case, but mainly because the original story was a generic zombie / mad science plot. The Resident Evil movie has just taken one version of zombies / mad science and replaced it with another. In fact, the links to the game are so tenuous (apart from the theme and some stylistic factors) you wonder if the license was bought to attract a greater audience.The big problem with the film is that the narrative gets weaker as the film progresses. Starting with the stealing of the T-virus (the zombie making agent) and the smashing of a T-virus tube in the lab (because the thief was evil, as far as I can tell), the computer security system known as the Red Queen locks down the facility and kills all the employees. It's a great start, and the use of security cameras as a view point for the audience is a great effect because you get to see the Red Queen's abilities and depersonalised status. From here on it's downhill in regards to the narrative - some flashbacks, a weak backstory surrounding attempted corporate espionage and characters making stupid / evil decisions against all common sense. You got bitten by a zombie for which there is no cure? Hey, hang around us, please! A top secret bio-warfare facility went into lockdown? First thing we should do is open it up!There are some great moments, such as the appearance of the skinless dogs. But there are so many holes in the story the movie suffers. That said, the ending does leave a huge gaping hole for a sequel, and if one is made I'll go and see and pick it apart too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this at the movies with my friends, and we all thought it was pretty damn awesome... some of us liked the gore, the zombies were damn freaky-lookin', Milla Jovovich was lovely as always and actually did a good job with her action sequences, and Michelle Rodriguez, the chick with the EYES, got all the coolest lines... the story was good, the opening sequence was awesome, but for me the movie started when the troopers invaded and took over... think I'll go see this again now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie film: Hollywood Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" was, originally a series of really enjoyable video games. With a dark, creepy atmosphere that could make you jump out of your seat, it created a world in which you could easily go into. It also had the reputation of being a very graphic and gory game. Another great element of the games was the plot; you had to resolve many puzzles, and your intelligence was required to play.  The same things are not all true in "Resident Evil", the film.  "Resident Evil" tells the story of a woman who had been rescued from a virus infested research center. She awakens later on, she has forgotten everything. After that, a military team takes her and brings her back in the research facility, when the effects of the virus are no longer contagious. They find that the release of the deadly virus was a conspiracy. But there are many problems on their way; some almost invincible zombies, a main system (which takes the aspect of a little girl) that wants to kill every intruder, and a security system that turns against them.  In the case of "Resident Evil", it's not the movie itself that is so bad, it's all those little things that are messed up, without ruining completely the quality of the movie. If you've seen "Deep Blue Sea" and liked it, then you'll love Resident Evil. As much as "Deep Blue Sea" was a very simple and common model of what a suspense movie turns out to be in Hollywood, "Resident Evil" is another clone of that model. What I mean by that is the presence of the similar elements, which mostly are: A good-looking girl, a bunch of men that get killed one by one, a spectacular enemy, some high-tech facilities and equipment, a very simple scenario, some violence (not graphic enough to gross out the average teenager, which is 80% of their target audience, but not mild enough to be rated PG-13), and some cool looking action sequences. It's a formula that works many times, and they chose it for a movie that promised so much, but did not deliver what the real "Resident Evil" fans like. A movie that could have been so much more...I could easily criticize the plot, or the actors, but you know how it is, and we all know how it is. It's just normal, common, average...it has nothing special...it is an excuse to make a movie. I'll still have to admit that Milla Jovovich is not only a beautiful woman, but she's also a pretty good actress. Even though her role in "Resident Evil" did not require a lot of talent, she's still able, sometimes, to make us share the shivers she plays on the screen.  The points where I would focus a little more are two very important elements in the "Resident Evil" video games. Like I said before, originally, these games were moody and gory. Two major deceptions here. The gore...ARGH! I just can't take it, it's made by computer! This is a message to all directors: If you want to put any gore in your films, do it the old fashioned way. Digital blood looks fake, digital monsters look fake...Even with some very cheap gore/creature effects, you can do a better job than the one they did in "Resident Evil"...the same thing is true in Blade...Every single mutilation in "Resident Evil" was made in CGI, and every single one of them really looks bad. (Spoilers) There's a part where more than half a dozen soldiers are cut in pieces by lasers (and it really deceived me to see that three quarters of the human characters die in two minutes...human characters were the only hope of seeing a gore scene in this film, because the zombies in this film have coagulated blood, which is, for sure, realistic and intelligent, but absolutely not satisfying for the gore fans) and some heads are cut off, some bodies are cut in cubes. But every darn death looks so fake! Even in the excellent low-budget Canadian movie "Cube", the effect with the guy that gets sliced into dices is really, really, really, really, a thousand times better than all of "Resident Evil"'s reunited gore moments. I'm sick of CGI gore...and all CGI made movies...this is removing all the human aspects of movies...people are amazed to see things that were made with computers and almost look real...Yeah, they almost look real, but if they were done like before, they would look even more real! Well, what is the point of being impressed with things that could be a lot more simple and look better if they were done like before...It's not because technology exists that films should overuse it...Technology is a tool, and many film makers don't understand it.  The other aspect, the mood, is not delivered the same way...it's more like a futuristic atmosphere, with a certain lack of terror, a very "Blockbuster" atmosphere, with nothing really eerie. The music is not bad, but it certainly is not as creepy as the one in the games. The zombies are not scary at all, and the other "creatures" are plain laughable.  They kept some elements from the games, and that's a good thing. The city is still "Raccoon City", the train really is identical to the one in the game of "Resident Evil 2", (Spoilers) the city in the end really seems to be an image taken from the game, it's the Umbrella Corporation, etc. But, talking about that ending, which is actually pretty good, I would have seen the whole movie setting in the Raccoon City streets, like we do in the beginning of "Resident Evil 2" (the game).  Overall, I'd say that "Resident Evil" really is a disappointment, especially if you were a big fan of the games, but for those who haven't heard of the games and saw the movie and thought it was good, you should definitely check these games out! "Resident Evil", the movie, is a very common piece of entertainment, that, without being bad, simply offers some acceptable entertainment, some mild thrills, and an easy and agreeable night at the theater. It really is nothing impressive, but it's very ordinary recipe of Hollywood thriller that puts itself under a name that has acquired reputation with the years. Not that bad, but nothing great either.  I give it 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "bunch of commandos sequentially devoured by alien/monster/(insert predator of choice)" movie is almost as ubiquitous as the "bunch of losers rallied into a champion football/baseball/(insert sport of choice) team" movie. But let's face it: nothing in this sub-genre has ever topped "Alien" (except "Aliens") so why bother? Especially when the filmmakers aren't even inspired enough to come up with a new climax or even a new twist ? "There's a traitor among us! Surprise!". Director Paul Anderson's dark and broody "Event Horizon" was legitimately terrifying in places (and a serious improvement on "Mortal Kombat"), but with its red and silver color palette and thumpin' soundtrack, his "Resident Evil" plays more like an overlong commercial for Pepsi Max. Amongst the cast, James Purefoy and Milla Jovovich stand out ? especially Jovovich who overcomes the impediment of a ludicrous costume to at least be convincing. And Eric Mabius gives a superb audition for the title role in "Max Payne" ? with that body, voice and haircut, the guy is a digital sprite... which is no bad thing, if this film foreshadows the future of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't take my word for it (well do, but make your own opinion by seeing it yourself), but Resident Evil is a fantastic movie! If you like a good action, suspense movie this is for you!The technical aspects of the movie are spectacular! Cameras, audio and visual effects all added to the overall helping to create the best movie I've seen in a long long while.The selection of acting skill was done quite well, imho. Just take a look at many of the other films some of these people have done - especially Milla; she's been in some very good movies in the recent past, and her abilities didn't shy away from the challenge in this great piece of art!Some of you might think "Game to movie conversion?!! I don't think so!" But hold off on that thought process. This movie portrays a general mix of the game "stuff" quite effectively. I had my doubts, but they were quickly set aside and discarded upon watching the first few minutes.The "comic bookyness" of the movie was a pleasing minimum. I don't like when movies go overboard in trying to do their special effects, but this movie had the perfect mix of computer graphics and such and reality.I stress that if you've heard any bad commentary on this masterpiece (although I can't imagine why anyone would think anything bad about this movie ;) ), please disregard it until you've seen it yourself - you'll be incredibly pleased you did - It's brilliant!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When are those stupid Hollywood producers just gonna learn, videogames DO NOT translate to the big screen...very well! It's been proven countless times, but they just don't get it...and here we have yet another one..That said, Resident Evil wasn't as big a stinker as some game-to-movie adaptions that I can recall (Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, anyone?). But there's still plenty to pick on...Resident Evil tries really hard to be slick and stylish (like Tomb Raider), but for the most part it falls flat on its face and fails miserably. As one would probably expect, the story takes a backseat (hell, it's not even in the car), and gives way to some hardcore action, lotsa gore, zombies, a mysterious genetic research laboratory, a hella sexy chick in some wicked designer clothes who can sure kick butt, and one macho chick with some big 'tude...and a big gun. That about sums it all up.Oh, and I wanna also say that the special effects absolutely sucked.It could have been better, it could have been worse. As far as videogame-movies go, Resident Evil didn't quite make the grade, in my books. If you're looking for substance (which I doubt you are, given that you are reading this review), look elsewhere. But if you want all of the above, maybe you should check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>too much of a videoclip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had quite some promises in my book, but alas it failed to deliver. **SPOILERS**Horror movies, even bloody action movies, are a rare find these days. Those that do come out are low budget direct-to-video releases and the cinemas are dominated by standard Hollywood fare.Therefor I was excited to hear that a zombie flick was about to hit the movies, but my excitement was short lived.In the first action scene, the music so dominates the picture that I was wondering whether this was a movie, or a videoclip. Sadly enough, this goes on for the entire movie. Whatever happened to atmospheric music that subtly accompanied the picture, the kind where you only realize its importance when you turn it off? Instead of this, we are pleasured with loud rock and rap music.The movie itself could have been much better too. The story is rather flimsy to say the least. (spoiler alert) Most all of the rescue squad dies in the first trap, so there is nobody left to become zombie food. The zombies are slow and drudging, and there is little to be feared from them. Yawn, boring. No excitement, no danger, no threatening monsters. Just slow, walking dead. (end spoiler)Sadly enough, if this is the best horror Hollywood can come up with, they should go back to the standard stuff they churn out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is easily the best creature flick to come out in many years. Not since Aliens have beasties jumped out of the dark (or the corner of your eye) with more scare value. Sure, the story was clearly written on the back of a cocktail napkin, but that doesn't mean it's bad in any way. In fact, apart from the obligatory crawl-through-the-ducts scene the plot is not overladen with cliches and the twists and turns are not swiftly apparent. The two ladies in charge, Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodrigez (sorry, can't spell) are excellent and are an excellent foil for each other. The monsters are cool and the amount of matrix rip-offs are kept to an acceptable minimum. All in all, this is a fun film with lots of jumpy moments and healthy helpings of gore. Expect Night of the Living Dead but with 2 hotties and some CG, and spend 1 and a half happy hours reacquainting yourself with zombie night-life.</fullReview>

Not only does it make you jump twenty times during the film and makes you have nightmares for a month afterward, it is also a great movie that is getting decent reviews. I really like Milla Jovovich in the lead role, she's absolutely gorgeous and she plays the ass-kicking superhero very well. The other characters are good too, but I think some get killed off too soon. Otherwise, this movie is a real suspense film that will make you jump and has an awesome ending too.

		<shortDescription>A fun popcorn movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a difference between a movie and a popcorn movie. A regular movie features decent acting and plot, and usually has some depth behind it. A popcorn movie is just there for the sake of entertainment. There can be good popcorn movies (The Mummy) and there can be bad popcorn movies (Tomb Raider). But, Resident Evil is somewhere in between.Deep underground is secret laboratory called The Hive. The Hive is owned by the Umbrella Corporation, which controls almost 90% of things that the public has in their house. Someone smashes and releases a deadly virus into the air, which gets transported by the air conditioning. In order to stop the virus from getting out, the computer (named The Red Queen) must close off all exits and kill everyone in The Hive, because once you breathe in the virus, or get scratched or bitten by someone who carries it, you are infected. A special military unit is unaware of the virus and assumes that the computer malfunctioned and went homicidal. So they get their team together and head down into The Hive. The team consists of Rain (Michelle Rodriquez), Kaplan (Martin Crewes) and a few other people that have no relevance to the story other than to meet a gruesome demise. This military team takes down Alice (Milla Jovovich), Matt (Eric Mabius), and Spencer Parks (James Purefoy) who will also help to destroy the Red Queen.When they're in The Hive, they find that all of those who died turned into flesh-craving zombies and that the Red Queen was just doing what she had to do. Now the team has to fight their way out. Oh yeah, and they only have one hour to do that in because the door leading out of The Hive will close permanently trapping everyone down there. Plus, there's a giant zombie that looks like a blob running around. Also, there's some Dobermans that look like they were skinned alive.Resident Evil has a very strong first half hour. There's a somewhat brilliant scene where half of the team are trapped in a room with lasers that slice and dice them to bits if they do not get out of the way. The middle of the movie is a jolt-a-minute ride that works only half of the time. Then the ending is downright stupid. The zombies, also, are frightening the first few times they appear, but then the fight scenes that follow all have the same routine.Now, don't get me wrong, Resident Evil is a bad movie, but it's one of those movies that so bad it's good. As a regular movie, it's not worth anyone's time. But as a popcorn movie, it works very well. So, order the large popcorn with extra butter, sit down in the cushy theater seats and check your brain at the door.---------6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that I expected to see a movie geared towards a teen crowd not looking to watch a film, but just to see action. While this isn't the most cerebral out there, it's more than I thought it would be.The bad: Well, at times the action does get tedious and convenient. For example, there's a scene where they get trapped in a room. A laser shines down the room at head level. Then it shines again at head level. Then it shines yet again, but this time forming a criss-cross pattern. Now, this laser is a defense mechanism, so why go for the criss-cross pattern right at the beginning? Why mess around? Things like that and some of the dumber, repetitive action scenes can get annoying.The good: I like movies which throw you into a situation where you are in the dark, and that's where this starts off. From a science lab, we see someone break a vial and leave the lab. From there, it switches to a woman in a mansion. No one knows what's going on (including her), and draws in those people wondering what went on (like me). The story is laid out where you don't feel manipulated and there are enough turns in it that you don't get the feeling that you know what's really going to happen. I also have to admit being surprised about the ending, but I liked it. The acting is what you'd expect, and the score fits well with the scenes.Having not played the game, I can't say how well it takes from the game, but I can say that the movie is accessible for someone who hasn't played the game, and it's worthy of a rental. Bottom Line: It's a good action movie to watch on a Friday night with friends. 7/10 -Mark</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rubbish action. Rubbish horror. I was going to limit my review of RESIDENT EVIL to these two pithy phrases. But when the comment `Well, what were you expecting anyway?' floated in my general direction, I began to bristle at this lazy, time-worn mantra. So what was I expecting, indeed hoping, to get out of this? More. Much more. We simply must learn to be more demanding. I speak as a fan of the original video games, and as a lover of a good Zombie-fest. Yes, I love zombies ? adore the pasty-faced, shambling hordes of Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD, the eerie moth-eaten Templar Knights from the BLIND DEAD series, even Fulci's faintly charming, crumbling undead. And here's the thing ? the zombies in RESIDENT EVIL are just about the most uninspiringly sanitised bunch you could ever (not) hope to bump into. They are a distillation of all the film's failings.Early impressions are favourable, with slick visuals and meaty, evocative sound design. But glossy aesthetics have the capacity to irritate rapidly in the absence of any semblance of plot. Make no mistake, the screenplay is RESIDENT EVIL'S principal Achilles' heel. The lousy dialogue (the one element to have survived intact in the transition from game to film) is further undermined by a limp narrative consisting entirely of one poorly conceived and executed set-piece after another. Characters spend the vast majority of the time running from point A to point B, without thought or ingenuity, to the extent that the viewer is soon faced with a tiresomely uninteresting series of disconnected and repetitive episodes. Things aren't helped along by some very strange continuity decisions, with characters regularly in calm conversation one moment and the next hysterically slamming doors shut in the face of a mutant horde. As though to paper over the glaring cracks, a bombastic electronic / heavy guitar score kicks in every few seconds, often at the most inopportune moments. Suspense and fear arise as much from moments of silence as from noise, but the first, most obvious lesson of horror filmmaking is so obviously and sadly lost on Paul Anderson and co. The undisciplined noise put me very much in mind of TOMB RAIDER, which similarly failed to capture the spirit of the original video games despite superficial similarities in the set design. These video games are primarily solitary experiences, I would venture almost introspective, whereas the celluloid incarnations are anything but, raucous and over-populated. I can just imagine a major studio risking a high-profile franchise with an introspective film light on dialogue and supporting characters, but rich in atmosphere.... not.I've seen the word `splatter' bandied about with reckless ease on these pages. Please don't make me laugh. The gallery of monsters on offer, including the aforementioned zombies, singularly fail to impress, victims of an overly clean, fussy cinematography that imparts a sanitised sheen on everything. The blood-letting is unimpressive and deceptively clinical. Rather like persisting with a dull film in the hope of catching the odd crumb of gratuitous nudity, here I was soon hankering after some proper, sleazy gore to alleviate the tedium. At this point, you know in your heart of hearts that both you and the film are in dire trouble, nay sinking fast. RESIDENT EVIL fails as horror and as action. It's a one-trick pony that is relentlessly noisy and tedious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most remarkably, a counter-gradient atones for the relatively banal plot of ever more devastating and insurmountable enemies getting their due: starting out with a smashing red negligee, Milla Jovovich manages to lose apparel with each new adversary (zombies surpassed by skinned watch-dogs surpassed by even more terrible zombies topped by "the licker" who will surely reappear as Alien V soon), till finally she is about to encounter "the nameless" wrapped in little less than a measly kitchen-towel, offering her the welcome opportunity to repeat her celebrated appearance as Leeloo in Besson's abysmal "Fifth Element": Applying the mathematics of horror to our expectations, a genetically modified dinosaur, long dead and carnivorous now, is the least we want to see her stalked by next, vested in but little else than the shotgun she grabbed before she took to the deserted streets...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie and all I have to say is bring on the sequel. . .No offence whatsoever to Paul Anderson, but I'm hoping the next installment gets passed on to someone like David Fincher. After all this is same man who brought films like The Game, Fight Club, Alien 3, Se7en and the latest Jodie Foster feature "The Panic Room". With the added bonus of non-stop thrills and suspense.Although the movie stayed faithful to the video game I was hoping for greater blood and gore afloat, but I suppose were just going to have to remain with this one till 2 comes around.The only disappointment I had with the film was that Jennifer Love Hewitt (originally casted) left the project two years ago not to mention legendary "Night of the Living Dead" director George A. Romero as this would've restored his credibility status.Milla Jovovich though was really a sight to behold, a bit dumb though with scenes of breaking zombie's necks and fly kicking mutated dogs and a dose of martial arts crap.One thing that impressed me about the movie was the similarities it had to films like Aliens, Demons and of course The Living Dead. Lets just hope that part 2 can dish more with David Fincher at the helm, with more frights and Jumps.Just bring it on!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best zombie movie since Romero's take.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best zombie movie that I've seen since NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1990). And that was twelve years ago now. This movie really delivers the goods. Explosive action sequences, gory zombie kills and some brief unneccesary nudity.*SPOILERS* This is a typical zombie movie. People go in to rescue dying people. Rescue people get trapped. Zombies start attacking them. But yet you wonder where they were when they first got in? This is about the only flaw that I can pick out in this movie. RESIDENT EVIL is a non-stop action horror thriller from start to finish. I never thought we would see Milla Jovovich in a role like this. Not after she did THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC. I thought that after that she would stick to nicey nice movies. But its a good thing she didn't. This movie wouldn't have been the same without her. And maybe its also a good thing that Romera decided not to direct after all. Because his zombie movies are so shallow. You could dive right in and crack your skull. The characters used bad dialouge in his films, language in every sentence (for no reason) and all his characters ever do is get attacked in the same stupid ways. Paul Anderson changed all that. What we have is a build-up to the suspense. We don't just immediately jump right into the zombies eating people. We slowly get to that part. I give RESIDENT EVIL 5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer, I thought it was going to be more imitation of the Matrix, but I was wrong. This movie starts the game off but in another facility which may have been a plot hole since the personnel get turned into zombies, someone would notice that tons of people are missing. The plot is simple and looks like it did come from a B- video game, but hey not all video game plots are complicated (like many people complained about Final Fantasy). The movie itself was not as gory as some may think (Romero wanted stuff like dogs biting through the back of a commando to rip out its heart). The reactions of the commandos when first encountering zombies was perfect since they had no idea what they were getting into. The makeup for the zombies were great especially those that could dislocate limbs for the added effect. Nice! The Red Queen keeps you guessing whether or not it is evil or good or just doing what it was programmed to do. The licker, although did not totally look like the original from RE 2 (and this is before it mutated), it still looked cool. When it mutated, oh my, makes fans ask "Why wasn't it in the game?" The ending which may be obvious but I won't say PERFECTLY sets up for the games to begin and it also answers some mysteries namely the "Nemesis." Kudos Anderson, you made a video game movie worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought I'd see another zombie-drama movie after the 70's or after Michael Jackson's "Thriller". I think it's cheap, non-sense gross bloody scenes. Weak story basis. Funny when it shouldn't: why is Milla Jovovich covering her private parts when she's totally alone in her bathroom? I think that making a horror thriller is one the most difficult task to do for film makers, but I'm sorry, I think that walking-hungry zombies are far from what people wants to see since the 80's zombies. Without the beauty and charm of Milla it had been a flop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" is one of those films that I was expecting with great interest. When the first rumors begun, George A. Romero was in charge of the project. When he jumped out the film, the name of Paul W. Anderson appeared, and everybody thought "That guy rings me a bell...".After some research, you realize Anderson as the director of controversial films such as "Mortal Kombat" or "Event Horizon". And I say controversial because Paul's films have always had such great success and criticism both at the same time. And "Resident Evil" will be the next victim..."Mortal Kombat" was a decent project that came out the same time "Street Fighter" did. I admit both films are not a perfection, but Anderson created a better film than Steven de Souza's one. So, and possibly because of the cheesy adaptation of CAPCOM's videogame, "Mortal Kombat" succeed in the duel, with good special effects and a few kicks and punches."Event Horizon" is one of my favourite movies, combining gore and horror in a very dark atmosphere, which makes this film unique in its genre. It went through the cinemas with little success, but now it's on my TOP10 list. Anderson did a fine job with this movie, helped with the cast crew that were incredible (Sam Neil and Laurence Fishburne).And now we have "Resident Evil". First, I quickly recognized the same dark atmosphere of "Event Horizon" in "RE". This strange way of Anderson to use the colours and the flashbacks, and also some scenarios were exactly reproduced from the videogame saga. The zombie makeup was very good, using CGI to create more realistic details. The Licker... well, if you survived watching the "Brotherhood of the Wolf"'s monster, you'll manage this one :P.Also, the movie has got incredibly good soundtrack: hard rock from Marylin Manson, Fear Factory, Rammstein and many others; and it fits perfectly with the film. And in addition, the movie has got very good rythm of action, so it absorbs you inside.The good points of the film: Milla Jovovich (of course ^_^), Paul Anderson's peculiar style, tons of action, some good scares and brilliant rythm. The bad points: the cast crew doesn't give an incredible performance, the whole plot is quite messy and the ending is too unconcluded (Sequel needed right now!). And in several scenes you can see the microphone (Anderson check out the takes next time, please)!!! :-PWell, if you liked the other Paul Anderson productions (I haven't seen "Soldier", though), you'll really enjoy this one. And if you're also a fan of the videogames, then you'll die for watching "Resident Evil" again and again. Waiting for the RE2! Worth a look! 8/10</fullReview>

This movie based on the popular video game was a horror to watch leading me on a number of occasions to look for a gun or any kind of weapon so I could put an end to my misery. Fortunately for me, there was nothing but stale soda and greasy popcorn. Just when I thought this movie was going to end, it started back up again, did this about 3 different times. The best part of the movie was when the credits were rolling. That and the sexy Mila Jovovich who we do get to see naked yes guys thats right, naked! Anyhow the one redeeming feature about Resident Evil was how it set itself up for for Resident Evil 2 based yes, also on the video game. My pick, 3/10 stars, avoid this film like you would a room full of Undead Zombies </fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of the games I was really looking forward to this film, and now I've seen it and I'm not disappointed at all, this film rocks!!. Set at the beginning of it all in Racoon city, you are eased into the shady world of the umbrella corporation's illegal research into viral weaponry, and we all see the horrific results of this folly. Ok, it has to be said that horror films are by definition, clichéd and generally formulaic, this is no exception BUT, it has been made true to the games, In so much as none of the games ever compromised there 18 certificate, and never held back on the splatter and gore and the film is no exception.Set in a secret underground research facility, the film starts with an act of sabotage. The story really starts moving with the arrival of a crack team from the umbrella corp, who's task is to get in and find out why the facilities main computer has gone homicidal and killed everyone inside. Let the fun begin.....This is a tense, atmospheric horror with plenty of twists and turns, some great effects, plenty of mincing zombies, dark corridors and surprises around every corner.Fans of the game will not be disappointed, horror fans won't be disappointed, and all film fans should see this top film. Oh yes and with a soundtrack featuring Marilyn Manson, you know you're on a winner. Ignore the usual crap and SEE THIS FILM, you wont regret it!!.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a friend who when we watch movies, he refuses to watch horror films because they unnecessarily scare him. Yet,the only video game he seems to enjoy playing is RESIDENT EVIL. He still has yet to explain that stroke of contradiction to me. Then again,this is someone who once told me he doesn't wear a safety belt because he is not afraid of dying,but once when I wanted him to go skydiving with me, he turned me down flat because he said he is afraid of heights. Maybe his logic is that he likes to be in control of a situation if he is going to be afraid of one. I on the other hand,am not a huge fan of video games. At least playing them. These days the graphics and sound are so advanced that I find myself watching them rather than wanting to play them. I do however love watching horror flicks. Surely there could be some sort of horror movie that I could take him to see. Instead of just waiting for a follow up to his favorite game, he found out that it was coming to the big screen and he wanted to see it. Being the hit video game that it was,it came as no surprise that a movie version of RESIDENT EVIL would be highly anticipated. Almost everyone would agree that movies based on popular game franchises are not a successful investment. RESIDENT EVIL is clearly the exception to the rule only because its source material already borrows from a popular horror genre. The right director is employed to make the movie work. While Paul Anderson(MORTAL KOMBAT,EVENT HORIZON)will not give you a subtle, thought provoking film in the vain of MAGNOLIA director P.T. Anderson, he doesn't adopt P.T. Barnum's "there is a sucker born every minute" school of thought either. The film is well aware of its George Romero zombie roots. It pays homage to it while staying close to the plot similarities of the video game. RESIDENT EVIL takes place mostly in the hi-tech underground facility of Racoon City. The evil Umbrella Corporation has a monopoly on all the world's technologies including nuclear,biological and chemical weaponry. Is this supposed to be a sendup of the Phillip Morris companies? Anyhow, the film wastes no time cranking the action level into full throttle. A saboteur in the research and development department meticulously unleashes a deadly virus(in an opening shot similar to the one seen in HANNIBAL) that will annihilate those exposed and turn them into blood thirsty zombies. The facility goes into automatic lockdown and all Hades breaks loose. Enter the super slick response team set up for failure from the word go. The "Hive" is controlled by a HAL 9000-like supercomputer to keep them from getting out. Milla Jovovich(THE FIFTH ELEMENT,THE MESSENGER) and Michelle Rodriguez(THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS)are the heroines who get to do most of the bloody work. sLiPkNoT,Mudvayne and Marilyn Manson,artists who seem to make most of their money playing on soundtracks of horror movies rather than on the radio are on the soundtrack of this one too. RESIDENT EVIL is a fun, in-your-face and ghoulish action pic. Whether you have heard of the video game or not,if you are expecting a fast paced frenzy accessorized by the lush color that blood will provide than this may be your cup of Joe.</fullReview>

Therefore, it presents a convincing and unpredictable plot, what´s indeed rare in this genre. Milla Jovovich is great as an action actress. Perhaps she finally found her ground in movie-making.

		<fullReview>First of all: this is no George A. Romero film. That means, do not expect overly digging in people's intestines. Also, don't look for political metaphores or an indictment of bio-genetic sciences. It's just a classic PC-Game transferred onto the big screens. And for that, "Resident Evil" is one hell of a movie!So, what could you expect when Paul W.S. Anderson went on filming this picture? Here's a director who is not really known for his cineastic masterpieces. Also, the script strictly hangs on to "Alien"-regulations. But for once, Mr. Anderson manages to prevail. The plot screams for action, not for significance or character development. From the first moment, the movie is just pure adrenalin.Both Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez, are known as talented and attractive actresses. They don't have to prove anything, so they don't start doing Shakespeare where no overly acting is required. You just feel, that they had much fun during the shooting, and they operate excellent, with Rodriguez as the Vasquez-like exterminatrice and Jovovich as Alice, left in a nightmarish wonderland. Besides, they both are refreshingly sexy!When I saw the movie in my favourite cinema in Berlin, it had the whole audience at the edge of their seats from the first scene. I'm pleased that all the scary scenes work without too much brain ripping and blood spilling. It's a straight and entertaining horror-movie, with a music score that is just a bit too extreme. But I strictly recommend it too anyone who waited all these years to finally see a good zombie-movie again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I submit my opinions on this movie let me say... I have only played Resident Evil 2 of all the video games, but I loved it, and my savaging of the movie may in some parts be unfair because I base this review on expectations arrising from the game, and other things.Now Im a huge fan of George Romero, he is the grand-daddy of zombie, and he always will be, his movies envoke a sense of claustrophobia, terror and realism (ironic I know, but if zombies did take over the earth I picture it like he does) that few other directors can accomplish, with perhaps exceptions of Dario Argento and early Wes Craven. So naturally when I found out he WASN'T directing this movie (I don't know the full story why, or if he ever was - it might have been a rumour I don't know)anyway needless to say I was dissapointed, I thought this would be perfect filler until the rumoured "Twillight" ends his Dead trilogy, so yeah, maybe I am biased before even watching this movie, but Im also going to give my view of the movie from the other perspective - as a regular movie rather than as something I had expectations for.Firstly, as far as this movie goes, the plot was very over the top, the characters two dimensional and the dialog was well, limited, the special effects were fantastic, I wont give away any specifics because I want this review to be spoiler free, but suffice to say it employs very good use of CGI effects and a lot of splatter, enough to keep all but the real die hard gorehounds happy. However, basically this movie can be summed up as Mission Impossible with Zombies, the zombies playing very much second fiddle for the first part of the movie. To be perfectly honest the whole thing seemed to me to just be a very lengthy trailer for the sequel, but perhaps thats a good thing, because its got me wanting to see the sequel, and I hated the original... I think because the way its all set up the sequel will probably be closer to what I was expecting of this movie. I very much expected this movie to have the same creepy feeling as the game, confused and lost wandering around unravelling piece by piece the mystery and all the while strange things going on.. which in a way it did, but it didnt play on it. Romero would have given it this creepiness and tension, and that would have been excellent, much better than all the cgi effects, technology on display and tomb raider-esque action.It could have been so goooooood, with a stronger plot while still basing it on the game, a little of the claustrophobia and nervous energy of Alien 3 (yes people didnt like it much but my god it was incredible for atmosphere), the terror and suspense of Dawn Of The Dead, another fantastic movie at keeping you hooked... would the zombies learn how to do things, could they survive forever, could they escape etc, and Day of the Dead, which might not have been the superior movie but it got the atmosphere just right like alien 3, and even a little extra blade 2 style ass kicking for good measure. And thats exactly what I expected, Romero to move with and be influenced by the times and to direct a tense, frightening gore packed action cracker But, alas, it was not to be, and we got that Mission Impossible with Zombies thing I talked about earlier. Still, lets hope they manage to Blade 2 the sequel and make the second film the movie the first should have been, oh and George, buddy, if your reading, give em a hint if your not too busy completing the 4th installment of your masterpiece :)4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is what you should know before going to see the movie..Two things.. One, forget its a video game movie, that is a non-factor..a mute point.. the movie can stand on its own with or without the video game preceeding it.Two, remember it is a zombie movie! Don't go into it expecting clean cut dialogue and an oscar winning cast..If you can remember the second you will enjoy this movie, (if you can't accept the fact it is what it is than don't go see it to begin with). For a Horror/Zombie movie I think it was very well done. I am a huge fan of Dawn of the Dead.. While Resident Evil is definitely not Dawn of the Dead it is hands down the closest thing to it in years if not since.This is a good movie, with smooth flow and solid action sequences. The soundtrack/score can get a little overbearing after awhile.. but it doesn't take from the enviroment of the movie..While the special effects aren't stunning they are far from disappointing.. and the overall performance of the plot/acting/characters is very solid..The only thing I take away negative from the viewing of this movie is the character of Rain (Michelle Rodriguez)..I don't know if I should blame her acting, the directors perspective, or the writing for the character in general but it was very weak and something that could have been improved immensely..Overall, if you are looking to see a solid horror flick, with its fair share of startles and gore you could definitely do worse.. You should also catch it while it is in the theater.. this is a film which can take advantage of the big screen and audio systems..My Ratings (3 scales) : 7 of 10 / 3 of 4 / B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a great fan of the games, I know about them and have spent a few hours in front of them. Not that they are bad but I did lack the time.The movie acctually manages to capture the feeling of the games, very well indeed. The hopeless situation and the dejectedness of the people trying to survive. The movie also has a game like look and feel to it in the beginning. Watch the first scenes with Milla in the mansion and tell me if you agree...The game style diminishes when the action picks up in pace though. And it really do keep a nice pace trough the rest of the film.I was afraid that the end would spoil the movie in some way but it acctually lifted the overall impression one notch!One thing (the thing?) that I think could have been done better or even have been left out was the "Big Monster". It wasn't really state of the art and didn't really fit in. It didn't affect the overall feeling though and I can live with it.The story is good, it follows the original story with the evil Umbrella company performing illegal experiments and the effects of them is what we see. Screenplay lacks some but this isn't a drama, it's action so it doesn't really shine trough. Even the effects aren't that spectacular but they don't need to be. Less is more. Finally the movie score, I loved it! Hard, fastpaced and matched the movie close to perfectly.This is proof that computer games (console rather...) do make great movies. Just give the idea to the right person!7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil is a great horror movie. It was amazing! The zombies freaked me out, the dogs were very scary, and the other thing was scary. Michelle Rodriguez did a great job as Rain. I liked her tough attitude. Milla Jovovich was great as Alice. Rain was always tough and never scared but it would have helped if we knew more about her. Alice was always trying to help out and beat zombies. The movie takes you through a chilling look at "The Hive" after the deadly T-virius infects everybody down there. The comando team has three hours to stop the virius from infecting the whole world. They also come upon some incredible things. If you want a movie to scare you out of your seat, then you might want to watch Resident Evil.</fullReview>

As far as it being like the games: it's got a compilation of characters.I personally didn't like the game (well at least the first one) but, the movie kicked-ass!

		<fullReview>This film is extremely bad... among the worst I've ever seen. But I loved it anyway. The script was just terrible. I mean, the plot is extremely flimsy, not one character in the film is worthy of the term, and the whole thing is just a big budget excuse to to make a movie about zombies. It doesn't have any of the tension of the original video game, it doesn't have any of the characters of the original game, and, in fact, it bears remarkably little resemblance to the game at all. Some people seem to think it's a prequel to the game. I don't understand how that works, exactly. I mean, the end of the movie looks exactly like the beginning of Resident Evil 2 (the game), so it's a prequel to the game's sequel. I don't know. But don't think about it. Just enjoy the cheese. Like that elevator scene in the beginning. Tremendous. So bad you can't help but love it. The whole audience cheered when that happened. Great. Just to illustrate how little this film cared about it's characters, I'd like to point out that Alice's name is never mentioned on screen until the final credits. I actually stayed in the theater and waited because I wanted to know her name. Apparently, she didn't want to know. Because even after meeting someone she believed knew her, she didn't ask. Of course, that begs the question why was she suffering amnesia at all? From a production point of view, it's a convenient (if hackneyed) way to introduce suspense. Or maybe, since the story was so bad, they wanted to conceal it from the audience for as long as possible. So, give your protagonist amnesia, and suddenly, none of the characters know what's going on, so the story doesn't present itself to the audience until long after the zombie brain-munching buffet has begun. But, from a fictional point of view, why would the computer have done that? Trust me, though, that is absolutely the smallest one of many, many plot inanities. This movie it truly wretched. Unless you have a soft spot for big-budget b-movies starring talented actors masquerading as vacuous eye-candy, stay far far away. But like I said, I loved it.</fullReview>

I even noticed similar sound effects and background music at certain points of the movie!For all of you Resident Evil fans out there, go see it! You won't be disappointed!

		<fullReview>If we look back to previous video game to film conversions, then you know straight away not to set your sights too high. Even the greatest game can be turned into the worst film with ease.But this isn't the case with Resident Evil. Paul W Anderson has done an excellent job of taking everything that made the games outstanding, and bringing them to life before our eyes.Rather than trying to follow any of the Resident Evil titles, it begins with the initial biohazard alert, where the humans begin to mutate into flesh eating zombies(!). This sets up the scene for great set pieces, like for example when the military, deep in the factory core, are making their way through a tunnel with darting lazers halting their progress.Of course the film is silly, with tongue firmly set in cheek, but at only one real point does it go over the top, with Milla Jovovich's, Matrix style, kung fu kick in the face of a zombie dog hot on her heels.People have said that it leaves itself at a point for the sequel, but in my opinion the film does not set itself up at all, merely just as a starting point for where the games start.Obviously if you don't like horror-type films, this probably won't be for you, but I enjoyed it, and found it much better than expected. Just remember not to take this stuff seriously, eh kids?A generous:- 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, don't expect any surprises of this Movie. Its a straight made, oldschool Horrorstory about a Team which enters a freaky Area and gets decimated. Except the fact that Millaaaaa (YESSSS;)!) doesn't remember who she is, there aren't many new fresh ideas to see. But that's not bad in this case. This movie doesn't try to be innovative, it is consequently straight. There are no senseless talkings, no absoutely stupid love story and noone acts like a fool just to make something bad happen. But bad things happen, and every bad thing that happens is made with much love. There is this really nasty Horrormaincomputergirl which shows a really beasty behavior, there are those lovely undying zombies, those really dangerous looking creepdogs and this odd monsters from these crates. Sounds really ridicoulous but its good mixed and everything fits.I think it's like eating at Grandma ! You get the food at every cheap restaurant, but from Grandma it just tastes better.Ah and I like the really fine end. FINALLY not this Hollywoodlike going out of the House straight in the Morning sun the Boyfriend right in the Hand and everything is good.And at last its just another fine movie with Millaaaaaaaaaa (YESSS;)!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil might look like an ordinary 21 century action/horror, but there's more to it than you'd ever expect!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer to the Resident Evil movie, I actually became a little bit disappointed. It didn't seem to have much with the different video games to do. Except for the original plot "An evil company, releases a massive virus which turns humans into living dead".Though now, after I've seen it, I'm really surprised with the amount of places and objects you find simular with the objects and places of the different games. Even some scenes seems to be taken from the Games. As for me, who have played all of the games, that is very amusing. Still Resident Evil isn't just a good movie based on some video games.My words are simple. Resident Evil might look like an ordinary 21 century action/horror,but there's more to it than you'd ever expect. The Story is so intense and the actors are really doing a great job, including the Zombie actors. It was a long time ago we've got a really good Zombie movie, but now we are liberated. :DTo finalize it all, I will rate it. Really I would like to give it 10/10, but there's something that gave me the feeling om incompleteness. It is indeed a superb film, but they could've at least given us 40 minutes more of Zombies and terror. So therefor I will give it 8/10 and pray that they bring us another Resident Evil movie, this time based on the first games' story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looks like a zombie shoot-em-up! But the biggest surprise about Resident Evil was that it was actually a pretty good movie.It wasn't all that suspenseful, but one of its many virtues is that it never talked down to the audience. The plot always remained under a veil, and the audience, along with the main character, never gets to see the whole of it together.There's a fair amount of gore here. Don't kid yourself. This is a zombie shoot-em-up. As such, it has pretty good dialogue, characterization, and plotting. Don't go in expecting something that will change the world, but do go in expecting a pleasant, mildly thrilling action flick, with lots of exploding bodies and bloodbaths.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There maybe a type of SPOILER in this commentary!!!!! beware... As video game movies go this one is pretty good. There are some excellent scares in this move, so I highly recommend it to those who crave those sort of things. So it's a pretty good little horror movie too, but not as good as it could be. Obviously like most horror movie this one is about over coming terrible odds, in this case (SPOILER maybe) zombies. They do not win enough against the zombies for me. There isn't that extra fun kick that you get when you know the main characters are going to make it and kick ass doing it. I need that to really get over the stress I feel with all the excellent "Boo!!"s there are in this movie. And you need it for some really good dramatic tension, and that's just not there. It seems really plodding when it simply goes from one scare to another, with no hope it seems. So all in all, see it if you love horror movies, lots of tension and good cinematography. However if you need more I wouldn't recommend it.</fullReview>

But now I have seen all the movies she has been in, and she is a fine actress.

		<fullReview>I am all about Resident Evil; I have played and beaten every game in the series. Perhaps I have carry bit of a bias. Anyhow, I took my lady friend out to see it. I will admit that near the beginning of the film I jumped more than she did, and she called me out on it too. I was happy with the start, middle and finish of the film, it rolled right along. The plot also contained nice little twists, which actually made for a pretty good story. However I was a bit disappointed with the suspense of the film. While it did have some moments that kept your heart beating loudly and strongly, I just felt like it lacked the overall suspense that the games held. Being a big fan of Dawn of the Dead (zombie killing classic), I didn't know what to think of the zombies in Resident Evil. I would describe them as an army undead tenacious Heroin attics, refusing to be taken down. You can tell director Paul Anderson had some influence from Romero's masterpiece Dawn of the Dead. There is a scene in RE that is nearly lifted right from Dawn of the Dead (the near suicide attempt if you are familiar). Bottom line - If you are a fan of Resident Evil, you appreciate this movie, more importantly, you will LOVE the ending. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder why some people bother financing movies like Resident Evil.Honestly, it had some potential, however it ended up being an annoying and disappointing movie. I thought i should list a couple of reasons why one might not wanna go watch Resident Evil:1) The amazingly ridiculous flying kick by mila jovovich, fatalizing a messed up leprous dog in the process.2) Michelle Rodriguez, damn... i don't really know why people employ her in movies, but the way she talks and looks at the other actors is quite irritating...well... some people might really like her attitude, but in my opinion, her acting is pretty much like cheap trance music: repetitive. and ANNOYING!!!!3) The first video game was such a masterpiece, well... it was slow... but as not as boring as the movie. At least it took place in a haunted house. In RS -the movie, they tell you right away what's causing all the weird evil crazy stuff... and the locations used reminded me more of a pointless van damme sci fi movie than of the house in the original game. [i'm sorry, my arguments might seem pretty weak, but i had such a bad experience at the theater yesterday night... i don't even want to play the devil's advocate here...)4) Special effects were not that great, and the resident-evilish creatures were pretty sad... well, i felt ripped off...5) the directors try to freak you out by suprizing the audience every 5 minutes. it was pretty effective at the beginning of the film, but let me tell you, after 25 minutes of false alerts, you get really annoyed... yeah... basically... that's it... the movie is annoying, how many times do i have to write it? if you like action movies, go watch iron monkey or something, if you like sci fi, just go watch, i dunno.... ET... or alien. if you like nice looking girls, well, mila jovovich gets pretty "uglified" towards the end of the movie, and you're pretty much stuck with her and rodriguez, whose sweaty face and greasy hair really ANNOYED me. you're better off renting "bring it on" or some other chick flick if you really want to check out...actually, i have other good reasons for not wasting time and money watching RE, but i'm gonna sound even meaner, so i think i should stop here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Warning: Spoilers contained)This movie has everything that a horror movie should: Guns, gore, chicks, and so much more. It is absolutely the best horror movie that I have seen in a long time (the only others remotely close are by John Carpenter or George A. Romero).The outline is basic: We are given some info about the Umbrella Coorporation. Someone steals and releases the virus in the Hive. Red Queen "kills" everybody. (From here on out, it kicks ass)A military unit is sent to investigate the deaths. First the recruit a security guard with a memory problem, Alice. Next, they capture a cop, and recruite the security guards "husband. They enter the hive via train. They search the hive, finding several labs flooded. In an effort to shut down Red Queen, a really cool laser defense system kills five of the eight commandos. Matt and Alice do manage to shut her down. One small problem: When shutting the bitch down, they let the former lab workers out. They soon discover they are hard to kill. Plus, the Licker escapes. In an effort to learn more, the five people in the hive Alice, the cop, the husband, and the two surviving commandos reactivate Red Queen (Her holographic image is creepy.) She tells them that the T-Virus can bring dead cells back to life. In the process, though, only certain motor functions are retained, and the creatures have the urge to eat. Now, the group has less than an hour to get out of the hive, get an antivirus, discover who released the virus, who was trying to bring the company down from the inside, and try not to die, or else they get stuck in the hive. Needless to say: Alice and the Cop are the only two to make it out alive. In the process, cop boy was scratched by the licker. Just before Alice can give him the T-Virus antivirus, some Umbrella Guys carry him off, and they use the good line: "We will use him for the Nemesis project".Alice is taken to a hospital, where she wakes up by herself. She walks outside, and Racoon City is almost completely destroyed. We see a newspaper, "The Dead Walk!". Alice grabs a shotgun, and wearing only two pieces of paper and a lab coat, the camera pulls out. The End.It is an amazing movie, one you must see to believe, and i cannot wait for a sequel and for it to come out on DVD. Damn!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had not wanted to see this flick. The trailer sucked big time, I have never played the games, and I think Michelle Rodriguez is one of the worst actresses in the biz. I also did not find Milla Jovovich as attractive as most horror reviewers thought. Zombie movies aren't my favorite, and all this future stuff makes me sick. Haven't we had enough of the future? My god it's 2002, let's worry about 2002, not 2234. And why can't one director have the guts to change the way we see the future. Every one's god damn future is exactly the same! Shinny walls, computers with brains, stupid people, etc. But that's a whole different subject so back to Resident Evil.I sat and watched, not interested in the whole long explanation of what was happening on the earth at this time. I found myself asking questions like "I wonder how much Panic Room will make this weekend," and "I gotta buy The Book of the Dead DVD fast!" Which is strange since the man only talked for about 45 seconds. When he shut the hell up, I cleared my mind, and watched. I thought, "Oh my god, a camera with a brain," but I got myself fully focused when the dumb ass in the elevator got crushed. Now that's what I was looking for in this film. After all the action with the releasing of the virus, Milla Jovovich's character is introduced in this long drawn out scene. How the hell long does it take this girl to stand up! So far, so... well... decent.Well I don't want to go on with this play by play commentary so let me get to the goods. My view on Michelle Rodriguez didn't change one bit! Man, what a horrible actress. I also found it strange that this character is not at all like her character from The Fast and the Furious, yet she acts exactly the same in both! Now if that isn't the sign of a versatile actress, I don't know what is! However aside from the horrible dialogue she is given, and her horrible acting I found interest in her character. This fad of ass-kicking, take charge women seems to be continuing, and god damnit I love it!Milla Jovovich still isn't as attractive as she is made out to be (Well at least not in this film), and still not a very enthusiastic actress. Whenever she does a strenuous punch, or kick she gives off a little tennis player grunt (That little annoying: uh!), rather than an "I'm kicking your ass" scream (AHHHH) that I like from the woman who might soon be kicking my ass. But I'm sure she made her brother proud (For those of you who don't know, Milla has said in more than one interview that the main reason she wanted to play this part was to impress her brother.), kicking those zombies asses.I also gotta' ask how stupid can these people be. The guy sees this pale thing, limping along, blood dripping out of it's mouth, obviously not human, and he puts his gun up and says, "Stop, I'll shot." And continues saying this and that "I mean it!" that is said in all these types of movies, when it is obvious the character doesn't actually mean it. This zombie pretty much could have taken a bite out of his arm, and he just would have kept saying "Don't move. I'll shot! I mean it!" And the amount of time it took these people to realize these things are not human is incredible! Maybe they were supposed to look and act more human, but they went overboard on the makeup and overacted or whatever, but come on Milla, and Michelle! Your shooting at the thing, and he just stumbles. The thing ain't Superman babe, get a clue!Now you are all probably thinking, "My god, he hated it!" but I didn't! No, I was actually incredibly surprised at the entertainment factor of the film, and did, for the most part, enjoy it from start to finish. The bad dialogue made me laugh, the bad acting made me smile, and the stupidity of the characters made me yell at the screen. And I had a blast doing all of that. What did I particularly enjoy about the flick? Well for one the zombies. Very pretty, nice and bloody, and they didn't get any extras that were too bad (like the nurse zombie in Dawn of the Dead). The violence was also well done, not overdosing on the gore, and making it almost unwatchable, but putting in just enough to put a HUGE smile on my face when the characters I hated got killed.And I gotta talk about "The Licker." I loved it! Sure it looked extremely fake, but I thought Anderson did a smart thing by keeping it mostly off camera, and not showcasing his film's bad special effects like many other films do (Brotherhood of the Wolf comes to mind). But I also wish he would have put up a little bit more of a fight. The thing was huge, and he dies pretty quickly, and easily. And how about the highly entertaining death scenes. Woah, those were fun. Like I already mentioned the gore was nice, and that laser sequence was great.Thumbs up to Paul Anderson for his imaginative, and stylish direction. I know it would not have been the same with a different director (It would have been much worse, or much better). Even though I hated that stupid "Red Queen," the POV shots were nice (But couldn't they have come up with a better name for that thing? I don't know if it was in the game or not, but Red Queen? It's a computer/camera for gods sake! How about "The Computer." Personally I don't want to live in the future if we name our computers "The Red Queen.") The score was also a plus, getting me into the film even more. Very loud, very mean, and very nice. And the ending set up the sequel, and did a damn fine job in the process. I loved it!Overall, Resident Evil was a surprise. I expected it to suck, and although it TECHNICALLY did, there is no denying I loved it. Highly, highly, highly entertaining, gory, violent, and just all around fun. Check it out if you want fun, and some pretty bad performances. 7/10</fullReview>

It was well made but it's not my type of movie. I know nothing of the game itself, but this is no TombRaider, this is horror, so be warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is awesome! I've played the games, so i like it a lot more then some others might, but this movie is a non-stop action thriller. Zombies jumping out at you. Monsters crawling in the dark. a virus on the loose! It doesnt get much better then that! milla jovavich is so cool in this movie. as well as all of the co-stars. there is a lot of character development, some twists and back stabbings in the plot. it's what the previews all say "100 minutes of non-stop terror!" I recommend this to anyone who saw THE FIFTH ELEMENT, SHERE, or new films like BLADE 2 and QUEEN OF THE DAMNED. u all gotta' see this movie. i was on the edge of my seat the whole time!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most video game turned movies turn out terrible. Often times, even worse than that. Here however, it actually turns out alright. Why? Because instead of taking ever bit of the game titles and throwing it into a movie that appeals (and makes sense) only to fanboys, Resident Evil stands well on its own as a horror/suspense movie. To be fair, the acting is pretty stiff. Shakespeare its not. However, it definitely has its share of scares and times when stuff just pops up. The plot is surprising well put together, the music creepy, the zombies (this is a zombie movie in the vein of Evil Dead)well done. Basically, the bottom line is, if you want to go see a classic horror movie redone with Milla Jovovich then its a great movie to see. Its plain and simple fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched it today at my local cinema, and was totally blown away by everything. Terrific action, suspense, blood and guts, cool special effects, all the right combination that made the game of the same name so popular. A salute to the director.Although I was a bit disappointed that Jill Valentine and all the familiar characters from the videogame wasn't there. Maybe the reason why, I guess, was to avoid the plot predictability like 'oh she's gonna die soon' and 'oh, that one will live' and the likes. But as a fan of the game series also, I was glad that there are some references like the T-Virus, zombie dogs, walking dead, the deadly licker, underground base, labs, the transport train. There is one scene when the protagonist was escaping the facility which would ring some deja-vu to those who played the game.On to the cast, Milla Jovovich who somehow adds some femme fatale to her role - as she did likewise in the Fifth Element, Michelle Rodriguez (Fast and the Furious) reprises her tough girl role. Kudos to all those who played the commandos and zombies, and also the childlike Red Queen.All in all, i am just waiting here for the next sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil is an action movie dressed up as a zombie horror flick. It has pretensions to being in the same gory category as George Romero's classic Day of the Dead. In fact Romero was originally slated to direct Resident Evil. He left the production and a fellow named Paul Anderson took over. They made the right choice. Anderson made a nifty joy ride of a movie with nothing in its brainless little head than to help you waste ninety minutes.Resident Evil is the type of movie where momentum trumps plot. This is not to say that story is unimportant. You need enough substance to involve the audience in the mayhem but not so much that they will accidentally start thinking. This movie has just enough characterization to make you worry about the fate of the actors and just enough plot to give them something to do. Something goes `Horribly WrongT' at a vast underground biological research facility. All the lab personnel die and provide a pool of hungry zombies. A crack paramilitary commando squad goes in to find out what happened. That's about it for the plot. That's all you need, really, to string the action sequences together. Okay, yes, there are some subplots involving corporate espionage, love and betrayal but most of that just gets lost in the noise. All you have to know to enjoy the proceedings is that the good guys have to go from point A to point B without becoming hors-de-oeuvres.The acting rises to the occasion but not much farther. A fellow named Colin Salmon does look like he's destined for better stuff. Salmon plays the head commando and manages to stand out in his brief screen time. Milla Jovovich, on the other hand, never seems anything more than the glamour puss she really is. Not that she gets much help from the script or costume department. Now bear in mind that these zombies are suppose to be highly contagious. One scratch and you're a shambling mess. Ms. Jovovich, supposedly a highly trained security expert, goes into battle wearing a spaghetti-strapped purple mini dress. I suppose the thigh high Doc Martins provided some protection but still.anyway, Jovovich has a likable screen presence and does the requisite kickboxing moves with passable flair.Michelle Rodriguez, now, looks as if she knows one end of an Uzi from another. She does go into battle wearing Kevlar but the ancient rules of dramaturgy being what they are; she eventually takes it off so we can see her t-shirt. To be fair, Rodriguez does a good job. She shows more personality than Jovovich and is believable in a highly contrived situation.Despite the zombies you can watch Resident Evil without gagging on your popcorn. Gore is not Resident Evil's bag. The zombies here are a civilized lot. They do their feeding politely off camera. Yes, there is plenty of blood being splattered around but not much more than you'd see in your average Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.Resident Evil is one of those borderline movies that are fun to watch but don't bear much discussion. Should you see it? Well, if your favorite movie of the last ten years was Room With A View then there are other films you should see. If you're in the mood for a swiftly paced, brainless action flick however, then you can't go wrong with Resident Evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Film Interpretation Of The Video Game.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly, I had my hesitations about this film. I really, really wanted to like this movie, but the way some magazines and on-line sites were talking about the plot synopsis (a computer turning people into the undead and not the game's T-Virus), I had some concerns. Fortunately, after seeing the film, my concerns were eased, and such rumors didn't come to pass.This film now resides in my "Top 3" (Mortal Kombat and Final Fantasy being the other two) of video game based films. And this is how the film should be looked at: A film that relies on a video game for its source material and story set-up. The film starts out slow, offering background information on the Umbrella Corporation, and introducing the viewer to the victims caught up in a situation they were ill-prepared to handle. The scenes (especially the Hive map layout) are set up like a video game. Again, for this type of film, it can get away with this and work properly if kept in that frame of mind. Once the zombies appear, the tone of the film gets much more intense, especially with scenes from some of the game's more "popular" enemies.For a horror film, it's not as gory as I would have expected. It does have its fair share of "gross" moments, but succeeds more in some good old fashioned jumps and false "gotcha" scares scattered throughout the film. What really surprised me was that the film actually had some brief flashes of nudity in it. Then again, this really isn't a movie for kids, and I'm glad this wasn't dumbed down to be so.The acting was decent, introducing new characters to the RE world (which kept things unpredictable as to who lived and who died, which made it more interesting in my opinion), and being the same director who did the original Mortal Kombat film, it was filled with plenty of flashy fight scenes to fast music. What really sat well with me in regards to this film is that the movie made plenty of subtle references to elements from the games (the crows, Nemesis, the mansion, limited ammo comments, etc.) without screaming to the audience "Hey, this prop is also from the game! This scene is just like the game! We included everything whether it needed to be there or not just to keep RE fans happy!" While I'm sure some people would have delighted in seeing the protagonists pushing around statues and opening doors with playing card-shaped keys, the movie rewards the die-hard fan with plenty of references if they look hard enough. The feel of the game was captured without going overboard.Granted, some people have likened the film to "Aliens" and "Night of the Living Dead", but that's something of a moot point. Yes, there are similarities, and no the story isn't the most original thing out there, but the game series does take inspiration from such films to enhance the tension for the game. Basing these elements from the game for a movie only makes things come full circle. The film is meant to capture the feel of the game and provide some entertainment while it's at it. In that regard, it succeeds in what it sets out to do.So is it worth it? If you enjoy the games, then yes. It's fun, it's got its creepy moments, it's got a great ending sequence (excellent "closure" for the film, if you can call it that), and hopefully the sequel won't go the way of the second Mortal Kombat film (read: bad).Hopefully, there will be a Director's Cut DVD. I have a feeling that some scenes were cut out of this. Excellent popcorn fare, and a future addition to my DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A matter of taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading through the other reviews I noticed that everybody was expecting something different. No, Resident Evil is not original - in fact, it's pretty corny. Acting, story and special effects are not worth any awards and it's not a complete splatter-festival either.But for some sick reason I've always enjoyed horror movies and of course prefer to see them on the big screen. And for that reason I went to see Resident Evil and wasn't disappointed - it's what I had hoped for, nothing more and nothing less.I'd rate Paul Anderson's last movie Event Horizon slightly higher, since I'm especially a sucker for SciFi/Horror and apart from Alien there's not much on the market to shout about, with Event Horizon being a reasonable effort. Still, Resident Evil is fine for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, pay no attention to the 7.0 rating. If you have any good taste and think good movies have to have actual plots, actual characters, and some decent dialogue, do not see this movie, because it's horrible.The main actors in this movie have done much better work (Milla: 5th element, Michele: girlfight), and everyone else in the movie was pretty much just there to be killed or take up space. There weren't exactly charcters. I didn't even catch any of their names. There was hardly any dialogue except for the usual "What is that?!" or the pathetic comedic one liners from Michele. We learn absolutely nothing about the characters themself, because, once again they weren't characters.OK OK I know that's alot to expect from a video game adaption (is it though?). I mean, going into see this movie I was at least hoping for some decent zombie stuff to happen. But there was nothing! The zombies looked like people picked up off the street, covered in flour and ketchup and told to scream at milla jovovich. Even the computer generated thing that got out from it's cage, whatever it was, was pretty bad looking, not a memorable creature at all.So basically it all adds up to this: Pretty much everything in this movie has been done before AND better:Zombies: "Dead Alive", "Evil Dead"; Butch Pretty Girl Heriones: "Alien", "Terminater 2";The Laser Sequence: "Cube"; CGI Monsters: "The Relic", "The Mummy", "Lord of the Rings";Boring Characters (if you could call them that), Dull Plot, Bad Acting, Bad Editing, Bad Visual FX, Bad Dialogue... etc etc etc.HOWEVER I did like the dog sequence. The dogs were OK looking, and the whole slow motion kick was done pretty well I think. Only if they had more of that and better characters and zombies.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sleeping beast awakens, horror is finally back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the recent crap cakes that hollywood has tricked people into thinking is "horror" or even more disturbing: letting people forget what decent horror films are about entirely, giving the impression that films like "Scream" are actually half decent, let alone watchable at all, comes a breath of fresh air. Resident Evil shows us what we have almost come to forget: old school horror with a stylish flair enough to separate it from the 80's horror films it selectively borrows from. I am not going to sit around and complain it wasn't gory enough, although there definately could have been more gore involved. I will say that it is definately a step in the right direction. Hopefully, if this film does well, we can hope to see more bold attempts at anything with the slightest backbone other than crappy 90210 mock slasher films, that do nothing but slowly kill the horror genre while it sleeps. Hopefully on that note, this would be more the awakening of a sleeping giant. Something that was missing in our cineplexes like it was in our minds.. something that didn't have a guaranteed appeal and took chances at reconnecting its audience with the main artery of why people go to see a horror film, albeit one based on a video game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard good things about this movie. That it was a video game movie that worked, that it was actually scary. It is with great disappointment, then, that I must report that Resident Evil was none of those things. There are so many problems with this film. The main one being that all the characters and performances are excruciatingly one-note. The worst of the bunch is Michelle Rodriguez who never strays from that horrible scowl she has on her face the entire film. Milla Jovovich, while nice to look at, gives a dull and lifeless performance. The rest of the cast is simply forgettable. This movie ends with a set-up for a sequel which LOOKS to be more promising than this one, but if Paul Anderson is in charge forget it. This doesn't measure up in any aspect to the classic George A. Romero zombie trilogy. This movie takes the genre that Romero practically invented, (and which the video games admirably payed homage too) and destroys it. Please Mr. Romero make a new zombie film to erase the awful memory of this sorry excuse for a movie about the walking dead! Either that or I'll just have to watch Dawn of the Dead again and again and again and again.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just when I'm getting immersed in the story, the movie is over! "Resident Evil" easily holds the title for the best "video game movie" (which isn't hard to do). Apparently, Paul Anderson didn't ignore what video game fans didn't like about the movie version of "Mortal Kombat". But he basically took a crappy script for RE and modified it to be coherent with the video game storyline. He did a decent job, but RE still can only be considered "good, for a video game movie". One negative aspect is that many of the plot elements that were developed over the span of four video games (over 12 hours of game time) are quickly introduced in the movie. The buildup becomes too redundant for RE fans, and too confusing and slow for newcomers. Alice, the main character, is never developed enough for us to really have any reason to care about her. There are glimpses about who she is that build interest, but are not explored enough. In the games, the characters always still had a mystery that was not explained at the end, but the character was developed enough that the player felt they knew the character. Unfortunately, this isn't the case with the movie. The music also wasn't as effective as the music in the games (especially RE2).On the plus side, the movie does do some things the games never did. The movie made me more truly feel the terror of seeing a person eaten alive by zombies (this is a great zombie flick). The movie also has many references to the games, and begins to explain some parts of the existing plot. This is the first video game movie that at least looks like its makers have actually taken the time to play the video game. But the most exciting part is the end! Just when it's getting really good, it's over. It's like it's only Disc 1 of the movie. There had better be a sequel, or this movie will end up being just another "video game movie". As long as Capcom doesn't decide to contradict the storyline with future games, and the new script follows from this movie, the sequel will make this movie better, and it will be a sweet movie itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally...a decent horror flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well it's about time! After plunking down good money to sit through crapola like "The Haunting" and "The House On Haunted Hill", it's refereshing to see a good horror flick come out that caters to this generation of "it's gotta be loud and it's gotta move fast". I would never compare this film to a "Night of the Living Dead", but I will say that for the matinee bucks that I paid for it, I got every cent worth.I went into this film really looking for a good escape. I had very low expectations and really almost considered not even seeing it. But the main character is pretty hot and the trailor looked somewhat decent so I figured I would give it a shot. I'm glad I did! Low on plot development and high on pacing, this movie takes you on a good ride right from the start. Not being a "gamer", I had no idea what the video game is about and so I didn't really know what to expect (unlike "Tomb Raider", which I did know a little about, and WOW did THAT movie suck?). I was pleasantly suprised by the way they introduced the main character. She doesn't know who she is either, so as the film develops we learn more and more about her and this makes it easier for the viewer to fall into the general plot of the film. Very nicely done! The opening sequence was very cool! Stealing a bit of Stephen King's "The Stand" opening, and making it even more horrific.The meat and potatoes of this film though is the audio. I saw this film with Dolby Surroundsound and it really kicks butt! The music is loud, there are movements behind your left ear, then it drifts over to your right. When a zombie drags a hammer on the ground, it really makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. Kudos to whoever did the audio mix on this film! It is done to perfection! And the soundtrack is a perfect match for the pace. Marilyn Manson did this movie justice!Another added feature to this movie, and it didn't occur to me until after I read some of the other reviews here on IMDB, is that there really isn't a lot of gore in this film. No blood splattering moments added for gratuitous reasons. Everything is suggested, which IS sort of odd for a modern day horror film. But sometimes suggesting it (such as the elevator scene starting the film) and/or showing it then cutting away (such as the now famous "slice &amp; dice" scene in the hallway) are a much more effective way of freaking a viewer out!Overall, I put this film up there with some of the all-time great popcorn horror films such as "Aliens", "Dawn of the Dead", and "Maximum Overdrive". Not a lot of thinking involved, just get ready to be freaked out a little bit and have a great time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil, the latest film from Paul Anderson--not to be confused with a much better filmmaker, Paul Thomas Anderson--looks great enough, but it feels like a feature-length compilation of familiar scenes from a handful of superior horror and/or sci-fi films, e.g. George Romero's zombie flicks, the "Alien" films, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, and The Matrix. The film doesn't break any new grounds and would have been better served, I think, as a "direct to video" release. The film features the beautiful Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element, The Claim) who, along with several others (most notably, Michelle Rodriguez from The Fast and the Furious and Girlfight), must contain a chemical leakage at one of those secret underground laboratories which you find from time to time in sci-fi films like this. Unbeknownst to this crew, the contamination has turned all the workers in the lab into "zombies," a group of walking dead who are driven solely by the instinct to feed on living flesh. As you might have expected, the crew has to fight off the zombies, resulting in plenty of carnage and gore. Resident Evil is a gory film. What the film lacks, however, is any real suspense or genuine scares. And the soundtrack is one of the loudest I have heard in a long time; I wasn't scared by the film, but several times I got scared that I might go deaf. (I guess the philosophy behind this tactic is: if you can't scare them, jolt them.) I should also mention that the film features several almost nude scenes of Jovovich which are sort of disappointing and anti-climactic (you sort of keep wishing that the damn towel, etc. would fall, but it never does) but might turn out, in the long run, to be the best part of this dead-brained film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A third of what "Dawn of the Dead" was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, of course this movie provided some exciting terror and great horror but comparing this to THE BEST silent zombie horror film "Dawn of the Dead" it just doesn't match up. Like most movies in the new age (2000s), most of the horror films are just put on the market for a minimal amount of scares and less than a 2 hour picture. This movie, in my eyes, was good, but easily could've been better with more airtime. One of the few good things about this movie though that saves it from being busts like "Thirteen Ghosts" and "The Haunting" is that it definitely took the bad label off video game movies which movies such as "Double Dragon" and "Tomb Raider" failed to master. The casting for Resident Evil is probably one of the main flaws of the movie. It including "The Fast and the Furious" star Michelle Rodriguez, who's character failed to entertain as a tough girl who's puns are more sickening than laughable. Also in the casting was Milla Jokovich, who had starred in Joan of Arc, before; I absolutely think that this actor has no skill whatsoever so i guess a role in this movie kinda fit her style. Regardless of the fact, she was good as a superhero but honestly, these two girls shouldn't of been on the top of the food chain. All and all, the movie is good up until the ending, which drags on a bit too far leaving the viewer unsatisfied slightly and leading into a 'should be' sequel. Judging by how they did at the box office, they should have a sequel, but what I can't understand is why it is ranekd so poorly at the box office. This movie although not the best zombie movie, should've mastered the box office without a doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More fun than a barrel full of zombies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do we even fear zombies? I mean think about it, they are usually mangled corpses that walk about as fast as a 100 year old person. Is it because they wish to eat our flesh? the fact that they are reanimated corpses? the fact that they are monsters that just wander around in broad daylight, rather than hide in the darkness and spring out at you like every other monster known to man? or is it the fact that when you see one zombie, once you turn the corner all his zombie friends will be there.Whatever it is, Resident Evil is a movie about, or should I say WITH, zombies in it. It's THE best film based off a videogame (I know you're asking "How can this movie top Mortal Kombat Annihilation?" *sarcasm*) but it is, because it's a slight blend of a few of the games' plotlines, but they specifically made the movie for the movies rather than be the premise of the videogame, stuffed with all the monsters, characters and ideas of the videogame.Milla Jovovich and the rest of the cast are not going to win any Oscars for their performances in this picture, but at least they arn't stiff and cheesy like most acting in videogame films. It's nice that Milla can prove that you can pull of the kick ass babe role in a movie without wearing dominatrix like outfits, spouting stupid catch phrases, and does not need a large set of implants to do it. All she needed was a simple red dress, leather boots, and those sexy-as-hell eyes of hers, and she had me swooning and cheering her on all the way.The plot of the film is simple. There is a corporation that is underground from Raccoon City. One of their experiments, the T-virus is set loose in the compound. The super-computer that surveys the entire lab, quarintines the place and kills off all inside. Then a team is sent to shut down her motherboard (I guess this is so they can use the lab again). Of course shutting the computer down shuts off power, and then all the experiments escape, and all hell breaks loose. So in short, if you wanna see a creepy film full of zombies, zombie dogs, a computer with a creepy British child's voice, and some other weird creature, go see Resident Evil, it'll make all zombie fans happy and give people another reason to worship Milla.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!!!WARNING MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!This movie is just like the game. I loved it. As in the game the zombies are goofy, but they don't let up. The LICKER was way cool. Sure some might say it didn't have much of a plot but neither did the game. In the game you were suppose to kill Zombies and solve mindless puzzles, which the movie clearly did. The choice of actors was excellent, the only problem I had was they went and killed Rain( Michelle Rodriguez), she was outstanding. They could have had both her and Milla's character in the next movie. Speaking of "RE 2" they have to make it, cause the ending for RE left it wide open I can't wait.</fullReview>

However, the pacing, special effects and photography, and interesting and carefully-maintained balance of all those twenty-year-old traditional sci-fi/horror elements make this a tasty tidbit. And I imagine those who've played the game will be enraptured, as will those who can't get enough of the suspense-splatterfest genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's talk Zombies. When you talk Zombies four names come up; George Romero, who started it all; Dario Argento, who branched off with his own lovely visual feasts of gore; Lucio Fulci, the master of Italian zombies; and Tom Savini who directed the superb 1990 color remake of Night of the Living Dead. It may be time to throw in a fifth name. Paul Anderson's film has finally sated my longtime need for a new and WORTHY zombie film!While critics are too busy complaining about how many movies they say are "imitated" in Resident Evil-so busy in fact that they've forgotten to have fun; it's obvious that Paul Anderson-or someone on his crew-is paying attention not only to the official zombie films that started it all, but the fans of the original psychologically unnerving films. Not only does Resident Evil follow the "rules" of the Romero trilogy, he also threw in a few homages for those of us who "know" our zombie films the way some know a good wine or cigar. Look for the beautifully redone "Day of the Dead" scene where a member of the team is pulled into a sea of arms of zombies. Listen closely to the music at the end of the film (composed and performed by Marilyn Manson, who has proved with the score that he has talent beyond visual shock), the music was obviously meant to mimic the sound of The Goblins who did the music for "Dawn of the Dead." And the all-time kicker, THE DEAD WALK newspaper headline at the end of the film. Straight out of the beginning of "Day of the Dead." I may just be one of the few of my general age group (25) who are lucky enough to have seen the films that started it all. Its hard to believe how many people I've met who haven't seen the original trilogy! Resident Evil was without a doubt an excellent supplement to the trilogy and remake. I definetly include it among the ranks of "Zombie," "Night of the Living Dead," "Dawn of the Dead," "Day of the Dead," "The Gates of Hell," "The House by the Cemetery" and others. If you want to talk actors, Mila Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez and not only pleasing to the eye, but they have proved themselves worthy and talented in playing "tough chicks." Screw the critics. I loved it, I only hope that those pesky rumors of sequels are true!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There hasn't been a commercial zombie movie in quite a while thus I was quite excited to watch this one. So I joyfully trotted to the cinema, paid for my ticket and took a seat. It all started quite nicely with people ruining around and having their heads chopped off by berserker elevators. Then I smiled when Mila Jovovich courteously showed a nipple because you simply can't have a good zombie movie without gratuitous nudity. But the further I got into the film, I mean the movie, the more disappointed I became. This movie is so tame! I wanted to see zombie brains splatter on walls. I wanted to see people being decapitated in graphic detail. I wanted to see Mila shoot a double barreled plasma powered bazooka twice her size at that tongued creature and to make it blow up in tiny little chunks of bloody goo. This is a zombie movie guys, where is all the gore? </fullReview>

		<fullReview>i've played most of the RE games, and the movie thankfully does not disappoint. This movie got an nc-16 rating in singapore, and i think its because of this one scene where SPOILER this bunch of commandos literally get diced into little pieces by a laser(especially the laser 'net' part, that was really sick)END OF SPOILER but overall the movie wasn't *that* gory. I thought there should have been more scenes where the commandos are blasting the zombies, but the movie focussed more on the suspense, which it did very well. The story is a mixture of the first and second RE games. The final 'boss fight' was very familiar to the 2nd one.Overall this is the best videogame-movie, and it certainly doesn't suck like tomb raider did. Thankfully it doesn't focus on milla's figure (except in a couple of scenes). Just try not to barf when you see the laser corridoor scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We're all different and certain things may appeal to certain people but not for others. I have to say I was EXTREMELY skeptical from the first time I saw the *TERRIBLE* trailer (which does total injustice to the film). The fact that it was based on a video game didn't help either. Nevertheless, this movie really did it for me. From the time I started watching it, I was in love.If you are a fanatic of movies like Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Dead Alive, etc. and think of them as really scary horror movies instead of silly comedies to laugh at, you might not enjoy this movie very much since this movie is not a gorefest splatter movie. Personally, I have a hard time taking such movies seriously. Resident Evil is different. The most intense gore in this one is limited to a few scenes but they are pretty sick. Most of the violence is hinted at but not shown, but to me the few scenes felt much more brutal and chilling than any scene from an old school zombie flick with plastic mannequins shooting out buckets of fake looking blood. Limited gore can be much more brutal and shocking than a movie where people are getting splattered for 2 hours - look at Hannibal for instance. The gore scenes are few but they are truly gruesome.The action in this movie is really intense. There were a few scenes that seemed a little too over-the-top-blockbusterish like the scene from the trailer in which Alice does a jump kick after running up the wall at an undead dog's head, but that's about the only really unbelievable one I can think of. I think perhaps they just wanted a neat scene to go for the trailer in that one.The atmosphere of the movie was really captivating for me. There's a very surreal feel to it. Like several reviewers have said, the scenes really feel like the real atmosphere of a video game. There are ambient sounds throughout the entire movie in the dark environments. Sounds of metal scraping, hearts pounding, water, etc. Only in a few parts of the movie does it get completely devoid of background sounds and/or music, and these parts seem twice as uncomfortable and scary as result. I really liked the soundtrack too, particularly Marilyn Manson's parts. I'm not a fan of his normally or his style of music, but I thought it fit in perfectly with this movie. From the very beginning I was completely captivated by the seamless integration of the visuals with the soundtrack.The script in the movie is very limited. There's very little meaningful dialogue save for a few scenes of explaining the plot. The character's backgrounds are never fully explained, only their roles in the story... But it's really interesting, I felt closer and more drawn to the characters than most horror movies.Unlike many horror movies, this one is really unpredictable!*********** SPOILER ALERT *******************Take the laser scene for instance! Surely I thought the captain would be saved. I really liked him and he seemed like a really good soldier. Normally guys like this tend to stick around at least near the end of a horror movie... But nooo, he and all but 2 members of the team get killed right from the beginning. Take Rain as another example. I thought for sure that after all that work trying to save her and finding the antidote that she would surely make it to the end... But noooo, she turned into a zombie anyway.********** END SPOILER ALERT ****************But it's unpredictable in an interesting way. There's no sense of randomness like some poorly done movies where what seem like almost completely random factors change the course of events (Ex - Red Planet).In my opinion, this is the best movie ever made! I've become an absolute fanatic. All my previous favorites: Leon/The Professional, Excalibur, Memento, Rainman, etc. all seem uninteresting now. All I can think about is Resident Evil. It's kind of scary.I realize, however, that I am very biased. There seems to be a strong dividing line between the critics of this movie: they either hate it or love it. I have to say that I don't think there are many movies really like this one if you really analyze it. Maybe the people who don't like this just simply don't like this type of movie at all.If you look at the movie very rationally and analytically, there are some flaws here and there. Still, something just did it for me. Like the recent movie Ali with Will Smith, so many people disliked that one. I agree with many of the critics who gave it poor reviews because it was an incoherent biography of Ali and had some really bad editing, but something about that movie touched me and really appealed to me. It had a lasting effect and I loved it, bad editing and all.The same is true of Resident Evil. It just spoke to me in my language. I felt like it could really be a part of my imagination and how I dream and how I wish for movies to be. Does that seem strange? Oh well, the point is that I think it's absolutely great. Don't let peoples' analyses prevent you from seeing it. I had the same doubts when I first went to see it yet now I'm a hardcore fanatic. At least give it a try and see what you think. :) If you don't like it after the first 15 minutes or so, you probably won't like it at all.100,000,000 stars out of 10 from me and some more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a good video game-movie translation...and a terrifying message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning: spoilers ahead!) There have been a lot of attempts to bring video games to the big screen. Super Mario Brothers, Mortal Combat, Tomb Raider, the list goes on. Finally, however, there is a break in that list. Located under an elegant mansion, Umbrella, one of the most powerful corporations in the world, has a secret lab named the Hive. Stocked with the brilliant scientists, state-of-the-art technology, and run by a sentient super computer called the Red Queen, Umbrella most promising research is done here: genetic manipulation and viral weaponry. When a project the corporation is working on suddenly gets out of hand, the lab is locked down, killing all the scientists and containing the secret they were working on. In the mansion above, Alice (played by the beautiful and talented Milla Jovovich) awakens from a chemically induced state of amnesia (part of the facilities automated defenses suddenly turned on) just in time to meet a team of commandos sent in by Umbrella to ascertain the nature of the emergency and reestablish control. Alice and her partner, also suffering from memory loss, and escorted into the Hive by the team immediately. The fun starts. After shutting down the Red Queen, who initiated the emergency shut down that contained the catastrophic events, the team is besieged by legions of scientists who have been altered into tough, flesh eating zombies. As the surviving team members struggle for their lives, desperate to escape the Hive, they discover the terrible truth: the zombies were created by the T-virus, a genetic weapon that reanimates dead tissue, creating beings whose only purpose is to feed. One scratch, one bite from these abominations, and you're infected, with just hours before you become one of them. As with all viruses, there's no antidote. The action and tension mount as the stuggle for survival continues when the few survivors face the epitome of Umbrellas sick research: a creature called 'the licker,' huge, unstoppable, killing machines that were once human beings. They are almost impossible to kill and become stronger, faster, and deadlier with each life they take. It soon becomes clear that none of them may leave alive...and even if they could, their death might be better than exposing the outside world to the horrors of Umbrellas secret weapons. Resident Evil delivers the goods, no doubt about it. Sure, it's story is simple, the acting isn't superb, and the setup is nothing new. Which makes the films appeal and success in its endeavour only more impressive. Milla Jovovich is great as a heroine, with all strength and guile we've come to expect from such roles over the years. Michelle Rodriguez does a great job as Rain, the tough, dedicated soldier who must deal with her wounds and what they mean for her ultimate fate. The plot twists and turns, with flashes of recollection from Alice adding to the story gradually at just the right times. The music, techno, punk, rock, whatever you call it, is just perfect for the mood and action of the movie. And the FX and makeup, superb. Simply put, go see RE, especially if you're a fan of the video games series, you won't be disappointed. In addition to finding the film entertaining and action packed, though, I was also disturbed and genuinely frightened by it. No, not the film itself, but the idea behind it. Resident Evil is not just another sci-fi horror flik, but a warning. In an age where it seems science is revealing incredible possibilities to us, genetics has emerged as both the a holy grail and doomsday weapon. The best expression of this is given at the films end, where Alice stands alone in the middle of a dead Raccoon City, where the T-virus has devasted all life in a once bustling metropolitan area. The most horrifying scene of the movie, perhaps, because this might not be as impossible a scenario as it sounds.</fullReview>

This is a movie you would buy to play on a top of the line surround sound at your house. Action (10/10) Plot (7/10) Acting (7/10) Overall (8.5/10) Its not great but it is worth the $6.00.

		<fullReview>Bollicks to you, Glacier. You talk as if a midget with brass knuckles was punching you in the balls during the duration of the movie. I'll agree with anyone who says this film wasn't art, but it was NOT a bad movie. I'm not gonna nominate it for an Oscar, but it was entertaining, and much more so than "Tomb Raider." And before we get into the "you don't know the game" issue, let it be known that I am a diehard fanatic of the Resident Evil series, having played all of the games, owning two, and having beaten both "2" and "Veronica". The game itself consists of walking around rooms being frightened by sounds, and very often there isn't much zombie fighting involved. Granted, ninja kicks to the heads of Dobermans forced my eyebrow to rise a little, but I let it pass, especially once they showed the Licker (only complaint I have is that such a weak character would be made into the "boss"). The special effects weren't great, and I found myself chuckling to myself at the sight of the zombies, but what got me into the film was the constant ambience. It played just like the game, with more moments where you're scared of the silence than gunplay against approaching zombies. As for accuracy to the game, it's not all there (if it was, they'd be able to hold eight guns at a time, and eat plants to cure their wounds), but as it is a prequel, it doesn't have much to stick to anyway. The beginning introductions were accurate, and the ending was seamless, as well as being extremely creepy. And while I had expected to hate this movie, as video game transitions typically suck eggs (i.e. Super Mario Bros), I was very pleasantly surprised, and while I can't repeat enough that I wasn't blown away by the depth or artistry involved with the film, it was a good, mindless, lets-shoot-the-hell-out-of-some-zombies movie. And if this series which seems like it's gonna sprout is true AND chronological, it's only gonna get cooler. Anyone who remembers a specific line from the end of the movie, and knows what it's referring to...you know I'm right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A major disappointment to say the least. All a video game movie needs to fulfill it's limited purpose is cool monsters and some good action sequences. So what made them think they could get away with Night of the Living Dead? This crap was okay in 1965 when it was done the first time and not so bad with the various George Romero remakes and sequels but all this is is a bigger budget B flick. Utterly predictable and full of "startle scare" scenes. This is the other side of 13 Ghosts but with a plausible(for the genre)idea and lousy monsters - "more brains!". Maybe okay for the under 15 crowd as they may not have seen the zombies before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" is true to both the spirit of zombie movies and to the console game it was based on. If either of these criteria drew you to the film, chances are you were not expecting a profound exploration of the human condition anyway. The film delivers precisely what it promises. This movie is a bloody exposition of special effects and super-models with fire axes. If neither appeals to you, stay at home and read Dickens.Beyond this, "Resident Evil" relies heavily on tried-and-true formulae for the horror and action genres. Things jump out. There are loud noises. Blood gushes. We have close ups. We have slow-motion. The plot twists aren't exactly the end of "Usual Suspects."If any of these things bother you, then the volume is too low and it isn't dark enough in the theatre. Subjecting "Resident Evil" to a cynical criticism of its stock elements is like drinking your beer warm and then complaining because it tastes bad. Accept that this is not Hamlet, and enjoy "Resident Evil" for its loud and expensive applications of horror/action traditions. It's sleek for a zombie movie and very good for a movie made from a video game. 8/10.</fullReview>

Then comes Milla Jovovich ranting and raving how she wants to make a RE film due to her appeal to its macabre style of action/story. When the film was finally released I could not help but see that it was nothing more than mixing aspects of PART 1 and 2 of the games. Badly mixed at that. There was nothing original about this film. It took bits and peices of other films mixed in with amatuer computer graphics and matrix fx. To top it off the use of one of George Romero's key signature scenes as a climax was a true insult to the zombie king himself. The creative team behind this film, including Milla Jovovich, has taken a great concept and turned it into another box office insult. For the love of god I hope that another is not released with the same production team and the leading actress Milla.

		<shortDescription>Good movie, shame about the music...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film based on a video game would understandably make one skeptic considering the nature of such films made in the past. However, unlike those films that shall not be named, Resident Evil remains to focus on its plot rather then any over-the-top-effects, cheap stand-out gimmicks or even mindless violence... and for something based around the idea of zombies, that is saying quite a lot. My only gripe comes in that there is really no gore, something I touched upon in the none-mindless-violence aspect, but seeing as how this is a film about zombies, you would expect some. If this film was overtly creepy, then it could get away with it with no such complaints. But perhaps I have seen Dawn of the Dead too much and it has spoiled me for anything less. The plot is very suffice, as it is really interesting. None of the characters are hollow and there really is no cheap dialogue. This film really gave me no regrets except one: the God-awful music. But seeing as how that is very limited and the film really pushes pass that, it really never becomes too huge of a problem. I just hate to have to sit through Slipknot as I stay afterwards whilst the credits go by. Now, like most people, I was skeptical when I had heard that Romero was knocked off from the job, but I think his absence really never feels like a loss. Because the film was done so properly anyway, that nagging question as to what he would have done with it is only out of the mere idea that he was working on a zombie film for the first time since the last one, which was in 1985. Speaking of which, I was amused when I caught a headline seen in the film that is a duplicate out of the previously mentioned film. I will not spoil it, but I will say that Living Dead fans will spot it in a second. In all, the film really never lets you down. It slows in some parts in the beginning, but it does picks up when you understand what is going on, as it is a bit confusing for a good while, but that becomes another great plot element and that is one of the wonderful ways this film works. The most recognizably positive thing that stands out in this film is that it keeps its nature as a film rather then just another game turned movie. It never falls on that fact at all and sticks to be an entertaining film all alone that works at a well organized pace. The great story could be due in part to the creators of the video game, but its loyalty to it without rendering it at all feebleminded says a lot about the respect it was given and shows that someone was really paying attention for once. Looking back, I cannot help but think that Romero may have tainted it because I have heard that he focused on the living dead. The magic behind this film is that it does not do that. The backbone of the film is about a greedy, humanity-less, global corporation. In the wake of the Enron scandal, the film really has you wondering more about what such real large corporations are up to and what some could and are very well capable of then that of the living dead. The fact that these people can create a physical incarnation of their soulless mentality (i.e. zombies) is merely a horrible example of their power as well as being more terrifying then the zombies themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the film "Resident Evil" I was very pleased. Writer and director Paul Anderson, who also made the "Mortal Kombat" movie has successfully made another game to movie port. The movie makes many references to the video games, such as the 'Nemesis' and Leon Scott Kennedy characters.... although you have to listen closely.If your wondering why you should bother with this one after losing faith with video game to movies with that horrible offering "Tomb Raider" you will very much like this movie. The action is steady at times but picks up after a while, it really does well in it's performance. I myself thought that this movie would be horrible, but to my surprize, I was dead wrong (yes that was a cheap pun, I know).The plot is very thick and supported by a great cast. It doesn't quite follow the games but is similar in it's own unique way.During the movie even the most die-hard horror movie fan will have jump during some sequences. Thought there are many gaps in the scenes (due to major editing as not to earn an NC-17 rating) the gaps in scenes do not show very well, I wasn't aware of this until I read an interesting review made by GameShark.com.The bottom line is simple, even if you have not played the video games, you will still understand this movie and really enjoy it. I had a really fun time watching this movie, and so will you.If I had to rate this movie I think I would have to give it a 8 out of ten. In addition to its greatness it leaves room for a sequel, and trust me, there's gonna be a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not played the video game but the film does have the look and feel of an action game. Which actually works quite well in fact. This film has great visuals from sets to special effects to action sequences. It is probably one of the best video game based films yet. In my opinion this one's far better than last year's much lauded attempt to a game based film.Resident Evil has a straightforward plotline and wastes no time getting to the point. The pace is energetic if not frantic. Plot twists and new details are not of the cheesy variety and are well integrated into the flow of the film. No goofy, quirky characters or plotlines make this film a more serious and credible sci fi action film in the vein of Cameron's Aliens (if not quite as strong).What Resident Evil lacked and could have improved on is the more development and depth for the "Resident Evil" part itself. I can't expand on this here without giving away the plotline. But this area, if improved, could have made this a great movie movie indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a true HORROR film, but still entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, Resident Evil caused me somewhat of a disappointment. Being that I am a fan of horror and consider myself to be a connoisseur in the genre, I went to the movie theatre with the idea that I was going to see real zombies; such as those in George Romero's trilogy or Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2, even like those in the classic B movie Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things. But it was nothing like that. On the contrary, the zombies in Resident Evil looked stupid and not scary at all. What happened to the classic zombie moans and humming? The facial close-ups? The gore? The explicit zombie attacks? The loud bites and zombie appetite? And the list can go on just to compare what a classic zombie movie should be versus the new zombies such as the ones portrayed in Resident Evil where even some of the zombies faces were computer generated.It seems like good horror films will not make a come back to the big screen. There have been many, such as Scream, Urban Legend, I Know what you did Last Summer, Disturbing Behavior, Jeepers Creepers and so many more recent films, but none are true to the genre. There will probably never be another Suspiria, Evil Dead, Inferno, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Phenomena among others.Now taking Resident Evil from a different point of view: it is an OK Hollywood movie, entertaining and very similar to the video game (T-virus, killer Dobermans, Train, Licker, Umbrella). Milla Jovovich beauty enlightens the screen and her performance is pretty good. Overall the film is watchable, not the greatest but still entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been expecting this movie since I first heard of the plans to make the games a motion picture, and as (I'm sure) we all know, that can lead to high expectations. This movie did not disappoint me at all. While it is true that the fans who have played all the games (myself included) will have a little bit more fun recognizing the situations and characters (so THAT'S where Nemesis came from!), the movie is a wonderful opener to the entire story line, and hopefully will introduce many people to the games, as they are all truly exceptional chunks of programming. There was also a lot of symbolism in the movie that I found genuinely interesting. If you're familiar with Alice In Wonderland, you might know what I'm referring to:-Main character's name is Alice...-Evil Computer is called the 'Red Queen'...-The scene with somebody having to be sacrificed so the Red Queen will give them the code to escape, and the method is a proposed beheading (OFF WITH HER HEAD!)... and I'm sure there's more...Overall a totally enjoyable movie, with quite a few good scares to boot. Go see it, and you should not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Ever Made Based on A Video Game and Also a Kick-Butt Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie rocks! It's definitely one my favorite horror movies and I have seen a bunch, including many zombie movies: Night of the Living Dead, Dead Alive, Dawn of the Dead, Evil Dead, etc. Most of these old zombie movies are so cheesy and filled with such fake, harmless gore scenes, however, that they shouldn't even be classified as real horror movies.Resident Evil is really different. I entered the theater not expecting much at all, thinking it would just be another cheesy, stupid attempt to make a video game.However, I tried to be optimistic since the movie had an R rating. All the movies I've seen up until this one seemed like they were made for teens with overprotective parents, censoring all the original violence and gore contained in the video game to avoid being bombarded by whining mommies. This one is different.. It really depicts the real dark, horrific environment of the original game series and captures the mood and feel of the game. I couldn't have imagined it any better than this.I think Anderson could have also done really great with Mortal Kombat in the past if he had just captured this sort of violence and action and tried not to dress up the video game's plot. After all, the plot and character backgrounds are only about a paragraph long in Mortal Kombat - they're not what made the game great. It was the fast paced action and brutality, cool martial arts and effects.This movie presents a very honest attempt to capture the video game without trying to dress up the storyline or the script too much. It also comes up with some great ways of presenting things in the game that would have sounded a bit cheesy had they presented them directly as they were. For example, the zombies are never referred to as "zombies" in the movie. Instead, they are simply referred to as infected humans who are virtually dead but still animated because their brain can still function at a very primitive level.As a horror movie, this is one of the least predictable ones I've seen and definitely the most intense. There's a feeling of suspense throughout the entire film and there are no real breaks to really relax the audience save for a minute or two of dialogue here and there. From the very beginning to the very end, trouble is happening. The gore scenes are really intense, but they are presented in a really gruesome way that none of it seems to wear off by the end of the movie (ex - by the end of Evil Dead the gore wore off to the point that it was just plain funny). There's no dumb comic relief character to provide cheesy punchlines as so many recent horror movies have started using either. The soundtrack, though a bit too heavy metal for my tastes in some areas, really worked GREAT in my opinion with the visuals.Now, don't expect this movie to win an oscar for its script and plot. After all, it is just based on a shoot-em-up video game... But that's exactly the best part of the movie: it presents a video game honestly as how a movie should present one, successfully capturing the atmosphere and action that we all love in the playstation game.I have to say I enjoy brutality and action in stylish movies like this. This doesn't mean I only like these kind of movies, but they are a nice break from the more serious movies where the script is the most important aspect of the movie. I don't expect everyone to like it - especially the squeamish or people who are into more serious movies - but this was just the type of movie I needed tonight and I really hope they make a sequel. Can't wait to see more Milla Jovovich too. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top-notch Saturday night drive-in fare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have said many times that games of any kind do not make good movies but I now have to make one exception when I say that. Resident Evil is a great zombie shoot-em-up that doesn't rely entirely on visceral thrills. The plot has enough twists to keep things interesting and the characters are real enough that you care about them. On top of all that Milla Jovanovich is a treat to look at for a couple of hours and makes a convincing heroine.It is true that there is nothing very original in the movie but what it steals it puts to good use. If I have a complaint it is that the movie uses the same schtick too many times. I'm talking about the trick of having some obvious source of danger that everyone thinks is about to happen NOT happen and instead some other unexpected nastiness happens. Good once, not 4 times.As long as you don't put it in the Gladiator class and instead expect a thrilling Saturday night Drive in action movie this one is top of the line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very excited when I saw the trailer for Resident Evil and, after seeing the movie, I'm not at all disappointed. It had an interesting plot with a lot of twists and stuff to think about, which is nice.The body count is enormous, which always helps, and there's plenty of graphic violence for those who like that kind of stuff.Couldn't be happier about Milla Jovovich being in the movie. She is extremely hot (and scantily clad the majority of the time) and does a good job with all the action sequences as well.All in all, a great movie. Definitely go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Mix!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regardless of whether or not you are a die hard Resident Evil fan, you'll love this movie. There truly is nothing I can say bad about this movie...it has the perfect mix of great acting, special effects, and most importantly, sToRyLiNe! I saw this movie a couple of days ago and haven't stopped raving about it since! This will be in my DVD collection ASAP! In all fairness, I'm not upset that some didn't like it, but I can only guess someone wouldn't like this movie for two main reasons. 1) If you worship the Resident Evil game series and feel that the movie should have followed the game more closely, and 2) If you don't like this genre of movies entirely. (ie: Aliens, Dawn of the Dead, Event Horizon, etc)I'm even amazed at how thrilled I am with this movie but I am SUPER THRILLED! Milla Jovovich does an awesome job as she's so versatile and beautiful she can conform to almost any movie role. All in all, if you like zombie action movies and are willing to let the movie have some creative differences from the games, then you will absolutely LOVE this movie. Forget the title, it stands alone as one hell of an action/horror/sci-fi film.Have I said enough now? ;) Can't wait for the sequel! Go see Resident Evil today!!! ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*spoiler* Bigger scares in House Party II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently read a first draft for this movie by George Romero, and I can't understand why they discarded what he put together. A much better script, with a genuine sense of drama and hopelessness. Probably why they didn't use it.Now, I have never played the game (and that should not be a requirement. If it is, you need to hire another writer) so I cannot say if it's true to the game or not. But then I don't really care if it does or not. I'm interested in what sort of movie the studio produced. Is it scary? Can folks act? Does it make sense? Is the ending a standard movie cliche? Resident Evil fails on all these points.I won't bother going into the errors with their bio-toxin lab. (If you can't figure out on your own that the lab would NOT run off the same air ducts as the rest of the facility, then you won't understand the rest of the movie's problems. Go watch Ghosts of Mars and brace yourself for the surprise ending you'll never ever see coming. Honest.) The scene continuity is terrible. Folks are surrounded by zombies with no way out, then next scene they're safely out of the way. What happened? How'd they get out? Guess Paul Anderson wrote himself into a corner. Frankly, he does that a lot. Getting in and out of the lab appears so darn easy you have to wonder why they didn't send in the janitor to reboot the system while he's mopping the floor.The biggest hole is why the computer simply didn't TELL someone that the virus had escaped, why this is a Very Bad Thing. But since there's an antidote, it's not really that bad, is it? How about shutting down the facility entrances, notifying folks in charge, and then giving them a shout of the green stuff before you go killing everyone? Must be a software error. Darn that Windows 2000!Aren't we all getting tired of spotting the survivors when the movie starts? Could we at least have someone else survive for a change? Would really be so difficult to not film the ending of `Guess what-it's not over yet! Bet you didn't see THAT coming!' Umm, yes, we did. About an hour ago. It's such a standard ending now you'd think they teach it to film students.Not much to see here, and very little to get excited about. Standard pulp fare for the masses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been expecting this movie since I first heard of the plans to make the games a motion picture, and as (I'm sure) we all know, that can lead to high expectations. This movie did not disappoint me at all. While it is true that the fans who have played all the games (myself included) will have a little bit more fun recognizing the situations and characters (so THAT'S where Nemesis came from!), the movie is a wonderful opener to the entire story line, and hopefully will introduce many people to the games, as they are all truly exceptional chunks of programming. There was also a lot of symbolism in the movie that I found genuinely interesting. If you're familiar with Alice In Wonderland, you might know what I'm referring to:-Main character's name is Alice...-Evil Computer is called the 'Red Queen'...-The scene with somebody having to be sacrificed so the Red Queen will give them the code to escape, and the method is a proposed beheading (OFF WITH HER HEAD!)... and I'm sure there's more...Overall a totally enjoyable movie, with quite a few good scares to boot. Go see it, and you should not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't going to review this movie, but I just get so MAD when people go on and on about how "Resident Evil: The Movie" wasn't an exact representation of "Resident Evil: The Game Series". What you people don't get is that we're talking about two totally different mediums of artistic expression. How can you possibly make a movie and expect to market it to the world if it only makes sense to a certain group of gamers? And why bother making a movie in the first place since there's already an identical game people can play? Movies are not games. They tell stories in a different way, and have much less time to do it in than a game does. This means things have to be changed, shuffled around, and taken right out. Characters have to be condensed, backgrounds brief, let's get right to the action. You see what I'm saying? Resident Evil was a fun movie. It had a comprehensible plot that didn't get bogged down technically with advanced science mumbo jumbo. This movie basically gives you the skeleton of a much bigger story, and it's up to you to put the missing pieces together. I never really played the games at all, and I understood everything that was going on. Go see Resident Evil if you enjoy a fast paced movie that is never corny or badly written. Milla Jovovich was great, and I hope she gets more tough girl roles in the future. All of the actors were well casted and there were actually a couple of surprises in the script along the way too. But if you're still reading reviews for this movie asking yourself, "I love zombie movies, but is Resident Evil still worth my time and money?" IT'S A MOVIE ABOUT ZOMBIES!! That should be enough to get any fan of the genre out to see this movie. When was the last zombie movie to hit theaters? I mean a real zombie movie. It's been a while right? Go see Resident Evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better video game movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More and more, studios are turning popular video game titles into movies. Unfortunately, more often than not, these films tend to turn out between mediocre and awful. The one film that rose above the norm in my opinion was Final Fantasy, which, despite its shortcomings, still provided some wonderful entertainment.Resident Evil is much like Final Fantasy in that respect. For one thing, it never pretends to be anything more than it is, a film based on a video game that already has a B-movie plotline. Naturally, it's not going to win any academy awards, but Paul Anderson managed to make a film that should leave most viewers satisfied as long as they aren't too condescending in their opinion.The action sequences are energetic, which is an accomplishment when you consider that the vast majority of the monsters in the film shuffle along at about two miles an hour. Some of the scenes with the zombies massed together resembled a literal mosh pit of the damned.While the film doesn't contain any characters from the video games, it's obvious that Anderson did his homework when he wrote the script. The movie functions well as a prequel and to my knowledge doesn't contradict plotline of the games. In many respects, the movie was tailored a bit more to the fans of the games than the general viewing public. Perfectly setting up room for a sequel, fans may yet get a chance to see some of the game series's heroes in living color. It certainly deserves a sequel more than Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, in any case.To sum up, while Resident Evil is most certainly a popcorn flick, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film. It has its entertaining moments, and if it's given the benefit of the doubt, it has its rewards as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil. What does this movie contribute to the horror genre?Although it is the first main stream big budget american zombie movie in a decade or so, this movie falls short of being a classic horror for several reasons:1. Soundtrack. Why is it that so many horror movies are little more than a vehicle to sell a soundtrack? Mostly, the soundtrack worked the pumping dark techno added to the futuristic suspense, but everytime there was a song with lyrics, it cheapens the film.2. CGI. Not having ever played RE, I don't really see what the mutants really contribute to the movie. I'm sure the sequel will make this make more sense. Personally the zombies were much more scary than the tongue monster. When is hollywood going to learn that audiences are not scared by CGI monsters, we say, wow that's cool, and then get scared by something as cheap as someone grabbing another person in a tense situation. But anyways.The Good:The zombies were fantastic. Some people think that they were cheap looking. Have you ever seen one of the best horror movies ever? Dawn of the Dead? The zombies in that are little more than people with grey pancake makeup on. In RE the zombies have creative makeup, and most have some icky wounds. I loved the scene where they opened the door and all the zombies came rushing out (ripped off of dawn of the dead, but its about time someone ripped off a good movie for once instead of scream), it was one of the best scares, eventhough anyone who's seen Dawn knows whats coming.Milla was also great. She kicked major butt! And she did it wearing the least amount of clothing possible. If that's what women will be wearing in the future, build me a time machine. The supporting actors, while underdeveloped, added to the story (except for Rain, who was annoying, and i couldn't wait for her demise).The flashbacks Milla had were also wonderful. Very very eerie, especially the lab scene and the graveyard. By the way, the german chick playing Lisa, we American audiences need more of her. She would've made a great zombie.The other really great thing: The red queen. The film makers have stumbled upon the best horror theory: little girls with english accents are beyond creepy. If you don't believe me, watch the others, or the innocents.With the exception of minor flaws, this was a good movie, not a classic, but for a video game inspired plot starring a supermodel, this movie went way above my expectations.Please be warned though, seeing Milla nude at the end of the movie is not sexy at all. Don't expect to pop some wood, amazingly the filmmaker has managed to make us repulsed by her nudity, you'll understand once you've seen it.7.5 out of 10 for a horror 9 out of 10 for a video game inspired movie (even that can't make me forget the CGI monster)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the good reviews on the net, I can't say I went in to see the preview of "Resident Evil" with little or no expectations. Indeed, I expected "the best movie made from a video game to date". I don't really know if if was that, but "Resident Evil" was quite good. After all, I got what I paid for, or expected, in the first place: A fast-paced action movie which truly made fun. The body count was great (on the zombie side), the soundtrack was well fitting (from Techno to New Metal), Milla Jovovich was eye candy (as was Michelle Rodriguez, at least in the beginning) and all in all, "Resident Evil" was well worth the 4.50 EUR. If you like your little-or-no-brain-required-but-many-bullets-flying action movie from time to time, go see "Resident Evil", you won't be disappointed. 7/10 Points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the skinny: I am not a video game fan, so I went into this film with only one thing on my mind-a gory zombie movie. Boy was I disappointed!While watching the film, I came to a few conclusions. 1. I realized that I have already seen DAWN OF THE DEAD, and it was a far superior film in every way. 2. This is a zombie film that has an R rating and yet it has no worthy gore to speak of. 3. There was no story. The upshot of which is that I already saw DAWN OF THE DEAD but all of the good stuff was actually in that movie. Since I had already seen a good version of the same basic scenario, I was prompted to do something that I haven't done in 15 years.I walked out.I have certainly seen worse films, but this is simply devoid of scares, suspense and characters. People who may find this film to be actually scary seriously need to hit the video rentals stores! And.please, PLEASE put an end to the plague of video game adaptations!!! Don't keep shelling out your hard-earned cash for this kind of crap; it only encourages Hollywood to crank out more!</fullReview>

The characters were poorly developed, using only much-cliched memory flashbacks, the plot was very hokey, and the atmosphere was totally wrong. Also, the cast looked like lookalikes that may have turned down roles in it: the squad leader (L. Fishbourne), the man who had coffee spilled on him (D. Carver or E. Norton), the man put into the Nemesis program (B. Pitt/M. Wahlberg) and so on. The worst movie made since Firestorm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie expecting a decent adaptation of the game series, but instead I got Matrix ripoff crap.It's not that the atmosphere wasn't there, my main problems with the film had to do with the main character played by Milla Jovovich. First off, they make a big point to show that the zombies can take quite a few bullets without any effect, yet when Milla kicks a zombie in the chest, it's dead. Uh huh. Yeah,okay. Then she kills another one by hitting it in the back with a paperweight later on. When cornered by the dogs, she manages to hit a bunch of moving targets with expert accuracy, then kicks a dog who was jumping while her back is turned, killing it instantly. How'd she know the dog was jumping? Then there's a damn bullet-time moment towards the end, I swear the Matrix ruined action films forever with that s***.After seeing the film, I can only assume that Resident Evil takes place in The Matrix and Milla Jovovich is actually The One.Then there's the whole thing that bothered me in the beginning of the film. The soldiers are strapped to the gills with explosives and automatic weapons, yet they are unaware of the fact that there are zombies and creatures in the lab. They think they're just there to shut down a computer.Why the hell would you need HK's to shut down a frickin computer?Resident Evil would probably be a decent film if I was about 10 years old and had never played the games. The hand to hand combat aspect was totally out of place, I know I wouldn't touch an infectious zombie if I were in the same situation, I think I'd rather run like hell.It is the best video game adaptation to date though, so I had to give it at least a 2 for effort. Paul Anderson, please leave video games and classic films alone. If you must continue to make s***** movies, at least ruin something original and don't bring down the quality of what's already been made well.</fullReview>

She seems poised to have a great role in the sequel.Even the "Red Queen" that everyone seems to hate isn't that annoying, and she's only in about 15 minutes of the movie.While the film doesn't have the creep/chill/scare factor of the games, over all it is recommened to any fans of action movies.

		<fullReview>Okay, I've been an avid player of the Resident Evil (Biohazard in Japan) video games ever since they were first released, therefore, I had been looking forward to the movie ever since they first made rough plans for it back in 1998.All through the years, both the ups and downs, I have waited patiently for the film to finally pick up speed. And, sure enough, it was well worth the wait.Definitely, this was the best movie ever made to be based on a video game series in my opinion. Plus, the movie is a prequel to the games, so if you've never played them... don't worry!Action-packed, horror-filled, and zombies galore; this movie offers the best of the best. Milla Jovovich was the perfect choice for a character to have to go through our traditional Resident Evil "survival horror".*SOME MILD SPOILERS HERE*I would have to say that the ONLY thing I thought could've been changed was two little facts.- Number One: The movie starts with an announcement that the Umbrella Corp. is the most powerful in the 21st century. Well, both the games and the movie takes place in late 1998. That's the 20th century... not 21st.- Number Two: In the video games, the dreaded T-virus is a green color and the G-virus was bluish-purple. In the movie here, the virus seems to be blue and the "antidote" is green. Although, I could really overlook this fact since the so-called "antidote" doesn't do the job it's supposed to.*END OF SPOILERS*In conclusion, Resident Evil, the movie, is just as great as the video game series. If you're a die-hard fan of both horror and zombies/creatures galore, see this movie right away!</fullReview>

An unabashed knockoff of "Night of the Living Dead" plus "Alien" plus "The Thing" plus "The Poseidon Adventure", Evil gets off to a promising start with some great CAD-views of The Hive where The Red Queen is turning everyone into blood-sucking zombies. The best part of the movie: the trip down the slice-and-dice laser corridor just outside the Queen's chamber. This in itself is worth the price of admission. Other than that, the script is convoluted, the acting stiff and the finale a weak excuse for a sequel. So much of "Resident Evil" simply does not work, yet when it does hit the target it can make John Carpenter proud. I just hope the inevitable sequel comes with a better script.</fullReview>

Compares favorably to Night of the Living Dead. The acting, mood and special effects were all topnotch. You'll jump out of your chair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>intellectually devoid and ambiguous with obvious high points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review might give away some of the plot (as little as there is) so bewareThe film Resident Evil disappointed me in a lot of ways. I have played the popular game series and have grown quite attached to the story line that the game used. This movie strayed a lot from this storyline which was expected, but this was a little out there. Before I go on I will recommend that you play the games and get the full story. The remainder of this review will be detached from my own opinions about the game and will concentrate on the story. The amnesia plot gets old really quick. the story builds a small conspiracy flashback series that is way too underdeveloped for anyone to really care about it. The characters are developed poorly and their dialogue is intellectually devoid. The character Rain gives the prime example of this when she shouts "Blow me" to the cop she just handcuffed. That kind of stupidity is enough to make me cringe. Milla Jovavich's character tries to carry on a sense of grandeur and security, but fails miserably. This was supposed to be a zombie movie, but I wasn't sure what to be more scared of; the zombies or the hive that was vilified and given way too much weight in the story. There was a good sense of dread caused by the laser tunnel scenes. But, to play into the old scary movie cliche, the black guy(who happened to be the most interesting character) died towards the beginning. This left the meely mouthed tech guy in charge, you know, the one responsible for the deaths of his teammates and the release of the zombies. The movie needed to make up its mind. If it wanted a big plot with the amnesia suffering Umbrella employees there should have been more character development. It was a poorly written action flick because it didn't have a decent juxtaposition. It ended so abruptly that you just didn't care. It seemed like a mini-series more than a succinct horror-thriller. They left it open for a sequel with the Nemesis remark at the end of the movie, but honestly I don't think the interest will be there by the time they chunked another one out there. Now that I've bashed it sufficiently, I'll discuss the good points. The make up and effects were decent. It looked a little bit too much like The Mummy with all the computer generation but all in all it was cool,especially the dogs. The holographic Red Queen sequences added an eerie vibe that deserves praise. I spotted a George A. Romero homage, on purpose or by mistake. The scene where Cap tells the others to go, contemplates suicide, then makes the heroic charge, paralells the scene on Dawn of the Dead. The main thing to say about this film is that the soundtrack was beautiful. Marilyn Manson did an awesome job on this score and in my opinion made the movie worth it. I recommend this flick under certain conditions; you don't know the game that well, you don't want to think, you like to see violence, you can be affected by music.</fullReview>

Which I don't understand because Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead were a hell of a lot more gorier than this film...and actually a lot better. While I thought this movie was great it could have been truly horrifying. Milla was awesome...but she seemed kinda lost or maybe it was supposed to look that way. But anyway if you want an action packed ride with a few scares thrown in this one is for you. If you are a gorehound then you will be disappointed. I hope that when the DVD comes out they restore some of the cut scenes. I think in all honesty that the nudity near the end is actually worse than the violence but hey I'm not complaining. 6 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a zombie flick loosely based on a video game. I had no other expectations other than to be entertained for an hour-and a-half. But the movie went far above my expectations. Yeah, there are similarities to "Aliens" and every other George Romero Dead flick, but it didn't detract from my basic enjoyment of the film. With the exception of one or two exposition scenes in the middle, the movie was non-stop. Milla and Michelle were great. And the Red Queen was a nice touch.I can't believe how many people are nitpicking over the inconsistancies between the game and the movie. See it again and suspend your disbelief. I did and enjoyed it. And I own the first 2 games myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why was this rated R?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Has the MPAA gotten so tough over the years that using the "F-word" 3 or 4 times will garner an R rating - because this sure wasn't rated R because of the violence. In all seriousness, Lord of the Rings has more violence and it was PG-13. I have never seen a horror movie like Resident Evil before, where each and every time something violent happens the director cuts away from the action.Perhaps my disappointment stems from having seen the George Romero zombie trilogy, in particular Dawn of the Dead. Paul Anderson also directed Event Horizon, which pulled few punches when it came to violent imagery, so I guess I thought I was in for an updated version of a good Romero zombie flick. But alas what made it onto the screen was 35 minutes of build-up to entering the Hive, and then no pay-off.I won't go so far as to say that this movie is horrible, but I do hate it when movie studios hedge their bets and aim for the middle. Either make a movie PG-13 which everyone will know going into not to expect anything, or make a true horror movie for adult audiences. What people don't want to see is some stilted compromise that plays off of an ultra-violent premise and amounts to a PG-13 movie cloaked in an R rating. I mean honestly, after Romero created the genre, who ever saw a zombie flick with only one zombie getting shot in the head?The movie does succeed in a decent (but perhaps overlong) set-up, and it does set the stage for harrowing encounters and ultra-violent zombie confrontations - it's just that they never materialize. I think horror fans will be bummed out when the lights come on in the theater, thinking that another great opportunity was squandered in an attempt to make something edgy into something palatable. There is an obvious sequel set-up at the end, and who knows if that will ever happen? Maybe they'll try and spice things up the next time around or maybe just more honest and go for a PG.My rating 4/10, because the premise is cool, it was filmed with some flair, and the visuals were decent. It just could've been so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Video Game to Movie translation EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of zombie-movies and the biggest Resident Evil fan in the Northern Hemisphere, I loved this movie. The scenery was superb. Some of the shots are taken directly from the game and give any true Re fan a feeling of coming home. This has been my most anticipated movie for a long, long time.The plot is fairly basic but works very well: An experimental virus has been released in a top secret, underground facility. A team of highly trained, highly equipped "problem solvers" working for the Umberella Corporation is sent in to take control of the situation. As they enter the superficial cover of the mansion that is the entrance to the installation, The Hive, they find an unconscious Alice(Milla Jovovich) and a cop named Matt(Eric Mabius). After acquiring their two new members they break into The Hive and the fun begins. The computer "brain" of the Hive has gone homicidal and wants to kill everything within its grasp. After they go underground the action starts to run together and be non-stop, but in a Very good way. Possibly lurking around every corner is a zombie or something much, much worse. The scene to really watch for is when the team enters the corridor outside the main computer control room. Also not to be missed is the nude scene Milla Jovovich did. HOT HOT HOT!!! This movie works on so many levels. It is a great movie that really entertains and has a thumpin' soundtrack. ROCK ON PAUL ANDERSON. Hurry up with the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not that that's a bad thing. Although I generally like more substantial fare, sometimes it's nice to have a fun movie come along. Unlike so many other action/thriller movies out there that pretend to be so much more than they actually are, this one makes no attempt to try to carry a meaningful plot or intelligent dialogue. It's pure escapism, and it's fun to watch.I have to hand it to the creative team behind this one, as it cooks up new and creative ways to kill people. But the violence isn't as mindless as the rest of the movie -- there's still that sense of shock and horror when someone gets killed.Oh yeah, and get ready for the sequel -- this one's not even subtle about setting up for Resident Evil II - Escape from Racoon City.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very true to the game with an American twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Tomb Raider, I was very nervous about seeing Resident Evil.I heard it was to be a prequel to the games, and that just made mystomach turn more. Since Resident Evil (or Biohazard Japan) hasalways been written by the Japanesse, I viewed this movie as a 90minute fan fiction story. Standing on its own, Resident Evil is a great horror/action film. Theentire film is filled with "what's that noise" or "what's around thecorner" suspense, much like the game. I was always pleased tosee that Millia's "Matrix Move" that she uses against the dog (theyshow it at the end of EVERY commercial) was the only string stuntused. Now for the more important part. How well does the movie portraythe game? Very f***ing good. First of all, Millia's costume was verysimilar to Jill's in RE3. Second, about 10 minutes of the film DOtake place within the mansion from RE1 (and if you played thegame, you WILL notice which rooms they are in). Third, a lot of theshots in the film are similar to the game (ex: a dead body lyingagainst the wall and blood stains all over the wall and a pool ofblood leading to his body). Fourth, (and this may spoil some of themovie for you, so you might want to skip to the next paragraph) theclimax takes place on a train. Overall the tone of the game is verysimilar to the movie. On a down note, don't think all the monsters will be in it. Nohunters, tyrants, sharks, spiders. There is ONE Licker, whoevolves into a super Licker, but they save him for the end. The film does have very "action" moments, such as the laserscene in the beginning, and the matrix move, but it won't ruin theoverall feel. The audience cheered and said "Oh damn!" wheneverthese incidents occured. But my favorite thing about this movie... is the hidden things theyput in that only the gamers would understand. They talk and showRaccoon City, as well as the outside and inside of the mansion."Biohazard" is said and shown in the first five minutes. And,(Beware: HUGE SPOILER!) they show you who Nemisis really is,which I thought was a very nice touch. The ending did let you hanging, like they might make a sequel(and I hope they do). If they do it would have to take place duringRE2 and RE3, cause anyone who beat RE3, knows what happensto Racoon City. No Chris, No Jill, No Barry (I love Barry), and no "You being themaster of unlocking" (joke for the gamers). GOOD MOVIE. SEE THIS. EVEN IF YOU HAVENT PLAYED THE GAME.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though Romero was nowhere to be found in the finally film, his archetypes were. This visually stunning, claustrophobic piece brings the video game to life in a way rarely, if ever, seen before. Moments of zombie-ridden calamity scream references to moments established in Romero's 'Dead' films, and leave the horror fanatic drooling with delight. Aside from some occasional bad dialogue, a constantly brooding Michelle Rodriguez and that ever present curse of finding good zombies to act in a film, it was a stunning work of horror. The zombie-loving public never gets a fair shake in the mainstream of Hollywood, so this is a must see if only for the moments that glimmer references to Romero-past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you go to see resident evil- go and see it because you want to have fun. Don't take it too seriously. It has some good special effects and quite a few moments that will make you jump- if not scream. My husband and I took my teenage son, and I was pretty skeptical about liking it. But really,- when is the last time you went to the theatre to see a zombie flick? It brought back memories!This movie is NOT for the pre teen or younger set- a young mother chose to bring her little girl- probably 4 or 5 years old - and the child was very frightened. The R rating is appropriate and parents should be aware. The down note of the film is Michelle Rodreguiz's performance. She tried too hard to be tough- I found it annoying. The rest of the cast was pretty good. Go ahead and see the movie- if you liked the video game, or just want to see a good zombie flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing I dont get is why they fired George Romero but still managed to rip off his movies. The whole movie is just cliche's from Romero's zombie movies and even specific lines of dialogue were taken from Dawn of the Dead. The film didnt even seem to be about zombie's at all, it was mostly about the umbrella computer. I think if they would have stuck to the plot of the games , at least character wise the film would have been alot better. The film didnt really give me a good sense of the character's like Romero's films do. I found my self rooting for the zombies to eat everyone just so the movie would be alittle interesting. The violence wasnt really that great either. I thought the violence/gore was pretty weak. They never even show the zombies really eating anyone! Overall I was disappointed but a film about zombies is better then most of the other horror movies that are out now a day's. Hopefully if the make a sequel it will be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely predictable scares, coupled with special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No spoilers here:Could the plot be anymore predictable? As soon as the sounds start to swell in this movie, you can count down the seconds until they scare you. You will sit around, placing bets in this movie about what will happen next, and how soon before the next zombie monster comes.Not to say the movie was a total washout. It's great for it's setting- a big, dark theater, with surround sound. The scares are well done- I fell for them every time, even though I knew what was going on. Questionable plot has generous amounts of cheese that will leave you going "Did they REALLY do something that stupid?" towards the end. I will say the movie is very good at faking you out with false alarms and then springing the expected scare about five false alarms later.The special effects were nicely done as well- anyone feel sorry for the dogs? The movie stays pretty true to the game, and feels like a giant video game thrown onscreen. Which it is, I suppose. Conspiracy plot presented in such a way that it's hard to grasp at the begining, but just smacks of "We're going to make a sequel" at the end. A good movie to watch if you're a fan of horror flicks or the game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the reason that gave interest for seeing this movie was I myself for playing all the Resident Evil series. And the other was they did a really good job with the trailer which made me want to see it even more. It seemed really cool which it was.I really expected the story to be simple where you too can be brainless like the zombies and still understand what's going on but the storyline is actually thought really well, many scenes shocked me many times, good thing about this movie is you can't really predict what's going to happen next and there are many chilling all of a sudden something popping out every few minutes which keeps you awake and interested at all times.Out of all the game-to-movie adaption, Resident Evil is the best entertaining film, Final Fantasy wasn't too bad but it lacked in similarity with the game and some scenes made me fall asleep and Tomb Raider was just a joke. Resident Evil though, you can watch many times and not get bored. Pure entertainment.I don't think this is much of a spoiler but the ending is similar to the start of Resident Evil 2 the game. Another plus is it uses many ideas from all the Resident Evil series such as the mutated dogs in RE1, the licking creature in RE2. I'm sure it's hard to use ideas from games to a movie which the creators of Final Fantasy didn't do a good job of (where were the chocobo's?!) anyways, even if you haven't played the game at all you MUST see this movie!I think this was a great start to build up to the sequal, if they make a sequal which they must, a lot of people will be craving to see the movie. For you gamers who saw this movie I'm sure the sequal will have Nemesis like in RE3.#1 Game to the big screen movie! Actually the RE1 the game was practically a movie with real people in the game. The game is no doubt one of the best games ever made and this movie is pretty much up there with the horror movies.I would give this film a 7 but Milla Jovovich looked great in this movie! +1Overall Rating: 8/10 Great Entertainment! I never heard so many screams in the theater before, hopefully even more scares and gore in the sequal, hehe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>See Milla Jovovich karate kick and blow away zombies, mutants and beasts in this fast-paced and action-packed genre blender. Is the film good? Yes, if you like mindless action/horror film with scenes that are less-than-original and derivative, but well-done with some genuinely tense and scary moments. Is the film violent? Somewhat, but not as much as I had hoped. Actually, it has surprisingly less gore than the video game from which it was adapted. Will this film win any Academy awards? Are you on drugs? Of course not, this is a mindless actioner that you will probably forget once you leave the theatre. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fast paced, high-tech, high-action, horror film that keeps you entertained from beginning to end. There have been other attempts at bringing video games to the big screen that had miserable results. Of course, we all remember the ill-fated Mario Brothers movie. MORTAL KOMBAT was probably the biggest let down. TOMB RAIDER was not as bad, but still failed to really "wow" audiences. So far, I would say RESIDENT EVIL is the best video-game-gone-big-screen so far. The plot outline is pretty simple: A team of commandos venture in to a secret corporate research base to discover what went wrong and why all the employees were killed off. They find out that horrible experiments were taking place and a biological terror is released in the form of vicious, flesh-eating zombies. They have to find the antidote and get out before they are sealed inside forever. The film moves fast. There are a lot of scares, some of which are set up with fast editing, but the film pulls it off effectively. The gore abounds and is VERY well done. Some of the disfigurements of the zombies was done with CGI to great effect. There is one zombie that is missing a large portion of his head, which pretty much looks like swiss cheese, and that effect is both startling and grotesque. I loved! And if Zombies are not enough for you, there are also zombie dobermans. And if that doesn't give you nightmares, there is a big, Frankenstien/Alien-from-hell monster that breaks loose from its incubation chamber that probably will give you nightmares. Besides the great effects, there are a lot of cool scenes throughout the movie. The highlight of which is probably the part where the commandos are sliced up with a laser beam. Also, the gore effects here are fantastic. (The end of the guy's knife getting sliced off and falling on the floor was a nice touch!) In fact, this movie is a lot gorier than I anticipated it would be. It is much more gore-infested than most movies that have been coming out in recent years. So that is a breath of fresh air to a horror fan like me. In some ways, the movie amounts to a very well done "B" horror flick. If you are like me, you will love that kind of stuff. Although this is not a perfect movie, the second act is long and well developed. By this I refer to the characters getting further and further in to trouble. The situation gets worse, and then, just when you think the situation could not get any worse, it gets WORSE still! Which creates some good suspense and great action scenes which build up to a fantastic third act with an exciting final battle on the train. Without giving anything away, I will just say that the conclusion was really well done. I really liked the ending, not only because it was creepy and the final special effect was really grandiose, but because we get to see Milla Jovovich's muffin...who could ask for anything better? She certainly doesn't seem to have a problem getting naked, which is a good thing. Made me reminisce of the good old horror movies of the early 80's. Only two minor complaints. The part where Milla starts breaking everybody's neck, I didn't really buy that. The human neck doesn't break so easily. Although, dying with Milla's thighs wrapped around my neck sounds like a pretty nice way to go. And sometimes the characters get in to deep trouble and then the movie doesn't really explain how they got out of that trouble. This doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film, however. If you liked ALIENS and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (my all time favorite horror/zombie movie) then you will like RESIDENT EVIL. Don't make the mistake of thinking this is another bummer of a video game/movie. It is an effective horror movie all on it's own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not SENSE SENSIBILITY so if you want character development, look elsewhere. This is for people who like John Carpenter films and genre pictures where all that matters is how the characters will stay alive (or conversely, which will die by the end of the movie and how).I played the game briefly a few years ago and was intrigued to see what this movie would be like -- for what it is, it's good! A fun (albeit LOUD) popcorn flick that will keep you interested and guessing. It has some flaws (what were those things in the crates? And how many railroad cars have cargo doors on the floor like that?) but I enjoyed this. And Milla Jovovitch is a hottie! Loved how they set up the sequel (which we'll see, I presume, if this one pulls down enough box office).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie just plain rocks! It has great blood scenes, great cast (Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez), great music (Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Madson), and great story (written by Paul Anderson). It's a great movie-adaption from a video game.I was so happy to see Anderson back on the director's chair. The last time he taggled a movie based on a game was 1995's "Mortal Kombat" (which I consider to be the best movie-adaption from a game. The sequel was good too). But, the last movie Paul made was 1998's flop "Soldier" (which was also good). Even his 1997's "Event Horizon was also good. Not only that, he also wrote and co-produced the movie. His first time writing and directing a movie since 1994's "Shopping." If you think "Resident Evil" is gonna be better than "Tomb Raider" and "Final Fantasy," you're right. This movie is heart-pounding from beginning to end. Check it out.One last note to Paul Anderson: BRING ON THE SEQUEL!!!! And make sure you write and direct it as well.A+ 13/13 ****** (out of ****** stars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I enjoy high-brow cinema, I also have a soft spot in my heart for shoot-em-up SF escapism.In my mind, "Aliens" from 1986 is still the best jump-off-your-seat SF scarefest of recent history. "Resident Evil" doesn't even come close to the level of techno-thriller expertise of that older movie.BUT: Resident Evil is a lot of fun, and should please many zombie fans. The story is a treatment of the classic zombie formula: trap some unwitting people in a closed system with flesh-eating dead people. Add some action sequences, some people-muching gore, and a couple of motivation twists to make it spicier, and you have the usual zombie stew.What makes this better than a C-movie Romero flick is the special effects wizardry, and a little more character texture than most Saturday afternoon zombie flicks.If you're looking for some fun B-movie escapism, and don't mind a couple of slower scenes, then you should enjoy this flick. I can't say I want to run out and buy the video game now, but I certainly did get some good jumps and good "grosssssss...!" factor from Resident Evil.3 stars out of 5.p.s. I thought "Tremors" and "Deep Blue Sea" were even more fun than Resident Evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Milla Jovovich kicks @ss with authority.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See Milla Jovovich karate kick and blow away zombies, mutants and beasts in this fast-paced and action-packed genre blender. Is the film good? Yes, if you like mindless action/horror film with scenes that are less-than-original and derivative, but well-done with some genuinely tense and scary moments. Is the film violent? Somewhat, but not as much as I had hoped. Actually, it has surprisingly less gore than the video game from which it was adapted. Will this film win any Academy awards? Are you on drugs? Of course not, this is a mindless actioner that you will probably forget once you leave the theatre. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fast paced, high-tech, high-action, horror film that keeps you entertained from beginning to end. There have been other attempts at bringing video games to the big screen that had miserable results. Of course, we all remember the ill-fated Mario Brothers movie. MORTAL KOMBAT was probably the biggest let down. TOMB RAIDER was not as bad, but still failed to really "wow" audiences. So far, I would say RESIDENT EVIL is the best video-game-gone-big-screen so far. The plot outline is pretty simple: A team of commandos venture in to a secret corporate research base to discover what went wrong and why all the employees were killed off. They find out that horrible experiments were taking place and a biological terror is released in the form of vicious, flesh-eating zombies. They have to find the antidote and get out before they are sealed inside forever. The film moves fast. There are a lot of scares, some of which are set up with fast editing, but the film pulls it off effectively. The gore abounds and is VERY well done. Some of the disfigurements of the zombies was done with CGI to great effect. There is one zombie that is missing a large portion of his head, which pretty much looks like swiss cheese, and that effect is both startling and grotesque. I loved! And if Zombies are not enough for you, there are also zombie dobermans. And if that doesn't give you nightmares, there is a big, Frankenstien/Alien-from-hell monster that breaks loose from its incubation chamber that probably will give you nightmares. Besides the great effects, there are a lot of cool scenes throughout the movie. The highlight of which is probably the part where the commandos are sliced up with a laser beam. Also, the gore effects here are fantastic. (The end of the guy's knife getting sliced off and falling on the floor was a nice touch!) In fact, this movie is a lot gorier than I anticipated it would be. It is much more gore-infested than most movies that have been coming out in recent years. So that is a breath of fresh air to a horror fan like me. In some ways, the movie amounts to a very well done "B" horror flick. If you are like me, you will love that kind of stuff. Although this is not a perfect movie, the second act is long and well developed. By this I refer to the characters getting further and further in to trouble. The situation gets worse, and then, just when you think the situation could not get any worse, it gets WORSE still! Which creates some good suspense and great action scenes which build up to a fantastic third act with an exciting final battle on the train. Without giving anything away, I will just say that the conclusion was really well done. I really liked the ending, not only because it was creepy and the final special effect was really grandiose, but because we get to see Milla Jovovich's muffin...who could ask for anything better? She certainly doesn't seem to have a problem getting naked, which is a good thing. Made me reminisce of the good old horror movies of the early 80's. Only two minor complaints. The part where Milla starts breaking everybody's neck, I didn't really buy that. The human neck doesn't break so easily. Although, dying with Milla's thighs wrapped around my neck sounds like a pretty nice way to go. And sometimes the characters get in to deep trouble and then the movie doesn't really explain how they got out of that trouble. This doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film, however. If you liked ALIENS and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (my all time favorite horror/zombie movie) then you will like RESIDENT EVIL. Don't make the mistake of thinking this is another bummer of a video game/movie. It is an effective horror movie all on it's own.</fullReview>

I for one have played the video-games, and love'em, so I had high hopes,but also doubt since Tomb Raider came out, and M.K.2 stank. But my faith has been restored in video-game movies after watching this movie. the story was excellent , casting, directing, effects, set design, all top-notch. the movie itself was scary as hell. seriously my heart was pounding mad all through the movie.

This film definitely does the popular game series justice.as acting goes, milla jovovich is new queen of kickin ass (excludin TV's Buffy) she does great with what is her first REAL starring role. the rest of the cast, especially michelle rodriguez, handle themselves well and are genuinely likable.the gore in this movie is pretty good and both the zombies and the dobermans were terrific looking. Paul Anderson does a great job writing and directing the film, bringing to life the best video game adaptation ever!the ending was superb and i cannot wait 4 the sequel.

		<shortDescription>Compared to the game, it falls way short.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I am going to warn you that the following comments may contain spoilers, because I'm not sure if comparing scenes from the film and the game could be seen as such.Anyway, Resident Evil is less like the video game and more like Event Horizon (by the same director, Paul Anderson) meets Dawn of the Dead (by the man who basically invented zombies, George Romero). Here's the bad first, as it is a lot easier to recall the bad than the good.Screw Up #1: Changing the script! Our Event Horizon director must have really liked his old film, because he decided to rewrite the RE script and make the Umbrella lab a slave of some AI computer, just like the "living spaceship" in EH. It felt more like the team was in battle with the lab instead of the zombies. And to think they initially had George Romero on the staff and let him get away!Screw Up #2: The zombies (what's left?)! There were no zombies in the mansion like in the game, it was basically "zip right to the lab to make the movie easier to shoot i.e. more contained." The zombies that were in the film were not scary or gory (except for a couple) and unlike older (Romero) zombie films, there was little violence in their destruction. No humor, no creativity, terribly crowded camera work on many of the "zombie" sequences, etc.Screw Up #3: The plot (now what's left?). The plot was a total rip off of Dawn of the Dead, yet Dawn was a much more entertaining, well-rounded movie. One major difference is that Anderson didn't take any time to develop ANY of the characters, so we really could care less who gets killed. When the good guys do die, most viewers won't even remember their names at that very moment.Screw Up #4: Translation (yep, that's right). They did not use ONE character from ANY of the games! Anderson claimed that using characters from the game would make the film too predictable. I (and I hope you agree) think that was a BAD move. I think his reason was that he didn't know JACK about the characters, so instead of doing some hard-nosed research on the games to "get it right" he decided to do it "his" way. Ouch!Screw Up #5: The ending. I won't give that away though...The Good: If you saw the commercial or trailer you saw most of the good stuff i.e. the dog getting kicked in the head, the lab sets were great, Milla is so beautiful I think she was the only reason most guys watch the film to the end, and there are a FEW other parts of the movie relative to the game which aren't worth mentioning. I had mixed feelings about Tomb Raider when I saw it, I thought it was good, but not very deep. But compared to this, Tomb Raider looks like gold. Anderson did much better with Mortal Kombat, I'm not sure what happened here.Overall score: 1.5 out of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Initially I disliked the movie, but I went home and played through one of the games and realized it wasn't so bad. If Paul Anderson decides to make a sequel he had better put enough "back tracking" plot and story-line for those who don't understand the deep rooted connotations of Umbrella Inc and the entire game series in general. I was disappointed that George Romero was booted, but I am beginning to wonder how bad his version was if they decided to keep Andersen...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly Surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read all the reviews for this movie before I dragged my boyfriend with me to go see this film. After reading the reviews, I got the notion that it was a great film for lovers of the genre, but lacked something to be desired for sci-fi/zombie movie loathers. Well, doesn't that assumption make sense? Anyway, I'm not going to spoil the movie, just suffice it to say, I was pleasantly surprised thinking it was going to be another mindless piece of celluloid. It turned out to be a movie filled with a dreaded atmosphere, and a continuing sense of foreboding, and actual morals. I think my only complaints about the film were the music (yes many other people had reservations about it), and the fact that I wanted to see more at the end, I wanted to know what happened next. Now that can be either a deterrent, or an advantage. Here it's both because there's no real sense of closure, but you actually care enough about the characters to want to know what happens next (rare for a video game-turned film). Oh, and my boyfriend liked it too.</fullReview>

I spent the first 2 and a half minutes wondering if Mila would get naked, score. The second half trying not to jump out of my seat even when I knew it was coming. and the third half hoping Michele Rodriquez would be a part of the sequal. I was all in all entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A big hit and a couple misses means you'll love or hate it...THE GOOD ----------------The movie has a great opening (minus the video game-like title intro). The first 15 min. of the movie does a great job of getting you very uncomfortable. Then the movie becomes pretty much nonstop action till the finish. The director likes to put in scenes that are nerve wracking, but predictable... BUT then turns around and manages to surprise you There were times when I was thinking to myself, "Oh man, he's gonna get it... Wait, he's gonna pull through... See, I knew it, lame... This movie sucks... WAIT(jump)! He didn't make it! Awesome."Alice(Milla Jovovich), the main character, was surprisingly likable. She did as good a job as she could have for the character, and I actually cared about what happened to her. I dont care too much for the actress's previous work so I was expecting another annoying performance, but, to my surprise, she was great. She had great reactions, the character was strong without being "IN YOUR FACE" and she actually managed to warm my heart a bit. :)Resident Evil is a classic pure zombie movie (love it or hate it), and most people have seen the old cliche's before. What I think sets Resident Evil apart is that it takes what you think will happen and switch it around to surprise you... That and the zombies aren't slow! ;)The sound was really loud... Sometimes annoyingly loud... However, the soundtrack was very effective in enhancing the mood and I actually got a kick out it.THE BAD -------------WARNING! This movie is not deep or intelligent in anyway. It's there simply to get a couple thrills and have some fun. Its a video game movie and it shows.There were a couple things that dragged this movie down. Rain(Michelle Rodriguez ), a female soldier working for Umbrella, was completely awful. Her lines ("After this is over, I'm gonna get laid") and her character's unrealistic reactions make her the most annoying female supporting role ever. She was what was wrong with Resident Evil.There were a couple parts of the movie where the plot felt a tad clumbsy, it didnt injure the incredibly basic plot too bad. Mostly they were creative mistakes. Some of the lines were just terrible. "Kiss me bitch"Also the CG was pretty bad and way too "clean" and "look at how cool I am".In the end, I had a lot of good dumb fun and I was actually looking forward for the sequel despite glaring flaws! Definately better than expected. RATING : 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a die-hard RE fan, it ROCKS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been waiting for this movie for years, and I'm glad that it was true to the game and worthy for RE fans all over the globe. I've played every game (except Gun Survivor) and I probably speak for everyone when I say that the first time you played a Resident Evil game, there were parts that scared the crap out of you (try in surround sound and you'll see what I mean). This movie has the same effect. I don't want to give away the plot (it's pretty obvious), but there were special effects in the movie that were as gory as they were awesome (the elevator, the laser room, the hives 'city simulator'). Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element) plays the perfect role of the games 'Attractive heroine who kicks zombie butt'. I can't express how typical this movie is of the RE genre (That expression being a very good thing). The ending follows closely to the opening of the game Resident Evil:2, and anyone who saw the ending and didn't understand it, just watch the opening sequence in the video game to get a really awesome, graphic explanation. 9 out of 10 for being such a good game-to-movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil is the best video game to movie translations ever, but they should have stuck with the storylines of the games more. Basically in the simpliest terms, it sort of follows the games, but the lack of the creatures, and main characters sort of brings this movie down. I was hoping to see Wesker, The giant spiders, Alexia, Alfred, Steve, Claire, Jill or Barry, and I was really wanting to see the Nemesis ("Stars!!!") or Tyrant on the big screen. The new people did a great job portraying the newcomers to the series, but it would have been alot better if they would have included any of the ones mentioned above. The special effects were great, and the licker looked just as creepy as it did when you saw him for the first time in RE 2. The zombie scenes were done effectively where it looks like they are really overpowering their victims. Overall a good all around movie, if you are a fan of the series, you'll like it.</fullReview>

The acting is actually good from some actors and moderate on others, and some of the lines are a little hammy, but overall the movie is terrific horror film. I found myself consistantly frightened during some points of the film, and when I wasn't, it was certainly a pleasure to watch the kinetic Milla Jovovich preform.The soundtrack was at times inappropriate. The special effects often obvious, and there was a hint of predictability, but surprisingly (due to the fantastic direction of Paul Anderson) I still found myself jumping.

		<fullReview>I saw a preview of RE yesterday and was not disappointed. I am a big fan of the video games, especially the first one, and like many of the gamers, I was shocked by the "Supercomputer" story. I would have loved the plot of RE being done in a movie, but well, you can't have it all.Also, the gore just was not enough. It is Rated R, but still not close to the game's great splatter effects. It's freakin Resident Evil!Aside from these two points I loved this movie, and I don't say this very often about a movie. It's fast and loud, a thrill ride from the beginning till the end (pretty much as scary as Event Horizon which I liked) and plenty of gun fights. The story is, while not the same as RE 1 (the game) at about the same level quality wise. The aspect I loved the most was Marilyn Manson's score. I love his music and he did a great job on this movie with a rather industrial, but still loud and freaky approach. The effects are good, I thought the Zombies looked just like they did in the game, and that's what I expected. The action scenes are nicely done, the only things I didn't like were the two "Matrix-type" scenes you can see in the trailers (bullet time &amp; wall walk).I was deeply satisfied when I walked out of the cinema into the cold night and I expect you will be too if you liked the game.Oh btw, did I mention Milla is just beautiful?9/10 (closer to the game would have been a ten)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DAWN OF THE DEAD for TV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eagerly waiting for this movie to be released I found it quite unsatisfying when I finally saw it. The creepy atmosphere and the well done action sequences can't help over the conglomerated plot made of two big chunks from DAWN OF THE DEAD and THE LIVING DEAD AT MANCHESTER MORGUE, a dash of ALIENS, and seasoned with several John Carpenter movies. But who thinks to find the gore and sometimes brilliant fiction of these splatter, horror and action classics in this movie will be disappointed. Apart from a scene which seemingly was inspired by the movie THE CUBE there is not much splatter in it. The one shot in the head you see at the end of the movie is probably topped every day on TV. All characters are written very plain and bloodless. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez do their best to add some attraction to them. But they are clearly outshone by the action and CGI effects. I don't say that is an entirely bad movie. It only seems to be trimmed for TV or computer games. It is fast paced, has two nice actresses and in some moments it really gives you the creeps. Therefore it is entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an avid player of the Resident Evil games. I went into the theatre with low expectations, expecting yet another horrible video game-to movie translation. The moment the film starts though, you can tell it is nothing like the anything that has come before it. It takes less than a minute for all heck to break loose as the virus is released upon "The hive"(an underground facility where the film takes place). The poor workers are trapped and we witness an intense and very sad series of scenes. Cut to above the complex where we meet out star, a beautiful young woman who can't remember who or where she is. In come the S.T.A.R.S members(the good guys) to save the day. They are here to see what went wrong at the Hive. All of this happens in only minutes...just hinting at how fast-paced this film is going to be. We meet many people, majority very likeable as they go deep into the Hive. The beauty of the film really comes out here. The film started so quickly and left so many things un-explained that we feel exactly like the lead. Everything is a mystery and every second of the film is part of the mystery unfolding. Now I won't give anymore away....the film does any amazing job of setting everything up, and slowly building up until the really scary stuff starts. Some of the acting at the start is a little off, but later the acting is great. You really start to care about the people, and when people die the way the characters react really gets to you. To top it off, this film has some of the best writing I've seen in a long time. I'm a writer so I'm usually very picky, but I was very happy with this films ability to surprise the audience. I see every horror movie, so I can always say what will happen next. In Resident Evil though, I had no idea what would happen. From opening scene to the completly amazing ending, I was susprirsed. There is even one specific scene that is so surprising, even after it happens you are still in dis-belief. By the time the film was over, everyone in our audience looked exhausted. I know I was. And if that still isn't enough, the movie fits perfectly in with the video games. Must you play the games to understand? No. People I saw it with have never played the games, but they still understood everything. However, if you have played the games, you will definitly appreciate the movie even more, if that's possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Closer To Reality Than You Might Think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fan of the game series for a long time, and I think the movie is an excellent addition to the franchise. If anything, the story is explained better in the movie because it is condensed and presented all at once. Of course, there's nothing like a romp through Raccoon City with your own shotgun to discover the hidden screts of Umbrella. Clearly there is room for both the movie(s) and the games, even if the stories differ slightly in some places.The scariest thing to me, though, is how possible the incident at Raccoon City is. As a Cellular and Developmental Biology major, I have seen how easy it really is to manipulate the genetic code of organisms, even with basic laboratory equipment. One of the first experiments performed by biology majors is to transform (modify the genetic code) of E. coli bacteria. The bacteria are typically given immunity to a specified antibiotic, in addition to a gene that allows transformed bacteria to glow when exposed to UV light. While bacteria are particularly easy to modify, it is certainly possible to modify other organisms as well. "Transgenic" food, as well as new advancements in pharmaceuticals have proven this. Will we ever see human experimentation or an outbreak like in Raccoon City? Hmm...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Damn I just watched the movie in a staff screening of empire theatres. and it was damn good! now, i really don't like movies like that, where there's so much blood and guts and people eating each other, but it was really well done.The style, cinematography and acting in the movie are just right for the gendre and mood of the film. some may say they suck at acting but i liked the cold, some may say bad acting of the characters. it suits the movie better.This movie is not about making moody masterpiece, more of just running around in panic and trying to survive. and scaring us with freaky zombies who wants to bite you.the movie is 2 hours and 50 minutes but i never noticed the time, meaning it was really fast paced and kept you with the movie throughout the whole time.I would NOT go see it again. because i am not in favor of the contents - such as people being eaten, being cut up to pieces etc etc. but that's just me. that's not my thing. but it is recommended that the people go see it as it's a FUN movie to watch. I was driving home after the movie and god i felt like i was in the movie. I felt quite paranoid. i felt like a zombies gonna jump into my car window andtry to break in. But no zombie did. hewwwwwwoverall, i give the movie two thumbs up for doing what it set out to do - mindless running around in frantic trying to survive horror movie that keeps you on the edge of your seats with horrific images and ideas.I doubt people who made the movie thought about it morally, but i really thinkt hat what happened in the movie should be seriously considered. Zombies and Genetics technology. believe it or not, it may all be possible for shit like that to happen someday. all of the great scientific advances we have origially started from ideas and fantasy.ofcourse, nobody (i hope) fantasizes about zombies, but i think the fact that we are developing sciences without thinking and not takign responsibilty for our creation is a serious issue. infact, we already have things in this world that are far more horrific than zombies. - Nuclear Weapons.anyways. go see the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never before have these words been more true. After seeing the game-to-movie adaptation of RE, I left the theater feeling uneasy, shaken, and for the first time in a long while, genuinely scared. When I got home I decided to see if anyone else on this vast internet would agree with me. What I found has shocked me possibly more than the movie did. It seems as though everyone on the net thinks they're some high grade movie buff. All I'm seeing in regards to this movie is negative feedback. That's a funny thing considering all the RE shows at my local theater were sold out last night. I think the problem is that everyone reviewing this movie is jaded by the normal crop of touching, emotional, hoopty-blah that comes out every couple months. Critics are walking into this movie expecting the get the same kind of experience they got from 'We Were Soldiers', or 'Forrest Gump'. I honestly don't think critics can spot a good horror movie when they see one anymore. This movie grabs you right from the getgo. Just when you think it's gonna cheapen out and be not-so-gruesom (like most game movies), it hits you in the face with 100 minutes of the most action packed scenes, INCREDIBLE special effects, and enough gore and horror to keep you cringing at night.I will openly admit that I went to see this movie as a game fan. I just wanted to see how it transitioned. I in NO WAY expected the movie experience I got last night. I give this movie, out of 5 stars, a big-ass 5. If you haven't seen this movie, disregard the old critics who don't like a genuine scare, and get to your local movie house. But as a side-caution, DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a preview of RE yesterday and was not disappointed. I am a big fan of the video games, especially the first one, and like many of the gamers, I was shocked by the "Supercomputer" story. I would have loved the plot of RE being done in a movie, but well, you can't have it all.Also, the gore just was not enough. It is Rated R, but still not close to the game's great splatter effects. It's freakin Resident Evil!Aside from these two points I loved this movie, and I don't say this very often about a movie. It's fast and loud, a thrill ride from the beginning till the end (pretty much as scary as Event Horizon which I liked) and plenty of gun fights. The story is, while not the same as RE 1 (the game) at about the same level quality wise. The aspect I loved the most was Marilyn Manson's score. I love his music and he did a great job on this movie with a rather industrial, but still loud and freaky approach. The effects are good, I thought the Zombies looked just like they did in the game, and that's what I expected. The action scenes are nicely done, the only things I didn't like were the two "Matrix-type" scenes you can see in the trailers (bullet time &amp; wall walk).I was deeply satisfied when I walked out of the cinema into the cold night and I expect you will be too if you liked the game.Oh btw, did I mention Milla is just beautiful?9/10 (closer to the game would have been a ten)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost didn't see this film on opening night, I didn't think it was going to be that great...was I surprised! This movie was well made, the acting was great (of course anything Milla does is terrific). There was great action, adn the suspence was amazing. This is deffinatly a movie I would see again at the theatre, and that doesn't happen very often! The Story was well thought out, the cenemotography was great, they made a movie about flesh eating dead people and still made it realistic, GREAT MOVIE!! If you haven't seen it, go get your keys and run to see it........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I played 3 out of the 4 games out in the US, and I absolutely loved the movie. I went with people who never played the game, or just 1 or 2 of them, and they all felt the same way. I had a feeling it was going to be a little bit like "Aliens" but I didn't mind. Game fans will notice the nods given to the game here and there. It was a very enjoyable experience, but I think I'm going to have to see it again. Milla was just too darn distracting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DAWN OF THE DEAD for TV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eagerly waiting for this movie to be released I found it quite unsatisfying when I finally saw it. The creepy atmosphere and the well done action sequences can't help over the conglomerated plot made of two big chunks from DAWN OF THE DEAD and THE LIVING DEAD AT MANCHESTER MORGUE, a dash of ALIENS, and seasoned with several John Carpenter movies. But who thinks to find the gore and sometimes brilliant fiction of these splatter, horror and action classics in this movie will be disappointed. Apart from a scene which seemingly was inspired by the movie THE CUBE there is not much splatter in it. The one shot in the head you see at the end of the movie is probably topped every day on TV. All characters are written very plain and bloodless. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez do their best to add some attraction to them. But they are clearly outshone by the action and CGI effects. I don't say that is an entirely bad movie. It only seems to be trimmed for TV or computer games. It is fast paced, has two nice actresses and in some moments it really gives you the creeps. Therefore it is entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an avid player of the Resident Evil games. I went into the theatre with low expectations, expecting yet another horrible video game-to movie translation. The moment the film starts though, you can tell it is nothing like the anything that has come before it. It takes less than a minute for all heck to break loose as the virus is released upon "The hive"(an underground facility where the film takes place). The poor workers are trapped and we witness an intense and very sad series of scenes. Cut to above the complex where we meet out star, a beautiful young woman who can't remember who or where she is. In come the S.T.A.R.S members(the good guys) to save the day. They are here to see what went wrong at the Hive. All of this happens in only minutes...just hinting at how fast-paced this film is going to be. We meet many people, majority very likeable as they go deep into the Hive. The beauty of the film really comes out here. The film started so quickly and left so many things un-explained that we feel exactly like the lead. Everything is a mystery and every second of the film is part of the mystery unfolding. Now I won't give anymore away....the film does any amazing job of setting everything up, and slowly building up until the really scary stuff starts. Some of the acting at the start is a little off, but later the acting is great. You really start to care about the people, and when people die the way the characters react really gets to you. To top it off, this film has some of the best writing I've seen in a long time. I'm a writer so I'm usually very picky, but I was very happy with this films ability to surprise the audience. I see every horror movie, so I can always say what will happen next. In Resident Evil though, I had no idea what would happen. From opening scene to the completly amazing ending, I was susprirsed. There is even one specific scene that is so surprising, even after it happens you are still in dis-belief. By the time the film was over, everyone in our audience looked exhausted. I know I was. And if that still isn't enough, the movie fits perfectly in with the video games. Must you play the games to understand? No. People I saw it with have never played the games, but they still understood everything. However, if you have played the games, you will definitly appreciate the movie even more, if that's possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of the game series for a long time, and I think the movie is an excellent addition to the franchise. If anything, the story is explained better in the movie because it is condensed and presented all at once. Of course, there's nothing like a romp through Raccoon City with your own shotgun to discover the hidden screts of Umbrella. Clearly there is room for both the movie(s) and the games, even if the stories differ slightly in some places.The scariest thing to me, though, is how possible the incident at Raccoon City is. As a Cellular and Developmental Biology major, I have seen how easy it really is to manipulate the genetic code of organisms, even with basic laboratory equipment. One of the first experiments performed by biology majors is to transform (modify the genetic code) of E. coli bacteria. The bacteria are typically given immunity to a specified antibiotic, in addition to a gene that allows transformed bacteria to glow when exposed to UV light. While bacteria are particularly easy to modify, it is certainly possible to modify other organisms as well. "Transgenic" food, as well as new advancements in pharmaceuticals have proven this. Will we ever see human experimentation or an outbreak like in Raccoon City? Hmm...</fullReview>

Everything is a mystery and every second of the film is part of the mystery unfolding. Now I won't give anymore away....the film does any amazing job of setting everything up, and slowly building up until the really scary stuff starts. Some of the acting at the start is a little off, but later the acting is great. You really start to care about the people, and when people die the way the characters react really gets to you. To top it off, this film has some of the best writing I've seen in a long time. I'm a writer so I'm usually very picky, but I was very happy with this films ability to surprise the audience. I see every horror movie, so I can always say what will happen next. In Resident Evil though, I had no idea what would happen. From opening scene to the completly amazing ending, I was susprirsed. There is even one specific scene that is so surprising, even after it happens you are still in dis-belief. By the time the film was over, everyone in our audience looked exhausted. I know I was. And if that still isn't enough, the movie fits perfectly in with the video games. Must you play the games to understand? No. People I saw it with have never played the games, but they still understood everything. However, if you have played the games, you will definitly appreciate the movie even more, if that's possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Closer To Reality Than You Might Think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fan of the game series for a long time, and I think the movie is an excellent addition to the franchise. If anything, the story is explained better in the movie because it is condensed and presented all at once. Of course, there's nothing like a romp through Raccoon City with your own shotgun to discover the hidden screts of Umbrella. Clearly there is room for both the movie(s) and the games, even if the stories differ slightly in some places.The scariest thing to me, though, is how possible the incident at Raccoon City is. As a Cellular and Developmental Biology major, I have seen how easy it really is to manipulate the genetic code of organisms, even with basic laboratory equipment. One of the first experiments performed by biology majors is to transform (modify the genetic code) of E. coli bacteria. The bacteria are typically given immunity to a specified antibiotic, in addition to a gene that allows transformed bacteria to glow when exposed to UV light. While bacteria are particularly easy to modify, it is certainly possible to modify other organisms as well. "Transgenic" food, as well as new advancements in pharmaceuticals have proven this. Will we ever see human experimentation or an outbreak like in Raccoon City? Hmm...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Damn I just watched the movie in a staff screening of empire theatres. and it was damn good! now, i really don't like movies like that, where there's so much blood and guts and people eating each other, but it was really well done.The style, cinematography and acting in the movie are just right for the gendre and mood of the film. some may say they suck at acting but i liked the cold, some may say bad acting of the characters. it suits the movie better.This movie is not about making moody masterpiece, more of just running around in panic and trying to survive. and scaring us with freaky zombies who wants to bite you.the movie is 2 hours and 50 minutes but i never noticed the time, meaning it was really fast paced and kept you with the movie throughout the whole time.I would NOT go see it again. because i am not in favor of the contents - such as people being eaten, being cut up to pieces etc etc. but that's just me. that's not my thing. but it is recommended that the people go see it as it's a FUN movie to watch. I was driving home after the movie and god i felt like i was in the movie. I felt quite paranoid. i felt like a zombies gonna jump into my car window andtry to break in. But no zombie did. hewwwwwwoverall, i give the movie two thumbs up for doing what it set out to do - mindless running around in frantic trying to survive horror movie that keeps you on the edge of your seats with horrific images and ideas.I doubt people who made the movie thought about it morally, but i really thinkt hat what happened in the movie should be seriously considered. Zombies and Genetics technology. believe it or not, it may all be possible for shit like that to happen someday. all of the great scientific advances we have origially started from ideas and fantasy.ofcourse, nobody (i hope) fantasizes about zombies, but i think the fact that we are developing sciences without thinking and not takign responsibilty for our creation is a serious issue. infact, we already have things in this world that are far more horrific than zombies. - Nuclear Weapons.anyways. go see the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Resident Evil:the movie last night and i came out very excited about this franchise. My background is that I have played just about all of the games except for Nemesis and I loved them. This movie captures the feel of the game very nicely with great atmospheric work. All of the sets were very well done and had a very eerie feel to them(the flooded offices were creepy! the bodies float by). Another advantage of this movie is that they played it smart and did not go for the obvious scares on most of them. For example(not ruining anything) lets say there was a dead body laying down and you walked up to it; the obvious scare would be for the body to move; but in RE expect anything! Sure the plot isnt spectacular(says a lot when a movie with no plot like gladiator or crouching tiger can get awards) but this is survival horror! Thats a plot within itself. Get out alive! Makes sense to me. The dialogue is terrible but i got over it. The games themselves were not known for their great lines. (Thats jill shes the master of unlocking things, WESKER!!!!!!!!!) All in all the acting was good for this type of movie. Milla was perfectly cast and really played the part well.(the kicking of the dog was cool and her dress is awesome!) Some of the minor characters are downplayed and killed before we know their names ,but it was necessary. This movie definitely had something for everybody who is into this type of movie. For the hardcore gamer they made references to the games(saving bullets). For the horror fan you have definite suspense and terror from the zombies. And for the hopeless romantic your mate will be in your arms jumping and cringing from explicit decapitation = D All in all i say see this movie! Even if you didnt play the games see this movie! I say it probably will make you want to experience the survival horror(soon to be rereleased on gamecube ; )!!! Go in expecting a fun scary movie with great special effects and visuals and you won't be dissapointed! Some other sites are saying this is a bad movie which is not true. I saw 13 ghosts at a free screening, THAT was a bad movie. So if you have any desire to see this movie dont be fooled by the cruddy critics of the net who dont know what they are talking about. GO SURVIVE THE HORROR MWAHAHAHAHAAH</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A HOT MILLA KICKS ASS. An "Escape from the Zombies" blast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "Night of the Living Dead" came out decades ago I kept wondering how long it would take them to figure out to SHOOT THE ZOMBIES IN THE HEAD!! Well, apparently our heroes are still a little slow on the uptake - or never saw that classic! This time the zombies, former technicians, are underground in a high-tech lab that secretly develops terrifying biochemical weapons of mass destruction.For those who care about the reasons for why things went crazy down there, suffice it to say there was a plot to steal a virus to prove what a horrible place it is - but one of the conspirators preferred to sell the virus to the highest bidder, while killing everyone else (or at least turning them into the Undead). I think that was the explanation! Regardless, a sort of SWAT team is dispatched to shut down the Artificial Intelligence computer that has taken control of "the hive" - that name for this huge multi-level subterranean laboratory.The gorgeous Milla Jovovich, never looking better, plays an enigmatic prisoner of the SWAT team suffering from memory loss. It is a really KICK (in more ways than one) to see how she slowly regains her memory - and her martial arts skills.Milla and the SWAT team descended into the menacing lab. . . and the scene where many of them meet their grizzly, laser-induced doom (Slice and Dice time) is a Classic Movie Moment everyone in the theater found deliciously gory. Only after that do they (the survivors) discover the lab is filled with refugees from "Night of the Living Dead" and a pack of bloody zombie-Dobermans who look as though they've been turned inside-out. Milla deals with them single-handed.As they make their way out, after "frying" the AI computer and battling the zombies, they discover the traitor in their midst - and a gigantic, mutating monstrosity with which they have a final heart-pounding battle on a moving underground train. The thing tried some "tongue-action" with Milla to its regret. Those who see it will know what I mean; it was rather droll.Towards the end, Milla, wrapped in less than when she appeared in "The Fifth Element", faces an Apocalyptic Armageddon scene - the virus not having been contained.The cast is generically adequate, although Michelle Rodriguez as "Rain Ocampo" clearly modeled her tough-talking Hispanic female character on Private Vasquez in the great "Aliens" from 1986.Special effects are very good; the monster-thing being the highlight. Perhaps after all these movies I've become jaded, but I didn't think it was even all that gory. But that may be just me. There is absolutely nothing thought-provoking about this film, which is OK with me (although that was a failing with "The Time Machine").Anyway, it's a fun way to kill a few hours - entertaining and exciting. 7 out of 10. I'm a little generous.Read the credit crawl at the end. Almost every name is German. It was filmed in Berlin.</fullReview>

They weren't twins by any means, but the story line is definitely good, the plot is pretty thick and still somewhat echoes the game. Unfortunately, there are no connections to the characters within the actual game, but for the movie to stand on it's own and be "inspired" by the game, rather than a cinematic version of it, it was done nicely.

		<shortDescription>Enter the World of Survival Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I walked into the theatres today, I wasn't expecting much from the director of such classics as "Mortal Kombat". There was still, though, that lingering part in me that wanted the movie to rock. Well, my friends, I can safely say that it does.Milla Jovovich (besides being scantily clad atleast three times) is excellent in her role here, even with a trying plot device in the "Amnesia Sufferer" bit. Michelle Rodriguez mainly looks like somebody took a wiz in her corn flakes; hats off especially to James Purefoy and Eric Mabius, who deliver a fine performance when most thought they'd bomb horribly.Contrary to most reports, Resident Evil is not as gore-filled as sold on. In fact, the low-level of gore compared to other horror flicks might be a knock off for some die-hard zombie killers out there. Still, this movie suffices as a true zombie-flick in every sense of the word. And hey, the lazer deathtrap near the beginning was pretty neat as well.As far as movies go, Resident Evil wont be an Academy Award winner, nor will it likely make history in any sense of the word. Still, as far as entertainment and Game-to-Movie adaptions, Resident Evil is head &amp; shoulders above the rest to date. Thus, I christen it with the 10-* vote. Now, against other horror movies &amp; films, I'd be more inclined with giving it maybe a 7 or 7.5, but I'm a RE mark so sue me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly tense movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I want to say that I have never played resident evil or even seen it played, so I have no idea about accuracy to the game, etc. That being said I will review it as a movie only.This movie is incredibly tense. Throughout the entire movie I kept waiting for the next jolt/scare, knowing it was coming and still getting startled. The plot proved vaguely interesting, but was largely lost in the carnage. And of course since this is a sci-fi horror the ending left open the possibility of Resident Evil 2.The acting was on par for a horror scifi movie. Basically the cast was Michelle Rodriguez, Milla Jovovitch and a bunch of guys no one cares about except that they (in some cases) advance the plot. Milla did a fine job playing the beautiful but tough security agent with amnesia and something to hide. Michelle played a thug, an annoying thug (as per her usual endeavors). Both actresses have their pseudo-trademark scenes. For Milla this means being nearly naked except for, to quote James Bond, A nice nothing she is almost wearing. For Michelle it is the sweaty hair in the face snarl look.All in all it was better than most game turned movies and about on the same level with other movies of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what movie the reviewers are seeing, and the commentaries here border on moronic babble. RESIDENT EVIL represents one thing clearly, and that is the generation gap between lovers of good b-movies and horror films and the younger folks who don't have the background to dig what RE does. What the stupid slobbering gore-twits and the "film" snobs are missing is RE's true, uncompromising nature; no self-referential, humorous one-liners or pompous revision of the Zombie Attack genre. RE revels in understanding what is terrifying about the living dead.That understanding? The impending attacks, the coming of the zombies, their craven need. Zombie movies prey psychologically: they are out there, they will not stop, they want us, they ARE us. That's the horror behind the Zombie, that's what makes the Zombie truly unstoppable--as long as we exist, the Zombies will exist.The attack scenes are hardcore enough, coupled with any lifelong Zombie lover's imagination, to provide the truly impressive tension that drives RE. All credit for that should go to Anderson the director and writer: he manages a strong, kinetic movie devoid of the worst of horror cliches--in fact, Anderson manages to respect the audience enough to give them genuinely eerie imagery; I had no problem accepting the world of the Hive, of the Umbrella Co, and of the T-Virus.And Milla Jovovich is superb; a fantastic actress entering her prime gig in RE. She manages to show human frailty even as she displays very cool martial abilities. Jovovich is simply perfect as a beautiful woman discovering that she is a high-level professional killer as unstoppable as the waves of zombies that descend on her.Anyone who loves good, solid, uncompromising horror films should check this out (uncompromising up to a point, of course; at certain points, gore in grand quantities SHOULD have come, for the story dictates it; the gore is minimized, and you can thank the same board restrictions that have voided most realistic violence and sex from films and replaced it with cartoons--a Zombie movie is a gore movie, and at some point, as Romero knew, you have to show just how awful it is to be eaten alive). But let me say this: I'm willing to pass up on the hardcore viscera in order to get a full-bodied, enjoyable, and non-idiotic horror movie. I'll even accept the poor CGI on the inhuman monsters, the non-zombies, to get zombies back on the screen again.Certainly RE is a step in the right direction. For everyone wishing for the return of the horror film to full popularity, RE's as good as it gets. As the 1950s science fiction movies led to the '60s psycho fests and then to '70s mind-blowing blood-letting, all gore-hounds should keep in mind that good Zombie movies without the intestines will only open the door to movies that DO contain those scenes, and for all other American films to loosen the restrictions. But RE proves it isn't necessary, and even if we don't see the flesh tearing and the brains blowing out of the back of the head, our minds perceive it, and our minds are where the zombies have always fed most heartily.Excellent movie. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how can such a fast-paced movie be so boring?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>maybe I shouldn't rip into this film so much, as I did see it at a free sneak preview. and I'm not really a gamer, only playing the "resident evil" games a bit, and mostly watching the game being played and picking it up at various points throughout. but I'm a huge fan of zombie/splatter/gore/horror films, and so therefore I can honestly say that if you're debating about seeing this film, my advice would be to skip it (or see it at a matinee, definitely not worth $8) and wait to rent it on video.the strongest aspects of the best zombie films- "evil dead", "dead alive', "cemetery man"- as that they are irreverant and refuse to take themselves seriously. but paul anderson in "resident evil" takes himself much too seriously, which eventually ruins any promise the film might have had. I'm just wondering why I was bored throughout the flick. during the mansion scenes, the introductory office scenes, making the way to the Red Queen- sure there was the occasional scare and fright, but it wasn't until they shut the computer off that I thought "is it finally going to get interesting?"perhaps I was just waiting and was expectant too much for the zombies. and they didn't disappoint. in fact, the special &amp; visual fx of "resident evil" were quite good and was definitely a highlight to the film. as was the use of audio in providing the suspense and building tension. (although the score created by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Mansion is garbage and unnecessary.) however, the acting was just putird. milla jovovich just CAN'T act. she's best when she just sits there and looks pretty w/o opening her mouth- as in 'dazed and confused' and 'fifth element'. sure she's a hottie, and it's quite obvious the paul anderson tried to come up with any reason to show off her body as necessary, but that's jsut sticking to the tired horror film cliche of showing the primary female in various stages of undress. nothing new there. and what's up with the complete obnoxiousness of michelle rodriguez's character. she delivered every one of her lines compeletely flat and her attempts at humor were ridiculousness. it got tothe point where I despised her character, didn't care that she was infected, and in fact felt pretty good when her character was offed. michelle sure has tumbled swiftly from her promising debut in "girlfight". you couldn't have done a more poor job casting for the two primary female roles. they definitely don't measure up to angelina jolie in "tomb raider", which although wasn't that great of a film, it is much better and more fun and doesn't take itself as seriously as "resident evil." the other cast members are incidental for the most part, though it did kind of bug me that the most gruesome deaths were saved for the characters of color. whats up with that?and the plot kind of bugged me- I understand the computer's intent on killing everybody off once the toxin escaped, but the computer was also aware that the dead would eventually become reanimated, yet took no steps to take care of that eventual side effect, such as torching the Hive or something similar. it did have a failsafe programmed in, thus providing the countdown of our heroes having to escape from the Hive, but it was- in my opinion- too much time allowed with the possibility of escape of the toxin too high. and I didn't quite understand the rationale behind the crack team going into the Hive- the reason given was to find out why the Queen went homicidal and to take apart the mainframe, but ti seemed far too dangerous and unnecessary for me. then again, when you work for the shady Umbrella Corporation, I guess you jsut don't ask questions and blindly follow orders. even when they lead to disastorous results, as can be seen at the end of the flick.anyways, its not as if this film is horrible or incredibly bad. I just found it boring. even Romero's epic plodding "dawn of the dead" I found more interesting than this flick- perhaps because it made me think and it stimulated my mind, whereas "resident evil" didn't. regardless, if you like loud/ fast/ zombie/ splatter films with half-naked babes and plenty of blood, then "resident evil" is the film for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got back from seeing Resident Evil. Based on the fact that the theater was sold out for every showing today (including the 11:40pm I went to) I'd guess that it's definitely going to be a hit. It should be. It has everything someone expecting a movie based on the game should have. You have the house (albeit briefly), the dogs, Umbrella Corporation, the licker thing, the T-Virus and, oh yeah, the zombies. Add on some very nice gratuitous shots of Milla Jovovich completely naked and you've got the whole package.What doesn't this film have? Let's see... a well written story, well done CGI, tension, scares and, oh yeah, GORE. Yes there's some blood in it but the camera is always cutting away when a scene that would require gore comes up. Maybe they cut all of the gore to get an R rating as I've read but there's so little that I think it would practically be PG if not for Milla's nudity and the work f**k used 1 or 2 times. How they could have turned down George Romero's script and fired him as director and then thought that Paul Anderson was making a better movie I have no idea.So what we have here is an extremely mainstream version of what Hollywood thinks a horror movie should be. Horror fans will probably be very unimpressed with it. If you've nothing to do and need to kill 90 minutes then there are worse things you could occupy your time with but certainly don't go out of your way to see it.</fullReview>

Then a group of Combat fighters invade the nest and try to found any survivors (good Luck).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was a lot better than I expected. Then again, my expectations were set *really* low (so that it would be difficult for me to be let down).Res. Evil greatly exceeded my expectations. That means it was pretty good--not Oscar material, but good.They movie intentionally has a somewhat different plot from the game it's based on (so that things don't get boring). At the same time, even though it's different from the game, it manages to keep a lot of the same feeling--and you can definitely still claim that this movie *is* "Resident Evil".Warning: ::Possible semi-ENDING-SPOILER::Watch out for that ending--it's dark, open ended, and screaming, "SEQUEL!!" It looks really cool too. :-)Okay, that's all.I gave it an IMDb score of 8. It would have been 9 except for a few scenes I thought were fairly lame that, in my opinion, hurt the film. Still an over-all good action movie though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! I went into this movie with doubts lurking in the back of my mind from the horrors of seeing Mortal Kombat but they were quickly blown sky high. This movie rocks the socks! It's nothing sensational or mind bending but why would one expect it to be. And the acting was almost as bad as the video games (is.. that... Chris's blood?). It's action-horror at its best! The plot is ...there, albeit nothing super but it's more than made up for with tons of action scenes. You will jump, and you will jump more than once! Suspense, Thrills, Action...it delivers all three, and its very entertaining. Drool lil' poochies drool! Overall 8/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what movie the reviewers are seeing, and the commentaries here border on moronic babble. RESIDENT EVIL represents one thing clearly, and that is the generation gap between lovers of good b-movies and horror films and the younger folks who don't have the background to dig what RE does. What the stupid slobbering gore-twits and the "film" snobs are missing is RE's true, uncompromising nature; no self-referential, humorous one-liners or pompous revision of the Zombie Attack genre. RE revels in understanding what is terrifying about the living dead.That understanding? The impending attacks, the coming of the zombies, their craven need. Zombie movies prey psychologically: they are out there, they will not stop, they want us, they ARE us. That's the horror behind the Zombie, that's what makes the Zombie truly unstoppable--as long as we exist, the Zombies will exist.The attack scenes are hardcore enough, coupled with any lifelong Zombie lover's imagination, to provide the truly impressive tension that drives RE. All credit for that should go to Anderson the director and writer: he manages a strong, kinetic movie devoid of the worst of horror cliches--in fact, Anderson manages to respect the audience enough to give them genuinely eerie imagery; I had no problem accepting the world of the Hive, of the Umbrella Co, and of the T-Virus.And Milla Jovovich is superb; a fantastic actress entering her prime gig in RE. She manages to show human frailty even as she displays very cool martial abilities. Jovovich is simply perfect as a beautiful woman discovering that she is a high-level professional killer as unstoppable as the waves of zombies that descend on her.Anyone who loves good, solid, uncompromising horror films should check this out (uncompromising up to a point, of course; at certain points, gore in grand quantities SHOULD have come, for the story dictates it; the gore is minimized, and you can thank the same board restrictions that have voided most realistic violence and sex from films and replaced it with cartoons--a Zombie movie is a gore movie, and at some point, as Romero knew, you have to show just how awful it is to be eaten alive). But let me say this: I'm willing to pass up on the hardcore viscera in order to get a full-bodied, enjoyable, and non-idiotic horror movie. I'll even accept the poor CGI on the inhuman monsters, the non-zombies, to get zombies back on the screen again.Certainly RE is a step in the right direction. For everyone wishing for the return of the horror film to full popularity, RE's as good as it gets. As the 1950s science fiction movies led to the '60s psycho fests and then to '70s mind-blowing blood-letting, all gore-hounds should keep in mind that good Zombie movies without the intestines will only open the door to movies that DO contain those scenes, and for all other American films to loosen the restrictions. But RE proves it isn't necessary, and even if we don't see the flesh tearing and the brains blowing out of the back of the head, our minds perceive it, and our minds are where the zombies have always fed most heartily.Excellent movie. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how can such a fast-paced movie be so boring?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>maybe I shouldn't rip into this film so much, as I did see it at a free sneak preview. and I'm not really a gamer, only playing the "resident evil" games a bit, and mostly watching the game being played and picking it up at various points throughout. but I'm a huge fan of zombie/splatter/gore/horror films, and so therefore I can honestly say that if you're debating about seeing this film, my advice would be to skip it (or see it at a matinee, definitely not worth $8) and wait to rent it on video.the strongest aspects of the best zombie films- "evil dead", "dead alive', "cemetery man"- as that they are irreverant and refuse to take themselves seriously. but paul anderson in "resident evil" takes himself much too seriously, which eventually ruins any promise the film might have had. I'm just wondering why I was bored throughout the flick. during the mansion scenes, the introductory office scenes, making the way to the Red Queen- sure there was the occasional scare and fright, but it wasn't until they shut the computer off that I thought "is it finally going to get interesting?"perhaps I was just waiting and was expectant too much for the zombies. and they didn't disappoint. in fact, the special &amp; visual fx of "resident evil" were quite good and was definitely a highlight to the film. as was the use of audio in providing the suspense and building tension. (although the score created by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Mansion is garbage and unnecessary.) however, the acting was just putird. milla jovovich just CAN'T act. she's best when she just sits there and looks pretty w/o opening her mouth- as in 'dazed and confused' and 'fifth element'. sure she's a hottie, and it's quite obvious the paul anderson tried to come up with any reason to show off her body as necessary, but that's jsut sticking to the tired horror film cliche of showing the primary female in various stages of undress. nothing new there. and what's up with the complete obnoxiousness of michelle rodriguez's character. she delivered every one of her lines compeletely flat and her attempts at humor were ridiculousness. it got tothe point where I despised her character, didn't care that she was infected, and in fact felt pretty good when her character was offed. michelle sure has tumbled swiftly from her promising debut in "girlfight". you couldn't have done a more poor job casting for the two primary female roles. they definitely don't measure up to angelina jolie in "tomb raider", which although wasn't that great of a film, it is much better and more fun and doesn't take itself as seriously as "resident evil." the other cast members are incidental for the most part, though it did kind of bug me that the most gruesome deaths were saved for the characters of color. whats up with that?and the plot kind of bugged me- I understand the computer's intent on killing everybody off once the toxin escaped, but the computer was also aware that the dead would eventually become reanimated, yet took no steps to take care of that eventual side effect, such as torching the Hive or something similar. it did have a failsafe programmed in, thus providing the countdown of our heroes having to escape from the Hive, but it was- in my opinion- too much time allowed with the possibility of escape of the toxin too high. and I didn't quite understand the rationale behind the crack team going into the Hive- the reason given was to find out why the Queen went homicidal and to take apart the mainframe, but ti seemed far too dangerous and unnecessary for me. then again, when you work for the shady Umbrella Corporation, I guess you jsut don't ask questions and blindly follow orders. even when they lead to disastorous results, as can be seen at the end of the flick.anyways, its not as if this film is horrible or incredibly bad. I just found it boring. even Romero's epic plodding "dawn of the dead" I found more interesting than this flick- perhaps because it made me think and it stimulated my mind, whereas "resident evil" didn't. regardless, if you like loud/ fast/ zombie/ splatter films with half-naked babes and plenty of blood, then "resident evil" is the film for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got back from seeing Resident Evil. Based on the fact that the theater was sold out for every showing today (including the 11:40pm I went to) I'd guess that it's definitely going to be a hit. It should be. It has everything someone expecting a movie based on the game should have. You have the house (albeit briefly), the dogs, Umbrella Corporation, the licker thing, the T-Virus and, oh yeah, the zombies. Add on some very nice gratuitous shots of Milla Jovovich completely naked and you've got the whole package.What doesn't this film have? Let's see... a well written story, well done CGI, tension, scares and, oh yeah, GORE. Yes there's some blood in it but the camera is always cutting away when a scene that would require gore comes up. Maybe they cut all of the gore to get an R rating as I've read but there's so little that I think it would practically be PG if not for Milla's nudity and the work f**k used 1 or 2 times. How they could have turned down George Romero's script and fired him as director and then thought that Paul Anderson was making a better movie I have no idea.So what we have here is an extremely mainstream version of what Hollywood thinks a horror movie should be. Horror fans will probably be very unimpressed with it. If you've nothing to do and need to kill 90 minutes then there are worse things you could occupy your time with but certainly don't go out of your way to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether you've played the game or not, this movie is it! There's nothing like it! The game was a classic for me. If you are a fan of the game, you might be a little disappointed with the slight twist in the plot and different characters but believe you me, it doesn't take too long to get hooked on to these characters. And the blond chick, i don't even know her name. She was like whoa! She rocks!This movie is the best guys. I loved every moment of it! Amazing special effects! Also, just so the fans of the game know, its a mixture of Resident Evil 1 and 2. They give you a kind of prelogue to Resident Evil 3: Nemesis in the end which means that Nemesis is coming. No mention of Code Veronica yet! But my God! Spine chilling, interesting, x-filey like! Full of conspiracies and the hot chick! A MUST see for all fans! VERY entertaining for those who will get introduced to the idea for the first time!</fullReview>

The Film Which takes place 6 months before the 1st games, has a lot of scares, and shocks, and because it's not based on a game you don't know the out-Come. Also there are a lot of little things that will make the fans of the Games Laugh. The film starts out with the T-Virus leeking out into an underground building called the Hive, and killing all of the people in side.

Also, just so the fans of the game know, its a mixture of Resident Evil 1 and 2. They give you a kind of prelogue to Resident Evil 3: Nemesis in the end which means that Nemesis is coming.

The Film Which takes place 6 months before the 1st games, has a lot of scares, and shocks, and because it's not based on a game you don't know the out-Come. Also there are a lot of little things that will make the fans of the Games Laugh. The film starts out with the T-Virus leeking out into an underground building called the Hive, and killing all of the people in side. Then a group of Combat fighters invade the nest and try to found any survivors (good Luck).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how can such a fast-paced movie be so boring?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>maybe I shouldn't rip into this film so much, as I did see it at a free sneak preview. and I'm not really a gamer, only playing the "resident evil" games a bit, and mostly watching the game being played and picking it up at various points throughout. but I'm a huge fan of zombie/splatter/gore/horror films, and so therefore I can honestly say that if you're debating about seeing this film, my advice would be to skip it (or see it at a matinee, definitely not worth $8) and wait to rent it on video.the strongest aspects of the best zombie films- "evil dead", "dead alive', "cemetery man"- as that they are irreverant and refuse to take themselves seriously. but paul anderson in "resident evil" takes himself much too seriously, which eventually ruins any promise the film might have had. I'm just wondering why I was bored throughout the flick. during the mansion scenes, the introductory office scenes, making the way to the Red Queen- sure there was the occasional scare and fright, but it wasn't until they shut the computer off that I thought "is it finally going to get interesting?"perhaps I was just waiting and was expectant too much for the zombies. and they didn't disappoint. in fact, the special &amp; visual fx of "resident evil" were quite good and was definitely a highlight to the film. as was the use of audio in providing the suspense and building tension. (although the score created by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Mansion is garbage and unnecessary.) however, the acting was just putird. milla jovovich just CAN'T act. she's best when she just sits there and looks pretty w/o opening her mouth- as in 'dazed and confused' and 'fifth element'. sure she's a hottie, and it's quite obvious the paul anderson tried to come up with any reason to show off her body as necessary, but that's jsut sticking to the tired horror film cliche of showing the primary female in various stages of undress. nothing new there. and what's up with the complete obnoxiousness of michelle rodriguez's character. she delivered every one of her lines compeletely flat and her attempts at humor were ridiculousness. it got tothe point where I despised her character, didn't care that she was infected, and in fact felt pretty good when her character was offed. michelle sure has tumbled swiftly from her promising debut in "girlfight". you couldn't have done a more poor job casting for the two primary female roles. they definitely don't measure up to angelina jolie in "tomb raider", which although wasn't that great of a film, it is much better and more fun and doesn't take itself as seriously as "resident evil." the other cast members are incidental for the most part, though it did kind of bug me that the most gruesome deaths were saved for the characters of color. whats up with that?and the plot kind of bugged me- I understand the computer's intent on killing everybody off once the toxin escaped, but the computer was also aware that the dead would eventually become reanimated, yet took no steps to take care of that eventual side effect, such as torching the Hive or something similar. it did have a failsafe programmed in, thus providing the countdown of our heroes having to escape from the Hive, but it was- in my opinion- too much time allowed with the possibility of escape of the toxin too high. and I didn't quite understand the rationale behind the crack team going into the Hive- the reason given was to find out why the Queen went homicidal and to take apart the mainframe, but ti seemed far too dangerous and unnecessary for me. then again, when you work for the shady Umbrella Corporation, I guess you jsut don't ask questions and blindly follow orders. even when they lead to disastorous results, as can be seen at the end of the flick.anyways, its not as if this film is horrible or incredibly bad. I just found it boring. even Romero's epic plodding "dawn of the dead" I found more interesting than this flick- perhaps because it made me think and it stimulated my mind, whereas "resident evil" didn't. regardless, if you like loud/ fast/ zombie/ splatter films with half-naked babes and plenty of blood, then "resident evil" is the film for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got back from seeing Resident Evil. Based on the fact that the theater was sold out for every showing today (including the 11:40pm I went to) I'd guess that it's definitely going to be a hit. It should be. It has everything someone expecting a movie based on the game should have. You have the house (albeit briefly), the dogs, Umbrella Corporation, the licker thing, the T-Virus and, oh yeah, the zombies. Add on some very nice gratuitous shots of Milla Jovovich completely naked and you've got the whole package.What doesn't this film have? Let's see... a well written story, well done CGI, tension, scares and, oh yeah, GORE. Yes there's some blood in it but the camera is always cutting away when a scene that would require gore comes up. Maybe they cut all of the gore to get an R rating as I've read but there's so little that I think it would practically be PG if not for Milla's nudity and the work f**k used 1 or 2 times. How they could have turned down George Romero's script and fired him as director and then thought that Paul Anderson was making a better movie I have no idea.So what we have here is an extremely mainstream version of what Hollywood thinks a horror movie should be. Horror fans will probably be very unimpressed with it. If you've nothing to do and need to kill 90 minutes then there are worse things you could occupy your time with but certainly don't go out of your way to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to admit that I was a bit concerned about the whole super-computer element of the script, but I think that the movie came off rather nicely.The movie does deviate a bit from the games. However, I don't think that fans of the game will be disappointed with what they see. Many of the major "dead" characters are in the movie. I generally like the set of (living) characters. However, Michelle Rodriquez is _very_ one-dimensional as the pouty I-got-beat-up-by-my-older-brothers-a-lot-and-if-you-mess-with-me-I'll-teach- you-the-meaning-of-the-word-pain soldier. I liked Milla's character a lot, and I think Milla does a great job.The movie is usually very claustrophobic which I think is one reason I really liked it. Anderson makes great use of cluttered closed-in spaces. I don't think the movie is particularly scary, but with how tight the sets are, I think it adds to the anxiety of the situation. There's very few options when something comes down on your head.The biggest flaw I have with the movie is the music. It sucks. I like loud music as much as the next person, but I think it is just too loud and takes away from the movie. It turns into a stupid MTV video. I think the music could have added a lot to the creepiness of the film... very minimalistic stuff... but as soon as any action happens, it turns into a stinking SlipKnot album. I don't know what the best option would have been, but I think the music could have been done better.Anyway, on the whole, a very good effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traditionally, this time of year is devoted to films that are either bucking for Oscar consideration or too dreary to be released at any other time of the year, basically meaning that any movie one sees before the couple of weeks before Memorial Day is going to be really good or really bad. It seems that, this year, those movies that aren't Academy-Award hopefuls have been, across the board, gawd awful, representing some of the worst films that Hollywood has had to offer in the past 5 years. With those unpleasant experiences in mind, it is with a sense of sheer trepidation and lowered expectations that one goes into a movie like _Resident Evil_, whose trailers make it seem akin to most of the wretched movies that have come out so far this year. Perhaps, it is because nothing exceptional is expected of it that I begrudgingly have to admit that this movie is really not that bad. In fact, I could go so far as to say it was quite watchable. admittedly, there are plot holes, Michelle Rodriguez seems wasted in her role, and the material owes a great debt to George Romero's work, but once one gets past all that, a big dumb popcorn movie is there for the taking. In its favor, the actors give convincing performances, the cgi effects are used sparingly enough so that when one does get large doses of it, they don't look obviously fake like in the Harry Potter movie or _Jumanji_, and the movie overall displays an understanding that while it doesn't have the chops to actually scare you, it also doesn't over-rely on startling moments like so many horror movies will nowadays. Is it worth the full price of admission? Compared to some of the alternatives playing in theaters, I'm afraid so.As a sidenote, who among us knew that, at this point in our lives, with Paul T. Anderson slaving away on an Adam Sandler movie, the other Paul Anderson would make a more satisfying movie without any pretenses?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil is by far the very best adaptation of a video game ever. Everything that was featured in the game is on screen, the story is there and very true to the game. You will find the much loved zombies, the possessed dogs, and the very nasty monster. Milla Jovovich does a great job and shows once again that she is a very strong and physical actress. Paul Anderson directs with pleasure and confidence and it shows in every scene. Yes it does get pretty ugly sometimes but wasn't the game ?. A Lot of people surely won't like it. Even though The film is mainly targeted towards the young audience that has been playing with the game for the past 5 years, it does enter the great horror movie category with a big R. If you like scary movies, great action, and especially are a fan of the game, goo see it, you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Friends, Gamers, Fellow movie goers, your friendly neighborhood SmackmYackm had the opportunity to see a special sneak preview of the new Resident Evil movie. Needless to say, I jumped at the opportunity, since it was free.Let me first start by saying that I walked into the theater tonight completely biased and almost hoping for the movie to be a complete and total turd that didn't even deserve to be placed in the porcelain throne. I was totally certain that this movie was going to stink so bad that the stench would rise above the audience like a foul flatulent cloud and drive everyone out of the theater demanding their money back for a movie they didn't even pay for in the first place. Well friends, I was happily disappointed.From start to finish the movie just oozes everything that made me fall in love with the games. From the eerie atmosphere to the jumpy feeling to the hundreds of zombies this movie was from start to finish, Resident Evil. Those familiar with the game will start to see the resemblances right away and continue to see them all throughout the movie. The train, the mansion, the ending that screams sequel and most importantly the walking dead, its all there with the exception of the poor voice acting and the frustrating control scheme. Surprisingly, it doesn't rewrite the story, but expands it. Very easily just another chapter in the story, it could be tied together with the other chapters like a finely knit sweater. Even if you didn't like the game, but found the story compelling, you will like this movie.As a movie it plays very well. It has action, suspense, a little drama and a whole lot of `what happens next'. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time wondering what was lurking around the next corner. The acting was very good considering the fairly unknown actors and the few, which in my opinion just aren't very good in the first place. All in all it is an action movie but does not feel like one. A few scenes suspend belief, but after all it is basically science fiction. No overdone fight scenes or Matrixesque `wire fu' but a whole lot of run for your life. All these pieces come together to make a very well done movie. I also found out that this isn't a `Hollywood' movie so that may have something to do with the reason it didn't suck, but I would like to think that movie producers are finally starting to notice that the movie goers are not all as stupid as they think we are.The bottom line, Resident Evil is a thrill ride good for both movie fans and gamers alike. I myself couldn't have been more pleased and I think you will feel the same. Whether you're a fan of the series or a gamer that would like to see a gamer movie made well or just a fan of the cinema, you should try this one out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly one of the best of the genre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know much about Resident Evil except that it was based on a Computer shoot-em-up and made into a zombie-splatter-flick. So when the title came up on the screen at the Sneak Preview, I was prepared for a bit of action filled onscreen-slaughter in which the brain can be safely turned off. The film eventually exceeded my expectations and managed to impress me on many a level and proved to be at the top of it's genre ? and immensely entertaining to watch.Now don't get me wrong ? "Resident Evil" still wants to be a splatter movie and provides everything that is expected: The group of "good guys" getting smaller and smaller, torn apart Zombies and other nasty creatures, blood and gore, shock effects that will have a good part of the audience jumping (and some screaming) in their seats, the girl (in this case the main heroine)not dressed in much, bullets flying left, right and centre.But this film has much more to offer than that:The directing by Paul Anderson is quite impressive. The choreography of the plenty of action scenes not only lets you keep a sense of what's going on (as opposed to the "let's-just-use-a-shaking-hand-held-camera-and-give-the-audience-a-headache" kind of film) but is also nice to watch. (Sometimes also when you don't see the critical second on-screen. But don't worry, you will still see plenty!) Sets and effects create the creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere, with the undead dogs being my favourite bad creatures ? they do the best job in looking disgusting yet dangerous.The Story, by Anderson too, is also a major point that raises this flick above the average standard of the genre. Sure, the whole design of the "hive", the super-computer, the virus etc. lack any real-life logic, but this is hardly what you came looking for in a film about zombie-bashing in the first place. So once you're in the right frame of mind to accept that, the story in itself is quite complex for it's genre. There are a couple of sub-plots, flashback scenes, deadlines and plot twists, so to successfully add suspense and surprise moments to all the shock and fright scenes. The film avoids using all typical cliché-scenes, never getting totally predictable and boring. A couple characters also have there individual background and escape the trap of becoming two-dimensional monster food. You even begin to care about them, especially the Soldier played by Michelle Rodriguez. The actors are convincing and do a very decent job. Note that even for smaller roles, "Resident Evil" casted "real" actors instead of "zombie food extras". (i.e. Dr. Lisa is played by Heike Makatsch, a quite well known actress in the German-speaking regions).The pace of the film is a very fast one, which is not a bad thing normally, as it doesn't get boring, but ? and here we go with the first point I criticize ? now and then, you get the feeling that longer parts have been cut out and are now missing. The story then jumps ahead and leaves the audience with a "there-at-this-point-all-of-sudden?-that-was-fast!" feeling. I wonder if there'll be a directors cut on DVD. The music in the first part of the film is a bit too loud and disturbing. Nothing is really going on yet, but we already have the sound that would be worthy for a showdown scene. It gets better after a while (maybe because the action starts fitting the music). With all the positive points though, the later ones can easily be overlooked.All in all, if you like the Zombie-slaying kind of horror film, go see "Resident Evil" ? it's a prime quality example of this genre and you won't be disappointed.P.S. I'd really like to see the original crew come back for a sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At Last.An Unironical Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too long we fans of horror have been suffering the slings and arrows of post-`Scream' crappy, irony-laden, pseudo horror fare. `Resident Evil' is a straight up, no nonsense sci-fi/horror actioner that delivers the goods without tongue firmly (or loosely) in cheek. The film starts briskly, setting up the plot and situation. From the moment the toxin is loosed on the interior of the Umbrella Corp HQ, the flick kicks into a steadily building overdrive, tension mounting all the way.The cast, headlined by Milla Jovovich, is uniformly good, though most of the roles themselves are pretty much generically familiar constructs (tough, gravel voiced CO, hard-as-nails tough chick with chip on shoulder, slightly skittish techno guy; you get the gist). This, however, is not a criticism. In this kind of down-in-the-trenches-type film it works. Though I'm a big George Romero fan, I'm kind of glad the directorial torch ended up being passed to Paul Anderson. Anderson, whose previous films `Soldier', `Event Horizon' (another fine, straight-faced, sci-fi/horror motion picture), and of course, `Mortal Combat', is a deft hand at pacing, building atmos' and showy, edge-of-your-seat cinematic pyrotechnics, and has done a commendable job translating the Capcom computer game to the big screen. Much as I love Romero's work, I think he would have made a more bogged down film. Anderson's is lean, hungry and relentless, but gives ample and obvious props to Romero, which I think is quite suitable. (Note the newspaper at the film's conclusion that boasts the identical headline as the one shown in the opening of Romero's `Day of the Dead'.)Writing as someone who's played the game (why doesn't that sound as impressive as, `.as someone who's read the book?), I appreciated the film's fealty to its source material; spooky game, spooky movie. Really good ending, too.Technically, the effects are all top-drawer, as is the set design and cinematography. My only beef is that at times the thrashing soundtrack (which I otherwise enjoyed and found entirely suited to the material) overwhelmed the dialogue track. But maybe that was just a fault of the sound system in the screening room in which I saw it.All around, `Resident Evil' deserves high marks, and if you've played the game you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie-Bashing at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see Resident Evil in a Sneak Preview in Vienna, Austria. As usual for the horror genre the movie is rather short (around 90mins) but not a second of it is boring.The movie starts off with a virus being released in an underground research center called "the Hive". The A.I. closes all exits and kills everyone inside to keep the virus contained. When our main character (Milla Jovovich) awakes in the shower, she has no memory of who she is. A group of soldiers takes her along to the Hive that is located under the building she woke up. They don't tell her much, only that she was supposed to protect the entrance. Everyone who knows the computer game knows what follows: tons of zombies.The story evolves rather nicely since we never really know more than the main character. The suspense added by this to the known genre plot of "get out before they kill you" is a nice little extra. There is nothing to complain about the special effects and the action is well executed though obviously inspired by the Matrix in some places. The music is effective, loud and fits the movie.I really enjoyed it and I think that fans of movies like "Pitch Black" or "The Relic" will enjoy it too. Splatter-fans might be somewhat disappointed, the gore factor isn't higher than in any of the movies mentioned above. Fans of the video games will notice nice little tidbits taken from the games and even if I played only part of one of them, I liked the attention to the details (for example the sound that the zombies make, the equipment used, the enemies encountered and most importantly: the end). I can only recommend this movie to fans of the genre and to everyone who played one of the games.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil - Father of the "zombie virus" idea? Even if not, excellent zombie film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a devout Horror fan, I suggest that Zombie flicks are sort of a different genre. It could be considered a sub-genre of Horror, much like Ghost Stories and "Torture Porn", but it's more unique in it's differences, I reckon. I've seen my share of Zombie flicks. Most of them, like world famous Dawn of the Dead, take place in a zombie infected reality, where few survivors try to live through the aftermath of an apocalypse. Resident Evil predates most of the films of the passed decade, and the best thing - it shows the factors that lead to the zombie apocalypse. I must confess that I have no prior experience with the title, not the Comic books nor the animated films. But I very much enjoyed this film!The screenplay and story feel unoriginal, but if anyone knows of the first film that has come up with the idea of a major corporation developing a virus that turns people into zombies, then gets released somehow and infects the world - let me know, because I don't. White Zombie was released in 1932, but involved Voodoo rather than a virus. Resident Evil probably ins't the first, but it was there before many others. The story is great, with good plot twists and delightfully surprising turn of events.This film might not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it's a great and fun to watch zombies film. The acting is good (Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez of course, but I also liked James Purefoy as Spencer). Direction and cinematography are also good, done just right for such a film. I've watched this intending to continue and watch all the anthology, all the way to the latest 2012 film, including the animated films. It seems I'm in for quite a ride!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a film that is thought provoking and will make you ask yourself some of the deepest questions in life, you've come to the wrong place. If you want to throw reality out the window for an hour and a half and enjoy a film with zombies, blood, side-boob shots, and great mindless action, this is the one. While this movies does have its flaws(bad acting being the biggest), its not like it's trying to win an Oscar. I will always defend movies like this because they often get panned by people who just don't understand what it's about. This movie is just plain fun and has tons of re-watch value. Of all the video game adaptations, this is among the better ones.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil The horror Comes to the big screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hard to believe this movie came out ten years ago.This is the first of the live action Resident Evil movies based off the video game of the same name.For the record the reason the movies are not based off the games fully is because Capcom requested the filmmakers not too because they were worry that the fans wouldn't buy the games but watch the movies.Being since games and movies cost just about the same amount of money to make them so I can understand Capcom's point of view.However now that we got that out of the way lets get started on this movie.The Story kind of feels like Resident Evil the game where a Mansion is the base of operation for the HIVE Umbrella's hidden lab where the T-Virus escape killing all the workers in the HIVE.Our main Character Alice played by Milla Jovovich who suffers from a effect that causes her to lose her memories.So when Alice meets Matt Addison played by Eric Mabius they are soon taking by a Special Forces team with Rain played by Michelle Rodriguez they are send in to find out what happen in the HIVE only for it to become a mission for survival against countless waves of Zombies and Monsters.Paul Anderson played the game before making the movie so at least he gave the game a try before making the movie and from what he said in interviews he fell in love with the games so he wanted to make a movie out of it.And to tell you the truth the movie really give me chills watching it because of the fact that the zombies and zombie dogs and Lickers the main villain in the movie looking so real that it really makes your heart race.So if you're a fan of horror movies or a fan of the Resident Evil Series I would recommend checking out this movie.Beware the movie is very graphic for some scenes so you got to have a strong stomach for it Nonetheless a good movie for fans and I recommend checking out I give Resident Evil a 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A special military unit fights a powerful, out-of-control supercomputer and hundreds of scientists who have mutated into flesh-eating creatures after a laboratory accident.Before the review gets started, let me start by saying I haven't played any Resident Evil games but the 5th. The others do nothing to intrigue me, but I am a fan of zombie films, so this was a must-see in my book... The film actually has a story. Yeah, every film has a story, but this has much more depth than that. The world is ruled by a corporation called Umbrella, and to add to that, the film has tons of underlying messages and outlooks. But sadly, film's have to rely on execution, so I didn't have the highest of expectations, especially looking at the score. Safe to say, the film does things right. The opening sequence was brilliantly done, and interestingly one of my favorite opening scenes in any movie. The film does tend to get a little confusing, and a bit too much sometimes. Sometimes they almost forgot they were showing the world ruled by a greedy corporation, but this was only some scenes. I admit some scenes were super awesome, and I was on the edge of my seat. Examples: the entire 'laser scene' and the last scene. But sadly, some scenes all relied on pure action. Examples: the scene where Alice shoots up the zombie dogs, and ironically they had to place a hard rock song in there too. There were only flaws here and there, and thankfully didn't send the film downward to pure nothingness. In fact, I recommend it. If your a hardcore zombie fan, and enjoy a story as well, this could be your cup of tea. The film sometimes relies on hot chicks and rock music, but the rest is nothing you'd expect. If your expecting a horror film, your out of luck. The film relies on pure action survival, and it's a good one at that, but only for a select few. PS, if your looking for more films like this one, I highly recommend Zombieland. While Zombieland is a comedy, and your expecting that, than your going to love how it combines our today's raunchy comedy and zombie films. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never played the Resident Evil video games, and i doubt i ever will, yet i watched Resident Evil and was hooked! Bearing in mind that i have never played the games i found the start very confusing. However i soon found it was really easy to get the idea of the plot and became gripped. The film is very intense and builds up suspense perfectly, even when they first entered the Hive i expected a horde of zombies to attack them, it was great.The great acting helps to make the film have more meaning, especially Milla Jovovich (Alice) who turns into a bad-ass heroine. However i believe the film keeps some aspects of the game, which may hinder the film to people who don't play the game.I would definitely recommend watching Resident Evil as it may surprise you and get you into watching the sequels!</fullReview>

I didn't realize this until after i watched the movie like 10 times, but the under story to the film is actually Alice In Wonderland. Milla (Alice) is trying to escape wonder land (The Hive) with the help of the rabbit (a white rabbit is seen being experimented on in a lab) and well the red queen actually is a computer instead of an actual red queen as in the story. its a clever idea actually haa...

		<fullReview>Resident Evil is an action-packed horror fest. Some people love it for it and some hate it. I'm on the 'love-it' side, but there is no in between. You love it or you hate it. Most of the criticism about the RE film is that it doesn't stick true to the games. This is true, but to be honest, it doesn't effect my opinion on the matter. I love it, but a lot of people hate it. This is why I like it.'Resident Evil' never struck me as a video game that could be made into a movie, but it did seem nicely done. Besides the bad acting throughout most of the movie, it was a pretty good movie. There was a lot of repetitive music but it was good because it totally fit the scenario and was pump-up music that was light then progresses to heavier and more intense. It was a bit slow at first but it gradually got faster, eventually I couldn't even notice the time passing by. The creatures were unique. There were interesting zombie-dogs and a massive four-legged creature in which I can't compare with anything running all over the place, it was quite freaky. The zombies were just typical zombies, no different than any other zombie movie you would see. 'Resident Evil' was entertaining and worth the 90 minutes you are spending,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem where the film is better than the games!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After playing the first game, and not really liking it, when I heard that Resident Evil was going to be made into a film, I had very high doubts. Usually an adaption decreases the quality of the original. However, after recording this film off the television and watching it with my Mum the night after, I found myself pleasantly satisfied. This is one of the only adaptions that are actually better than the original.What we get from British film makers Paul W.S. Anderson is a Zombie movie with a difference. Zombie movies tend to be relatively similar and very difficult to take seriously. In fact, I usually end up laughing my guts out whilst watching Zombie movies because of how B-Rate most of them seem! The clever thing about Resident Evil was that I ended up laughing (a quality to look for in all films), but not at the Zombies. I laughed at well structured dialogue, some potentially outrageous action sequences and quite lovable, though well developed characters. The Zombies were actually very realistic and quite scary too! I'm 17 and even I got scared whilst watching this.The plot, although slightly different from the game, was well written, flowing nicely from one event into the next, helping the audience to understand what is happening, yet keeping wonder and suspense as to why things are happening. As a writer myself, even I'll admit this is very hard to obtain, especially with action films when you want to keep your audience stuffing themselves with popcorn, but Anderson has done this very well. Characters kept on being introduced throughout the film, which kept it interesting. Better still, this film doesn't ramble on with pointless sequences! As far as the average duration of modern-day films go, this is relatively short, keeping on the 100 minute mark.The acting was extraordinary, with some very well delivered lines. It is so easy with a film like this just to choose an actor or actress for their looks, rather than talent. I've seen plenty of films where an actress has been cast just because she's pretty, but is such a bad actress that it would make being nominated for a Razzie unfair, as nobody else can get so potentially bad to win! With Resident Evil, however, not only were the female cast mind blowing pretty, but they were also very good actresses! As were the men, but I'm not going to make such a fuss over whether or not they're hansom because that would be weird, but they were very good and believable actors all the same.The heroin (the main character, not the drug) was very well played by a brilliantly cast and beautiful Milla Jovovich, who received some very imaginative and exciting action sequences, and executed them extremely well. Perhaps some of the stunts were slightly unrealistic, but a very good plot helped make them more believable, and anyway, in the world of Science Fiction, the more unrealistic the better sometimes! I've only played the first game, but I've seen the first two films, and this a real gem and masterpiece by Paul Anderson, with a great cast. I am very much looking forward to seeing the third and fourth instalments. Truly deserving of an Oscar or four.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil is a well written , well acted and well directed horror film which holds the viewer's attention from start to finish . However it is too short in my opinion and lacks a few minor details which prevent it from being a classic .The film is quick to start and carries the pace well throughout . A brief account of how the virus is spread and the fate of those affected is given at the start . As the plot thickens and tension is mounted we begin to realise that the "Umbrella Corp." know no limits and are prepared to risk anything for success in their dangerous and highly illegal experiments . The only question is; are the team sent down to fix things going to make matters better or worse ? Resident Evil is no masterpiece, but is most definitely worth a watch !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul's second best video game adaptation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul W.S. Anderson came into my radar in 1995 with Mortal Kombat becoming a film. A film in which I watched dozens of times throughout the year. I loved Mortal Kombat. Clearly, Paul has a knack for making video games into movies.Resident Evil as a film works on many levels. First, it doesn't specifically adapt one video game from the series. Second, it keeps loyal to the way the video game is shot and how the rules of Resident Evil games work. Third, it keeps the element of surprise and finally, it allows for an update and improvement in an already existent zombie movie genre.Milla Jovovich plays Alice, part of the Umbrella corporation. She's sexy, clever, funny, and bad-ass and kicks butt! Eric Mabius plays Matt, and there's just something about Eric's voice that attracts me to his characters. Michelle Rodriguez plays Rain, who kicks just as much butt as Milla.The special effects and make-up effects allow for some really gross and awesome scenes. You really feel apart of the movie throughout the film, and it gives the same vibe as when you're in the game and you're just waiting for the door to open and find out what's on the other side.It's a great adaptation, but the sequels don't follow the same pattern. I suggest skipping the sequels and playing the games after watching the first film. It's the only one worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just because the zombies are slow, doesn't mean the movie should be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit that I'm a closet fan of the series, but the first installment doesn't do as much for me as the later movies. My main complaint is that the best part of the franchise, Milla Jovovich (Alice), doesn't get going until the last quarter of the movie. Until then, we're subjected to boring build-up and the lamest, slowest zombies since the first Resident Evil game. When Alice finally starts doing her thing, the action picks up, but that doesn't fully wash away the boredom of watching the generic other characters being killed far too slowly. There isn't much cross-over between the movie and the game, besides a few of the locations and the zombies. I don't mind that so much, but I wish Anderson would have added a few more cool moments and set-pieces to Resident Evil, to balance out the boredom. He clearly didn't aim to make the movie scary, so it really needed to be action-packed, to keep the viewer's interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who knew Paul Anderson had it in him? Well, the fact is, while by no means a great director, he can certainly create mood and atmosphere, as witness EVENT HORIZON. This adaptation of a popular video game has mood and atmosphere to spare, as a top-secret lab experiment goes haywire and soldiers are sent in to deal with the aftermath. Everybody's favorite Fifth Element, Milla Jovovich, is the heroine of the piece, and is surrounded by a cast of mostly unknown actors evidently from many different countries based on their potpourri of accents (the film was shot overseas). Probably the best video game-derived movie to date, as befits one the best video games ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil A Decent Movie Based On A Video Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil is a decent movie based on a video game but not the greatest from director Paul W.S. Anderson who for the most part gives fans of the game what they come to except from these type of films. The cast are good in their roles including Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Martin Crews, and Colin Salmon in a brief extended appearance. The action which is pretty much non stop once they reach the Hive involving people mostly shooting at zombies and creatures created by the T-Virus are well executed. The special effects are impressive but at times you can definitely tell it's CG. The zombies and the Licker look terrifying like something out of your worst nightmares. Well done. The dialogue however wasn't the greatest at times, it was a little predictable, and some characters are written out too soon for you to care about whether they survive or not. Depite its flaws though overall Resident Evil is decent with enough action, gruesome deaths, impressive special effects, some suspense, and good performances by the cast who make it worth watching but this movie could've been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was just another day in the Hive- a high tech, underground bioengineering facility- that is, until a deadly virus, know as the T-Virus, is unleashed amongst the workers. A government supercomputer seals the Hive killing everyone left inside. However, it doesn't end there. A group of commandos are sent in to shut down the Hive for good, and at the mouth of the Hive they find Alice, a woman suffering from amnesia after being exposed to nerve gas. It seems becomes clear however, that not all is what it seems in the Hive, and shutting her down soon becomes the least of the teams worries...I am a huge fan of the Resident evil game series. My first exposure was playing Resident Evil 2 on my Nintendo 64 in the dark hours of the night, and jumping out of my skin when a licker crashed through a window, or a zombie that appeared down and out suddenly grabbed at my ankles. I remember playing Resident Evil 3 and being in absolute awe of the Nemesis creature. I remember the dark atmosphere,the ambient soundtrack. I remember the puzzles, some easy, some hard, and some just plain frustrating.The Resident Evil film offers something quite different then we saw in the video games, and many fans were displeased with this. Sure, the T- Virus plays a central role, and a few enemies from the film make appearances ( Those pesky Cerebus, the undead killer canines who often jumped out at random to attack your character and almost always traveled in packs, make quite a memorable appearance), but as a whole this doesn't look, feel, or sound like Resident Evil. And though I love the games, I really liked the slick action and stylish tone of this flick, and despite it's shortcomings, I enjoyed this flick.A soundtrack can make all the difference for a film, or even a video game. Gone are the spooky, eerie, piano ditties that populate the game. To match the high tech tone of the film, shock rocker Marilyn Manson and Marco Beltrami teamed up to create a totally new kind of musical score that adds so much to the film. The film's music is very hardcore, grinding, and violent. It's electronica with teeth, and it's perfect for the film. It gives the film an extra layer that a lot of films, especially action/horror films, lack.The film offers us no game characters, so we see no Jill Valentine, no Leon S. Kennedy, no Albert Wesker. A whole new slew of fresh faces fill this horror show, and this is one area where the film lacks. Many of the characters are disposable, secondary characters that receive no characterization. Even the main players, namely Alice, Rain, and Eric, receive little substance. Milla Jovovich does a good job as a lead action heroine, her merodic acting is forgivable because this girl has so much presence. Milla's charm make a poorly written character shine. Michelle Rodrigues, who I am not terribly fond of, does a great Vasquez impression (from the Aliens film) and it works. She deliver my favorite line of the film, after dispatching a zombie for the first time. Matt Addison is decent as the wide eyed pretty boy. Also, not to be forgotten, is Michaela Dicker, who's voice work for the Red Queen, the homicidal supercomputer of the film, is superb.Paul W.S Anderson does a fairly good job in directing this film. The film looks very vibrant, with bright colors, mainly reds and blues, contrasted with more darker scenes. There are some very cool shots, and some nice visual references to the game.I suppose one thing that bothered me was some of the CGI. Most notably was the licker creature. Slightly different then the lickers found roaming the walls of the RPD in Racoon city, I was quite disappointed in the final result. The licker is one of my favorite Resident Evil creatures, and this film did him no justice. The CGI licker looked terrible, and the animatronics are not much better. Also tied in with my disappointment at how the licker looked, and behaved, was the idea that the licker was the 'boss' creature. When I play Resident Evil, a few shotgun or bow gun rounds take down most lickers I run into, so the idea of the licker as a boss creature is a little silly.Overall, I really liked this live action Resident Evil. What Paul W.S. Anderson and crew did was simply take the structure of the the Resident Evil story and create an entirely different universe. As a fan of the game, I can say that I truly grooved to this new presentation of Resident Evil. A pulse pounding score, slick visuals,some exciting stunts and a quirky sense of humor all give reason to watch this film. Resident Evil's shortcoming's, mainly a lackluster script and a habit of relying on CGI, are forgivable.And that ending... wow.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident evil is one of those movies that are not good and not bad at the same time.It had a bit of the games, Romero flicks and the Bourne movies rolled into one movie.This one is much more believable then the 2nd movie and might make you jump a little bit if it is your first time watching it and the sound is way up.Fans of the games will either like the movie or not like the movie. It may have the fans saying they should have put this zombie in the movie or that character.The zombies looked great with chunks of there faces or bits of there neck missing.This Sci-Fi horror movie is not bad and is one for the fans of the games and people who like a zombie movie. If you see this movie you must see the next 2 movies next.This movie is entertaining and a great popcorn movie that i recommend to those people who want a movie that are looking for a great Sci Fi movie. This a OK movie that has a few characters and monsters thrown in from the games. Go watch this but don't expect this to be better then 28 days later or dawn of the dead.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I feel it will become a classic like Alien</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This is my first review comment so I hope it is OK) Resident Evil is based on the video game (VG) franchise developed by Capcom. My understanding of the VG is that it is about a dark time in the future when a "T virus" developed by a megacorporation for military purposes escapes into the public and begins to re-animate dead people. The movie does not drift far from this plot but has some particularly compelling twists.1) As much as the VG is about a dark megacorporation, the movie captures this ethos quite succinctly. The attitude of the corporations agents and officers mirror what you, I or anyone could turn into if we were to more vigilant in our own workplace. It is a dark future and the movie captures the mentality of those salarymen, even the mercenary soldiers, quite well.2) The acting is very purposeful and there is good chemistry. I believe Milla had a role in this because she has a natural flair for adding a unique and useful dimension to a cast as well as projecting her own self as she did in 5th element. The actors quite clearly have looked at the VG and they all do a good job of capturing the feel of the VG and its mysterious, perplexing surroundings.3) I believe it will become a classic like Alien because the movie has so much to tell about how things could go so horribly wrong in humanity's future. This is not just another zombie flick of supernatural resurrection made by John Romero. The movie adds a new epic dimension spawned out of the dark imaginations of the best imaginations in Tokyo. The movie falls into the same genre as Akira or Ghost in a Shell - a retelling of a dark forbidden future where you get to see what you could become like were you to live your whole life there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahhhh, Milla, Milla, Milla, Milla... Milla.She's certainly easy on the eye... and so is this little zombie movie which has precisely one exceptional thing going for it. Milla (if I haven;'t mentioned it yet). It doesn't get a lot deeper than that however and I haven't played the game so I guess there's a lot of back-story missing etc for me. Hence, the plot was very shallow, forced and I'd seen it all before.Even so, the set values seemed pretty good and the special effects weren't the worst I've seen (except maybe for the 'beast' at the end which sort of suggests they either had no budget to start with or ran it into the ground pretty quickly. Still, it was a bit better than the werewolf in Ginger Snaps so that's something. This isn't the best sci-fi movie you'll see (in fact it's not a sci-fi movie at all really) but it's not the worst zombie movie either. Somewhere in between. A good one for some easily digestible eye-candy that doesn't ask too much of you... if you don't expect too much of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typical movie based on a video game: sparse plot, little to no character development, terrific special effects, lots of blood and gore, and a loud heavy metal soundtrack. Great if the viewer expects nothing more than a video game transferred to film. Disappointing if the viewer expects any use of imagination to expand the video game plot in said transfer. The female leads are physically strong heroines as opposed to whiny, sniveling damsels in distress (definitely a plus). Yet these "strong female heroines" demonstrate very little in the intellectual or common sense departments. Of course, neither do the male leads, so I can't complain too profusely. I enjoy zombie films because zombies do make fun movie monsters in an ugly and disgusting sort of way. Unfortunately, I do not consider them to be very scary or threatening except in large numbers. One on one they are a minor threat (don't get bitten or scratched) and are no match for an average human being who could out-think and out-run them with very little difficulty. The whole point of a movie with zombies as the main obstacle is to be gory, disgusting, cannibalistic, and provide a high body count. This particular film succeeds on all those counts!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RESIDENT EVIL This My Friends Is One Of The Best Of Any Zombie Movie You'll Ever See. Some People Might Call it Scary. Some Might Call It A Horror Flick. But In My Mind It Is Not Scary. It's Not A Horror Flick. And I Don't Give A Damn What Any Critic Says About It. On A Scale Of 1 To 10 It's A 20 For Me.Milla Jovovich And Michelle Rodriguez Hit This One Out Of The Ball Park. If You've Played The Games, Or Even Just One Game, You Know What To Expect. The Point Of The Movie Is That Some Jerkoff lets loose the T-virus; An Experiment, By The Umbrella Corporations, The Worlds Largest Commercal Entity. But Underneath The Nice Medicare Skin Is An Evil Side. They Rake In All Their Profits From Military Technology, Bio Weapon Experimentations, And Viral Experimentations.Milla, Plays Alice, A Tough Woman Who Is Head Of Security At A Top Secret Facility Called The Hive; The Umbrella Corporations Lab Underneath Raccoon City (You Should Know This City From The Games.). This Is Where The Virus Was Let Loose. This Is Why The Red Queen, A Computer AI (You'd Swear It Had A Brain) Attacks Everyone in The Hive. Alice Awakes After Being Knocked Out By A Gas The The Red Queen Let Loose, To Try And Kill Everyone In And Near The Hive (She Had Her Reasons). Now A Team Of Commandos Rush In, Sent By Umbrella, To Investigate The Red Queen's Attack On The Hive.What They Find Is Nothing But What Most People Would Call Horror. But These Are Trained Commandos. They Can Take Care Of A Simple Zombie Right? Wrong. They Come In Packs When They Shut Down The Red Queen And Unlock Every Door In The Hive. Michelle Plays A Commando Who Don't Take Nothing From Nobody. But Sadly She Dies In The End. But That's O.K. Because The Wounderful Milla Survives. And Is Taken By Umbrella Lab Geeks At The End. When She Emerges, She FInds That The Entire City Has Been Attack.By The T-Virus.So Put Simply: I Loved This Movie. That Is Why I Had To Buy It. DVD Deluxe Edition. It Is The Best. And If You Don't Like My Opinion Then What In The Name Of The Force Are You Reading On For!?!?!?! That People Is My Very First Movie Review In My Own Words. Thank. Thank You Very Much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good video game inspired movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a confession: I've never played any of the Resident Evil games. But I have seen the movies and I love them. The story starts with a disgruntled employee of a illegal research facility releasing a chemical virus through the ventilation system. All the employees quickly die. Then we are introduced to a young woman (Milla Jovovich) with amnesia who is somehow connected to the facility. Suddenly a young man bursts into her home, followed by commandos who are there to exterminate the employees who are now flesh-eating zombies. I found the film to be exciting, scary and well made. Jovovich is very good in the role of Alice, who discovers she has fighting skills that come in handy when battling the undead. (I love the scene where she climbs the wall and kicks the zombie dog in the head!) Be sure to pay attention to all the "Alice in Wonderland" references. The audio commentary from the cast and crew on the DVD is entertaining. Jovovich points out all of her nude scenes. She also mentions that the American distributor wanted to change the voice of the little girl (Michaela Dicker) who plays the Red Queen, but the American girl's voice was too sexy for a little girl! All in all, a good Saturday night flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good zombie movie, despite not mentioning the word zombie once. Alice is a great leading lady, despite never being called Alice once. Turn it on, turn your brain off, and enjoy the action!Fans of the game complain that it's not faithful to the story lines of the game, but you have to recognize it for what it is. It is its own movie, not a live-action carbon copy of a video game. If you like the game's story, play the game. The movie doesn't have to follow it exactly to be a success.The CG work is looking pretty dated, but not bad. The zombie practical make-up effects are great. Sets are good and contribute a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. Plenty of good fight scenes, suspense, and gross zombie behavior.The best scene in the movie is the end. It goes out with a bang, leaving you wanting more and wondering if the sequel will satisfy you.One note: don't base your opinion of this movie on what you see on cable. They cut out some of the best scenes, like the zombie dog fight. Maybe animal rights people didn't like seeing a woman run up a wall and boot a bloody dog in the face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardcore fans of the games be warned!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now don't be too taken back by my comments summary. I actually thought Resident Evil was a really good action (yes action, not horror) flick. It has practically nothing to do with the video games except for the Umbrella Corporation who are the creators of the T-virus biotoxin. And of course, Racoon City. The Tvirus is catastrophically leaked in a large hi-tech underground facility beneath Racoon City named The Hive. Super slick, sexy ass kicker Alice (Milla Jovovich) has to team up with Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) and Matt (Eric Mabius) to escape from the complex which is now overrun with flesh eating zombies. Ahaha. No need to describe it any further. Its plainly obvious how the rest goes. Fight scene goes to another fight scene with some shallow dialogue and weak plot, this movie is definitely not brilliant, but is, In my honest opinion, just "good really" The CGi within was remarkably well done, and the Licker monster was really (no DEFINITELY) the ONLY kinda scary thing within this movie. Worth a rental or purchase? Neither, just wait for it to air on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent first rate zombie film! **** out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film. Paul Anderson is a great director. Bold statement I know. A lot of you will disagree with me and I will tell you that you are probably just one of those guys who have seriously jumped on the bandwagon. Because that's basically all that it's amounted to. Paul Anderson has had the opportunity to direct films that have a extremely high expectancy level to them. And this alone is probably the reason he is lambasted so. Because no one can live up to a lot of fan boys expectations.I myself am a fan boy, but I'm an open minded and not such a nit-picky one.Anderson really knows how to construct a movie and tell a story quite well. The scares in this flick are anything but cliché. He knows how to scare us by providing an extremely high level of suspense.The gore is low, and that is my main problem with the film. It's based on a video game that has buckets of it. There is some though. It isn't completely bloodless. But at least there is plenty of suspense and terrific action sequences. In the end that's what really matters.Everything else though works completely. We are introduced to characters we genuinely care about and are sad to see it when they ultimately meet their untimely demise.The special effects are terrific and the music by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson is pulsating, creepy, and very unsettling.It's a superior horror film that I highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Shame.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's disappointing when a successful computer game franchise is brought to the screen in a disappointing fashion and that's exactly what's happened here. When a Resident Evil computer game comes out, it's a bit of an event especially to the die hard fans of the series. I, myself own Resident Evil 2 and have played every single title at some point down the years. This, you would suggest does not classify me as a die hard fan and you're correct but what I am quite a large fan of is survival films such as '28 Days Later', 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Dog Soldiers' so watching 'Resident Evil' was pretty compulsory, fan of the games or not.Everything was set up nicely, the situation was clearly established as it must've been tricky to do a first Resident Evil film, especially after several games; 'where do you start?' springs to mind. However, what follows is a case of 'where do we continue from?' The film seemed to get into a gear and just stay there the whole time. I grew tired of the same location over and over and the way all of the characters look the same. There was no real suspense, no real monsters from the games, no real proper weaponry, in fact the whole thing just dug itself in and stuck itself there for two and a bit hours, a real shame as there was some potential what with the games creating such a success. We aren't treated to many of the games characters either and for most of them, I couldn't really care less if they survived, there is even a temptation to hope that they all snuff it anyway.In fact, the ultimate irony is when they actually get up onto the street surface which is where I wanted the film to take place. This would be fine except: it happens right at the very end of the film! A lot of damn good that is! The REAL survival starts just as all the other rubbish ends. I really can't see the point of this film as from what I understand, with the second film street based, this is just a break in for the absolute non-fans of the game who won't mind not seeing the characters and monsters from the game because they won't even have played it! Where as for the fans, no matter how large or how small they are; they're guaranteed to be disappointed.How ironic- aiming a film based on a successful gaming series at people who AREN'T fans of the games.I didn't enjoy this that much, I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting remake from a classic movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent remake from an all-time horror classic 'Night of the living dead'. The movie very deliberately re-creates the horrified and depressing tensions apparent in its predecessor(the aforementioned film). In spite of that it's actually more science-fiction and action-oriented than horror. Don't remember did the director of original classic participate in making of this or not, but the aspects from tension between good and dark side of human nature are all there (under the action-style mainline). Racial conflicts are not so apparent in this, in fact characters all in all are just there to decorate the story (allthough the action and plot of the movie actually begins from Milla Jovovich appearance).There's naturally a lot similarities to other(later) films than NOTLD. For example the main plot about rescue team resembles Aliens movies (especially the 2nd, but others too...) Computerized cameras and views remind me somehow from Terminator films and of course, because movie is based on a game, there's a bit of tension from game-like storytelling. Haven't played the game though, cannot say how much there's similarity.One more aspect to mention is the 'music'(or sound scape) in film which is mostly from 90's ambient and something like techno-metal effects (it might have inspired from the game actually?). It very cleverly builds excitement in crucial moments.All in all, this must be one of the best (not many are worth mentioning) scifi-horror oriented films from 90's/2000. Also, I suppose it could be one of the few really good(if not only one?) movies based on PC-game. There's a lot needles violence and blood as in this kind films usually do, but not too much to spoil the excitement of the plot...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil - Ugh. When the best thing you can say about a film is it's locations, something is terribly wrong. An underground evil corporation (and that's about ALL that is realistic about RE) named The Unbrella Corporation kills all of it's employees and lets 3 survive along with a Swat team to get mauled by zombies and try and escape. The movie takes an hour (after 2 glorious minutes of actually scary elevator stuff) to do a lot of boring exposition. None of it is terribly well done or intelligently said, as none of the characters are good at acting. And then the zombies show up because of the T-virus, because turning people into mindless killing machines (except they aren't. When off-screen, they ravage an entire city. When on-screen, they can't even walk straight) is SUCH a good strategy. The zombies aren't scary, and you don't care about them, much less the cast. There's Milla Jolovich, who spends half the movie kicking the crap out of zombies, and the other half looking like a stunned cow. There's Michelle Rodriguez, whose most intelligent line is "Blow me" and is not only and ice queen, but also can't act to save her soul (I honestly couldn't tell the difference between her as a normie and her as a zombie). The only good part is the Licker and a laser field that dices up some people we couldn't care less about (But couldn't it have done Paul S. Anderson, the maker of this tripe instead?). So the acting sucks. The writing sucks. (The most intelligent word used is implore, and it's said by a computer voice by a British school-girl, so that doesn't count) The directing sucks. What's to like here? This is NOT the game that a generation of Playstation owners loved and cherished.D-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can you say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fact: When I saw the first trailer for this movie I was so excited I nearly wet my pants. I remember hearing rumors about a Resident Evil movie (directed by George Romero) back in 1998, when Resident Evil 2 came out, and promptly heard nothing else (interesting aside: In that same issue of GamePro magazine they mention something about Bob Dylan's son directing a House of the Dead movie... see how these things turn out).Anyway, I insisted on going to see it even after it got universal "meh" reviews. Well... I was disappointed. It wasn't "Bad" per se, it just wasn't good. The storyline didn't follow the video game, which I guess would have been a little redundant, given that the game played a little like a movie. It's just that the slick feel and high-tech science stuff seemed a little contrary to what I really enjoyed about the video games (tight, oddly-lit rooms, and everything being a mess). Likewise, the movie did not focus on game characters, instead it had Milla Jovovich as some woman with amnesia. Again, meh. There were relatively few zombie scenes in the movie, and the best moments of those scenes were stolen from George Romero (example: guy looks like he's going to commit suicide, then shoots a zombie instead). It was unspectacular, and the ending (which really got my hopes up for a final, super-cool battle sequence) was a serious letdown - I remember one time waiting through an entire porno movie for these two characters to get it on, and it never happened; it was about the same experience (except the porno movie didn't have a sequel where the two characters get it on incessantly, in lots of goofy positions).So that was the first time I saw Resident Evil. After watching it again, however, with some friends who didn't play the games, and as such weren't familiar with their settings or deliberate pace, I appreciated the awesome silliness of this movie: One of my friends pointed out what a daring move it is to kill off half the cast in one scene; we noticed that the zombie dogs looked like normal dogs covered in corned beef. And the Red Queen... good lord. Maybe a computer with the voice of a little British girl saying "You're all going to die down here" could have been scary, but here it's just a precursor to the hilarious techno-camp of Resident Evil Apocalypse.I can't really say anything bad about this movie. It disappointed me at first, yes. But hey, we've got the REmake on GameCube to make all our dreams about cinema-quality RE1 come true. If I want to see a real zombie movie, I always have out Dawn of the Dead, but now if I want to see Milla Jovovich kick a mutant dog Matrix-style, I have somewhere to go. Thank you, Paul W.S. Anderson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first played Resident Evil 2 shortly after I got a Playstation in 1999 on my 9th birthday.And it was one of the best games I have played at that time. I would give it a 9.5 out of 10. Then I played Resident Evil 3 and I had fun with that also 9.4 out of 10. I didn't played Resident Evil Survivor. Resident Evil Director's Cut was just as good. 9.7 out of 10. Then I got a Playstation 2. Then I got Resident Evil Code:Veronica X. 9.8 out of 10. I never played Resident Evil Dead Aim. Then shortly after that I saw the Resident Evil movie. It wasn't the best movie I ever saw, but I still liked it. The only thing I hated about this movie was that they wanted to make boys to see this movie was because a hot looking girl was wearing a red tube top and a mini skirt. That not's what Resident Evil is about. It's about the horror, the action, the monsters, maybe hot looking girls, but not wearing mini skirts when she has no idea what is going on. Millia. Nothing personal you were great in that movie. I especially liked that kick you did. I'll still give this movie a good rating. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a long time fan of the Resident Evil computer games, i have waited a number of years for a film to be made. I was not in the least disappointed by this film. The film is based in an underground facility called "The Hive." The idea of this underground hive never appeared in the games, so that was a great way to go with the film. You don't see any footage from the games in this film. However, i saw lots of parts in "Resident Evil: Apocalypse that were taken from the games. The film was based on the games but completely original at the same time. This film explains to you how the contamination of zombies started, where as most other zombie films don't explain this. In most, the zombies are just there and nobody knows how. Resident Evil was everything i could hope for and more. I would recommend this film to any Resident Evil fan, and highly recommend it to anyone who has never seen anything to do with the films or games. I love the film and rated it as 10, i'm sure you'll do the same. Jenn X</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm no fan of the Resident Evil video games. I have played them but i found them to be quite tedious and slow. Not bad, but nothing that didn't feel like "Alone in the dark" hadn't already done it years ago on the Amiga.The research complex called "The Hive" is buried deep under ground. Now a virus have gotten loose there that has caused the hive to close itself. A special military unit is going in to investigate.I was of course skeptical when i saw who directed this movie. The Antichrist of b-action Paul W.S. Anderson. And here he does it again, the same thing he almost always does. Turns the movie into crap. And there are several reasons for this.First of all Milla Jovovich is completely wrong in the hero part. Going to war in a mini skirt is ridiculous to begin with, and it just becomes even worse from there. The cinematography is surprisingly OK as are most of the special effects. But the action scenes completely lack any kind of tension or pulse. It's just people firing weapons while REALLY loud heavy metal music is playing, but there is no real excitement. This is typical of Paul W.S. Andersons movies though. The lack of any pulse in the action scenes. Seldom have so many fired bullets and so much fighting felt so incredibly slow.So why watch this? Well it's not recommended. I don't know how it compares with the video games as i don't know the games well enough. But i do know that standing on it's own this is an inferior action movie. There are a few tolerable scenes and a couple of moments that lift this a bit above the lowest mark. But in the end you can do something better with your time. I rate this 3/10.</fullReview>

Anderson) marks time between set-pieces, and barely makes an impression. Despite a top-line cast (including Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Colin Salmon and Martin Crewes) and excellent production values, Anderson's movie replicates the computer game's limitless excess, and reduces its characters to the status of zombie fodder, despite a handful of plot twists which set the dwindling survivors against one another as the zombie hordes descend from all sides. The action scenes are chaotic but unmemorable, and some of the gore appears to have been curtailed for censorship reasons. Watchable, competent, forgettable.

I realize that the movie is based on a video game, but the plot is loose at best. the film makers seem to think that the way to make a good movie it to throw in all the movie clichés possible.1. The beautiful heroine, who just happens to have temporary amnesia who ends up wearing a skimpy outfit throughout the movie.2. The heroine being betrayed by someone she trusts.3. Someone HAS to go off on their own, and ends up getting killed.4. The score is so overdone that things that you miss the truly disturbing stuff and focus on the wrong stuff.There were no real shocks in the movie...they were all contrived, cheap scares that last barely as long as you are in the theater. And I'm sorry, when I saw the killer rabbit all I could think of is Montey Python and the Holy Grail "It wasn't just any bunny...It was a vicious man-eating bunny....with big sharp teeth!" Having said that, I gotta say I enjoyed the movie. I gave it a 5 out of 10!</fullReview>

Out heroine wakes up, equally mysteriously, in a shower in a strange house which is attacked by commandos whose mission it is to enter and disable the research facility's computer.The story is told from an interesting point of view and the revelations as to what happened are pretty cool. The action scenes are well done and soundtrack is awesome. So overall this movie is a surprise since it is both based off of a game AND conceived by Paul Anderson.

		<fullReview>Resident Evil just flat out kicks butt!The cast is a group of virtual unknowns... but they all are great actors and actresses, able to fall into their roles with believability....The action is TOP NOTCH - with lots of fighting and zombie action and running around and everything...SPOILERS MAY LIE BELOW - BE WARNED!!!When RED QUEEN, the computer of the Hive, in which Umbrella Corporation creates chemical and medical formulations, realizes that there has been a breech in security and that some of an experimental virus has gotten out, she does what any computer (read: uncaring intelligence) would do - kill any and all beings in the Hive and shut it down, not allowing anything (or anyone) to escape...Some of the deaths are just simple - using Halon or some other type of chemical, the oxygen is removed from rooms and people die.... or the room is flooded and people drown.... or the elevator drops hundreds of feet and crashes to the bottom of the shaft.... or it moves quickly, snapping the head off anybody stupid enough to poke it out the doors...Well, there are some drawbacks to the Red Queen's actions.... Including KILLING all of the people that work and live in the Hive.... And, as the deadly T-Virus is on the loose, which is chemically created to re-animate dead tissue, all of those same workers come back to life - with only the most basic of brain functions going - those that will keep them alive - breathing and eating... what do they eat?!? Living creatures.... Through this movie, we get an expansion on the Resident Evil video game series, giving us more back story into the T-Virus and the creatures that inhabit Raccoon City (far above the Hive). We learn a lot about how the virus escaped into the population - although not a lot about how it goes SO big in Raccoon City.We meet an elite force of security officers of Umbrella Corporation, whose job it is to shut it all down... many die along the way, getting killed by zombies and dogs and brain suckers and the Red Queen's unique security systems... This film is NOT for the feint of heart when it comes to gore - both realized and intimated.....The end of the movie leaves enough unraveled threads to allow for a sequel (see RESIDENT EVIL:APOCALYPSE - released in 2004) for more.... And enough threads are resolved, giving you closure and allowing the movie to stand well enough on its own.... a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True to the games</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Minor Spoilers)As a fan of the Resident Evil games, I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. I know Paul W. S. Anderson is hated by many, mostly because of MORTAL COMBAT and SOLDIER, but I think this is by far his best directing (and writing) work.What I like the most is how the movie stays true to the spirit of the games in spite of moving away from the original plot and characters. The story is sort of a "re-imagination" of the first game with a few things taken from the second (mostly the Liker, the train sequences and the ending), but you can find the key elements that make up the Resident Evil universe: Racoon City, the Umbrella Corporation, the T-virus, the zombies, the dogs... And though none of the original characters appear in the movie, those created specifically for it could fit nicely into the games: Alice is some sort of a mix between Jill Valentine and Claire Redfield, Matt seems inspired by Leon S. Kennedy, Spence seems inspired by Wesker, and Colin Salmon's character is a compendium of all the Umbrella operatives seen through the games. The actors are serviceable, and I think Salmon stands out in spite of his limited screen time. Mila Jovovich is also perfectly cast as Alice, and though she's not a great actress, she makes the part her own. Michelle Rodriguez is also good, if only because she plays the same character in all of her movies. Of course, more character development would have been welcome, but I think there is enough for an action movie. Also, the script cleverly avoids a common mistake in this kind of 'combat team in hostile ground' stories: The most generic and interchangeable characters are killed early on (I wish Salmon had survived longer, though), so you can focus your attention in the rest ? unlike in the recent STARSHIP TROOPERS 2, where there were too many cardboard cut-outs? I mean characters.Another area where RE succeeds is in the balance between horror and action. Just like the games, the movie kicks off in what is (more or less) our everyday world, and quickly turns into a nightmare. The settings reproduce what you are used to find in the games, like the mansion, the laboratory, the train, etc. They all help to create the right atmosphere for the movie. On the plot side, I know the use of amnesia as a narrative device has been done to death, but here it serves the narration well: Just like Alice, we find step by step where we are and what is going on. Some scenes are adequately creepy and well handled, like the moment when the zombies show up for the first time. The action scenes are well edited, so you can tell what's going on (a rarity these days). The pace is also good, except for a few moments when you can tell that some scenes have been cut (particularly at the end of the conversation where Matt reveals his true identity to Alice). I also liked the epilogue. Though a bit overlong, it has the greatest Resident Evil feel in the movie (particularly the final shot).Overall, this is a good horror/action movie, specially for those who liked the games. As always happens, some of them may be disappointed, but I still think we've been far luckier than most Tomb Raider fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, what'd you expect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm baffled at why people have high expectations for movies based on video games. No matter how good the source material is, you can't expect a video game to do good as a movie. I imagine that's where a lot of heat towards this movie is coming from; hordes of Resident Evil game fans who hate the film because it has got very little to do with the games. I agree, it doesn't have a lot to do with the games; there are a few references to various of the video game titles, and there are the zombies, and it does try to build the atmosphere of the games. But it just doesn't work too good in the end. The film is billed as an action/thriller/science fiction/horror film; unfortunately, not too many of those aspects of the film work very good. The action is pretty good, but action sequences are few and far between. The thriller parts are decent enough; I really enjoyed the very last scene. The science fiction portions of the film are not very well thought out or particularly professionally executed; I kind of liked the basic idea of the film, but it just didn't seem to work too well. The horror consists of director Paul W.S. Anderson's personal brand of loud noise, sudden scares/shocks(or attempts at such) and intense rock music. It does have some good scares, and some of the zombie scenes are quite intense. But a big problem with the zombies is the fact that they don't even turn up in the movie for a solid 45 minutes. That's almost half of the film. And there passes many scenes that don't involve any zombies at all. I suppose the film was supposed to be tense during those scenes, as in, the tension of knowing that the zombies are out there, but I was never really afraid of them. The plot is nonsensical and pretty badly put together. The acting is decent, but not at all great. The character development is nearly non-existent. The special effects are great; well, mostly great. There are a few times where the CGI is obvious, and quite a few where it's badly used. Worth noting is the amount of details that are taken from various of the games. Something that annoyed me was the lack of realism in the film; these zombies/walking corpses are supposed to be a few hours old, right? Then how come their teeth are so decayed, half of their faces rotten, and various of their body parts so screwed up? I know it was done for effect, but it was fairly ridiculous. Also, the action and stunts that Milla Jovovich's character pull off is not the least bit realistic, and mainly looks like a direct rip-off of The Matrix. All in all, I suppose it's decent enough. For such a just-above-average-film, I'm surprised at how many times I've managed to sit through it. Maybe that explains my rating. Who knows. I recommend it to fans of the various aforementioned genres. Just watch it with low expectations, and don't try too hard to make sense of the plot. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen true crap, and this isn't it. It's enjoyable, at times, but at other times all the obviously-plastic props and rotten 'action' sequences are just infuriating.The reviews for this movie are all completely off-base as well. I pity people who claim this movie is gold. If you want a good modern zombie flick, go get 28 Days Later. If you're obsessed with the fact that it deviates from the game.. welcome to reality. Find me a solitary game-to-film movie that doesn't.If you just are looking for another alright zombie movie, go for this. It's no thriller, but it's not a complete waste. Hey, you could have rented Zombie Lake right?This film is simply mediocre, no matter how you slice it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil is one of my all time favorite movies, and is definitely worth your time. Don't listen to the haters of this movie, they're just mad because this isn't a carbon copy of their beloved video game. Paul Anderson makes a wise choice here in branching off from the games, because while the Resident Evil series works as a video game, it would suck as a movie. The acting is pretty good as well. Milla Jovovich, Eric Mabius, and Michelle Rodriguez do an excellent job, and the zombies are extremely well choreographed. You will enjoy this movie if you don't expect it to be an Oscar winning masterpiece. Its a fun romp that should be remembered for its amazing action sequences, not its less than profound plot.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As soulless as they come.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to know where to start. Perhaps the writer/director, Paul W.S. Anderson, intends some sort of irony, when he serves up this mindless, soulless corpse of a film. But really, I don't think he's that complex. Drivel of this kind puts even bombs such as 'Tomb Raider' in a good light.The premise involves something along the lines of: "corporation happily conducting research into viruses, when it all goes terribly wrong, and there's some zombies and some screaming and .. er, some zombies." The plot then takes this premise and promptly sits down. I mean it. It goes absolutely nowhere. It's as if the director just wants to string together meaningless, unrelated scenarios from generic computer games. Characters are suddenly alone, without explanation. Between scenes, the lead alternates from scared bystander to superhuman commando. If by this point, you're thinking "The only thing that kept this reviewer watching this film to the end was so that he can moan about it afterwards", you'd be utterly correct.Milla Jovovich provides the gratuitous nudity that the director obviously feels belongs in a film like this. He gets it out of the way at the start of the film, almost as if he's catering for all the viewers who will walk out during the film. It may seem unfair to dismiss Jovovich like this, but it isn't as if she does any acting in this film. To be fair, she has absolutely no material to work with, and the director's idea of character development seems to be the progression from "wearing a jacket" to "not wearing a jacket".Michelle Rodriguez garnered critical acclaim for her work in 'Girlfight', but sleepwalks through her role here. The forgettable male cast repeat tired lines like clockwork; including the immortal "We're not getting out of here. We're all going to die." The great Hollywood idea behind making movies based on computer games seems to be 'Neither acting nor development is important, just do some action scenes, and the unwashed masses will be happy.' Here, even the action scenes disappoint. Kicks and punches are unconvincing, the gunfights mind-numbingly boring.The tension and gore that are supposed to sell a film in this genre are at least attempted. The basic problem with tension is that we feel no empathy for the characters, and don't particularly care if they live or die. The problem with the gore is, like everything else in the film, it is presented in an entirely meaningless way. The film doesn't even set up the basic threat properly; if the zombies are so hungry, why don't they feed on each other? That is the only plothole that I will mention, because if you are ever unfortunate enough to be made to watch this film, perhaps playing 'spot-the-plotholes' might provide you with your entertainment for the evening.Oh, and at the climax, the director unleashes some of the worst 'special' effects I have ever seen in my life. I nearly cried out in horror at how poorly done it was. Oh, perhaps the director is employing his special 'irony' again. Silly me.2.0 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After playing the remake of this game on nintendo gamecube and being totally blown away by its storyline i was beyond dissapointment when i saw the movie. why would anyone base a movie on a video game and not even use characters from the game. it makes no sence to meWARNING: small game spoiler.in the game two S.T.A.R.S teams were sent into racoon city to investigate some bizzare murders. the first team went missing and the game begins with you taking control of one of two members of the other team, chris or jill. from their you enter a big mansion and uncover a very twisted and interesting background to the umbrella corporation and all their doings.now why didnt the movie do this. the story follows quite loosely and the characters are pretty dull and boring. in my opinion if the they had followed the story of the game this could have been one of the best horror movies ever made. if it wasnt based on a video game i think i may have enjoyed it but because i was comparing it to what i expected i was very dissapointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice try, but not as fun as it should have been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** out of ****Resident Evil is sort of an unbalanced mixture of old-school zombie horror and new-school filmmaking and special effects. Everything about the movie has to be a lot faster (except the zombies themselves, somewhat surprisingly), there has to be martial arts complete with even some wire-fu, and it has slimy monsters that are rendered by CGI, not old-fashioned animatronics. As you can see, I was never particularly won over by the film.Resident Evil opens in an underground laboratory called "The Hive, a top-secret facility owned by a company called the Umbrella Corporation, situated underneath Raccoon City. One of the lab workers sabotages the place, shutting the power down and unleashing a deadly virus that kills its victims and brings them back as zombies.We then cut to a cutie naked chick (Milla Jovovich) called Alice, who awakens in a bathtub inside some large mansion; not only is she unclothed, she's also suffering from a mild form of amnesia. Before she can collect her bearings (though she has enough time to put on a dress), an elite military task force barges into the building, taking her and an outsider (Eric Mabius) to the underground facility, directly connected to the mansion. Their mission is to shut down the Red Queen, the computer controlling the lab, but they''ll have to get through flesh-eating zombies and maniacal defense systems to accomplish that.As directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the same man who crafted the far superior and terrifically frightening Event Horizon, Resident Evil is unfortunately lacking in much of that film's thrills and chills. Anderson shows an inconsistent hand at staging and filming action sequences; the movie's numerous shootouts and fight scenes are only mildly exciting at best, hampered too often by close-up shots of big guns and expended shells. Worse yet, all the violence is sanitized; there's hardly any blood or gore in this picture.Actually, what's probably most memorable about the picture as a whole is how maddeningly inconsistent it is in terms of pacing and excitement. For every scene that's fun to watch, there's another that's just plot-stopping, whether it's watching it's watching the survivors move from one bland-looking corridor to another, or Milla Jovovich jump-kicking zombie dogs in slow motion, or a computer program tiresomely going over the very simple zombie rules.There are also some glaring technical faults that I'm surprised were't fixed or edited in post-production, such as an unbearably loud industrial score that blocks out most of the expository dialogue, most of it uttered by Colin Salmon, who if you're familiar with his work, already has a pretty quiet voice that'd be inaudible matched up against anyone else in the cast.The zombies in this movie are your basic "pale and rotting skin" undead, some with the occasional missing bits of face and flesh. Unfortunately, the zombies in this film have goofy-looking mechanical movements, as if though their joints were so stiff, they could barely show much in the way of mobility. Maybe it's the effects of rigor mortis, but this makes zombies far less enjoyable to observe.Most of the cast ranges from non-descript to just plain awful. Easily the worst of the bunch is Michelle Rodriguez, whose only distinct trait is a perpetual frown; she's given a lot of macho dialogue, but Jenette Goldstein she is not. Surprisingly, it's Jovovich who stands out as the film's kickass heorine. Sure, she's not much of an actress, but she's got the physical stuff down pat, for the most part. And she's cute enough that I don't mind seeing her in a slinky red dress, as well as a couple of scenes that briefly reveal some of her naughty bits.Because there's hardly any gore, Resident Evil doesn't really work all that well as a zombie flick. And because it's not scary, horror is out of the question, too. But being a zombie fan, I'm prone to forgiving movies of this ilk simply because I'm pretty easy to please. Resident Evil is a passable enough timewaster, worth a rental, but it's certainly nothing I'll ever give much thought to again.Compared to the recent spate of zombie horror, Resident might very well be the most lackluster of the bunch. It's never as intriguing or intelligent as 28 Days Later or as marvelously thrilling as the Dawn of the Dead remake and it's never as hilariously enjoyable as the misguided House of the Dead, proving that mediocrity really can be less entertaining than plain awfulness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must-See For Milla Fans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe that an actress who's been working for so long is still only 29 years old! She ages with supreme grace, and has *never* looked better than she does in Resident Evil. Wow!The movie itself is fair. Not great, not terrible. Pretty good SFX. It's a techno zombie thriller, and for what it is, it's effective enough. Considering how bad movies based on computer games usually are, this one is pretty good, although it has problems getting started. There are a few scenes that don't make sense (and that cop - Matthew? - where does he really come from?), and it's never really clear that there's only one of the CGI mutating zombie animals loose. The technobabble explanation we get for the zombies is a worthy attempt to "technofy" the zombie genre, but it doesn't quite work, esp. not the part about the "need to feed". All in all the movie brings back memories of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, and I'm sure the sequel will, too.Milla Jovovich gives good face. She doesn't really have anything to do for the first 45 minutes (other than look beautiful, of course), but she's very cool when she starts pouring on the kicks and punches, and her character is likable and heroic (and did I mention good-looking? And that outfit she's wearing...!). One wants to see more of her. With some better writing, this sort of role would be perfect for her. Accessible, kick-ass adventure with an appealing female lead (or several). If movie-makers know what's good for them, this is the kind of thing they should do more of. Much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I quite liked the Resident Evil games. They were scary and highly atmospheric. Not *excellent* games, but still very good. This film, on the other hand, is horrible. I think the main problem is that no-one takes computer games (interactive art, to me) seriously. "Oh, it's just a computer game!" most people think. But computer games have come a long, long way since the times of Pacman and Tetris. Many computer games have deep, compelling storylines, great atmosphere, and can stand shoulder to shoulder with other works of art. Computer games are not all action. That's a very very wrong perception that way too many people share. Resident Evil is not an action game. Therefore, the film based upon it should logically not be an action film. And yet it is. And on top of that, it's an action film with horribly cheap and boring action sequences. The film is bad on so many levels that I can't even describe it. The camerawork is a disaster. Far too many closeups, combined with horrible editing, give us a sense of complete confusion. Not only that, half the time it's impossible to tell what exactly is happening, because the movie doesn't show it. If you're making an action film, that's a really really bad idea. But this movie suffers from even more problems. The writing sucks, and despite the presence of a couple of good actors, the characters are just not interesting. The structure of the plot is terrible - there is barely any increase in tension, people just get butchered the one after the other. The climax is also nothing special at all. What's even worse, the movie does not convey a sense of place or of a logical sequence of events. In one scene the characters are fighting a ton of zombies (which look ridiculous) and in the next they're in an entirely different room, without the movie having told us how they actually got there. The movie is lacking in structure. The music... I shouldn't even mention it. I know that many people today enjoy listening to music which consists of three sounds being looped, but for a horror movie, this is the wrong soundtrack. The sets were actually quite good, but I don't think they were right for this movie. They should've set it in a mansion, and made it gothic. That works so much better for horror movies. And they stole a scene from Cube, which was a much better movie (and not a horror movie). I guess this movie is to the games what Hypercube is to Cube: something that has a plot which somehow slightly resembles the original, but was created by people who didn't understand what the original was about. Terrible. I was willing to give director Paul W.S. Anderson another chance, despite his movie Event Horizon being absolutely abysmal, but after this - forget it. It's not even worth renting on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It does not deliver; plain and simple.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one should have been "The Night of the Living Dead" of the new millenium. Instead, we get a Matrix-like movie with amateurish directing, an incredibly irritating techno soundtrack and a mistalented cast. Ironically, Paul W.S. Anderson was also the director of 1995's "Mortal Kombat" ; perhaps the ONLY good videogame turned movie in cinema history. The success of this film was due to the fact that it gave the videogame fans what they wished, that is action and plenty of it. Unfortunately, Anderson probably forgot that "Resident Evil" is a horror videogame, NOT an action one. We wanted endless scares, suspense, a creepie environment. We deeply wished to see the dark atmosphere present in the game, but we get nothing of this. All we get is a group of soldiers spending nearly all of the movie wandering through labarotory rooms and shooting bullets which seem never-ending.And speaking of the characters, why does Michelle Rodriguez think she can act? I mean she does nothing other than spending the entire movie looking angry and mad at the camera that she becomes incredibly annoying halfway through. And she seems to play the same annoying character in all her movies; just watch "The Fast and the Furious". It was a great pleasure seeing how she ended up at the end, at least we can all hope she will not be in the sequel.It's a real shame that George Romero left the project of directing this movie; I'm sure he would have done a great job. But he had his reasons of not participating; most probably he read the awful script and was discouraged. So why did I give this movie 2 stars? Hmmm, well probably because Milla Jovovich is a real hottie. As a matter of fact, it's thanks to her that I remained to see the movie till the very end. Cause some smart people know that if you're going to make an awful movie, at least bring in the hottie who will make teenagers fall in love and increase the marketing of their product. The same thing can be said to "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider".(2/5 stars.)TRIVIA QUESTION: Try and count the number of microphones that mistakenly pop out at the top of the screen throughout the movie; you'll be surprised. Another vivid proof of a half-hearted attempt to bring a popular videogame franchise to the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie flick with brains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mere idea of watching a zombie film is enough to give me the creeps, not because they are scary, but because every zombie film I've seen was bad and dumb. But lucky for me that I am not prejudiced and decided, in spite of my knowledge that there were zombies in this film, to watch it anyway. The thing that makes this zombie flick a good one, is that there is not too much emphasis on the zombies. They are there, but not all the time, because there are bigger, meaner and more complicated things to worry about which have been ?beautifully' engineered with computers and are quite original.Other things that really made me enjoy this film, were the story, the acting and the directing. The story is a pretty complicated one for a zombie film and there are always a few surprises and enough tension to keep the film thrilling and exciting. The fact that the film continues to do that is mainly due to the good acting and the good directing, which we all know if worse enough can screw up a potentially good film. This does not happen here though. Mr.Anderson and his actors have (according to me) succeeded in bringing the first good zombie film onto my TV screen.8 out of 10P.S. If you like Resident Evil, also try Anderson's EVENT HORIZON or CUBE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a total waste of time, but nothing special either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a video game conversion, "Resident Evil" is quite good. It even stays relatively close to the game for once. Unfortunately, judged as a high-budget movie, it falls short of my expectations, although it's not a total waste either.To it's credit, the movie has some nice-looking special effects and action sequences, and there's even a somewhat successful attempt at creating a storyline with a bit of intrigue (I said "somewhat", so don't expect another "Usual Suspects" or anything).Unfortunately, this movie once again makes the common mistake of not letting us care about the characters. They're all fairly generic, none of them is introduced properly, and they all look the same. On top of this, most of the action sequences are so incredibly frantic and haphazardly edited that it's really impossible to determine what the *** is going on. As a result, I really lost track of what happened to the character and I didn't really care either. I just a little bored. If you like this kind of movie ("group-of-people-gets-trapped-in-facility-and-must-get-out"), I suggest you go watch the much better Aliens movies (especially Aliens), or even "Deep Blue Sea". Those movies have better characterization, more likeable characters, more suspense, and better jokes. *1/2 out of **** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just so you know, if you've played the RE game. This movie is not even close to an adaptation of it. The characters were completely different (no Jill, etc.). Almost no zombies, demon dogs, slugs, etc. The acting was crappy and the soundtrack was even worse. I hate to read comments from kids who say the loved the game and rate this movie as "cool", "a great movie" etc. Kids, if you really love the game at least do some justice to it. The movie had nothing to do with the story. All they did was film a movie whatever the way they wanted it and said to themselves "let's make some money out of these dumb video game lovers and stick the name of RE in it!". I have played the games several times and I still get goosebumps when some creature jumps on my character. The scenes on the mansion really are creepy and the soundtrack really complements the atmosphere in the game. Not To mention in RE Nemesis, I freak out every time he comes out saying "Star!", I just run as fast as I can out of there. This was supposed to be the way that this movie should've made me feel. Instead, it was just some b-rated zombie movie with almost no zombies in it and some "actors" that don't have a clue as to what are they suppose to act in the film. Kids, wake up and come down to Earth when rating movies. Just don't go around saying "it was so cool!" kind of thing. I have no idea why they have to change the story so much when taking comic book characters from the books to the screen. If it isn't broken don't try to fix it. Stick to the story and it will work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like horror movies. GOOD horror movies. But in the name of those who have not played the game i can not recommend this film. I almost fell asleep. The whole thing seems to be a pure money-making try. No real effort in it to make it a real MOVIE. Each and every second of it is stolen from somewhere, which can tell much about the attitude of the makers for the expert. Well, I have seen very good re-makes, so this does not mean anything. This could have been a good piece after all. But there should have been any concept in it, and not only cliches. I guess the audience of this film is the players of the game. Those who are very sensitive of logical errors. Well, I lost counting somewhere around one hundred :) OK. It could have been a good movie even with these errors, if the makers had anything to do with suspense. Not only up and down, up and down, monotonously. Fingers appearing on the screen is NOT a terrifying moment. If they make one of it, they destroy the suspense in the film. And that is what they actually did, throughout the whole film. Should it be just a little bit worse, I would have left the theatre at halftime. Yes, there are some good points as well. But miss Jovovich's beautiful body wrapped in a tiny piece of cloth or some good songs can not save the film. This is a failure.Please forgive me for my poor English. I hope you could still understand what I am to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing remarkable, but there's some cool action and f/x</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never played the "Resident Evil" video game, being that I'm not a fan of video games. So maybe the story and characters will appeal more to the fans of the video game. They didn't appeal to me all that much. But altogether, it's fairly entertaining. There's some really cool action and special f/x. The two lead actresses, Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez, are extremely hot. And the DVD commentary was amusing. Paul Anderson also directed the video game-based "Mortal Kombat." I have played that game, back in the days of Super Nintendo, so I was able to appreciate that film more. If I saw "Resident Evil" in theaters, I wouldn't give it a recommendation, but it's a pretty good rental. My score: 5 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Dare You to Not Like this Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watch this film over and over again, now that I have it on DVD. That's right... it ROCKS! First, I name entertainment according to how I enjoyed it. Dramatic = "Film" - General Entertainment = "Movie" - Artwork = "Piece or Piece of Work" and movies that I just enjoyed for their sheer entertainment value, or kept my huge brain occupied the whole time (that can be any of the above terms) = "Flick" (my most endearing term for movies). Aren't you glad to know that? Well, this was a FLICK!! I mean it had elements from many great films, pieces, movies, and flicks, and put them all into one, lacking just the right amount of perfection to keep me coming back for more.S * P * O * I * L * E * R * SIf but a few...What worked: Action, horror, gore, eerie qualities, direction-direction, acting, and special effects. No one actor/character tried to out play the other. They all kept an even-keel on their desire for stardom and played together nicely. People've said, 'No plot'; to which I say you're commenting on the wrong flick. Maybe I'm retarded but even I found a plot in this flick, and I'm not that bright. Really. 'Bad dialogue'; maybe, but if you're into the game you'd see that that's the whole point and is intentional to give it that 'zombie' flick appeal. 'Poor directing'; no way! Where is there bad direction? I ask. 'Why do these two people that live in this mansion know how to kick butt?' -or- 'Why does Milla's character mysteriously seem to know kung fu?'; that was explained. She's a trained agent, working for Umbrella, living in the mansion to serve as guardian to the Hive's only entrance... uh: The Mansion. She and the other agent know how to fight because of the afore mentioned, 'training'.What didn't work: Well, I guess the character development could have used a bit more 'fleshing'-out (no pun intended... okay it was intended). However, the only character that counts is Alice and she's fleshed-out quite well. I can't think of another thing you need to know about her, right now: Let's see, an agent trained by umbrella to guard the mansion-entrance who gets caught up in the whole stolen virus and subsequent leak who must not only remember her role in it all, but must survive the zombies, dogs, and computer... and you say there's no plot.END OF SPOILERS!!Well, there you have it. A very strong 8/10 just because some movies deserve 9 and 10, maybe, a bit more. But not much. Thank you for reading this; if you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is this movie called Resident Evil???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been playing the game since the first one came out and it is probably my favorite game ever. So I knew that when I saw "Alice?" kick the dog in the preview, I knew the movie wasn't going to be like the game. In the game you walk through a mansion or warehouse or some other creepy scenery and shoot the zombies. You can not kick in the game! And who is Alice and Rain? Why couldn't they use Claire or Jill, um, like in the game. The movie itself was a 5 at best. I guess I'm just p***ed there wasn't any green herbs or puzzles to solve or anything really that scary. But I wouldn't be so mad if the movie wasn't called Resident Evil!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting good entertainment value, or, at least, some good special effects. Too bad, there is very little suspense, the plot is as linear as it can get: they go in, meet some zombies, they come out,no surprises. Okay, it's a "horror" movie, not a "plot" movie, butstill it doesn't grip, one never comes to that point where there is noobvious way out. The spectator seems to be the most endangered specieshere, I believe at least some of them must have died of boredom.  The make-up and effects would be about average for a 1950's horrormovie, we have come to expect much, much better things in this computer graphics age. Finally, we aren't even granted comic relief. If they are going toemulate old horror movies, they should at least make it a parody, likethey did with the recent "Mummy" remakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Popcorn cinema - simple fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere I've read that this movie was "yet another videogame adaptation with even less plot than Tomb Raider"... Actually, that statement is wrong.Yes, it is a videogame adaptation (of a game I never plaid), and it shows. The "Hive"? Linear plot development on a mission basis (Find the queen - kill the queen - fight the zombies - try to escape -.....)? Creatures just oozing that special air of "level end boss"? (The Queen, The fellow right at the end, maybe even the dogs).. Yup - it's a videogame alright.But, surprisingly, it is FUN to watch! The plot may be a bit thin - but unlike the pile of bulldung that Tomb Raider had for a story, this movie actually has a lot more charme and skill worked into its storytelling. Of course, it's still far from a proper thriller/drama, but I'd say it isn't too inferior to "Aliens" on the level of its storytelling. Definitely superior to Blade 2 - another movie with similar elements.On a visual level, this movie is pure joy. Vibrant colours, amazing creature effects, utterly scary Doberman dogs - yup! These visuals rock! And the action, too, is brilliant, although a few more kung-fu-esque kicking sequences would have been needed. The entry hall to the queen's chamber is definitely an impressive piece of action cinema, perhaps even the best of the movie, although it's a close call. The soundtrack underlines the action, and it fits superbly. If you have seen "House on Haunted Hill" it will sound similar, and it definitely enriches the movie.All in all, this is a great summer action movie, looking like a mixture of Night of the Living Dead and Blade 2 - but being better than both at satisfying my tastes. Fun. Fun. Fun.And the ending is very cool, too.....8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Zombie Film Since 1985's Day Of The Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead was the last great zombie film in my opinion and that was released back in 1985. Since then, there have been several mediocre zombie films but this isn't one of them.Firstly, I haven't played the computer game at all so I cannot comment on how it relates to this movie. As a movie, it stands out on it's own.It mixes action and horror very well and the actors and actresses all play a good part. Usually in zombie movies the people battling the zombies have no personality but everyone in this movie does. The military type people make a great impact looking all trigger happy but you soon start to feel sorry for them and care for them as characters. At first you are not sure why some of the characters are there but it's great to see things unravel throughout the movie.This was the first movie in a long time where I kept jumping at certain scenes. I won't spoil those scenes for you but there are some really creepy scenes in this film. The zombies and other creatures in it are probably going to give me and my girlfriend a few sleepless nights because they were so scary.All in all, a pat on the back for those involved in this movie. It was very exciting and I shall probably have to go out now and hire a computer console in order to play the game so I can take part in the action myself.</fullReview>

The music score: Done by Manson so you KNOW it's gonna suck. The director: Horrible, again. Paul Anderson sucks as a director but is even worse when he writes the scripts. There wasn't even a scary moment in the movie. I would have much prefered George A. Romero's version a whole helluva lot better then this one. Bottom line: This should have remained a video game but hollywood screwed it up to no repent. I can just imagine how BAD the next one will be. I can only imagine.</fullReview>

With a simple story he manages to make the best game-to-movie ever, and probably the best zombie film ever. Michelle Rodriguez is cooler then any action-heroine around, with her cool rough style. She also moves cool in the movie, in one scene she reminds me of a cat. Yeah, sure, Milla is also cool as action heroine (harder then in 5th Element) but the star of the movie is Michelle, whitout doubt. The introduction is really cool, and the fact that you just *know* that there are zombis lurking, before the commando team does is also great, you just wait for them to pop out. This movie is better then I expected, but Anderson is a genius. And Michelle rocks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome horror flick that people twenty years from now should still remember.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so "RESIDENT EVIL" wasn't up there in the high ranks with films like "ALIENS" and "DAWN OF THE DEAD", but it still gave me a reasonable amount of scares that I haven't experienced since the late 1980's.Primarily based on the successful video games, "RESIDENT EVIL" is a brooding piece of work that builds up suspense and horror in a claustrophobic-like atmosphere where a group of soldiers and two guards must infiltrate the headquarters known as 'the Hive' of a high-tech operation known as 'the Umbrella Organization' to shut down a mainframe computer that is known as 'the Queen Bee'. Little do they know that all 500 employees working in the Hive are now dead and have been re-animated as zombies while all other creatures inside have mutated into horrifying monsters.It appears that someone broke into the laboratories to steal a heavily-guarded experiment known as "The T-Virus" which has the ability to re-animate the dead. When the virus is stolen, the culprit throws one of the test-tubes containing the virus onto the floor which shatters, resulting the Hive in shutting itself down and trapping everybody inside the underground complex.Milla Jovovich is one of the guards who was supposed to protect the Hive. She is found in an outpost with severe memory loss of her identity and occupation. She along with the group of soldiers and one more guard are taken deep into the Hive. When all Hell breaks loose after the zombies and monsters are unleashed, you will be taken on an unforgettable thrill ride that will leave you riveted to your seat!Most of the praise for this movie lies within the special effects. I enjoyed seeing the zombified dogs and the creatures inside the huge metal containers. The only thing I was a little disappointed with were the zombies themselves. I am very serious when it comes to my zombies, so I was very excited to see the ones featured in this movie. When one man is attacked by a swarm of zombies and is basically eaten alive, I expected to see some good shots of limbs being torn off or flesh being eaten. Instead you only get to see a few of the zombies 'pretending' to bite into him as he screams, and later when he himself has been re-animated as one of the undead, the only signs of his demise are a few bite marks and some trickles of blood running down his face. Other than that, it appears as if the zombies didn't even bite into him at all! A few other scenes also display the same issue - one including a moment where a man is killed after a mutant beast 'eats' him, yet when looking closer at his body in a later part of the film when he too becomes one of the 'undead', he also appears not to have been injured greatly either. One might think that they originally died from fright!One small minor problem I had with the movie was the lack of characters left to 'survive' a sequel. The ending was fantastic - a deserted city scape left in ruin and pandemonium by something horrific, a door left open for a future sequel.I hope they make a sequel. I remember when "STARSHIP TROOPERS" came out and all actors involved had signed on for a trilogy, yet it performed very poorly at the box office meaning no sequels would be made. I don't care if "RESIDENT EVIL" only makes $1.00 in its opening weekend, I want to see a sequel!My Rating - 8 stars out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Living Video Game Translation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film that cannibalizes so many others, it's fitting that this one would feature cannibalistic corpses. As much as I love zombie movies, it's hard to hate "Resident Evil", even though my brain tells me it was pretty bad.The plot is hard to ruin by exposing too much of it (although Roger Ebert did a pretty good job in his review in the Chicago Sun Times). It's pretty basic: accident at secret underground lab, special forces team goes down to investigate. Yes, apparently the facility's high-tech monitoring system does not feature a link to the outside world, which would demonstrate in no uncertain terms that the facility is now overrun with reanimated corpses due to a viral leak. But no matter...if it happened that way there would be no movie, right? (Note in case this ever happens in real life: the virus that turns everyone into a zombie apparently affects everything just through touch or inhalation. The antidote, however, must be injected...and even then it may not work.) For some reason (also explained in vague terms), our heroes must venture to the core of the facility and disarm the Ubercomputer, the "Red Queen". The "Red Queen" talks to them (plot exposition has to go somewhere). She even appears as a hologram while she is explaining things. What she fails to explain is how the SWAT team got into the compound in the first place, if she sealed it off.The zombie action in the film is somewhat subdued. Fans of blood &amp; guts will be disappointed. Although the implication of violence can be a good thing, here it just looks as if it were snipped from the final print of the film, and apparently it was. After all, a film about the living dead should go for the gross-out. Not once do we actually get a glimpse of a zombie biting into one of the characters.Fans of Milla Jovovich, however, will be delighted. Her costume for the film is a revealing dress with a man's jacket thrown over it. That is, when she's not naked. The other actors are pretty good too, although their roles don't call for much.And, as usual, the biggest liability in the movie are the computer-generated effects, such as a creature known as "The Licker". We get what it's supposed to look like, but it looks more like a cartoon. Additionally, the director obscures a lot of the action with quick cuts and choppy editing, most notably in a scene where people get sliced with a killer laser, after which we don't even get to see the bodies. Boooo, hisssss.I guess what I did like about "Resident Evil" is the dreamlike way the story unfolds. It may not be much, but at least it's atmospheric. Milla Jovovich's character (I can't remember one instance in the film where anyone used her name, but according to the IMDB she had three) is suffering from memory loss, and the unfolding of her memories adds a "Memento"-like quality to the film. The director manages to create a very tense environment, although at the expense of much credibility. Much of the film's look and plot are derived from "Aliens" and "Dawn of the Dead", right down to certain lines of dialogue. I suppose these are supposed to be sly references, or else ripoffs. You be the judge.Verdict: "Resident Evil" is passable fun while you're watching it, ultimately forgettable after the credits roll. Unlike "Dawn of the Dead", which lives on in the memories of people as being a lot better than it actually is, "Resident Evil" probably won't live forever in anybody's memory except for those who are really, really into the video game.Oh, and the memories of everyone who wants to see Milla Jovovich naked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most boring horror movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've ever seen a TV commercial for the video game this movie is based on, you've seen the movie. Resident Evil is (or tries to be) an action-thriller in the style of Alien/Aliens, but all the suspense and intelligence that made those movies good was left out of this film. In fact, this movie is so bad that it feels like someone took a good script and intentionally took out the good parts and filmed what was left over. Shocks are telegraphed from miles away. Somebody needs to tell Paul Anderson that zombies haven't been scary since the 60s. The one possibly entertaining monster was dispatched with ridiculous ease in 5 minutes. Even the gore was surprisingly tame - for all the killing going on (and there is plenty), there's very little onscreen blood. The acting, with the possible exception of Michelle Rodriguez' smoldering glares, was awful. The story is barely there, with elements lifted from a dozen much better movies mishmashed together without thought for consistency, clarity, or pacing. The ending sets up the sequel with such insulting transparency that they may as well have named this film Resident Evil I. The only things this film have going for it are not-too-shabby special effects and decent set design, but in a way it's too bad - they're wasted on a movie this awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flaws and all, Resident Evil manages to be a pretty darn entertaining picture. This is one of the first FUN films we've seen all year -- it's heads and above trash like The Time Machine. As one might assume -- the film is full of problems. For an R rated picture that contains ZOMBIES, the film doesn't have nearly enough gore as it should. Speaking of zombies -- the zombies in this picture could use some work -- terrible make-up at times. A good amount of the action scenes are sloppy -- the director just kind of throws the camera into the carnage and the audience is suppose to make sense of it all. The film has a lot of problems like this, but it still manages to deliver on the goods. The film benefits from an amazingly sexy Milla Jovovich. She makes the film work much in the same way Angelia Jolie made Tomb Raider the guilty pleasure it was. The film also stands up pretty well when you compare it to the video games (which I myself am a fan of). Not a very good film, but if you are in the mood for some zombie killing but a sexpot, like I was -- you probably won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anagram of Resident Evil: Dire Sent Live.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A virus has turned the workers at an Umbrella Corporation HQ in to the snarling undead. Enter a crack team of commandos to lay waste wherever possible. But with a super-computer running the show and mistrust and amnesia gripping the surviving humans, it's a mission fraught with peril at every turn. How many good game adaptations to screen can you name? Of course the answer to this will depend on your age, love of the genre-sub-genre, games and how easily pleased you are. That Resident Evil has to date spawned four sequels, suggests that there's a target audience lapping it up. Why? I have no idea, going on this first film it's a wonder all those involved wasn't locked away in some Hive facility of their own to never be let out ever again.Though marginally better than the quite awful Tomb Raider adaptation, Resident Evil lacks atmosphere, shocks and a distinct lack of brain usage for the puzzles in the plot. Add in that it's totally predictable, the characters are dumb and that the creatures are like something Nick Park would make to scare his children, well it's not got much going for it. And that's before we think about dissecting the C grade cast of actors who are as muddled as the plotting is. Then the dialogue, oh dear oh dear, we don't expect Citizen Kane, but come on. Milla Jovovich at least earns her pay as an effective heroine, but under Paul W.S. Anderson's direction she's only really dressed up to please horny teenage boys, with one "money" shot thrown in by way of desperation one feels. 3/10 for Milla's spunky bravado, Colin Salmon's bemusement at being in such trash and the unnerving AI: Red Queen who out acts all of the cast.</fullReview>

They did a good job on those(Props to their prop/make up crew) but used them in a way that just made them look stupid and a shameless rip off from the matrix that doesn't fit into the the original RE story line.Paul Anderson completely butchered the concept of Survival Horror and replaces it with loud death metal and machine guns.

I don't want to sound like it's the only reason I like to re- watch the movie...but she is a very beautiful actress and it made the fantasy of the movie more believable for me. Seeing it now with the sheets on just takes me mentally right out of the fantasy and think only about post-production modesty. Or maybe someone knows of a digital version with her nude scene in it?

		<fullReview>This movie was awful. Paul Anderson took an amazing storyline from an awesome game, and did what ever the heck he wanted with it. In the first Resident Evil game you have an option of choosing Chris or Jill to play with in the beginning, not Alice. The game contains great music and a brilliant storyline. The only downfall of the game is the not so good dialog. I would have much rather had the movie follow the game exactly even if the dialog was mediocre. The movie would have been much much better if they had followed the game. Every person I have talked to about the game loves the game, but when I ask the about the movie they say it sucks. I hate how this movie starts out. She wakes up in the mansion in the movie, in the game, she is running from hell hounds and seeks refuge in the mansion. Alice, then goes out of the mansion into the hive, which is underground. Cool new idea, NOT! Alice starred in the fifth element before this. She gives no element of surprise in this movie. Zonbies are cheesy, no good storyline, a bunch of new retarded characters, and a horrible director. I am sorry to all the Resident Evil fans for the existence of Paul Anderson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boredom, thy name is Resident Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was originally going to give this a 6, but then realised I reserve that for movies that didn't quite work but never gave up trying. Resident Evil isn't really in that category. Strangely, the movie is slick and well-made, and full of wonderful production design. However, this can't hide the fact that it fails entirely to excite the viewer. A damn shame really considering the game franchise it derives its story from is actually more effectively scary than most horror of recent years.Maybe I was making a mistake, expecting what is effectively a big-budget mainstream flick with a major cast to be tense or scary, god knows most of them aren't, but it was the fact that Resident Evil failed totally to make me even worried for anyone until I fell asleep watching it and a large explosion jolted me out of my kip. You're supposed to care about the main characters in a horror movie and they're supposed to be vulnerable to some extent so that you get the impression they could die, therefore making you fear for their safe escape from the situation. This is where Resident Evil falls flat on it's face. Milla Jovovich's Alice is pretty much unstoppable during the movie, as are the other three or four key characters, who either get saved by Milla all the time or are fully capable of making their own way through events, and this removes all tension from proceedings.What compounds this problem is that Resident Evil commits an awful lot of horror movie faux-pas. There are so many scenes that even during the movie don't stand up to scrutiny. So much of this movie should have been killed at the screen writing phase, but they left it all in. For instance you don't have your characters physically fighting the zombies with their bare hands, not only does it look stupid, it doesn't work as a theory. Yeah zombies are pretty slow, and if you can't find a way of stopping one zombie on it's own or avoiding it, you may need to book into a 'special' school, but if you try to kung-fu fight twenty odd zombies with your bare hands, I don't care if you're Bruce Lee, you're gonna die. While for mainstream movie fans who don't watch a lot of horror this could perhaps look cool, to a horror fan, it looks really stupid and is something we don't want to see. Unless it's in something like Braindead which is supposed to be dumb anyway.Also, going back to the lack of tension, main character Alice is NOT an easy girl to relate to. In a horror movie, you must have someone helming the movie that you can relate to, otherwise as stated before, you don't care whether they live or die. Alice can inexplicably fight like Jackie Chan, a fact that seems wildly implausible. Simply put, if the girl in Freddy vs Jason ran up a wall and kicked Jason round the head sending him flying through a window pane, it would have ruined our impression of her as a normal girl determined to stop the madness around her. It does with Alice but director Anderson doesn't seem to care.Anyway, I think I've maybe gone into a bit too much detail, but the bottom line is that the emphasis in this movie is too heavily on action set pieces and being cool, and not enough on the accepted genre trappings of horror. Sometimes this can work, like in Versus, but Anderson doesn't have the balls, gore or naked intensity to pull it off. If you watched this with no prior knowledge of it's apparent genre or the video game it's based on, you'd probably enjoy it a lot more and maybe even give it a 7 or an 8, but for me the removal of the 'one person, 200 zombies and only a gun between them and certain death' vibe of the game, and the constant shocking ignorance of basic flaws in certain scenes makes it a dull, boring piece of style-over-substance mainstream tosh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been So Much More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it could have been so much more, but Hollywood went for the bucks and not the bang in catering this movie to the masses. Face it, "28 Days Later" and the remake of "Dawn of the Dead" were excellently-written and acted movies, but didn't do well at the box office. Producer and director Paul W.S. Anderson went for style over substance in "Resident Evil," having learned his lesson when he did substance first in "Event Horizon," which flopped at the box office.In this movie, based on the popular series of video games that parents wanted slapped with user ratings, a deadly virus is unleashed at a super secret underground corporate facility. The Red Queen, the Artificial Intelligence that controls the facility, called the Hive, as well as monitors the 500 workers living inside, cold-bloodedly, but logically kills everyone and seals off the place to prevent the spread of the virus.The Hive is the brainchild of the Umbrella Corporation, an evil worldwide conglomerate that makes The Company from the "Alien" movies seem tame by comparison. Unfortunately, Anderson makes Umbrella a clichéd, stereotypical villain.We next see the main characters. Milla Jovovich, the butt-kicking universe saver from "The Fifth Element," plays Alice and wakes up half naked (as usual) in a shower. She can't remember anything and we learn that the Red Queen's defenses go outside the hive and into Alice's house which guards the entrance to the Hive. Alice is hit with nerve gas. We also meet Matt, a local police detective, played by Eric Mabius. He might be more than he seems, although this plot point is also wasted.Soon, commandos from Umbrella crash the place. Among them are Rain, played by Michelle Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who won acting accolades in "Girl Fight," has been stuck in two-dimensional roles since then, ranging from the girl with the bad attitude in "Blue Wave" to the cop with a chip on her shoulder in "SWAT." Here, she's pretty much the same and we never really get to care anything about her. The only really interesting character here is One, the commando leader, played by Colin Salmon ("Prime Suspect," "The World Is Not Enough," "Tomorrow Never Dies," "Die Another Day"). But, being in charge and being black in a sci-fi film, it's not a spoiler to say his time is up pretty quick.The group, including a manacled Matt, descends into the Hive and takes a small train to the main facility. Aboard, they find Chad, played by Martin Crewes. He's Alice's "husband" and another Umbrella operative who protects the Hive. He's also suffering memory loss from nerve gas exposure. Unfortunately, whereas Alice slowly regains her memory, he won't remember until a certain plot twist late in the film, which makes it so obvious that the whole subplot is unnecessary.I won't recount the movie scene by scene, but Anderson's direction pretty much kills the suspense. Even the emergence of a creature called The Licker (sounds perverted, doesn't it?) doesn't add any scares or suspense. Hollywood typically adds things like The Licker and shows them so far in advance as to cancel their surprise, instead relying on lots of gore. Obviously, The Licker is CGI-created but its movements are stiff and disjointed making it seem like it was a plot twist thought of at the last second and belatedly laid out over the finished product.And speaking of gore, here's where the film really bogs down. The virus re-animates the dead, but the actors playing the zombies are so stiff you'd think they really had rigor mortis. Also, they supposedly need to feed, but they rarely feed. They bite and draw some blood, but that's about it. It's like those shark specials on Discovery where they say sharks bite divers then back off when they realize they're not seals. The zombies bite a little, then either back off or get punched out. They're not scary at all and the big gun battles with them are rather lackluster.Pretty soon, the whole film degenerates into the standard action/horror film cliché. A few people trapped in a remote location, trying to escape while being picked off one by one. And if the one doing the picking off was anything but The Licker, it might have been okay. But, it is The Licker and it ends up being The Lacker.The movie does have some fine points, though. The scene near the beginning with the woman in the flooded lab and the one with some of the security commandos stuck in the Red Queen's chamber with its lethal laser beam are tense. Also, don't miss the scene when the heroine faces off against some obviously p*ssed off hell hounds that used to be Doberman pinschers. Oh and the ending is a trip. You can see it coming a mile away and you can tell it's a setup for a sequel, but it's jarring nonetheless.Also, British child actress Michaela Dicker is marvelous as the Red Queen. She outdoes everyone else except for Colin Salmon.Overall, the movie wasn't as bad as most of the reviewers make it out to be. However, even those unfamiliar with the video game, will see that there could have been so much more to the movie and that, ultimately, is what makes it a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Final Score: 5.5 (out of 10)The Playstation game 'Resident Evil, was so atmostpheric, cinematic and downright scary that it begged to be made into a movie. Video game movies have a rap for being bad and it's true. Most of them are. Of course, most of them are written and directed by unimaginative hacks and constructed in studio boardrooms to shake some cash out of the kids who play the games. In the event some talent comes onto the project - like Simon West for my favorite VG movie to date 'Tomb Raider' - we get a pretty decent popcorn flick. The problem is this Paul "W.S." Anderson guy (not to be confused with the brilliant Paul Thomas Anderson) seems to have cornered the market on making video games into movies - bad movies. The guy is a hack who couldn't direct his way out of a paper bag. He's given a promising set-up from the games and before it's all over Anderson will reduce our crisp atmospheric story into a cheap trainwreck of quick editing and flashing lights - just as he did with 'Event Horizon'. On one level I understand Anderson's thinking. The games were based on George Romano's 'Night of the Living Dead' so a 'Resident Evil' movie is essentially a remake of NotLD. So he apparently decided the "better" way to go would be to dump the horror and turn this movie a glossy, techno action flick. At first it seems alright. The movie is the 2nd act of 'Resident Evil 2' - a high tech underground facility is producing a zombie virus, virus gets out, crew become zombies. The first few minutes are the most well done of the movie. We actually feel a little for the doomed crew (we hear one asking another for a date). Then we get the now stock head-stuck-in-the-elevator-doors gag and it's all downhill from there. Well, that's not true, he has a few decent gags here and there: a bit involving a grid of lasers, a flashback sequence that makes no sense but looks good and a nifty final shot. The best scene in the movie involves Jojovich and a pack of zombie dogs. She jump-kicks one in the face. The bit is so absurd, it's fun. If the rest of the movie were like this and didn't take itself so seriously we might have something here. The acting is as B-movie as it comes all the way around. The script is rock bottom. The single best thing about 'Resident Evil' is Marilyn Manson and Marco Beltrami's thumping, driving techno score. That coupled with those few decent scenes makes this Anderson's best movie and the second best video game movie to date... but that is not saying much at all. It's still trash.</fullReview>

However, the film is very entertaining even as it plays up the cliches of the zombie genre. Milla Jovovich comes off well as an amnesiac who joins the soldiers as they fight the zombies, and she turns out to be a formidible fighter, even though she spends most of the film semi-naked... but hey.. works for me... The film is an entertaining thrill ride that plays like a live action video game but if you go in expecting that, you get what you wanted. GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I tend to avoid films like 'Resident Evil' unless when strongly recommended enough to be convinced. I'd watched it when it released because my brother kept insisting, telling me what a great movie it was. I thought it was an okay film with a terrible ending. Tonight my brother played it on the DVD and I watched it again as my family as around and I still feel pretty much the same. Though having the company around didn't make me feel like I had wasted my time and a few points I'd like to make about the film.The background score I found to be very impressive. It's one score I'd like to own. The special effects are not that bad either and the sense of isolation and abandon within the building was quite well done. I liked Milla Jovovich's acting for most parts. I think she displays the range of emotions very effectively through her facial expressions and makes Alice different from a caricature sci-fi horror movie heroine.Now pretty much everything else in 'Resident Evil' ranges from mediocre to bad. There are plenty of ridiculous 'jump' giving moments. Though I didn't jump at all, I saw my cousin startle at some scenes. The zombies are laughable. It's extremely Hollywoodish and the ending, though unpredictable, was disappointing and in my opinion, silly.However, I didn't feel as bad as I did after watching it for the first time. Maybe it's because of the company I was in or maybe I just noticed some of the more positive side of the film (which in my opinion is still limited).Ho</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review may contain spoilers. I have been playing the Resident Evil series for nearly as long as they have been around, and as my username suggests, i have a very large passion of them. Therefore i was horrified when the film was finally made. Not horrified by the 'horror' (loose term) but by the way it was made. For starters, there is no-one in the film who is actually from the game, and the settings are just as abstract. What a stupid concept. Surely the idea of making a film of a game is to actually BASE it on the game. Apparently not, according to Paul W.S Anderson whose track record includes 'Mortal Kombat' (not a bad film from a game adaption point of view) and the huge flop 'Alien Versus Predator'. The film is a complete insult to the games and should have been made by someone who knows what they are doing. Not play the games for 5 minutes then see what you can invent to be made into a film. Mila Jovovich ruins it to. The entire film is focused around her and what involvement she has with Umbrella. I can tell you that- NONE! She is the main character and yet is not in any of the games. In fact, she is getting married to Paul W.S Anderson and i have a strong reason to believe this has something to do with her role. Where were the S.T.A.R.S team? Or the hunters? A terrible film, yet being a film student it is my vow to write a better script and show the world what the fantastic story is all about. Before Paul W.S. Anderson does anything else (he is working on a third Resident Evil film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeeesus...this is one BAD movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to Resident Evil as I am both a massive fan of zombie movies and of the Resident Evil games. I was thinking "zombies, bad genetic shennanigans, kick ass girl heroine, if the games were great how can the movie go wrong??" But it was so WRONG. Where to start?Firstly it took me and the guy I was watching it with about thirty minutes to figure out what the hell was going. Then we realised there wasn't actually a plot to speak of. The script, well what I could hear of it above the LOUD and not very good music (sounded like the directors' three year old kid let loose in a factory of kitchenware) was unbelievable bad to the point where it wasn't even funny. Alot of the talentless cast looked the same so one minute I was thinking someone had died only to see them again (dammit) in the next scene.Then there's the acting. The acting in the game's FMV sequences was like Shakespeare compared to this. Mila Jovavich had perfected a permanently blank expression while Michelle Rodrigez looked like she was sucking a lemon throughout the whole film. The CGI was so bad you could almost see the strings and this is the only zombie film I have ever seen where the zombies were just NOT scary. At all.Every time the Red Queen popped up with her terrible English drama school accent I just cringed...God there is no way to convey the terriblness of Paul Andersons crimes. At first I was laughing at the badness, watching Mila/Alice turn from blank eyed bint to some superhuman action hero running up walls and killing zombies with her thighs but eventually my laughter gave way to slack jawed amazement at the horribleness of this film. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Rent a Romero film instead. To think Romero could have directed this film brings a tear to my eye....</fullReview>

I went with my mother, and through half of the movie, she had her eyes covered with a Tribute magazine from the lobby. It was gory and tastefully horrifying, and those of you who have seen "Cube", you may notice a similarity between the beginning of that movie and the corridor scene in Resident Evil. I have liked Milla Jovovich ever since I saw "The Fifth Element". She's really good at kicking ass.I'd give this movie a 7/10.(ok, this is my first review i've ever written, i just saw this movie.

		<fullReview>Rewritten on: 10.9.06Let's get one thing straight. This film is not a horror-movie. Horror-movies are lame. Resident Evil is anything but lame.Almost everything about this movie is excellent. The atmosphere kicks ass and the movie has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. The over-all feeling is rather abstract, but not so much that it would make the film difficult to follow.This film is also not a Zombie-movie in the traditional sense, but more like an action-thriller...with zombies. As far as movie-monsters go the Licker was a great piece of work, even if in the earlier scenes it was a little dumpy-looking. The only other notable point that I may criticize is that up to the halfway point of the film it perhaps attempted too many times to startle the viewers which seemed a little goofy.As a final note, the ending crawl is one of the best I've seen in any film to date. Even if the film's plot (which I felt was on par with the games) is nowhere near as good as in Silent Hill, this is still my personal favorite on the front of video-game films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not like zombies movies. It's a matter of taste, but none of the after-death genres really speaks to me. I must however confess having enjoyed 'Resident Evil', especially because it is very well made - but I might have never seen it if I knew what it is about when I rented it from my local Blockbuster. This would have been a miss.The director, Paul Anderson seems to specialize in movies inspired by computer games (another sign of the culture of our times, but why not?). This is his second one after 'Mortal Kombat', and it works much better. His other sources of inspiration are Lewis Carrol's Alice, '2001 - The Space Odissey', and of course the other zombies movies in the last 20 years. The combination works, and I think that this is first of all because of the clear and sure director hand. The story line is of a corporate having almost total control of home computers ('evil' Microsoft comes in mind immediately), and performing secret biological weapons experiments behind the scenes. When something goes wrong, zombies are not late to show up and start eliminating the humans around. It's not especially original, but all is well linked, there are no major flaws, and even the quantity of pretentious laughable quotes is beyond the usual limit.Milla Jovovitch and Michelle Rodriguez are the feminine stars in the movie, easy to remember as they are both beautiful and well-casted. The rest of the actors team are decent. Effects are well filmed, and provide the needed quantity of horror for the fans of the genre.The sequel is already in making, and I intent to go and see it.</fullReview>

The "evil computer" subplot is ridiculous, the fact that "bullets don't seem to stop them" yet that is exactly how they stop them, and the entire virus plot is contrived.

'Mortal Kombat' anyone? At least 'Soldier' was so horrifically bad that you could laugh at it, and at the $20 million that Kurt walked off with. But 'Resident Evil'? It's not difficult making a Zombie film. Zombies stumble around, Zombies chew people, Zombies get shot. What's the problem?

'Evil Dead', 'Dawn of the Dead', 'Braindead', 'Bad Taste' - these are real zombie films. 'Starship Troopers', 'Aliens', 'Buckaroo Banzai' - these are real sci-fi films.

		<fullReview>For anyone who has played throught the videogames in the series (especially the GameCube remakes) will know that it was the immense tension, slow build up, film noir-like lighting and the gritty characterisations that made the zombie action so brilliantly scary.However, it seems that Paul 'Mortal Kombat' WS Anderson spent his time watching Kerrang! on cable in the run up to over seeing the design of the film. Resident Evil, although catering mainly for the 'teen - rockers' faternity could also have appealed to a broader horror fan, or even been a more mainstream sucess (in the same way that 'The Others' was 'Poltergeist' for thesps).The entire thing plays like a two hour rock video. Why is the installation so clean and new? It was housed in a rotting mansion in the games (with its decrepid grounds and gothic architecture) and merely placing a mansion in the film does not a plot point make.The zombies had CGI eczema and the amount of cast was OTT - why not have a few specific deaths instead of popcorn cannon fodder? The music was terrible - just because it is horror and was made in the new millenium we had to put up with thrash metal. Hmmm.Paul's sequel will be just as crap, im sure. God, I hated this film, as I'm sure you can tell - and you will too if you're a fan of serious and genuinely frightening horror. This is just a media franchise film I'm afraid, and very unsatisfying.I gave it a 4 just because it had a vague resemblance to the game, but the potential that the game held, cinematically, has been devoured by this actually very poor film.This style was great in 'Mortal Kombat' - it was a good, fun, meaningless film (like the game) but in the case of 'Resident Evil', a narrative that holds deep emotioal and social meaning (and is subtly scary) it is as useful as a spoon.</fullReview>

Ok there are three things: The virus, there ARE zombies, Lisa Trevor is in there somewhere - But she's a computer not a mutated freak.Anderson has never played Resident Evil. There are simply so few references to the game it's scary. Examples: No shotgun (the survival horror's weapon of choice) or Grenade launchers (because every female alive uses one.) And no crate pushing! CRATE PUSHING!The biggest disappointed is easily the fact that none of the infamous bosses appear.

		<fullReview>Poor at best. The gritty horror of the games has been swapped for really incompetent soldiers posing for the camera with massive guns. The only cool bit is the "laser net" sequence which is both graphic, and hugely entertaining.I mean i've seen more realistic zombies coming home on a Friday night out. They just grope a bit and then stop bothering.The soldiers really are stupid. They, despite the obvious risk, go into the bunker and get brutally butchered, showing no military know how at all.What ruined it for me was the typical characters. For example, you've got the bitchy butch women soldier who is really ugly posing around dark corners for the entire film. You've got the "good" soldier who gets murdered in the most painful way. You've got the woman who loses her memory and gets it back, discovering she has got kung-fu skills. It is SO old and predictable. They have been done a million times before.It was not even scary. The moment you see the monsters, you think "my god - they are so not scary" There is no suspense, and when scenes to get a bit "creepy" (though no way near as creepy as say, aliens), the chance for a scare is ruined by the "scare" being a member of the team.The acting is pretty standard. You would expect the soldiers to be absolutely s****** them selves, but they just accept their fate with very little emotion. The special effects are also pretty average- when the licker arrived i thought it was a cat.The film explains nothing about umbrella corparation and why they have made such hideous monsters. Well to be fair, it does a bit at the beginning, but the rest of the film is ALL the same. Posing. With guns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diabolical. In a, you know, bad way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the primary literary phase of its development as an entertainment form, the gothic genre tended to involve a set of familiar ingredients - ruined buildings, virtuous heroines in distress, supernatural manifestations, heroic rescuers and loathsome villains, perhaps with a gang of bandits thrown in. Even though we call 'Gothic' simply 'Horror' these days, and even though most of us now visit this genre in its new home of the cinema more than on the pages of books, these ingredients have hardly changed over the years. Resident Evil is fascinating proof of this on two levels.On the most obvious level, for Ruined Building read The Hive - the abandoned but not-so abandoned biowarfare lab which is the principal location of this film. For virtuous heroine read Milla Jovovich wearing a dress as short as her legs are long; for supernatural manifestations. well, it's a zombie film. You get the point.On the second level, this film is a bit of an abandoned ruin itself, haunted by the wailing spirit of the film it might have been. You can see how the crumbling architecture might have formed a magnificent structure at one time - however, what separates this from every other romantic ruin you will ever visit, is simply that most ruins come to their tragic state of disrepair thanks to the gnawing of time's teeth, or violent misuse, and not simply because the owner got some cowboy in to build it in the first place.More of a folly than a ruin, then. Sometimes this film looks beautiful - the cameraman certainly knows how to present the lead actress in a favourable manner - I'm not sure Jovovich has looked quite so luminous on screen before. A pity, then, that the film is so awful taken as a whole.This is a film without sense, restraint, inspiration, or even excitement. It's not a good zombie film, not a good action film, and not a good science fiction film. It has an extraordinary trompe l'oeil quality that does, at times, deceive the viewer into thinking the film has some genuine quality - but it is deception only.What's more, it strikes me as rather bizarre that a film about zombies, with such obvious possible influences and precedents, should come across as being more interested in aping James Cameron than George Romero. Indeed, it is somewhat pointless since it is neither the first Aliens-wannabe, nor anything like the best-equipped to carry out such imitation; and this supposes that imitating another (perfectly good) film is even a good idea in the first place.The utterly pointless directorial allusion to Psycho which opens the film is entirely typical of the direction; so, like a jackdaw's nest, this film may contain many shiny and interesting things but it is simply a mess. Unlike a jackdaw's nest it isn't constructed of old twigs or covered in guano, nor has it fallen down a chimney into a fire yet - but we can always hope.I suppose utlimately what I find most objectionable about this exercise, and what makes me dislike it more than many other more obviously terrible films is that watching it you can actually see what a good film this could have been. This film earns contempt not so much for its mediocrity as for its wasted potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Milla very much. I like this movie, since this is one of the best she ever starred in, including the Fifth Element or any other. But Resident Evil is ever fresh, ever thrilling monster. The plot is excellent and from the very start the movie holds you glued to the seat and never allows you even to take a breath in or out. Milla as Alice is brave, sexy, valiant, courageous, smart, cool and so clever. And then there is Michelle Rodriguez as Rain, she is so gloomy, so dark and so demonic, that you hardly avoid falling in love with her too. The very idea that some large corporation like Umbrella here may control you, create some terrible genetic monsters and never be responsible for that is also a big magnet in this film. This is cool, impeccable and great All 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This title is very good and the scenes are very real. I like it besides the fact that the video game are much better. When i see it i really scare about the zombies and the evil present in the dark ambient of Raccoon City and The Hive. If you like the video game you perhaps disappointing a little seeing the movie but... this is not enough to call the film as horrible. The story is not all bad and the spirit of the game was catched by the director. Maybe a little more stars at the roster and a little more look in the direction of the real history and then ....eureka! one of the greatest movies ever made was the result. Truly impressive the beginning and the end. Definitely a very entertaining movie and a wise choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We've had movies based on books, based on the Bible, based comic books, based on songs, and ever since the mid 1990s, movies based on video games. Resident Evil is based on a video game, but probably could have been based on a night of heavy drinking and watching "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Night of the Living Dead," one after another. In Resident Evil, an evil bio-research company, called Umbrella Corp, or something silly like that, manufactured a virus that brings the dead back to life and causes them to want to eat other people. The standard horror movie rules apply, if someone is bitten by a zombie, they will become a zombie, zombies can only be killed after certain parameters occur (almost always where something is severed), and the girl with the most revealing dress and the biggest boobs will be the de-facto hero of the film. Milla Jovovich plays Alice who wants to steal the virus to somehow protect the world from it gets caught up in the building where the virus is stored has a security breach, and that causes all heck to break loose. This is where HAL 9000 takes over, errr, rather "Red Queen" takes over, as the computer has to shut down the building to make sure the virus does not escape, and will do anything to make sure it doesn't happen. Some computer rebooting occurs, yada yada, and by the end of the film, only 1 or 2 of the people who were in the building at the beginning are alive by the end. The movie is directed by Paul Anderson, who also directed "Alien vs. Predator," so action scenes are to be expected. Some of the action sequences are so dark, so frantically edited, that while the scenes convey "chaos," the message is lost in the inability to figure out what is going on. I would tell you who the men actors were, except they all look alike, so I couldn't tell who was who, they all had the same height, same haircut, one guy wore a blue shirt, but most of the others were even dressed alike. I know there is only one casting list out there anymore, but this is ridiculous. Not the worst film I have ever seen, but after seeing it, I have to wonder why they felt compelled to make a sequel. I for one have not heard about "Resident Evil Mania" out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this film. I had heard (from media hype, natch) that it might be the first decent videogame based movie ever. So I went to see it, and for the first five minutes hopes were high, the slow zoom in with the crunching industrial soundtrack was amazing, but it was downhill from there. Mila Jovovich finding herself in a strange place was intriguing, as was the lead up to her returning to the underground city (despite screamingly awful dialogue) and all seemed good. It was when the zombies appeared that this film disintegrated into awful cliche ridden vacuousness. After that, it was just an awful, suspence-free regurgitation of superior films and videogames. I do not want to spoil the plot for those who have not seen it, but when a zombie based movie does not use the word 'zombie' once, and takes an hour to realise the aforementioned undead should be shot in the head, something is really wrong!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fair action-film, but a poor shadow of the game...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Relatively fun to watch, Resident Evil, is a decent enough action film. Hard to take seriously and lacking in atmosphere, suspense and any real depth is does not, however, do the games justice. The games are cinematic in quality and create an atmosphere and potential for adaptation into a truly great film. Why the venture was given to Anderson i will never know, adept at action, he appears to lack the depth of creativity and understanding that is needed to develop a truly good film. Resident Evil had the potential to be one of the scariest films ever made and instead it has been violated and torn apart until all that has been left of the masterful composition of the game is a few lousy references and a distant memory of an engaging story. It is as if someone has played the games, seen the cinematic potential, then thrown all that out the window, focusing on creating a self-involved 'cool' film that tries to hard, yet fails more often than succeeds. The replacement of the atmospheric music with the noise-like 'angst ridden metal' is laughable and becoming a touch clichéd. Whilst it has its moments, Resident Evil, does not live up to its name and frankly should have be made by someone with more respect for the games, their creators, their fans and film-making in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Umbrella corporation dominates the world. In an accident at its secret underground facility called "The Hive", a dangerous virus is let loose. It has infected the staff turning them into zombies while mutant creatures run free. The computer Red Queen shuts down the complex and kills everybody inside. Alice (Milla Jovovich) finds herself with amnesia in a house that has a secret entrance to the underground labs. The corporation sends in an elite armed squad (Colin Salmon, Michelle Rodriguez) who finds amnesic Alice and Spence (James Purefoy), and they go in to investigate.Based on the video game, director/writer Paul W.S. Anderson brings some interesting gore into the movie. The characters are two dimensional. But it does what it intends to do and not much more. It's mostly atmosphere in the first half. Then there is shoot them up horror action but nothing terribly scary. And hot Jovovich doing battle with zombies and mutants. The flashbacks as Alice remembers is distracting and usually disrupts the flow. The video game genre doesn't usually get much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil is one of the biggest if not the biggest video game franchise ever and rightly so. The games are intelligent, action packed and scary as hell. Taking the first game and sort of making a prequel/sequel to it with this film Paul W.S. Anderson of the 1995's visual spectacle Mortal Kombat executes the right formula with his adaptation. By setting it in a sort of alternate universe he manages to keep an heir of unpredictability. We open the film with a viral attack on a huge underground laboratory owned by the Umbrella Corporation. Soon after that we meet Alice the films lead heroine who is suffering from memory loss played by Milla Jovovich with a exceptionally physical cool factor. A studly mystery man named Matt played by hunky Eric Mabius and soon after a security team featuring a very young and quite annoying Michelle Rodriguez. They of course go into the hive where they encounter many biological and digital terors such as an evil computer program, mutant creatures and loads and loads of zombies. What make this film work so well is the way it's paced it feels like a video game and you feel like your playing. As the film opens into its later segments and you learn more about the main character and the storyline you seem to be one upping levels it's an intriguing experience and a brilliant approach. Sure there's a little goofiness afoot and some of the FX are unimpressive especially by the standards now as well as being slightly repetitive at times. But Resident Evil is the best adaptation of a game it's cool, slick, action packed and scary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>irritating and clichéd, however still surprisingly fun to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, when i first saw that they were going to make a movie out of the game i though something at the lines of "Wow, this is going to be worse then the super Mario brothers movie" However, when i saw it for the first time i was surprised at how they actually managed to capture some of the game-play elements and some other interesting things into this movie things that DID irritate me to no end are stupid clichés and physical impossibilities like:When one of the commandos shoots a zombie (or whatever you'd like to call them) in the torso with a fully automatic sub-machine gun, now this zombie flies about 10 meters away and about one meter up in the air, sure it looks cool. BUT if that weapon should be capable of sending a zombie trough the air with that force, the shooter (in this case the commando)would also be propelled into the air with the same force.Then there where some other annoyances like the laser beam thing when the beam went completely horizontal but still managed to cut peoples necks in a not-so-straight angleNow, you might think i'm just nit-picking on some random occasions, however this movie is FULL of these kind of things, physical impossibilities and things that simply don't make any sense whatsoever Some other simply makes no senseLike why would an AI want to scare the living *whatever* out of scientists by teasing them around in the elevator, and when one stuck their head out, accelerate, stop, then go up in turbo speed - decapitating the scientist.The movie is also full of irritating stuff like the camera's switching angles a million times per minute and EVERY time they flash intensivelyCharacters are also insanely stupid like: oh gee laser beam coming at me, better stand and stare at it, maybe it'l go away.or:Hmm, there's something in the vent, maybe i should just stare at the vent some and wait for it to go and potentially slaughter the other guys.or characters asking questions 5 year old could figure the out the answer, like:*huge steel door with something huge pounding on the outside* *main character points at door and says "is it safe to go trough there?"*And ALL of these occasions happens in the first 20 minutes of the movie, and that's just the start of this annoying journey.However, on the good side, the action is amazing and some of the plot devices are really interesting to watch.So, + Good action and some interesting plot devices- stupid characters, nothing makes sense, impossibilities, and plainly irritating flaws</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much to do with the game series and as a zombie flick, not bad at all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite an entertaining movie but the fans of the game may find it disappointing as this doesn't necessarily stick to the games. In fact, the things that this movie and the games have in common is the T-Virus, zombies, the monsters and Umbrella, not the story. The story wasn't so well-thought but W.S Anderson's twist on the Resident Evil universe works to an extent. While trying to make the movie his own, it felt like it was driving away from the Resident Evil universe and started being its own movie (which isn't really such a bad thing). The music added the tension and added more 'oomph' to the action scenes which fit the movie quite well. 'Resident Evil' didn't exactly have you waiting for more but at the same time, it didn't make you turn it off. There were two or three scenes that were kind of boring and pointless but other scenes were well-executed.One thing I couldn't really fault was the acting for some of the actors. Milla Jovovich being the star of the movie and Michelle Rodriguez following close-second were brilliant. Their on-screen 'friendship' made it entertaining to watch and also the scenes between Milla Jovovich as Alice and Eric Mabius as Matt was also good. I couldn't say much for the others like Colin Salmon and Martin Crewes who were just average. The special effects and make-up in the movie were done brilliantly and added such a dark and cold tone. The design of the monsters were done well as were the make-up for the zombies.The movie ended quite well and wasn't exactly predictable like some of the scenes in the movie was. The ending wasn't exactly so shocking that you would remember it but for a movie that was above average, it ended well and it felt like it went smoothly with the movie.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terrible, however the video games are more entertaining than this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this doesn't have almost nothing to do with the video games it tries to adapt with. Besides the evil corporation, the same virus and zombies, it does how ever have the survival horror feel to it and has sort of the similar atmosphere as the video games. Now this film is a mess for the most part, especially the last hour of it, but it's still a entertaining mess and the pacing is well done although it seems to skip a lot of parts and scenes. The story is passable, not great though alright for a video game adaptation and although not particularly scary it has decent action scenes and zombie killings. The plot is basically about a girl named Alice who worked for the Umbrella Corporation, who gets amnesia from a chemical and gets dragged in and has to team up with a group of commandos that is trying to infiltrate a underground lab called The Hive in order to turn off the super computer called the The Red Queen that killed off the workers after a virus outbreak. But the team is in for more than they bargained for. The acting in this is pretty bad, not terrible however. And although it isn't a fantastic film, it still is entertainment to some degree. Would have been better if it had some of the video game elements of solving puzzles with more flare to it and was compact better in a way it flowed better. Has a lot of flaws and nothing about it is scary in anyway, but still decent.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason i always find myself thinking about this film. The eye; that's what does it for me.It is my belief that, without wanting to offend anyone, most people nowdays do not have appreciation for "good film". Again, i mean no offense, and it's OK if you do not love Truffaut of don't think so highly of Film Blu; or maybe you think that Ran wasn't awesome, or that Metropolis is boring.So maybe the reasons for me to say that Resident Evil is a great film, may not strike a chord with you;The eye is my favourite scene and perhaps my favourite shot, in-context, of any movie i have seen. The Imagery in Resident Evil is incredible; i personally find Milla Jovovich to be absolutely horrid (and not that hot either), but as she does nothing but serve as a prop in this movie(she is utterly incapable of Acting?), i actually find her almost perfect. More examples: How many times i (we all) have lusted at the deadly macho awesomeness of SWAT teams? let's film them in an otherwise empty room ! Just after we do a long take of the wind through the long red curtains, just after we do a long shot of Milla's eye as she wakes up lost in nowhereland.OK, we seen the swat do their stuff, normal film would kill them off one by one, but RE just kills them all straight away, in one shot. HA! We awesome film makers do not resort to such lame scripting as "we kill this guy here, that guy there, then that one in the last bit". Naa, let's just get them to "exit stage left", and be done with them. Look carefully through the film and you will see many possibilities for cheap scripting tricks that have been ignored, and kudos to the filmmakers for that; The change of pace and setting between the scenes of the film, the majestic use of color, (bright white, psychological horror at the Red Queen, dark brown and black, action bit in the train chase, red, claustrophobic zombie scene with the guy *not-actually-dieing* when you expect him to, blue/grey, beginning part with the virus release, etc..), make this one of the best films i have seen. For Me. Maybe i am under the delusion that *i understand it*, but i love it. all my friends think i am crazy, but watch it, you might just *understand it* too.One of the Best 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cheesy, juvenile action blockbuster, but at least there's lots of adrenaline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is another cheesy video game adaptation, and is based on a game series which I'm not familiar with. The film was released years before it ever caught my attention and it obviously wasn't any of the "Resident Evil" games that lead me to watch it, since I've never played any of them. I first found out about this Paul W.S. Anderson movie when I learned that Milla Jovovich was in it. Before I rented it the other day, I knew it was one of the polarizing modern action blockbusters, but fortunately not one of the universally panned ones. Due to all the criticism, I wasn't expecting a great film, but thought it could be pretty good at best. I can now understand the widespread criticism, but despite the severe flaws, I found some redeeming qualities.Below Raccoon City, there is a top secret underground genetic research facility called the Hive, owned by the extremely powerful Umbrella Corporation. After a vial is broken, releasing a virus, the lab's supercomputer known as the Red Queen locks the Hive to prevent the virus from escaping, trapping and killing all the employees inside! A military unit then takes Alice and Spence, two people suffering from amnesia, and goes to the Hive to investigate what has happened. The head of the commandos, known as the "One", explains why they are all here, and several members of the team attempt to disable the Red Queen, but are cut up by a laser! This leaves Alice, Spence, Rain Ocampo, Matt Addison, and Chad Kaplan to continue the mission. They discover that the supercomputer is not the only problem, as the employees who were killed have mutated into flesh-eating zombies, and can now be found all over the facility! From the beginning, I could tell the film wasn't that great, but when the emergency in the "Hive" begins, so does the suspense! After that sequence, Milla Jovovich, who plays Alice, makes her first appearance in the film naked, waking up in the mansion shower, and this scene could easily be cited as a highlight for straight male viewers like me. The suspense continues as Alice looks around in the mansion, but unfortunately, it doesn't stay consistent. The sci-fi action horror film can be a little hard to follow at times, the music is sometimes really cheesy, and there are some extremely juvenile lines. In addition to that, the characters are underdeveloped, and at least some of them seem like naive high school students who shouldn't be on a mission like this. The acting is nothing special, and Michelle Rodriguez' performance as Rain Ocampo is particularly poor. However, while the walk through the Hive before the mutants are found is pretty dull, there's a lot more adrenaline as the film goes along and the group faces the dangers of this underground facility. Jovovich and her fighting moves were another highlight for me. Also, as usual for these modern action sci-fi blockbusters, there are great sets and special effects in this film.I'm not sure if this video game adaptation deserves the 7/10 rating I'm giving it. Overall, it is cheesy and juvenile, and probably mainly appeals to young male viewers (younger than me). I realize Paul W.S. Anderson was also the one who directed 1995's "Mortal Kombat" (another movie based on a video game), and I didn't like that film at all, but for some reason, that wasn't quite the case with this 2002 blockbuster. I'm not sure what I would think of it with a second viewing, but it wasn't bad for one viewing, as much as I think some of the haters have made some good points! If you hate mindless action, you will hate this movie, so don't watch it, and if you like that sort of thing, well, you MIGHT like this first "Resident Evil" movie, but there's no guarantee. The flaws could still be too much for you to take, and you could end up wondering how anyone could possibly like the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a bit hard for me to review, because for one I am a fan of the first Resident Evil games, and second because even though this movie is often seen as a very mediocre movie and overall adaption of the game, it is still much better then the second movie Resident Evil: Apocalypse.The acting in this movie is poor, but its the kind of acting that is so bad its good. Even though Milla Jovovich has the looks, she is just not a convincing actor at all. Michelle Rodriguez's part also doesn't work that well either, but I have to admit that both of them do deliver some good action-scenes.The music in this movie is also something I have mixed feelings about. Its composed in cooperation with shock-rocker Marilyn Manson. The score sounds very industrial and cold, which adds a very eerie vibe to the movie. But in some places the music is way too loud. I first watched this movie in the theater and I kid you not when I say that the industrial rock soundtrack is deafening at some parts. But I have to say that it does fit the movie's atmosphere well.The story is about your average zombie-outbreak, but instead of it taking place on the street or in a mall its taking place in a underground laboratory. Nothing too special, but it works.If you are a fan of zombie-movies then you should definitely give Resident Evil a try, its certainly worth watching at least once. Don't bother watching Resident Evil: Apocalypse though because thats a whole different story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a film based on a video game, Resident Evil has a very sluggish start. It takes well over an hour for the plot to gather steam. This hurts it a lot. The production design at least initially is good though the Special Effects have already dated and look tacky. The performances are generally decent and Milla Jovovich has good screen presence. There is plenty of blood and gore and the film is definitely not for the squeamish. There are a lot of plot-holes and the action is not very thrilling.

		<shortDescription>Not A Good Adaptation But A Fun Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil follows a team of commando's investigating an underground biolab after a reported incident occurs inside of it.The incident is more severe then any of them suspected as the former employees are dead but they are still walking around and they are hungry.Seeing as Resident Evil was originally a groundbreaking horror game you'd think this film adaptation would be a mirror image of it however this movie only has elements of the game in it spread out through various visual effects, lighting, and set design everything else is completely different.Director Paul WS Anderson (Mortal Kombat,AVP) intended this movie to be a prequel to the game and show how and why the viral infection escaped however many did not know this and immediately hated it because the storyline and characters in the movie were never in the game.The elements of this movie are a mixed bag.The acting is very good especially Milla Jovovich, Eric Mabius, and James Purefoy but Michelle Rodriguez gives her one trick pony tough girl act again.The script is at times suspenseful and at times god awful mostly coming from poor dialogue and badly delivered one liners.Visually the film is gritty and very grainy with a very cold colour temperature which creates suspense but looks at times boring and unappealing.The music in the movie is also mixed sometimes it's absolutely perfect others it's loud and overbearing however the main score is an absolute masterpiece thank you Marilyn Manson.The action is raw and hardcore, the gun brawls are great but the hand to hand is weak and cheesy especially when it's Milla vs the zombie dogs.The special effects are pretty good but at times far too unrealistic and far too fake looking for example some of the gore and CGI effects(the licker is obviously CGI).This is probably Paul WS Andersons best film it's not perfect, it's not brutal but gamers probably won't like it too much.The film is mildly entertaining but the lack of special effects and good hand to hand choreography you generally see in an Anderson film (Mortal Kombat,Soldier) are missing in the otherwise fun film.The trailer isn't misleading if you've seen it you know what you're getting into n action/horror that isn't supposed to be taken too seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if any other movie infuriates me more than this. Well, maybe the sequel. The people in charge in Hollywood don't seem to realize that videogames turned to film have so much more potential than given credit for. That's why films like this don't have a large budget, which leads to idiots like Paul W.S. Anderson getting the chance to direct and write... neither of which can he do.I mean honestly, the Resident Evil video game series does not have an amazing story like some will say. What it does have is many characters that will one day go down as classic heroes and villains, with a conspiracy plot that was original and highly entertaining in how it was uncovered. The was all set in the perfect atmosphere - a creepy mansion filled with bloodthirsty zombies... awesome! That would be a good movie and it is already a great series of games.The only thing this movie has in common with that is... yes, there are zombies, but they're not scary. They look like sick, hungover mental patients who can't do anything. I heard someone once say this movie was the poor man's Aliens. Exactly. Everything about it is just so routine and mediocre, and aside from that the best characters are killed right away and in awful ways. (The laser hallway is among the dumbest things ever conceived by mankind.) Furthermore, the atmosphere of the games is lost in misplaced maniacal techno music...why?? I'm not saying that the movie is bad just because it does not follow the games, because the setting as a prequel is acceptable. However, there are several other things that make a film enjoyable, and it just doesn't work here. No good acting leads to lack of chemistry amongst the characters. The pacing is poor, the dialogue is mundane, and it is not scary enough for the horror flick it aspires to be. The director was just lost. Rather than use a great premise, Paul Anderson abandoned it and made something of his own, which isn't any good on its own. I'll never know why they didn't let George Romero make it. And of course, since it was low budget - the film made a profit and they made a sequel. That is why this sad cycle will continue to repeat itself, and the video game movie will forever be wasted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was the first Zombie movie I saw. OK, apart from the original ALIEN. I guess you should never ask for logic and reasonable scenes and sequences. In fact I guess this is what this genre is about - the more unrealistic and freaky the better. Unfortunately - and this is mainly the reason why I never watch these type of movies - there are no surprises apart from Zombies coming on to your screen out of any possible direction...and since you expect it anyway...what surprise is there? To predictable and only effects don' t do the trick to me. So fellas, it was quite entertaining but not enough to make me watch another one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Only did this because the person before me wrote an unfair comment on the movie. Here's The Plot:Alice wakes up and doesn't know who she is blah blah blah...etc Then they fight some zombies..... Someone Good dies for no real reason.... Someone you thaught was a bad guy is actually a good guy.... now same except turned around..... big monster wakes up... big monster dies.... bad guy comes back as zombie.... Alice kills said zombie.... happy ending..... Or Is It???? No It's A Sequel Ending.Okay Now what i was saying/feeling during this moviehey Mila Topless....Cool OH COOL ZOMBIES (turns to friends) I Love zombies WHY ARE THEY DEAD???? What A Bad Twist... I Knew that guy was evil... Is That A Licker Or A Hunter? Has To Be A Hunter! Doesn't Matter he was beaten easy... Oh Look who's back... Never mind he's dead... YAY Happy Ending!!! No Wait It Isn't.. That Was A Gay Ending.... No Wait It Isn't Over... SPOT THE GEORGE A ROMERO RIP OFF... No I Have To Wait For The Sequel... God's Sake!Anyone Who Has Watched This Movie Will Agree With Me. BUT it's still a decent Zombie Flick. Okay It's No Dawn(original and remake) But it's still good. It's Wrong To Compare this to the game since they are two different things. So Here's My Rating (given compared to game and not compared to game)Compared To Game 2/10 As A Stand Alone Movie 6.5/10my advice for viewing? With Friends So You Can Make Fun Of It,And So you can have fun. +For some real Fun? Pair it with RESI 4 Mercenaries. Please do me a favor,If you love the game? Forget about it and watch this movie as if it's called ''Zombie Where Mila Looks Good And Kicks Ass!FOR NO REAL REASON BUT THAT IT'S THERE TO BE KICKED''</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WAY better than what the most reviewers here seem to think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand all the negative emotions about this movie. Yesterday I saw it on TV and I enjoyed it very much! Sure there are better movies out there, but this one does deliver what it promises: zombie action, cool heroine (Milla is unbeatable here - with Sigourney as Ripley out of contest, of course), tension, and - from time to time - even the relatively unexpected plot moves.Bear in mind, however, that this *is* a horror action movie. Don't expect it to be logical, to have a really great story, or to be free of errors. However, it surely is WAY better in every one of those aspects than that overrated @#$%@ called "Signs".I haven't seen the first 15-20 minutes of the movie, but based on the rest, I know I'll rent myself a DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't do the Video Game Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thats all I have to say. The game plot was much better when cut into parts instead of mashing all games into one incomplete movie. If they took their time they could have made it a successful trilogy.Since there is a 10 line minimum, I'll have to go into a little more detail even though it pains me to think about the atrocities. I will start that I and many of my friends love the Resident Evil video games with a deep passion. If that video game were a woman, I would make sweet love to her. If. That may sound extreme to some, but if you can get past the lame Decalogue with no emotion of the original you will be in good shape. The game goes into much more detail than you would think so that you learn a little more each game and the conspiracy unravels slowly. But in this movie it basically goes 1) underground lab 2) outbreak 3)survival 4) open ended ending. Very vague, very very vague. If the original plot was kept intact ( isolated incidents of outbreaks being tracked to the mansion then a STARS team going in with one member being a part of the Umbrella corporation then fighting their way out and destroying the mansion leaving Raccoon city in chaos, setting up the sequel) But instead, they mash up all the plots from 1-3 and mess everything up trying to get the whole story told. I just wish that the director/producer would have been forced to sit down and play all games in order to appreciate the timeliness of plot information.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not having played the games I wasn't too bothered about the loyalty, or lack thereof, to the source material. Normally I feel right at home in anything featuring evil corporations and terrible mistakes (reminds me of my employment history I suppose), but this didn't do a lot for me. Like most zombie movies it's an action-horror but, while the action is reasonable enough, the horror aspect lets the film down badly. Horror, afterall isn't just about plain old fear. At its most effective it captures the senses in ghoulish fascination, while hitting the mind with such a terrible concept that it reels off in revolt. When done well zombies, in their relentless overwhelming of society, can cause outright despair. Otherwise they're just slow, weak and stupid, poor opponents for an action heroine. MJ fans by all means enjoy yourselves, but there are better action films and far better horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So it has begun. Press start to begin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Located in Racoon City is the Umbrella Corporation headquarters, where in an secret underground compound called the 'The Hive' one of their experiments known as the 'T-Virus' is unknowingly released. So the main computer system "The Red Queen" locks everyone in "The Hive", which the virus turns every living thing in the facility into fleshing eating zombies. So, a military crack force is sent in to shut down the main computer and pick up any survivors within three hours. One of them they come across is Alice who's suffering amnesia, but she slowly starts to puts the pieces together, while confronting this massive problem.I remember when I was originally going to see this at the cinema, but a friend of mine conned me out of it, in which we saw the sentimentally, wretched war flick "We Were Soldiers" instead. Well, I finally got around to seeing it after all of those years and well, meh! Now I just wonder what got me interested in it in the first place. I'm no fanatic of the video game and I have no idea how true it is to the story, but from what I've seen of the game. Anderson was no were near in capturing the dark and creepy atmosphere. Alternatively he brings his loud, rapid and glossy stylistic touches that find its way in most of his other films. I actually don't mind his earlier efforts like; the enjoyable rubbish "Mortal Kombat" and the mildly creepy "Event Horizon", but this project and even more so "Alien vs. Predator" I found mindlessly under whelming and kinda flat. Sure, I'm not expecting a meaningful masterpiece (although some specifics and character development wouldn't hurt), but the entertainment factor is rather botch. Maybe if I saw it when I was initially going to, I might've got more out of it and see it in a different manner. Since obviously its aimed at a certain target audience and to make a profitable franchise. I just found it far from gripping and the involvement was really lacking. That can be contributed to the story (which has decent plot device) that seems to go nowhere and the stock characters are pretty vague with their cheesy one-liners and thin dialogue.Well, since that was the case I was hoping the action, blood splatter and zombie madness would spice up this shindig! I'll admit the film has a couple of striking set-pieces and the pace keeps the film moving, but these aspects lose out to the "Look at my shinning new toy! I don't know how it works, but it looks great!" attitude. The film visually looks good. But it just got caught up trying to be too flashy in it's snazzy techno appearance than actually executing some tension, excitement or even some gore. Instead we get cheap jump scares that are plain predictable, lame slow-motion, tame combat and pretty clumsy, looking CGI. You got the usual chaotic editing worked around the slick camera-work that captures the crisp art direction. Surrounding these glossy fixtures is an impulsively, blaring techno mental soundtrack. Style definitely wins out here! The performances were rather vapid, though Milla Jovovich fits the buck in the lead role. She might not have much to do but to kick ass, but she does makes the most out of her undeveloped character. Michelle Rodriguez plays a very lazy stereotype; the tough female soldier who won't take any crap! The characters here actually share a real common interest with those in "Aliens", but at least in that movie that had interesting personalities. *Hmm* Now I'm sitting here looking at the DVD cover of "Resident Evil: Apocalypse", which has on the front cover "Bigger, better, action-packed". Well, hopefully it lives up to that wrap or, maybe it will be equally forgettable.No way is it awful. But simply, it's a weak and very dumb action-video game hybrid that lacks the firepower and is unintentionally laughable when it came to shove.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am 20. I really like Resident Evil. The idea of bringing the dead back to life would be awesome.. if only they didn't eat flesh and weren't so ugly. The mansion where the first of the movie is, was where the first Resident Evil game took place. The bad thing was that they never put enough blood and gore in. When the girl lost her head from the elevator, it should have showed. All the blood, all the gore, would have been amazing. The creators of Resident Evil Are amazing movie creators. I say though if it were Rob Zombie who created that movie, would have been amazing. Another downfall is that they have Slipknot as a theme song. Its also stupid how Spence and Alice don't introduce themselves to each other, but in the middle of the movie, Alice knows Spence' name. Another thing is, it doesn't show what happens to Matt. And also, with 2 years in the difference of both movies, it kept fans in tight suspense. "What shall happen to Matt" What shall become of Alice" "Why is Umbrela Corp so fruity?" all these questions and more to be answered in the next Resident Evil movie. Thank you, good bye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent premise....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...for a video game! I joined IMDb for the sole purpose of writing a review for this movie. I don't even care if anyone reads it, I just absolutely had to vent. I watched this movie with average expectations, knowing and having heard little about the film. Let me be the first to say that this movie should never, ever have been made. And then they should never, ever have made a sequel (but that's a story for another day). I won't give anything away here, because there's pretty much nothing to say about the movie that hasn't already been covered in the summary... in a way that makes way more sense, I promise. Meanwhile, this movie is just like the video game. Literally. I felt like I was playing a first-person shooter the whole time. The kind with a lot of unnecessary segues and animation, but no real action. But without the fun of doing it myself. (More accurately, I guess I felt like I was watching someone else play a first-person shooter.) The concept of the plot itself is just really, really dumb. Usually you can make up for something like that with good action or awesome fight scenes. Not so here. The action felt forced and was extremely predictable. Loud sound effects and a soundtrack with lots of power chords never make up for a lack of substance, and didn't here. Milla Jovovich's talent is completely wasted in this film. She's too good to be doing stuff like this. Really. And regarding Michelle Rodriguez... well, I've seen better acting skills in my 14-year-old sister's school plays. She has only two facial expressions: angry, and really angry. I only gave this movie a 3 out of 10 because I've seen The Hulk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this actually IS an INTELLECTAL movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>many people say this movie is not deep, not intellectual, whereas movies like The Matrix is. I loved The Matrix but I have to say that Resident Evil is very much intellectual in a different way. How often in life is it that our family members, friends, and relatives, seem like zombies? In a way, this movie says more about humanity and says it more realistically than The Matrix, because in this movie, the enemies are other people, and often in life our enemies are other people, sometimes the ones closest to us. Also, many times in life, a person who is right about something (for example, the guy who thought the earth was round when everyone else around him thought he was an idiot, or the people who wanted to abolish racism when 99% of the people around them were racist) may live in a society in which 90% of the other people attack him for it. This is like the zombies attacking the small group of main characters. The zombies are also very cruel, eating other people, and isn't this similar to how many people are against George Bush, but have absolutely no way of getting through to the people who support Bush how wrong they are? Are the people who support Bush, not like Zombies who have gone mad and cruel and flesh-eating, and who we seem unable to stop? Are people who support Bush not very blind and "mutated", as those zombies in the movie were? Is Bush himself not like the last monster in this movie, huge powerful and just plain nasty? This movie is so representative of real life that it's really just awesome. You may say, "well, tons of other movies with monsters aliens and vampires say the same thing", but you can say the same for The Matrix. Dozens of movies before The Matrix have criticized humanity in the same way The Matrix has, but The Matrix is special because it does it SO MUCH BETTER than other movies had. Resident Evil does the same in this area. Even though many movies in the past have monsters and vampires, Resident Evil and its series is the first movie (and movie series) which has as its basic premise the fact the thE ENTIRE FREAKIN' TOWN has turned into monsters. And this is how it is in real life in many ways. In previous movies, it was always where the number of monsters was less than or equal to the number of survivors. In this movie, 99% of the people in the setting are monsters. This is different from The Matrix, where 99% of the people are blind, not monsters who attack the the main characters. The rest are robots, and these do attack the main characters, but they are robots not people so this is actually less representative of real life in a way because it implies that negative things in life may stem from objects foreign to us (i.e. the robots), or may stem from ourselves (i.e. Neo in The Matrix is often told by the Oracle how much influence he himself has), but Resident Evil focuses on the fact that sometimes in life the greatest negativity comes from the people around you who seem to not only become blind like the people in The Matrix, but to have become cruel and heartless and soulless.</fullReview>

Out of the blue, all these so called human beings appear like in the "Night of the Living Dead", eating everyone in sight and leaving nothing on the bone. It did not take me very long to become completely disinterested and finished viewing the film with great disappointment.

		<shortDescription>This is Sci-Fi For the Cinematically Impaired.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have to thank the MTV and video game culture for bringing us the rapid-fire montage of seemingly unrelated images and cartoon-like sequences that came out of the AEON FLUX canon. We also have to give George A. Romero another handshake -- because of him the story of people turned into mindless, shuffling zombies whose sole intention it is to rip other people apart (and of course, always the lingering question: why not themselves and the healthy humans prevails, always without an answer) has become something of a mainstay even for more serious features (28 DAYS LATER...).So here we are in RESIDENT EVIL. Much like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, the aforementioned 28 DAYS LATER..., and a not-too-subtle nod to ALIENS, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and ALICE IN WONDERLAND, there is a viral plague released in the confines of an organization called The Hive which turns its corporate employees into (you guessed it) hollowed-up corporate employees. So predictable! Except there's a super-employee, call it the monster in the closet that every company of the likes of Enron has, and it's out for (you guessed it again) blood and guts. Which made me ponder, "Don't they feed this thing?" Of course not: being the product of greed, it always wants more, and Michael Douglas did say once upon a time in a much better movie, "Greed is good." Oh well, telling you more about this story is frankly, fruitless. Been there, done that, not particularly shocked when the shocks arrive. Now, into some interesting aspects. Being a product birthed from a video game, the appearance of a killer laser that operates (surprise) like it would in a video game, even changing into a grid. Why is it included? Oh... let me see... Oh, I can't think straight right now. But there's something else. The never-named Alice (Milla Jovovich, proving that acting is beyond her but looking smashing) and Matt (Eric Mabius) learn that there is a conspiracy. Cut to a nifty computer image as-seen from the outside of The Hive, then to them going back to where their friends are, being pursued by the zombified corporates. Where's the transition? Some neat touches, though. The use of what could be the ugliest soundtrack in movie history provides a boost to erstwhile predictable moments of terror. Some composition shots, such as the transition between the prologue to the Mansion where Milla emerges or when Milla, walking down a murderous hallway (the one with the laser with a mind of its own), is interposed with the image of scientists performing unnatural acts, bringing back "important details." The revelation of what we missed in the prologue emerging later on when one character's true motives are exposed.However, there is the saying that any film can be elevated into the levels of an instant classic with a good director with a strong hand. True. But again, this is a movie version of a video game and I'd like to know if there ever has been a (movie version of a video game) that has ever been more than vaguely adequate with a good dose of shrill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is inspired by the same named video game, so much inspired that the characters really have no more depth than those from the game. The true horror in this movie is that they manage to make some video game characters from actors, who are human being, are not they ? Desesperatly under the level of a good living dead movie. No humor, no surprise in an ultra-linear plot, just like a game with a start point and a game-over screen, just a little cheap twist about memory loss (not as good as Memento), a few scary moments OK but when i watch a movie i want more than a Luna Park feeling. No heart, i did not feel any emotion for any character, nothing matching Dawn of the Dead, or Day of the Dead from Romero. A pure vacuum feeling. Some nice fx like in Matrix, a blond haired girl who run a few steps on a wall, and what ? Avoid this void, honest people, there is not even some technical flaws to laugh at.</fullReview>

Alice in the film? damn!

Anderson didn't play the game I think.If you haven't play the game, I think this is a very amusing film with good horror scenes in it, a beautiful actress (why does she show her boobs? to get more viewers? crap!!) and some good action scenes.Conclusion: If you are a fan of the games, do not view the film. if you aren't a fan, please, go ahead and amuse yourselfNils</fullReview>

I hate when filmmakers do this to films, it seems so good and entertaining in the beginning and all but then something stupid pops up and ruins most of the movie for ya, for an example this movie. this movie should deserve better ratings then it should because not only did it have a better and more complicated story then most zombie films it lived up to its horrifying story. tip: I have seen the sequel to this movie (apocalypse) and it is one pile of crap, i recommend seeing the first one only and then stopping there because if u liked the first one u don't want to ruin the vibe by seeing that failure of a sequel. Most sequels are failures anyway :) .Other than the horrible cgi for that monster i give this movie an 8 for story,7.5 for acting,7.5 for suspense,6 for special effects and overall is 7.3</fullReview>

But when you put more emphasis in how the dudes are going to die and forget all about the plot in the middle of the movie, well that can't be right.Milla Jovovich saves this movie from the abyss, she's a great actress and I'm in love with her, so everything that she does seems great to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This contains minor spoilers) As a fan of action movies, as well as the zombie genre in particular, I was fairly excited to see this movie. Sadly, it makes no sense. The plot - if it could be called such a thing - is only briefly referenced, and the rest of the movie is people running from poorly-animated creatures, obnoxious music cues ("Let's take the stairs!" cue exciting, techno music for the ten seconds of climbing down stairs), and awkwardly-placed flashbacks. Poor acting from people who should know better, cheesy dialogue and short-sighted directing from Paul WS Anderson, who should but obviously doesn't. My favorite moment in the entire film is when our heroes are completely surrounded by zombies in a tunnel with no way out. Anderson wisely cuts to a shot of an unrelated empty hallway and cuts back to the characters having made some sort of miraculous escape.And of course, there's the ending, where the enjoyable Jason Isaacs makes a good-sport-style cameo in a rather pointless scene that doesn't appear to connect with anything we've just witnessed, including a creature that would make a Harryhausen stop-motion flick look like Lord of the Rings. Good job, all around. I'll avoid the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi!! I'm 13 years old and in spite of my age i'm a very big fan of the movie!Besides it's my favorite!The movie was excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!I loved it but i was disappointed with the ending of it due the fact of Matt(Eric Mabius)and Alice (Milla Jovovich)were separated and Matt became a monster...!I mean..., it's a sad ending... I think it would be a very cool ending if Alice and Matt staid together and in the second film the two of them fight together against the zombies, joined the other new characters!! But besides that it was really cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I loved the sequence and the actors, specially Eric Mabius and Milla!! I highly recommend it!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Think about it. Wasn't this movie supposed to be scary? The mansion was scary and Jill, Chris, Barry, and Wesker would have been prefect characters. Instead of the big, tough, stupid military losers. Resident Evil is about puzzles, traps, less zombies, and big monsters. Not hot girls, big guns, and loads of action. I still enjoyed this movie a little bit but its not Resident Evil. It would of great to see the big snake, the hunters,the tyrant, and the original characters. And the story would have been much better. The acting wasn't that great. The editing was horrible. I still had a little bit of fun with action scenes but with all the monsters looking as cheap as they did it took me out of the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice addition to the zombie genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film as a rental, it seemed pretty average. After multiple viewings via cable (it seems to be a favorite on HBO), my opinion has gone well up.The film does not necessarily have tons of scares, but plenty of suspense and action. I've always believed that Anderson has done a great job of creating isolation spaces, and this is no different.The acting is also decent, Michelle Rodriguez is not great, but let's face it is great to look at. I like Eric Mabius quite a bit, and Milla is as convincing as one might be with a supermodel kicking ass etc.All in all I'd recommend the film, however the sequel was another matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies in this genre. The research facility provides a nice and scary high-tech atmosphere. An excellent soundtrack by Marilyn Manson that really suits the environment. The story is definitely interesting and keeps you focused. Flawless acting.One of the few things I find bad about Resident Evil is the excessive amount of zombies towards the end of the movie. IMHO 'Monsters' should come unexpected and in limited amounts to make it more thrilling. The huge mutant monster towards the very end could possibly be left out of changed to give it a bit more credibility.I also find the Red Queen mainframe computer 'laser' protection system somewhat stupid but this is a minor defect.A similar scenery and feeling can be found in the game Half-Life, so if you enjoyed playing that you will probably like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul W.S. Anderson the director of Soldier and Mortal Kombat writes and directs yet another game to movie, this time its Resident Evil, the hit survival horror game.But the film is well Bad just like the sequel that followed it; its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper and really there is nothing scary in it except for some awful acting and lame special effects. This is why this is a forgettably film that has no lasting power and is already outdated while some good sci-fi horror film made in the 70's arnt. A sex scene between the 2 main female characters would have saved it- just kidding. Nothing could have saved this film as it is a film without interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and special effects. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing for fans of the RE video games.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the Resident Evil video games, and the movie disappointed me. When I first heard about it I thought it would revolve more around the video games. The only thing that the movie had to do with the games were the T-Virus and Umbrella. I only liked a few of the scenes that were in the movie, mainly the one when the Umbrella Special Forces were on their way to reboot the Red Queen and they entered this room where lasers killed them all in a matter of seconds. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I'd recommend renting it before you buy it. If you're also a fan of the games then this movie will most likely let you down, so don't get your hopes up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have been waiting to see this movie for long enough, and when i finally got round to seeing it, i wasn't let down. yeah sure there are many people out there who say that this was a waste and that the acting was bad! but what i say is, do you think you could actually do any better, the answer is no! i'm an actor so i should know, as far as i could see the acting was flawless and just what the movie needed, where the movie lacked something the acting always made up for it. Especially if they had such an actor as Martin Crewes, i mean he's better than most Hollywood actors! The zombies were better than most movies and from a actors point of view it was a quite artistically directed. anyways, that's my opinion. still, this movie did the game justice. Although it would have been a lot better and more impressive if it had been given a larger budget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, this movie has the same strikes against it as did HP3. Movies are not literal adaptations of the source material. It really is a good movie. I love the games, but a single game can make about three movies, and nobody has the stamina or patience to sit through all that. Also copying the games to a fault would have brought in too much hackneyed cliché material.Would I have loved to have seen Leon, Wesker, or the Redfields? Yes, but this cast didn't disappoint me in the least. Milla was awesome, and Michelle was out of sight, and nobody can tell me that that ending was not amazing.Yes, 28 Days Later was good, but in my opinion, Resident Evil was far more chilling.It gave the eerie feel and the tension of the games. I didn't need much more than that, and it's not as if this were supposed to be Aliens or anything. Mortal Kombat and Super Mario Bros. were nothing to rave about either. At least I can say that I got scared by this.</fullReview>

Then again I am not a very big game freak, but still. The movie was one of the most interesting I've seen. yet the film maker seemed to think it was a good idea to have Alice in a tight red dress all the way through.... it was very strange, but I should say I would admire anybody who could stand wearing that dress and those shoes and still kick those zombies ass. :) I hope they make a resident evil three in fact! =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil is the best!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first the movie I was amazed by Michelle Rodriguez's acting. I had never seen her before in any other films, but after this film I was a fan and bought every film she was in. One of the best scenes is when they are in a glass room and then suddenly lasers go through the room slicing and dicing the people inside, I thought the special effects were wicked especially when you see Colin Salmon's character falling to pieces in the reflection of the door (I was a bit freaked out by that part). Another scene where Alice (Milla Jovovich) is being chased by the dogs and she shoots them and there is a close up of the 9mm Umbrella Corporation bullet falling to the ground and when she runs up the wall and kicks the dog (totally wicked!) The dogs were pretty scary at first because I have a Doberman and she was sitting next to me while I was watching the film! A scene where Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) is 'out of it' on the train near the end and Alice thinks she is dead, well I started crying which is pretty embarrassing but I thought the 'moment'was quite emotional. I have watched this movie over and over (about 50 times not joking) and I have listened to the commentary which is great and pretty funny too and I bought a huge Resident Evil poster with Michelle's autograph on it! Everyone must see this film although it wasn't exactly the scariest film made. I'm a huge fan of the games and I thought the film took some really good parts of the game and made it their own and I thought it worked well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't even like horror movies in the first place, but this movie is so great, it beats the odds and turns out to be a fantastic always fun to watch non stop action thriller. Marilyn Manson's score is simply the best score ever and will keep you glued to your seat looking sideways and feeling your heart beat race. I understand the fans of the video game mostly don't like this movie but I guess they failed to realize that the story of this movie is about how the accident that caused the infestation of zombies happened, it's a PRE-QUEL to the first Resident Evil game. The director actually took the time to explain (commentaries on the DVD) about how he came up with this movie's story - as he did do this movie because he was a fan of the video game in the first place. Also keep in mind that as a movie maker, he couldn't make a movie exclusively for the fans of the game and I guess all are forced to agree that if he did a movie intended exclusively for the game players that would really limit the audience - and I am betting that if any of the hard critics of this movie where to make one, they would end up also realizing there is no way one can make a movie to such restricted audience. I sure hope Paul W. S. Anderson is coming up with lots of sequels to this movie. With that said, sit back (if you can) and enjoy this wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What had the potential to be the greatest zombie movie ever is let down by poor studio choices, distancing itself as far from the games as possible. However, it remains a solid action movie if not the terrifying, emotional, complex horror it could have been. Admittedly, truly bringing the game to life for a two hour movie would be an extremely difficult process, and those making it could easily have made a mess, mangling the characters and story. It has always been my opinion that the games should be made into feature length TV movies, say 2 two hour episodes for each game. This way everything would fit in, and the budget would not need to be great. Of course this is just a pipe dream, and what we have is not as bad as some make out, with many good points.The film starts with an outbreak at the Umbrella facility. Chaos ensues, and everyone appears to die. We then meet Alice, a woman inside an eerily empty mansion at night. She does not know who she is, and only has flashbacks of her life. Soon a group of marines enter, assuming she is a civilian, and along with the other survivors they try to work out what happened to the facility. They soon find out that everyone has been turned into zombies by an evil computer programme and they soon worry about how to escape. Though Alice is not what she first appears to be, and neither are some other survivors.The main problem with the film is that there is little fear created, and it is insanely watered down, with little gore. Fans of the series are used to high tension, jumps, threat and bloodshed, but this is simply not present here. Also, most of the marines are wiped out in a laser room, and only one is killed by a zombie. The licker effects are OK, but there are no Hunters, Spiders or Tyrants. As well as this, most of the marines get small parts, look similar and we fail to feel anything for them. Now the good points; Johovich is very good in the role, and there are a few decent twists, like the game. The way her mysterious past is revealed is clever and well-balanced against the escape. Howver the clear star is Michelle Rodriguez, giving an excellent, strong performance akin to Vasquez in Aliens. The action scenes are dealt with well, especially those involving the dogs, and the lighting and camera-work is good. The film makes a good attempt at creating an original story, and the direction is sound. Of course, us fans would have loved to see Wesker's antics and our favourite STARS members being picked off. Maybe one day the games will make truly great movies, but why complain when we still have the games. Obviously a let down for fans, but still a pretty good actioner.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice deviation from the games</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of the Resident Evil vodkas. Because of that I was really looking forward to the movie. I hear Romero wanted to do something which stuck more faithfully to the plot of the games. That would have been preferable to Andersons film but thats not to say this isn't still enjoyable.The plot revolves around a virus which has the ability to reanimate dead corpses and was used to develop hideous bioweapons. When the virus escapes, the underground complex known as the Hive is sealed and a special team is sent in to investigate.Andersons film is at first nothing like the game. The original took place in a Mansion and there was no character called Alice at all who is the principal character here. However there are enjoyable references to the games such as the Licker creature which appeared in Resident Evil 2 (VG) and stalks the cast throughout the film. There is also a nice reference at the end to the Nemesis program which takes centre stage in the second film and third game.Its not a startlingly original horror film, or a film which takes the baton and refines a formula beyond what existed originally. But for fans of the games it is an interesting and enjoyable film, and that was what was intended more or less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I've played, and enjoyed, one of the games (RE2), I didn't really fancy this movie, certainly didn't make the effort to see it at the cinema, but a friend offered the DVD to lend...This is a superb bit of fun; I'm not sure what was in the first game, but the memory loss idea is great: you don't know who the good guys are, and who the bad guys are until about half way through, and the fact that they don't know either adds real suspense.Certain scenes reveal their game origins; there's a scene with some zombie dogs that is both chillingly atmospheric (like RE2 was), and exciting, as the situation keeps getting worse every time you think it's over! The pace never really lags, and yet it's not overwhelming.I can't really fault the acting, given that this is an action movie with not much scope for performance; no-one is wooden, and everyone seems to be fully 'into' their role.The special effects are convincing, the zombies look great, and the CGI effects still stand up, given that this is now a 3-year old film. And, of course, Milla looks great, especially when she's kicking zombie head! In summary, if you like zombie movies, like good-looking female action heroes, and want some not-too-mindless escapism with a few little twists to keep it interesting, you'll love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the best game adaptation movie I have ever seen. Tell the truth I can't see why so many people did give a pretty negative review about this movie. But after you watch it for yourself you would find that it is not like the game (I love the game) but there a lot of resemblance in it between the two. After all it can't be exactly like the game.I think the movie is pretty cool from the very start, though you might not know what going on in the first but you will, later. The action sequence that you will see is great and very much convincing and even though the casting is pretty weird it not that bad at all.I think it is a very good sci-fi movie that should not be missed.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-)</fullReview>

Barely looks like it.I personally became a big fan of Michelle since this film.The story was great and would make a great game too, I hope they do one though.The main downside to it was that there's not much for the non-fans.

		<fullReview>RESIDENT EVIL (2002) cast: Milla Jovovich, Eric Mabius, Michelle Rodriguez, James Purefoy.plot: Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in her mansion with total amnesia only to be taken down to a secret underground laboratory called "The Hive" which is part of the Umbrella Corporation, which she is supposedly an employee of. She goes down with a group of paramilitary commandos including Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) and Matt (Eric Mabius), in order to shut down The Hive and protect the world from the spreading T-Virus, which turns people into the walking dead. Alice must fight for her life along with the others to battle zombies, mutant dogs, and strange creatures called "Lickers".the good: Having never played the famous videogames, I went into this movie with an open-mind not expecting it to be like, or not like, the videogames. I was basically expecting some crazy zombie action fun! And that's exactly what I got! Lots of action, zombies and more types of fun! Alice is a very interesting character, someone who was never in the games and is unwillingly brought into a war. This also has a very claustrophobic setting, in the laboratory, they're locked in and can't escape until the place is shutdown. It was also a nice introduction to the trilogy and basically set the standard.the bad: I didn't get much of the characters as I should have. Alice and Matt were cool, and so was Rain but she was basically just like all of Rodriguez's roles.All the other commandos all blended together and I could barely tell them apart.8/10</fullReview>

I like the whole idea of Rain's death. I don't like one's death because it was too early and it was not well deserved. The poor guy certainly did not deserve to be cut into mincemeat. I think J.D. probably deserved just what he got because he was kind of a jerk. The lesser commandos like the medic and the other two guys that were killed by the red queen were not on enough to pass judgement on. Kaplan deserved to live. At least his death was quick and painless, unlike Rain, who suffered much. The second movie would have been so awesome with Rain, Kaplan and One.

		<fullReview>A virus is purposely leaked in a subterranean complex known as the "Hive." A computer, called the Red Queen, shuts off the complex and kills everyone in it. The virus brings the dead back to life as flesh-eating zombies lying in wait as a group of military police and one other break in to shut the computer down and restore order if possible. The plot of this film is very complex and muddled. Throw in some unrealistic action scenes, bad dialog, and some poor actors and you have the heart of Resident Evil. I have totally no familiarity with the video game, and I think this movie travels very little from the mindset of that venue. The film definitely has a nice look to it. The special effects are good as well, but the action driven plot moves way too quickly for the viewer to internalize the story and get to know the characters. The most interesting characters die very quickly and soon we are left with cliché-drawn actors that flip up walls and use leg kicks to the zombie's heads. The "witty" reparte between characters is so hackneyed and ridiculous that we get lines like "when I get out of here I am going to get laid." The line is said by a woman having had her hand bitten into and just hearing that anyone that even had a scratch from the dead would turn into the same. Michelle Rodriguez played this role with NO conviction at all. Milla Jovovitch gives her typically blank face performance as the female lead bouncing up walls and performing one "kick-ass" stunt after another. Ho...Hum. Director Paul Anderson does have some flair for directing and some scenes are particularly well choreographed (the scene with the laser I thought was quite innovative). If you are out looking for a film with lots of action, lots of blood, and lots of special effects like giant mutated dogs and some creature with a big tongue, not to mention the hordes of dead, and have little need of a coherent plot, decent acting, and sparkling, crisp dialog - not to mention some good old-fashioned common sense - then I recommend Resident Evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one makes a movie based on a video game and assumes that viewers will be looking for something from Stanley Kubrick. Instead, one would expect the film to reflect the style and excitement of the original game, while bringing something more to the table.I am not a "Resident Evil" game player so I cannot discuss whether the film was true to the spirit of the game. However, from what I've seen of the game, I sure does look like a close match. I can certainly express my complete enjoyment with the film.Even though some of the twists and turns are predictable, they're still effective! You know the dead guy is going to open his eyes, yet it still startles you! That's a credit to the mood created by the film through effective lighting and sound, and outstanding costume and set creation. Even though you're shown virtual schematics of the setting repeatedly, the story takes you so quickly through the setting that you can't keep up and you're left confused and bewildered as to where the characters are, adding to the suspense.Milla was fantastic as the heroin.

Finding out that marital status isn't all it's cracked up to be would be a big factor, but it is. That trap the computer did was awesome, and the virus that spread out in the place was something too. At the end I would know that Alice would be ready to face another challenge being thrown to her. And she'll just get that!

		<fullReview>This is a "must see" for anyone who considers themself a "gamer" (especialy RE fans). Most games make horrible movies, this one finally got it right (well, to be fair, the Finally Fantasy movie was good also). Plenty of suspense, a few "jumps", and a lot of things that people will recognize from the game.As long as you realize this is a live interpretation of the game universe, you should really enjoy it. Those who aren't fans of the game, may not like it as much as it's only an "ok" action/horror flick. (I wouldn't classify it as horror, but that's because I watch a lot of horror, and this just isn't scary.)Oh, and I couldn't say enough good things about the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on the game, but just couldn't live up to the idea...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I own the original DVD (not deluxe edition) of this movie. But, sometimes I contemplate on keeping the movie or selling it to a used cd shop. Based on the survival horror series Resident Evil (Biohazard), the only 2 main themes that came from the game were the zombies and the Umbrella Corporation. I'm not real picky about converting games to motion pictures , but this movie's idea wasn't executed well. George Romero's dead trilogy (Night Of The Living Dead, Dawn Of The Dead, Day Of The Dead) set the standard for survival horrors, and they are the best of their genre. Even with all the SFX and technology we have, this movie could not live up to its hype.In my opinion, the acting isn't really an important element in these types of movies. But, Michelle Rodriguez's character just didn't do it for me. Living off of her girlfight fame is long overdue. Another female character would've been suitable. Paul Anderson is known for his visually stunning sets, but he has trouble executing his idea for some reason (ex. Soldier, Alien vs. Predator). What's going on with Paul? Colin Salmon does what he can in his limited time within the movie. He has a very commanding performance, and he is very charismatic on screen. I think he should've been the main lead. Milla Jovovich is alright, but I think Colin would've done a better job.I love the horror and gore scenes from earlier zombie movies. I'm not saying that this movie has to have an all out gore fest, but act like a R-rated movie. With the exception of a few scenes, this could've been PG-13 (Alien Vs. Predator!!!). Come on Paul!!*SPOILER*: The scene where Michelle Rodriguez gets bit on the hand was too simple. Michelle's character shoots the zombie after getting bit on the hand. Too Simple!! Come On!! There were no bullet holes in the zombie. The audience was deprived because of quick edit shots.*END OF SPOILER*Can somebody turn up the gore factor please?!! Zombie movies usually have a high gore factor. This was just an average action movie. It could've done better given the fact that there were a lot of elements to work with. RE2 didn't improve, and I've lost hope in the movie series. Dawn Of The Dead, both original and 2004 version, are better movies. Final Judgment: **/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After a classic first half hour this is done in by crappy monsters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story of the walking dead in a secret government base is very disappointing. In all honesty I expected to despise this film and then was shocked when the first half hour leading up to the zombies, was a tight, scary horror film of the highest order.And then the zombies show up and it all falls into the toilet. The problem with this movie is that the monsters are so badly acted and so awful looking it takes away from any tension because you are laughing at them. Such is the problem with most post-Dawn of the Dead films, the people playing zombies over act and destroy the mood. Chalk it up to awful direction, or non direction of the crowds of zombies.If you can get past the laughter this is a good film. Many people I've told about the laughable monsters, liked the film when they saw it themselves, I on the other hand can't be as forgiving because I loved the opening that much.Try it, but expect to laugh more than you scream.5 out of 10 (purely because of the zombie, the rest is pretty good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie of 2002,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to go see the movie the same day that it came out, and today I'm going to go see the second part as well. I found the movie to be completely awesome!!!!!! No, it did not have many similarities to the game, but I think that is what made it great! The setting was the same, but if you wanted to see a replication of the game, then replay the game. That's my opinion. I believe that adding different characters was a very good idea. The best part is that they added the dogs and the licker. I can't wait to see part two now!!!! Resident Evil was really matched with the game. Though Chris and the other Star members were not in there, they couldn't have made a better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" is one of my all-time favorite movies. It ranks up there with the "Matrix" trilogy, the "Bourne" series ("Bourne Identity" and "Bourne Supremacy"), and "Kill Bill" volumes 1 and 2. As soon as I got out of the theater after seeing it for the first time, I knew I was going to buy it as soon as it hit DVD.It is definitely a very "cool" movie. I liked how the plot developed. It didn't just go in shootin' up everything. It had a story to tell, and told it well. The characters are cool. The music is great! It is well placed within the movie and adds to the atmosphere of the film. I really liked the look and atmosphere of the film. There is an uneasy and spooky feel. There are some classic moments that help make it a unique zombie movie. Plus, the explanation of why there are zombies is better than any other one from the other zombie movies.The "brief sexuality/nudity" is not graphic or tasteless. It actually helps with the story. Plus, it is very "brief." The gore is not excessive.It is a pretty spooky movie the first time you see it. It remains "cool" every time you watch it.Since "Resident Evil" is so "cool", I am extremely excited about its sequel, "Resident Evil: Apocalypse."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the best zombie movie I've ever seen. Even though the movie doesn't have any characters from the games it was still a great movie. The movie is based on the games. Paul W.S. Anderson did a wonderful job on this movie. The Licker is the coolest creature in the movie. This movie scared me the first time I saw it in theaters. The movie's zombies even look like real zombies you can't get that out of Dawn Of The Dead or another zombie movie. I loved this movie and I always was a fan of Resident Evil. Now I'm even a bigger fan since I saw Resident Evil on the big screen. Hopefully Paul will make more Resident Evil movies. I can watch this movie again and again and not get bored with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit to not being a fan of horror movies, zombie movies, etc. I get easily scared by movies (pathetic, but true). I didn't sleep for months after seeing The Relic several years back. That's why I thought it was pretty sad that Resident Evil only had one scene that freaked me out, and that was the people stuck in the elevator having to listen to the screaming of the other people in the falling elevator (and the crash when it hit the ground) just before theirs fell. It wasn't jump-out-of-my-seat frightening, but it definitely gave me chills. The rest of the movie was pathetic and I laughed at the licker. When even I'm not scared, it's not worth a horror genre fan's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil (2002) is a movie that's loosely based on the zombie killing video game series. If you're going to make a movie based upon a video game at least play it before you decide to write and direct a movie based on it. I've seen several Japanese zombie flicks that are not based on the game that are more truer to the original source than this movie. Leave it up to Paul W. Anderson to take a brilliant concept and ruin it by making a movie that is so unlike the game. By itself it's a decent movie. You can take Resident Evil out of the title and it wouldn't make a difference. This movie wasn't that very good to be labeled Resident Evil. The brain dead suits at Capcom made a huge mistake when they let George A. Romero go and hired someone who's never made a zombie flick. Oh well, that's their problem.Back to the movie. How can you make a zombie movie with sparse views of head shots? I don't know but the makers of this movie manage to. The only thing worth while about this film are the first appearance of the zombies, the music and Milla Jovovich. Other than that it's a complete waste of time. Go out and watch Junk, Stacy or Wild Zero. At least you'll have some fun.For Zombie completest only.</fullReview>

There is just a bit too much unintentional comedy in the film, the whole seriousness of the tone just adds in that factor.Not one of the best movies of Milla Jovovich</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I want to go see it when it came out and a friend of theater let me see for free and thank God. Although "Resident Evil" was entertaining to an extent it was also very laughable, and not "Bloody Fantastic" and someone said it's "Bloody Idiotic" is more like it.The first big thing is that the movie DOES NOT FOLLOW THE GAME, not even half of it, the only part they got right is the zombies and virus but that's it. Speaking of that the zombie effects and actors are utterly pathetic. I haven't seen Zombies this cheap since George Romero's "Dawn Of the Dead".This all considered it was downhill from there, but entertaining. However, not even the real characters from the game are here: Claire Redfield, Chris Redfield, etc. Not a damn one.Then at the end of the film the writers desperately try to tie in the "Nemesis" game of Resident Evil 3, with this. Doesn't work.However, this cheap ending is also basically to an extent the same ending as "Matrix Reloaded".What a surprise, a movie loaded with great special effects with no story. Haha.Don't bother wasting money on DVD either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, people have to realize that not all Video games are stupid."Resident Evil" (the game) had a very interesting and atmospheric story, with believable characters and an exciting plot. The Movie however, distorted EVERYTHING into a cheap sci-fi movie.Had they chosen the same setting as the game, the movie would've been better AND cheaper (as they wouldn't have to use all the cheap cgi/sci-fi stuff)Don't blame Video games and their stories (which are interesting in many cases) for the work of sub-par Directors such as Paul Anderson (which quite frankly, I still don't know how people let this guy make movies).As soon as Hollywood start taking a serious approach to Video game Material, as it did in "X-Men", we will see a wave of good Video game-Inspired films, and as long as the Directors and Crew are competent, we'll be in for a treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A SEQUEL?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen worse movies than this, but not too many. This is probably the worst video-game movie I have seen(though I haven't seen very many). The acting is really bad, the "action" is slow and there's a lot of mindless violence. SPOILER ALERT The only good thing about the film, Michelle Rodriguez, Rain, ends up dying about 3/4 of the way through the film, and it just gets worse from there. Even the very end of the film seemed kind of...unsatisfying. The virus has reached the surface, apparently everyone's a zombie. The only non-zombie around, Alice, terribly played by Milla Jovovich (sp?) cocks a rifle-- roll credits. END SPOILERI know I haven't made reference to my title yet. I see they are making a SEQUEL to this piece of trash. Did it really do so well as the box office that they feel it necessary to hurt us again? What did we ever do to them? When the sequel, Resident Evil: Apocalypse comes out in 2004, I'd only see it if someone paid me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It just wasn't that good. It has slight similarities to the video game series but not enough to call it a truly faithful adaptation. Milla Jovovich gets a plus rating here, as well as Michelle Rodriguez, even though she plays the same role here as she did in "Fast and the Furious". You know, the tough, take-no-nonsense chick. Blah. I don't know, I think my beef with the flick is that it just could've been so much more in the right hands. I'm not a big Paul Anderson fan but I don't bash him either. He shows promise when he wants (i.e. Event Horizon, though the film itself is just as lackluster as Resident Evil) and I guess there was the possibility that he could've made this into a respectful fright fest. I think what happened is that his style got in the way, turning what should have been a gothic, creepy zombie flick into a metallic, overstylized piece of celluloid. I liked some of what he offered but it didn't outweigh what I had problems with. The laser beam sequence was actually pretty good. I feel that if this had been given to George Romero (as it should've been) to do, it would've been what it was supposed to. I don't know what happened there except for some problem with creative differences between him and the producers or something. Oh, well. I can't help but feel disappointed about the movie, having played through several of the Resident Evil videogames. It's watchable if you're looking for a no-brainer action flick with some cute chicks and interesting action sequences. What you see is what you get! RATING: ** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Game on Celluloid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, a film about a game made by people who actually played the RE games. Paul Anderson made an intelligent move by insisting everyone in his cast and crew to either play the game or watch videos of people playing the game to get a feel for what he wanted to capture. Not to mention the main members of the cast were RE fanatics, at last a game-to-film that keeps very consistent and has the same feel of the game itself.But Resident Evil wasn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination so some of the flaws carried over. For instance, a creature that debuted in RE2--'the licker' who did have a classic introduction, but the damn thing itself was a lousy rip-off of a much more intimidating beast known as 'the hunter'. But the hunter's appearance was far less impressive, which usually left most gamers underestimating the thing. Two seconds later you're restarting your game, vowing not to let another hunter breath. The last boss was nothing compared to two hunters; no questions asked.Also Resident Evil's trademark cheesy lines, a few outrageous scenes (who kicks a dog in the mouth and sends it through a window, rendering it unconscious?) But hey, you expect a certain level of cheese with horror . .. I mean hell, every Friday the 13th is 100% cheesy and it's one of the stronger series in terms of fanbase (as much as I hate to admit that.)Paul Anderson brings the claustrophobic, creepy, yet high tech atmosphere he provided Event Horizon with into Resident Evil. Once again using a great deal of subtleties until the last half of the film. As he said in the commentary, `This is a movie about Resident Evil, you know you're going to see zombies so you don't have to show them up front and right away.' Which better builds the tension, because the whole time we don't see the Zombies, we know they're somewhere, and we know they're coming.Alfred Hitchcock is quoted as saying, `A bomb under the table goes off-that's surprise. A bomb under the table, and it doesn't go off-that's suspense.' One you can come back to, and still get a similar feeling. The other, once you know it's there it leaves you empty ever after.Marco Beltrami and Marylyn Manson both surprised me by providing a tolerable score. Beltrami breaks from his typical style, which I don't care for, to capture the sound and feel of the RE games. Not a bad score to listen to while watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the years of watching horror films and seeing how lousy and contrived and cliche they have become, I went into RE assuming it was going to suck because I knew the movie wasn't based on the first few games. I was actually stunned at how much I enjoyed RE. Yeah, it took a lot of liberties from the games, but it was very close to the story line and actually leads into the story lines from the games. Anderson did a good job of translating the main game elements (a secluded mansion, an underground lab, a viral outbreak, a mysterious pharmaceutical company and an employee that reports to somebody on the outside) and managed to wrap it all into one fresh, suspenseful entity with some nice editing and an energetic score. There's been a lot of complaints that the movie has ripped off a lot of films, but what horror/action movie hasn't ripped off other movies? And why start attacking here? Besides, horror films weren't made to to win Oscars and shouldn't be critiqued in this manner. Resident Evil is a fun, entertaining film. And that's all that really matters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing to a Great Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the game series since it was first released on Playstation, and a knowledge of story--- I don't know what happened to this film. The movie starts off with promise, nice little exposition, and a state of confusion... but the real confusion comes in when the actual plot starts. Not to give parts of the movie away, but the character developement was "eh." Really didn't care for anyone to live or die. The zombie effects were a poor, by just giving them contacts, and painting their skin a bit blue tone. I didn't get the same chill from these zombies, compared to the ones in the Video Game. A lot of the connection to scenes (maybe deleted footage?), but people went from point A to D, without explaining how they got past the zombies in B and C. The film would have made me happy if they would have ended it at a certain point, but they had to go on to say "Sequal". Highlights though, include a "nice" score, and great sets. If your looking for it to be close to the game experience, just play the Remake for GameCube. If your looking for a zombie chiller, watch some of George A. Romero films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing for sure could be said about RESIDENT EVIL. It is not special at all. The special effects are cheap as cheap can get, which makes one wonder "why bother" when the zombies were ripping off Romero's zombie flicks. And let us not forget the ever present video soundtrack blaring at precisely the wrong times. The games were far better.A virus is let loose in an underground corporate construction called the Hive. An army swat team has the sense to kidnap three people suffering amnesia and send them down to shut off the Hive's computer, which murdered all the employees down there.As the tradition with all video game movies go (SUPER MARIO BROS., DOUBLE DRAGON, etc.), this movie sucks. But it is actually better than the ones previously mentioned and any other video game movie in recent memory. The advertised fight between Milla and the dogs was the ultimate disappointment though, and nothing really made RESIDENT EVIL the movie stand out from RESIDENT EVIL/BIOHAZARD the video game. Play the real thing instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While i don't quite share the enthusiasm of the previous reviewer, I will have to say that this movie takes me back to the good ol' days of gorey zombie flicks. You even have to shoot them in the head in this movie, too. I was never a huge fan of the games, but I am a huge horror movie fan. Yes, i love Night of the Living Dead (and no matter what anyone says, i also loved the other two movies in the Dead "Trilogy," so to speak). The best horror flick to come out so far in 2002 if you ask me. Jason X was good if you're into horror flicks, but it was more sci-fi horror.Keep in mind that this movie is directed by Anderson, who also directed "Event Horizon," hands down the best horror flick of 1997. Whether you like the games or not, or even know of the games for that matter, you'll like this movie if you're a fan of old-school zombie flicks (can anyone say "Pete Jackson splatter-comedy a-la Bad Taste" or "Re-Animator?"), in spite of the fact that this one has a definite sci-fi/action twist to it. This one also leaves room for a sequel without it being hokey (as opposed to most other horror sequels, aside from the Halloween series :) )....and if you're wondering I have to say that the best horror flick of 2001, beyond the shadow of a doubt, is "Jeepers Creepers."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better Than Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this might be one of those brainless action movies that I'm used to watching. Having this be one of the "video game" films didn't make me expect much. What a surprise! The writing is excellent, especially for a movie of this genre (horror action). The acting was a tad cheesy with a couple of the supporting cast, but overall, the acting was good. Whoever wrote the screenplay for this should get an award for doing an unbelievable job with material that could have easily become bad. The editing with the flashbacks made this movie a pleasure to watch. Well, lots of gore, too, but it was partly a horror film. Don't sell this flick short - you'll be in for a pleasant shock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gore nor horror need not apply *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one the most mediocre Zombie films ever made and one of the more mediocre and predictable so called horror films since the "Scream" era started. None of the heroes in the film had any connection or humanity whatsoever and I didn;t care that they died. Michelle Rodriguez' character for example is utterly hateful and her death was welcome. None of the characters showed any fear and thus disrespected the theme of horror. Milla Jovavich's character is a kung fu expert? Why? Did the movie tell us? No, and because it filmmakers are to politically correct and gutless to show a woman in peril for the sake of not offending sensitive women today, this film fails and so does Milla's character.The zombie makeup was suprisingly well done, but what is a zombie movie without gore? Even George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD had some gore that was extreme for its era. Speaking of which, Romero was originally slated to direct RE, but I guess producers felt he would have ended up making a better zombie film and thus canned him. Most of the gore was implied, but it fails. People would point out the TEXAS CHAINSAW technique where the gore was implied, but it works in TEXAS. For example, the girl hanging on the hook. We don't see the hook go into her back, but we do see her hanging painfully and struggling from the hook. A poor example of implied gore in RE is when the girl in the elevator in the begining has her head chopped off, we only see her point of view and then BAM- screen turns to black. Huh? Were the filmmakers too scared to do a zombie movie? It seems like it.The ending is a perfect example of how failed the writers were in their attempt to present something interesting and epic and instead give us a bland conclusion, where Milla walks out into the world to see desolation, burning streets, and no humans. It would have been an excellent opportunity to show a horde of zombies surrounding Milla, from all angles, throughout the city, and end the movie right there, but these are filmmakers who know absolutely nothing about horror, just popcorn moments and ALIENS ripoff techniques. A truly overrated film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good for a zombie movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me start by saying that I am not a huge fan of the video games (or zombie films for that matter). I own the three games for the playstation, but I could never really get into them.As for the movie, I thought it was fairly entertaining. It had it's good points and low points, like most movies. The story is nothing terribly intellectual, but it's interesting. There are a lot of things you just have to accept and take for granted in the film. Such as why on earth they would have created this virus in the first place, and what on earth that crazy dog beast thing was! But, ok, I'll accept it.The only major complaint I have about the film is the music in the film. I love type of music that they used in the film, in fact I own a lot of the music that was used in the film, but it seemed to me that most of the time the music was just overwhelming and out of place.The special effects in this film were surprisingly good. I wasn't really impressed with the trailers for this film, but seeing them in context made it much better.The acting is nothing to get excited about. It's good, but it's a zombie movie, so you can't really expect great performances. Milla Jovovich looked really good in this film, and there are even a few times where Michelle Rodriguez cracked a smile and looked pretty. She always seems to have scowl on her face, and her eyes are always up in her eyebrows. The only other cast member I'd heard of was Eric Mabius, he did just fine with his role. Although, I did recognize Colin Salmon from the 2 (soon to be 3) most recent James Bond films. He did a fine job as well.I would think that anyone that likes zombie movies and those type of films would like this one. Also, if you're into gory films, you may want to check this out. I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen. There is no character development whatsoever so you don't care for any of the characters. You may actually find yourself laughing when people you are supposed to care for die. The only reason to watch this film is for the brief flashes of nudity of the lovely Mila. Otherwise this is a 2/10 at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>** out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After movies like Super Mario Bros, Double Dragon and Tomb Raider showed that it is not easy to convert video games to the big screen this movie comes along and prooves that even more true. Great special effects can't save this mixed bag of action, horro and sci-fi that is neither exciting, scarey nor innovative. The film slightly succeeds on a "kick ass" level due to a nice performance from Michelle Rodriguez, but everyone else seems somewhat miscast. A weak story and even weaker execution make the film often confusing and it seems like the filmmakers expected everyone seeing this movie to have already played the game. This film probably wouldn't have even survived the first weeks at the box office without its namesake but because the game is so popular and the end setting itself up for this, I am sad to report that there will more than likely be a sequal. I just hope they get it right the second time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" which is the highly anticipated big screen adaptation of the popular video game series of the same name, is a very well done horror film. The story surrounds a rescue team that is sent to a large underground facility to find out the cause of a mysterious accident that occurred there. When they first arrive, they discover three survivors: a young woman (Milla Jovovich) who is suffering from amnesia and whose name I don't think is ever mentioned, a guy named Matt (Eric Mabius) who claims to be a cop, and another guy named Spence (James Purefoy). When they finally get into the Hive, which is the name of the large underground facility, they discover that no one is there, or so it seems. Soon the team members begin getting picked off one at a time by bloodthirsty zombies, mutated dogs, and a hideous monstrosity that has an incredibly long tongue. I must say that this film is above all things, very entertaining. I've never played the video games the film was based on, so I really can't be sure how accurate the movie is. The acting is all right, but it isn't good nor is it bad. The movie does maintain a constant level of creepiness, which is good. I must say that "Resident Evil" does keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. NOTE: One thing I do want to point out to gore fans is that this movie is no where near as gory as you may think it is. I was pretty disappointed by that. I mean a zombie movie, especially one like "Resident Evil" should be dripping with bloody violence and gore, but it isn't. I really like the fact that Paul Anderson (who directed another movie adaptation of a popular video game, "Mortal Kombat", as well as a previous horror film "Event Horizon") directed this film. I love both of those movies. I really don't see why so many people hated "Mortal Kombat". That is probably the only movie adaptation of a video game that up until this film, is really worth watching. "Event Horizon" while it wasn't a perfect horror film, should have almost certainly pleased any sci-fi fan. That was a creepy movie right there, despite its flaws. However, where "Event Horizon" failed as a horror movie, Paul Anderson makes up for it here in "Resident Evil". A lot people claim that Milla Jovovich is hot (seeing that she reveals almost everything in this movie is worth the $20 for the DVD), but I don't really think she's that hot. Personally, I prefer Michelle Rodriguez over her any day.</fullReview>

The plot is thin and Michelle Rodriguez has some bad lines. Milla is good as the gun-toting *ss kicking hot chick. FINAL VERDICT: If you like hot chicks kicking *ss, this is the movie for you.

		<fullReview>As a *very* big fan of the games I had to see this.I knew it would be tripe, and it was. The acting was dreadful, the action wasn't particularly exciting and the zombies looked unintentionally hilarious. In places it was boring too, with a distinct lack of chemistry between any actors and poor 'one liners'. They went for a serious movie and came up with a joke. Romero's screenplay got him sacked and they came up with this instead?As for the actual linkage between the games and the movie, well it was sparse. There were definitely similarities in places, but not particularly good ones. None of the characters from the games are here which is a huge gamble. Overall, if you're a fan of the games, see this because you'll want to - but be warned that it's terrible.A number of 'patrons' actually left half way through. I was tempted to do the same but thought better of it. On a side note, the certification in UK gave this a 15? What does it take to get a an 18?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best computer game to movie transfers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start off with where I'm coming from on this one: I haven't played the game. I know a little about it but I'm coming at this movie from a movie viewer's perspective not a video game player's perspective.Well it's a computer game to movie adaptation so expectations are not running high, given the travesties this usually produces. We'll just sit back and await the simple plot to be explained in the first 5 minutes, watch the CGI bad guys get cut down by the good guys and, after the fight with the big bad boss at the end, watch the heroine and hero walk off into the sunset in victory ... err, well "No" actually!A swift overview of the film, avoiding any major spoilers, has the evil Umbrella Company ? developing bio weapons and the like in a huge underground facility called "The Hive". The Hive is controlled by Red Queen (a computer with hologram, personality and voice based on the designer's daughter), which has gone psycho and killed everyone. In response a company SWAT team, armed to the teeth, have been sent in via the secret 'mansion entrance' to shut it down aided by their two operatives who guarded the entrance (both of whom have lost their memories due to being stunned by a nerve gas with that side effect) and a policeman who was present at the mansion when they arrived. In they go so let the movie commence ... with us, of course, knowing that one of those bio weapons is loose so they'll be facing more than just a computer ...Obviously I'm not going to tell you that the plot was intricate and complex, that the acting and dialogue was academy award stuff and that there was no sex and violence.With regard to the plot? It was actually well developed throughout the film from the original premise by quite clever use of the lead characters' memories returning as time passed, adding new twists the more they remember. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this engaged me by revealing a new facet each time you thought you knew it all. The fact that some people have accused there of being too little plot while other have talked about too much plot development before the main action kicks in just goes to show they've probably got a decent balance :)With regard to the acting? While it was pretty wooden this actually makes sense within the context of the film ? people on 'SWAT teams' and people without memories are not the most likely to be emoting or bonding. As the film goes on, logically, more relationships appear in the surviving team members and the emotions start to show. Alice (Milla Jovovich - 5th Element), as the heroine was the only character who really *had* much character but, two of the SWAT team members, Rain (Michelle Rodriguez - Fast and the Furious) and Kaplan (Martin Crewes) did pretty well with their limited dialogue too. Alice's co-guardian Spencer (James Purfoy - A Knight's Tale), SWAT team leader James Shade (Colin Salmon - last 3 Bond movies) and the policeman, Matt (Eric Mabius) were the others who basically managed to hold up their part of the deal along with a few good lines by the holographic Red Queen (Michaela Dicker).With regard to the dialogue? Yeah, OK, it was poor and quite sparse but it was good enough for a film like this ? you know the sort of thing:Surviving Team Member: "I can't believe [???]'s going to get away with it"; Red Queen computer: "I don't think so ... I've been a bad, bad girl..."Red Queen: "The zombies can be stopped by severing of the spinal column at the base of the skull or by massive trauma to the brain"; Surviving Team Member: "You mean we shoot them in the head"With regard to the sex and violence? It's a zombie/monster movie with Milla Jovovich as the gun-toting heroine wearing a short skirt and long leather boots (yes, she looks stunning) ... what do you think!OK, onto a few things I did and didn't like. Some of the early action set pieces seemed very ?bitty' and not very co-ordinated, but this improved as the film went on and the number of protagonists dropped! While there were a good few jumpy moments Paul Anderson's directing (Mortal Kombat (!), Event Horizon) sometimes allowed the tension to drop off a little too much when it should have been sustained which is a shame. In part I think for me this was due to the zombies being all over our heroes in one scene and then, once eluded, they don't appear (or even feel like they might) until the next 'zombie set piece' and any reasons for this are often not well explained. The film managed to avoid a 'linear' feel which I thought was good for one based on a computer game and actually done better than many other 'we have to escape from the monster' films. It also didn't use much obvious CGI and that which it did use was pretty well done (except the first time we see the CGI beast for some reason). The SFX in general were pretty good and though there were lots of rumours of the gore factor being seriously cut down to keep the certificate as low as possible unless you are expecting a total gore-fest then the violence level was suitably high. The only thing they really cut down on was the level of 'pumping blood' which was actually explained by the fact that deaths were often as a result of lasers (in which case wounds were cauterised) or of zombies (where the blood had coagulated and wasn't being pumped because they were dead already). To me the worst thing about the deaths were that too often you didn't know the character well enough to care but that's a common problem in films like this and only the best in the genre overcome it totally. That copes with the image so a word on the sound. The Marilyn Manson soundtrack worked pretty well, though I don't think it's been popular with people used to the in-game music, and generally sound and were well utilised to enhance the atmosphere and should come out well on a DVD surround sound set-up. So, the ending ... well I think it would have worked better not only as a self-contained film but also as a set-up for the inevitable sequel (slated for 2003) if it had been cut off a few minutes earlier. However it's certainly not the Hollywood happy ending I expected and I for one will be interested where it goes from here.So to sum up. I think this is easily one of the best, if not the best, computer game to movie transfers that has taken place so far. OK not that that's saying much but if you're looking for a shoot-em-up monster movie with decent action, decent plot and sexy heroine and you're willing to suspend a bit of disbelief, this should be worth a look!7/10</fullReview>

The zombies were hardly scary and not used effectively, the red queen was irritating and the mutant zombie was wasted. It felt like a video-game movie, and that's what it is, but 'Resident Evil' didn't become a zombie film in it's own right. Milla Jovovich was good but her character was stupid, but Michelle Rodriguez takes the cake for most annoying character award. Paul Anderson uses every cliche in the horror film genre to try create suspense to the extent it got cheesy. How can you be scared for characters that you couldn't care less about. 'Resident Evil' would get a lower mark, if it wasn't for the three saving graces that I mentioned in the opening sentence. **1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into Resident evil, having played all the games (except the survivor series...they suck) and I already had a pre-concieved notion of what this movie would be like. Personally, if I think a movie will be good I tend not to read movie reviews before I see as they can really throw your judgement going in.First off I must say... I love the resident evil line of games, they are the only games I have ever owned, they seem to be the only games I like. I cant explain that, but solving puzzles and killing the living dead just does it for me. So when I heard that my fav game series is to be brought to life on film I thought, cool.But then I heard who was directing it. Paul W.S.Anderson. Mr. Mortal Kombat... the man who helmed the unbelieveably bad "soldier" So thias lowered my expectations to almost flatlining. But, nonetheless I read some of the IMDB user comments on this movie and wel, most of them were in praise of it, so I took my chances and went to see it.I must say My lower expectations helped a lot. I was genuinely frightened by this movie, the only other film that has ever scared me was the sixth sense. Dont get me wrong this is no where near that level of film, but it makes good on the genre its based. Although the score (of lack of) can be a tad annoying at times, distorted guitars dont always provide a good backrop and sometimes, it was unecessary.If your reading, Im not going to say much about the story, cuz its resident evil, less I say is more for you. But the movie plays a lot like the game, the twists, the action... all very cool, and familiar.I loved this film, because I love the games, it was just like another game. If you like the games, see it, if you dont...then you might not like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With no expectations or predjudice, I decided to watch the movie since I've played the games. It turns out the movie was not to be shown locally in our town, so me and my friends had to take the 1.5 hrs drive north to catch the movie there. So we did and I must say it was really entertaining! Not really like the game, but not letting game-fans down. The music is perfect for the movie, even though I personally don't enjoy that genre of music that much, it really fit. The gore is as always present, we love it and if you remember all the times you jumped to the ceiling when you got scared from a zombie or something else non-exciting creature jumping out... Yeah, you get those skips here too.All in all, a really entertaining game, RE fan or not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it did NOT dissapoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay i have seen some rubbish video games films like super mario bros, tomb raider etc, but resident evil is without doubt the best ever. I am a fan of the games so i knew what to expect. The story is simple enough. A super computer kills everyone inside an underground lab after a huge experiment has gone wrong. A crack team of soldiers are sent in to investigate but end up running into a hoard of zombies and other nasy things. I wont spoil it by going into too much detail but for those who are a fan of the games then you will like the ending. Milla Jovovich, in my opinion, was terrible. I feel they should have cast someone else for her role. But MIchelle rodriguez plays the typical hard female soldier brilliantly. I was not expecting it to be a brilliant film but it was, forgiving MIlla's Rubbish acting and the mistakes. Paul Anderson, as we all know can do games (Mortal Kombat)and horror (Event Horizon) Well done paul for giving us an entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had very high expectations on this film, but I found out that it really sucked. Paul Anderson did a rather god job with Event horizon (violent and scary)...which R. E did not have...I mean juicy gore and a creepy mood. Now do not get me wrong..this film has quite a lot of action...but there are no gory action and this is supposed to have zombies in it. Just when your´re about to see some cool special effects, they cut those parts off. Lack of money or what? I wish they had not kicked George a. Romero out. Secondly there are a lot of holes in the story. Thru the whole film I sat and wondered what was really happening. Is this just a film for those who played the game? And for the last why is this rated R...it should be rated PG -13 or something. So if you like films such as John Carpenter´s Ghosts of Mars...you will enjoy this one. I rate this 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the WORST Movies of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I thought "Tomb Raider" was just okay, but at least they had a great director (Simon West), and actors that could actually act -- and a little bit of a story mixed in with all the action."Resident Evil" is just plain BORING! I almost fell asleep watching this trash. There was one good scene of action, but other then that, the acting was HORRIBLE (I can't emphasize that enough!), and the action -- what little there was -- was just plain boring! The movie was ridiculous! I rate this up there with Stallone's movie "Driven" as one of the WORST movies ever made!Director Paul Anderson needs to get back to his roots. He made an entertaining movie with the ORIGINAL "Mortal Kombat" (the sequels were awful though), but at least "Mortal Kombat" had some great cinematography, and special effects! It was an action flick...If you haven't seen Paul Anderson's first movie entitled "Shopping" you are really missing out... the BEST movie he's ever made -- and one of my favorite movies of all time! So it's a disappointment that after his first film, he started making trash! He's a talented director, but I think needs to make better choices, and start doing better movies like his action-director counterparts (i.e., Simon West, Michael Bay) who have moved on to not only do action films, but action films with strong characters driving the story -- like Paul Anderson did with "Shopping".He needs to be getting back to his roots and start making his characters more interesting, since he wrote and directed "Resident Evil" he takes the blame for the entire flick being bad!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I did not actually have a high expectation for this movie, thinking it will be just another scary flick with lame looking zombies. But after watching this movie i must say the scares were quite refreshing as in they were not your standard kind of horror. Overall i'll say its pretty good. And i like the way milla jovovich (did i get that right?), played her role, that confused, apprehensive but yet calm and controlled kind of action figure you would find in the game. but i must say the role played by Michelle Rodriguez WAS HORRIBLE....it was super irritating the way she played the role, perhaps the director wanted it that way or it was the actress who made her role suck so bad i dunno, but the way she spoke and the way she TRIED to look unfriendly and bitchy really irritates me. She like a small child acting smart and have that "know it all" look in the film. Well dun let that spoil your enjoyment of the film. (SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) And lucky she died so we will not see her in the sequel (hopefully.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way Over Rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts good. It leaves you wondering until it all starts to make sense. Unfortunately most of the most interesting characters get killed too early. There is some suspense and some strong music. Many parts of the film are more gut wrenching than suspenseful. This movie is mostly grim and depressing especially in the last half. You walk out feeling kind of down and a little sick. Even Milla is a little over rated. She is not that pretty with a weird nose. She has very little personality either. And all the graphic cuts and bruises are a real turnoff.She is no comparison to Angelina Jolie, the Mummy star, or even the excellent lead actress in Ghosts of Mars. I should say the other brunette female lead in the film who was also in Fast and Furious and Girl Fighter is very good with a powerful personality. But the "I want to kiss you bit.." line is stupid. I much preferred John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars. But you need to like Carpenter to like that film. Resident Evil is just more depressing than it needs to be. </fullReview>

I felt like the director had wanted to just "mention" every character of the game. Zombies, dogs, etc. all showed up for some minutes contributing no forthtaking effect to the plot. Bad publicity for the computer-game and, most of all Paul Anderson. Less could have been more for this one. Resident Evil had the possibility to become an entertaining pop-shocker. Unfortunately it turned out to be not only a bad game-adaption, but a really worthless piece of crap, one of the worst pictures I´ve seen so far. Sorry folks...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was absolutely horrible. I rarely write any reviews, but this was the absolutely worse film I have seen in years. It made Mission to Mars look like an epic. The film is just nonsense action followed by nonsense action. None of the characters are ever developed, they try but the actors obviously don't know what they were supposed to be doing, so the audience never figures it out. Certain plot elements like the zombies completely surrounding them just disappear after a while and noone seems to notice. They have the typical problem that bad horror films have of inconsistency. Sometimes, one thing will kill a monster and in a different scene, someone does the same thing to the monster 25 times and it hardly flinches. I guess it was supposed to be a prequel for the video games, but even with that it seemed unfinished at all levels. I was a little tired before going to this film and got myself awake early in the film and watched it. I wish I had just fallen asleep and had some productive time for my 5 bucks.</fullReview>

Very little sense of what causes zombies to need to "feed" as they do or even why they really exist. I won't even comment further on specifics of the 'eh-hem' "plot". In general the reasons for why things happen are very poorly explained (in terms of the creation of the problems). The movie even goes as far as to assume a sequel is a given...Presuming a great deal and delivering nothing but the mindless violence you get a B horror flick, this movie is a horrible insult to the intelligence of anyone who wants their disbelief suspended.</fullReview>

The overly and needlessly convoluted story centers around an elite SWAT team that infiltrates an underground genetic research laboratory on a deadly mission to investigate a biological virus that has contaminated the lab and mutated everyone into flesh-eating zombies. Like most films of this only marginally successful genre there are some exciting moments of action and violence, but the film is poorly directed, lacks tension, and has a frustrating tendency to let its music drown everything out.

		<fullReview>I have one word to describe this film: laughable. For the first 20 minutes, the movie follows no definable plot. It leaves the audience utterly confused. There were about 60 other people in the theatre at the same time as me, and a goodly majority of them were laughing right along with me at this horrible game to movie translation. The only faintly interesting monster is the Licker towards the end. The zombies look nothing more than extras with poorly applied make-up and that's exactly what they are. I have one question to the makers of this film: Is it so hard to use the already well established and well written plot and story from the Resident Evil games? If it were up to me, I would go the easy route and straight up translate the game to movie form. Apparently CapCom didn't want to let Paul Anderson have the rights to the story as he would so obviously have screwed it up. If you absolutely must see this film, go ahead and waste your $5 to $8. If you want a good zombie story, play the Resident Evil games.Or, if you're dying to see a zombie move, go to your local video store and rent George Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead. I now see why Luc Besson divorced Mila Jovovich.</fullReview>

Second, it seemed like this was a well over 2 hours movie that had been cut down to 90 minutes by someone very drunk.

		<fullReview>Went into this movie not knowing what to expect, when I orignally saw the trailer I was extremely disappointed with how the film looked, but after seeing the commercial on tv a few times, I realized it may have potential, but due to the fact that it was a video game movie, I still kept the expectations low, (even thought it was done by the same guy who did Mortal Kombat which is an awesome movie). The movie started off a little slow, but picked up pretty quick, Milla Jovovich ruled, Michelle rodriguez played her "tough chic" role, but pulled it off, I kind of wanted a little more out of Eric Mabius, I think he has potential as an actor but all and all the acting was pretty good for this kind of flik. The biggest fear I had going into this movie was that I didn't think it would stick to the same formula as the games, but it did, almost to a key. The movie's score was done by Mr. Marilyn Manson which was excellent, added extra creepiness to the atmosphere. All and all I really enjoyed this movie, and I would recommend it to fans of the games and to anyone looking for a wild ride. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is superb for what it supposed to be. Don't let the people who obviously never played the games, haven't seen the movie, or can understand artistic impression fool you. If you've played the game, it makes sense.I have to say that I disagree with a few comments about this being a movie for kids. It has nudity, extreme violence, language, and really graphic gore. So parents beware. As far as the people bashing the movie because it has a little Night of the Living Dead or Alien "rips offs"....uh HELLO, that is what the game is all about. The GAME is a rip off of the Living Dead movies. If they didn't include those things, people would have been complaining about that. The movie is very true to the game, and the games popularity revolves around those other movies. It has the birds, the dogs, the dead, the licker, the train, the mansion, the chic, the conspiracy, etc. It may not have them in the same sense as the game, or frequency, as in the case of the dogs, but they are there (note: the birds, when Milla walks outside the mansion). Some other reviewers are saying that they can't believe how long it takes them to figure out the "head shot" theory. How many zombies in the game die with one shot? You guys are looking at this from the wrong angle. Did you guys think Saving Pvt Ryan sucked because it had scenes really similar to those old John Wayne movies? Sure they could have made the movie more like the game, making them walk back and forth between 8 rooms solving puzzles, but then how boring would that have been? Enough with the rant...the movie rocks, go see it so they will make a sequel. It has the jolts and jumps of a true horror movie, the pace is upbeat and it never bogs down. I don't believe they made this movie to be an Oscar contender anyway. Look at it for what it is. It is a great escape just like the game.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this film was bad. I mean, the best part was watching Milla Jovovich!! She looked good and hid her accent well. This performance on her part was fine and she shows good moves (way better than that pile of dribble called TOMB RAIDER). The movie starts off ok with a cool shot of where the scientists work in "the hive". Then something goes wrong and the computer locks down the lab and kills everybody. Then, a SWAT team shows up lead by some man who looks like the CANDYMAN. There's a scene where some laser beams slice some of that team. That was a rip off from the Cell. Then suddenly all these makeshift Zombies show up after five hours of being dead! It was Alien's meets Return of the Living Dead (especially since The Candyman is in it) with a little bit of OUTBREAK thrown in. What you get when you mix those three together is a movie that appeals to only little kids with candy. In fact, I was embarassed because I was the only adult in the movie theater! I wanted to see that hispanic girl DIE the entire time. I also wanted for Milla Jovovich to have more speaking parts. Milla Jovovich is one of the best actresses of our generation. I hope that Milla Jovovich learns that she can do more than just these sell out movies. Ugg. And what's the deal with that stupid Red Queen? As if any artificial intelligence (another stupid movie) could be all nice and then start screaming "KILL HER! KILL HER NOW!" Many things were wrong with this movie. Shame on you Milla Jovovich. I will give you another chance though because you're the best looking actress since Andie McDowll. I rate this movie a 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**POTENTIAL SPOILERS**Being a big fan of the video game series, I went into the theater hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. (I think we all know how well video-game-to-movie translations typically fare.) The previews I'd seen for the movie did nothing to bolster my expectations, nor did the early reviews I'd read. Imagine my surprise when it actually turned out to be GOOD.Granted, it has its flaws; namely, poor CG effects, and fairly lame acting, but, overall its a very enjoyable experience, provided you can turn your brain off and just enjoy the ride.Before seeing it, I knew that the movie would have virtually nothing to do with the games' existing story-line, or its existing characters, and that kind of irritated me. (Why would you turn an existing franchise into a movie and eliminate its most basic of components?) But, as it turns out, this actually works in the movie's favor. They crafted an original, albeit basic, story using elements from the game that help to define it stylistically: story progression from creepy, Gothic mansion to high-tech research center, broken-down and flooded environments, the train sequences that just shout "Resident Evil 2", and a high quantity of "shock moments" involving creatures shattering windows, and arms flying through walls. There were also a number of homages to the game series that I found rather appealing, such as the use of certain static camera angles that look like they were ripped directly from the game, and the fact that bodies had a tendency to "magically disappear" when the characters weren't looking (which they did in fact notice.)I was rather surprised by the lack of gore present in the film, though, on the other hand, I was taken aback by the level of gruesomeness present. Very nasty things happen to a few of the characters, and the director lets your imagination do the work in some of the films most hideous moments, which is refreshing. (You probably wouldn't really want to see the results of these things, anyhow.)Overall, "Resident Evil" is a satisfying movie experience that should definitely be checked out by fans of the games and horror fans in general. It's been far too long since a decent horror flick has been released theatrically, and an especially deplorable lack in the amount of zombie movies released. I hope this movie does well, such that we see more zombie movies made in the future, potentially enabling George Romero to create the fourth installment of his "Dead" series.Heck, I'd even settle for a sequel to this movie. The movie's final image is fabulous, and I would love to see a movie taking place in the environment shown. The movies may even turn out to be like the games, where the sequel improves upon the original by leaps and bounds. How cool would that be?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is bad. Take every horror movie cliche you can think of, ripoff the story from Aliens, add third rate Matrix like special effects and then when the violnece kicks in pan away so there is no blood or gore despite that bieng the main idea of the movie and shake well. There are a few highlights, the makeup effects on the zombies are great and Mill Jovovich is both beautiful and solid as an action hero.If you're a big fan of the game or of Milla it might be worth your time but if you're looking for a good horror movie look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Believe it or not- this is this best game-to-film movie made so far... (eep!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah... The video game crossover... What a horrible thing... There was "Super Mario Brothers", "Double Dragon", the 2 "Mortal Kombat" films and "Tomb Raider". Now that your eyes are sore from all that cringing here comes "Resident Evil" from director Paul "W.S." Anderson. He, as many of us know is responsible for such atrocities as "Mortal Kombat", "Event Horizon" and "Soldier". But let's give his new initials (W.S.) a chance... Being a big fan of the "Resident Evil" games I was excited when I heard of the film being made. It was originally supposed to be directed by horror veteran George Romero but he decided not to after his script (which was way better) was turned down. Enter Mr. Anderson... Now writing and directing isn't the easiest thing to do and is a daunting task indeed. Which is why I wasn't completely insulted by the film. I won't give much of the simple plot away but here is what I liked and disliked. Likes: Production. -Great looking effects and design. The mansion and facility looked really good and solid. Dead Guys. -The zombies were some of the scariest looking I've seen in a while (very well acted too). Mostly make-up with good C.G. enhancements. The 'hunters' look pretty good as well. Gore. -Bloody but not ridiculous. They could've gone for a P.G.-13 rating for the kiddies but opted to go the whole 9 and make it violent like the game. Scares. -I jumped at a few of the scares. Great if u have your clingy lady-friend sitting near you... ;) OK... now the cons: Dialogue. -Really bad dialogue at times. Very bland lines. Some jokes worked and some didn't. Acting. -Other than the main actors (Jovavich and Rodriguez) everyone else seemed deader than the zombies. Directing. -Very slow narrative and the action was dull and brief. There was also too much emphasis on establishing a 'style' with wash-outs and camera angles. Very distracting...Editing. -Too many quick cuts. Plot. Too simple and ineffective with too many plot holes and unoriginality. This is based on a game that plays like a film so it really shouldn't be 'that' difficult... Music. -Probably the worst gripe of all. Crappy 'industrial' music from Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson. Ugh... It was 'accidental' instead of being 'incidental' music. It gave a lot of the scares away and was louder than the film itself. Overall this film is for the fans of the game who will appreciate it more than others who haven't experienced the 'Resident Evil' games. With a better script and better director this would've worked much better. Maybe the sequels will be better...P.S.: The original title was 'Resident Evil Zero' which would've been a better title because this film basically is the back story to the first game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I too, received free tickets to a premier showing of Resident Evil. I have never played the original, but was an avid fan of RE II and thought it would be a fun movie to watch with my sci-fi loving date.Anyway, it was good, and the best part was what a great job they did of depicting the "Licker." That creature scared the pee out of me in the game and did again at the theater. Ok, I didn't lose bladder control, but close.And that spooky little girl hologram. She can beat the Licker anyday in my nightmares.Milla Jovovich has proven she can do more than walk down a catwalk.Can't wait for the sequel. We'll see what they can do with the S.T.A.R.S. uniforms. And I'm waiting to see what kind of plant they use for the blue, red and green herbs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul W.S. Anderson once said: "I don't think anyone knows more about Resdient Evil than I do".Well that's certainly crap, because we should have gotten a better film. Zombie master George A. Romero was originally set to direct a movie based on the franchise, after creating two successful live action commercials for the video game "Resident Evil 2", that were aired only in Japan (YouTube them, they starred Brad Renfro). He sat and took notes, whilst his secretary played the original game next to him and handed the screenplay to Capcom and Sony. Though somewhat true to the original game, the script was shelved. George was fired and the movie was plunged into development hell.Eventually Paul was hired and wrote something respectably set within the first game only, but ended up creating all these new characters who are so underwhelming. Milla Jovovich is probably one of my favourite actresses and arguably she's probably the only thing good about these movies. But even she can't save this poorly executed franchise that managed to start off so wrong. Michelle Rodriguez is Michelle Rodriguez, and to say the rest of these characters are cardboard would be an insult to good packaging material.What would have been more appropriate would to have instead have zombies roam the house, and have the squad fall back into the underground labs due to having no chance of escaping. If there going to die anyway, at least you suddenly have a situation they have no control over and a sense of danger. That would be more compelling then letting them loose yourself. Better yet, just keep it simple and follow the PlayStation one classic that managed to make the franchise what it is today.Final Verdict: I wish Paul actually knew how to make a zombie film, let alone a good film. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Title: Resident EvilCondensed Storyline: A special militaristic unit has to make their way through an underground base to shut off a supercomputer, but first they must get through the base which is full of zombies Notable Acting: I found most of the characters quite boring and as soon as I was starting to get invested in a character, they got killed off. I found Milla Jovovich's character Alice quite boring and bland, whereas I did like Eric Mabius' and Martin Crewes' characters of Mat and Kaplan. But that was really, just about it. Noticeable Camera work: Zoom in shot of a man using transportation hands to get the T-Virus and T-Vaccine, they work this so you can only see it is a man in a Hazmat suit, but you cannot see his face. Simple yet effective. Graphics: CGI monster that looks like Venom from Spiderman, bluntly looks CGI. I wish I could say more things about it, as it does look like a cool design. But there isn't much good I can say about it. Incorrect Science: The Red Queen tells the group that hair and fingernails continue to grow after death, this is incorrect as what actually happens is the skin around the nails and hair shrinks as it dehydrates, causing the hair and finger nails to look like they've grown. At the start of the movie when the T-Virus vial is dropped and escapes into the air vent, this is incorrect again as any lab that would have people working in hazmat suits wouldn't have an air vent, just like the scientist says when he is about to drown. I highly doubt dogs can smell the T-Virus, but you never know.Overall Feel: I am generally not a fan of video game movies, primarily because I feel like I would be missing out on a lot of easter egg and jokes, almost similar to comic book movies. But I actually know things about comic book movies so I don't feel left out. But thankfully, I didn't feel "too" left out while watching this movie as it felt more like a cut and print action movie more than a video game based movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie on the television last night. I have not played the game. It came across like a video game with real actors playing the roles. However, I think it would be more entertaining to watch people playing the game for real on YouTube. I could not finish the film and stopped watching about half way through. I looked up what happened next on Wikipedia and was glad I stopped watching. Nothing made sense or felt right. I know it's fantasy but no one uses bimbos in mansions for security. And why did those SAS type commandos burst in through the windows? Why not just come in quietly through the front door? It was supposed to be a secret entrance after all. Did they ever explain what Matt was doing there? And why did they take Alice and Matt in with them and not just leave them with the back up outside? And why was there no support and back-up at the mansion to secure things as they moved in? And why did the Red Queen not just kill the four commandos in the Queen Chamber straight away instead of playing with them? And how come Alice was able to disable a zombie with her bare hands and kill a pack of zombie dogs with a pistol when the commandos could not do this with a small arsenal of weapons? And why were Alice and Matt suddenly wandering around on their own anyway? I could go on and I only watched half the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply one of the most boring, predictable and generally anticlimactic movies ever made, only being surpassed in it' awfulness by it' numerous sequels. The acting is sub-par (even by Milla Jovovich's standards), the plot is laughable, the action is dull and repetitive and the Matrix style bullet time effect is over used. For fans of the games, this film has nothing to offer you. In fact you're likely to end up hating Paul Anderson, that is, of course, if you didn't already hate him for his previous travesties.For fans of zombie movies, this film has nothing new to offer to you. All you will get from this film, and indeed the plethora of abortive train wrecks it's spawned, is an uninteresting rehash of things you've seen before, nothing has even been used in an original way. For fans of horror films, this film contains no suspense and is about as likely to frighten you as offering salt lick to horse is likely to frighten it. This is an action film pure and simple, an all style no substance action film at that.For fans of well-made movies, the genre of which really doesn't bother you, look elsewhere. If you are masochistic enough to feel you that you just have to see this film for yourself don't say I didn't warn you.There is a very special group of people who will love this movie, namely 14 year old boys with below average IQs and way too much testosterone. The only redeeming feature of this film is the soundtrack, but if you like that kind of music you'll probably have every song you hear in this film already.My suggestion save your money and get yourself a tin of paint, you'll have a lot more fun watching it dry than you would do sitting through this steaming pile of horse manure. In summary, the Resident evil the movie will probably go down in history as the most expensive B movie ever made. If you actually liked this film I have nothing but pity for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm embarrassed that people liked this film. The success of this disgustingly bad franchise really symbolizes cultural decay and the triumph of the room temperature IQ movie goer.Paul Anderson threatens audience with a sequel at the end of this film and follows through...with 4 of them.There is a lot wrong with this film, I don't even know where to begin. Paul Anderson took the original Resident Evil story line and concepts and totally butchered them.There's the premise of "well why tell the RE story." Well why the F*CK call it resident evil if your going to butcher the classic story line? Why not call it something appropriately stupid like "Paul Anderson's Death Metal and Machine guns House of the undead"?How about when they remade godzilla they made it a movie about killer clowns from the evil giant dinosaur planet or something completely irrelevant/ridiculous and been like "Oh well we didn't want to just re- tell the original godzilla story line."You can follow through with the original story, and build on it. Hone, out make it better, add more back story to characters, add side story and remain true to the original story without completely mangling it.There's no character development. Actor dialogue consists of commands, exclamations. I was actually glad when they were systematically/predictable killed off. No depth, Anderson cops out by giving the main character amnesia and a 2 minute filler explanation by the Umbrella team comander. Figuring well hey if I just get milla to flash her tits and pull her dress up a little, I can out of having to write a script that contains any substance and just blare death metal to machine gun fire and call the movie a hit.You could literally play the scenes in any order in this movie and it'd make no difference. Go into room A- shoot zombies with machines guns Room B- Karate chop kung fu kick zombies Room C- get killed by evil computer-The fight sequences were stupid, exaggerated and unrealistic. Alice Matrix kicks a dog, kung fu punches a zombie and snaps a zombie's neck with her thighs at blaring sound of death rock metal. -Machine guns that do not need to be aimed, and apparently never run out of bullets.If you're shot with a machine gun in this movie you go airborne like superman, so yeah, it's one of those movies. -The virus escapes from an AIRTIGHT room where people are wearing bio- suits connected to hoses to even enter.....through an air vent.The game story line was actually survival horror and unfolded the story line in suspenseful way. Characters have limited ammunition, and focus mainly on uncovering umbrella plot while developing a deep back story. We gain insight into who these individuals were and what they were doing while developing this virus which turned them into zombies. While doing so, they are separated from each other a extremely low on ammunition and simply trying to make it out the mansion alive.Paul W.S. Anderson's version is essentially a group of people with machine guns blasting, matrix kicking, kung fu punching their way through "the hive" to the sound of heavy metal death rock and occasionally inserts a snippet from the original concept as if to remind you what could have been.</fullReview>

I never played a Resident Evil game in my whole life, so I don't know how faithful it is to the source material, all that I can say is that I found this movie to be a dumb mess (Just like all the movies directed by Paul W.S. Anderson) being very poorly directed and boring.The acting is terrible, and all the characters from this film just seem just way too plain and bland to care about them. The story it is dumb and original as it can be, repeating several of the clichés used in every previous zombie film that have been done to death (No pun-intended) "Resident Evil" it's a lame film, being way too overrated and boring. I just don't see how a movie so bad as this one could have so many sequels and such a good reception. This is just terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I can think of giving this film a rating of 2/10, is that number 2 was even worse. Just focusing on this one, the story is so basic and weak, the characters are rubbish, the special affects, the zombie's, the action were abysmal. The idea of the character 'Alice' was useless, if you played the game you would know their's no character named 'Alice', and there's no need for 'Alice' as their were several characters they could of used from the game. Besides Michelle Rodriguez the acting was below average in fact the only thing worse, was the directing. Paul W.S.Anderson my nominee for worse director. I can't actually believe the studio's have allowed for further instalments of this shocking movie, which is supposedly based on the 'Resident Evil games'.</fullReview>

Apparently, she's a VERY powerful weapon. She's also the main character. ...How's that for a shocker? :o Alice also doesn't really have much of a background story. What's interesting about a super-powered, bland, nearly invincible, amnesic Mary-Sue with no depth? Nothing. She's a waste of time and space. Leon S. Kennedy, on the other hand, ISN'T.

In addition, even once the generally poor quality of films computer games (Tomb Raider!), I expected the worst when the sneak the title "Resident Evil" appeared.In retrospect, I must say that the film was not against me. Good: it is a little thirteen-in-a-dozen in terms of action but overall surely not badly made. The characters remain two-dimensional and very little attention to relationships, the movie is certainly a next level.The zombies were simply laughable. I thought of Michael Jackson every time 'Cause this is thriller, thriller night / and no one is going to save you from the beast about to strike.However, it was opposite that it is not tedious to Milla Jojovich half hours in a short skirt around to see running.

		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for Afterlife and i got to thinking, "People need to know how whether this series is good or not." So here's my opinion. I think the Resident Evil movies are a waste of money and time. My opinion is based on mainly the relation of the Video Game series, yes the movies are based on a video game series, as well as the movie itself. Well the story is completely messed up, the story has next to nothing to do with the games. They took the games titles as well as the names of some of the characters, without successfully portraying them properly, other than that, they took the name of the town, and that's pretty much it. There was no hive in the games, and Alice (The protagonist of the films) isn't even from the games! They got the virus all wrong and never got anywhere close to the plot of the games. Some people may say that, "Both the games and the movies are about a Zombie apocalypse, they got the story right." Wrong, The story is much deeper than that. If the movies were not named after the games, i would have passed of the things they actually took from the games as simple allusions. If you don't play the games, you might actually enjoy the films, the plot may be a little messed up and simple, but the action is OK and i can't complain too much about the acting. With relation to the games, i give it a 1/10, without 6.3/10. If your curios about the real storyline of the games, please watch a retrospective. I'm sorry if i come off as rude or biased, but it's hard for someone who loves the games so much. Peace to you all.</fullReview>

This time Neo is undercover as a female agent in a mansion, probably infested with agents. Umbrella corporation is some sort of super duper pharmacy group that controls half of the world.

Wait wait, action movie? Sorry once more, seems that somebody gave some nerd with zero creativity a bunch of money to shoot a matrix fan film, in a lab under a mansion with zombies. Why? I have no idea, but the results aren't pretty.So, how do you mess up something as simple as making a fun zombie movie? Follow the RE guideline:-Add a bunch of gimmicky, annoying and irritating camera angles, matrix-esquire slow mo and other pointless stuff that never ever looks "cool" at all. -Write a bunch of napkin-one-dimensional characters, all of them interchangeable, and just kill like half of them before the first act concludes. -Write stuff that doesn't make sense, and is not fun to follow, or interesting at all -Yeah dood totally use slipknot in the soundtrack! That's a great idea....if you're 15 and wanting to make your parents angry.There you go, the result is this insipid disaster, who is now on the 4th film. There is a market for this needless to say, but then again, there is a market for people with a fetish for seeing women on the internet stomping over eggs.

		<fullReview>This movie tries to be a lot more clever than it is. The dream-like opening sequences are intended to endue it with a gravitas that is simply never realised. Likewise, the rather art-house flashback sequences in glorious black and white with a graveyard setting, all merely create confusion because their accomplishment is clumsy rather than deft. It would have been far simpler, better, and less confusing to have taken the straightforward approach with a solid, logical 'rescue' movie like 'Aliens' - which it very much resembles - and sort out the conspiracy later.Once we finally know what is going on, the story gets into its stride. Set pieces are excellent and the pacing and revelations likewise. There are lots of strange-sinister environments - again, like alien/aliens - that leave you guessing what might turn up.What actually turns up is every cliché known to horror movies. There are - Zombies! And they're - flesh-eaters! It has never been explained ever, since the 'Living Dead' franchise why zombies are so picky. They won't so much as nibble each other, but give them a living human and they fall upon it like wolves. Why? protein is protein, after all.There's also a chamber of horrors into which most of the commando team blunder only to get wiped-out - once again, like 'Aliens'. But there's also a hint of 'Cube' about it, because this really is a booby-trap, and people get diced in much the same way.There's a malevolent computer like Hal of '2001', which needs to be shut down before it kills everybody. There's a deadly virus (where would we be without a deadly virus?) that also turns people into zombie flesh-eaters. There's even a pack of zombie dogs, that appear to have lost all of their hair for some unexplained reason. It makes them look more ghastly - and that's probably the reason.On top of all this, there's a really shocking beastie with big claws and a very long tongue - 'Journey To The Centre Of The Earth' (1957) - popping-up there, by the looks of it. And there's a riotous train ride with the villain on board, not so far removed from 'The Wrong Trousers'.And, last but not least; the mission is time-sensitive. So we all know the clock is ticking...If they don't get their arses into gear, they suffer a permanent lock-in - rather like 'The Crystal Maze'.The cast are about as unmemorable a bunch of players as ever graced a B-movie. Apart from the blonde communist typing-error, Jovovich, none of them register a single point on the Richter-scale of acting ability. An Hispanic female (called Rodriguez, would you believe) suffers from some strange opthalmic condition whereby she is permanently looking upwards. It is not a very endearing characteristic. Whilst Ms Jovovich's high point was to fall through the roof of you-know-who's taxi in 'Fifth Element'. One suspects that she must have fallen onto numerous casting-couches first. Frankly, I have seen more human emotion expressed by a pair of buttocks than I have seen manifest in her face. That blank, pale, uncomprehending stare has now become a staple at the check-out queue of my local Tesco's. Usually it is accompanied by a black-haired, bull-necked, block-headed lump who's eyebrows meet above the nose. Pretty, they certainly ain't. Such is European integration. Ms Jovovich also engages in the sort of gravity-defying wall-walk that 'The Matrix' made fashionable.There's a clever little shock-ending that is very well accomplished; it leaves you in no doubt that things really have gone pear-shaped, and looks like the origins of all 'Living Dead' movies.Soundtracks and incidental music are drawn from a variety of heavy-metal and thrash-rock tracks with which I am unfamiliar, and don't really add much atmosphere to the movie as, perhaps, simple silence might.And that's about it. Don't expect too much. Don't ask any questions. Just sit down with your six-pack or whatever, and watch. It's a well-made B-movie. The six stars I've given it more reflect the quality of set pieces and special effects than anything else.</fullReview>

Doomtrooper which is about a giant Frankinstein Nazi that... well you can figure it out from there. On to the review: I like the Resident Evil Video game series(especially RE4) And I was pretty excited for the movie and thought it would be a alright movie. God Almighty was I wrong. I can only think what was going through the director's mind when he thought up the idea for the movie. I think it went something like this: Hey I know lets get that red head skank from The Fifth Element (Milla Jovovich) To play our main character and completely screw our fans by changing the story! Good idea Paul.(the director) The plot is more broken than Chevy Chase's Career and you couldn't fix that with super glue. The only cool scene is where those agent losers get cut up by the lasers... or was That Resident Evil: Apocalyspe I don't know, crappy movies tend to blend together over time. There's your review, Oh what still wanna know more about the plot OK here: The Beginning: People become zombies. The Middle: Zombies attack survivors. The End: Alice (Milla Jovovich) survives and it turns out that she is Umbrella's secret weapon or something? I don't know I had already gouged my eyes out so I wouldn't have to watch it anymore. Anyway my point is that this is bad (I'm talking' Dane Cook's comedy routine bad) There the review is over (finally) and I just saved you an hour and forty-five minute journey to the depths of hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie of the video game; I thought, probably crap but...I read a review that basically slated the movie, but implied that it had some sexy girls gratuitously flaunting semi-nudity. PAH! Milla Jovovich in a short dress?! OK, so let's look at it as a sci-fi/horror genre flick. I suppose if you'd never seen a zombie movie before, this might offer some surprises, but even by the logically-challenged conventions of the genre, it's hard to take seriously.Mysterious mega-corporation that has 90% penetration into the consumer marketplace but nevertheless relies on military research for its income invents death-reversing virus that defies basic physics in lab run by AI computer that somehow manages to be HAL 9000 and Forest Gump simultaneously. Final scene is word-free but says loudly "Get ready to buy the sequel!"If you think I think it's more than a bit far-fetched, you're quite right!If you're a twelve year old boy and not, err, overly familiar with girls, you might think that this is worth an hour and a half of your time. But you'd be better off watching Tomb Raider! It's not the worst film ever made, but it tries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They think we're idiots!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the reason this film went so wrong is that most people neither understand nor respect games. They assume that they're all about shootin' commi's or appealing to a persons blood-lust. But that's not why I play video-games, I play them because of the participatory plot-lines.When I was watching the special features for the Resident Evil2 DVD they all had that gung-ho "we're gonna whoop some zombie butt". "This is the ultimate fight against the power". "I love Jill's impatience". Bull sh*t! Jill is not a super-heroine! She's a coward! The first time she sees a zombie she runs out to Barry shouting "It's a monster! It's a monster! Shoot it!" It's not that I think women can't be heroes it's just that ... Jill isn't. She's on that team for her investigatory skills, not her battle readiness.Both movies were complete failures. If anyone on the project is reading this remember; We aren't idiots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil undoubtedly works far better on the small screen than it did at the cinema. There is no way any director (no matter how experienced) can bring a video game to life without sacrificing art in the process. Anderson has been here before with Mortal Kombat but injected into both movies enough competency and style to make them respectable in their own right.With Resident Evil he has given us a decent story with a touch of complication and a fair amount of suspense. My main gripe is the fact that the movie looks far too slick to be as truly disturbing as the grainy and filthy Zombie movies of the '70s. Plus the violence isn't all that graphic but there is still plenty of fun to be had in watching a bunch of office workers turn into the living dead and it's scary how cheaply their lives are considered by the Umbrella Corp. they work for. I'm certainly not going to work in an office for a company like that if that's what they're going to do to me.The characters are thin but not entirely one-dimensional. You do end up siding with some of them and feel urgency in their futile escape from the underground skyscraper (shouldn't that be 'Groundscraper' then?). Milla Jovovich is cuter here than she was in Fifth Element or Zoolander but Michelle Rodriguez just plain annoys me. All I've ever seen her play is a moody Latino who frowns all the time. It's time for here to try and expand her range a bit and I wish someone else played her character.Video games will never make for classic movies. They can be mind-numbingly terrible (Super Mario Brothers, Double Dragon) or competent, such as this. Just turn a blind eye to the really, really bad FX at the end when a CGI monster goes on the rampage. My old Commodore 64 was capable of better graphics.The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and a choice of Dolby 5.1 or DTS 5.1 soundtracks which sound great but, as a result, also serve to highlight he meaningless and clichéd Marco Beltrami/Marylin Manson 'score'.</fullReview>

The effects are plastic and very industrial-looking. The movie uses every horror-movie cliché in the book. The characters are about as one-dimensional as is ever possible, and not only that - they're all stereotypes and clichés of themselves. The acting is crap.In short, everything about this movie sucked. The only good thing I can say about it is that it ended.</fullReview>

What is the plot of this movie?, is there a plot?Lousy actors, lousy CG effects and geeez, the script, how long did it take to write that?, 5 minutes? - all of the characters in the movie shares maybe 25 lines.This movie was so embarrasing that i had to stop it exactly after 60 minutes, i couldnt take no more. For the first 35 minutes *nothing* happens, not even a tiny conversation, oh well maybe someone talks but as the lines are the worst i have ever heard im not even gonna comment on them.Plot: bunch of people rush to an underground research facility, when they get there they suddenly have to get out again, cus these awardwinners who are supposed to be some kinda special forces didnt have the slightest idea that something might be totally wrong down there, as they were the ones sent to fix it.Also, female actors trying to act macho, i just dont buy it.Do yourself a favor, avoid this movie at any cost. Go rent "Super Mario Bros", "Mortal Kombat" or even "Street fighter" instead. Jean Claude Van Damme's acting is award worthy compared to this piece of trash.*note. I have played through all the resident evil games and i looove them, this is also why i was so dissappointed. The games have great plots, characters and are really scarry, so it wouldnt be that hard to write a decent script from that.. obviously the hired some dyslexic 3 grade blind kid to do it.0 out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a computer-game-to-movie-flick. They're always bad. Is this an exception? Not really? but it is a lot of fun. It entertains you for a while and there's something to be said for that.Plot? Does it matter? Everyone in a top-secret research base dies. A group of elite marines are sent in to find out what happened. They're helped by Alice (Milla Jovovich), who is suffering amnesia. There're are also two other men suffering amnesias. As they womble along, they uncover the shocking truths of what happened? and the even more shocking truths of who they themselves are?So, as you can see, the plot's a load of garbage. However it's kinda fun. Some lamented the fact the movie didn't opt for a tongue-in-cheek approach of `Dog Soldiers'? but I'm perfectly happy with that. We've enough post-modernism now that a good-old fashioned zombie-fest is welcome. Sure there are elements here which leave you thinking, `Why did they do that?' but you can forgive it all because it's entertaining you.Acting? While Michelle Rodriguez is good as action-gal Rain, the cast just barely hold themselves. Sure the characters are as one-dimensional as their video-game roots? but what the heck. Seeing as how we know most of them are going to be whittled away, this doesn't really matter to us. Since when did a pure-horror movie have good acting?Directing? How does it gel? Paul Anderson? does some stuff here. There's a surprisingly decent amount of jump moments. Sure they are somewhat queued in advance, but they're still fairly effective. The hard-pumping metal soundtrack also works well in a cheap sense. The usual separate-the-characters routine works grand and no character is particularly neglected to any detrimental effect. The action sequences are good, with enough tension and testosterone to make you smile. It's what we want ? a brainless action-flick that's fun.It's by no means a great movie, or even a good movie. However it doesn't have false pretensions about it's worth. It's entertainment, it's a `switch off' brain moment. It's an enjoyable way to spend ninety or so minutes of your life, and it had enough of that to make me see the sequel when it gets released. 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" isn't definitely the worst horror film ever made,but movie of the year?!...come on!I'm sad to have say that this is actually more action flick than horror.As cool as the games are(at least the first two),as mediocre is Anderson's film.Almost no gore at all,pretty bad acting(the characters in the computer game almost seem lively)and no uncanny atmosphere to be found.And,by the way it's mostly kind of rip-off of "Dawn of the Dead".Still there are some enjoyable moments to be found here.There's one reasonably creepy sequence in the mansion near the beginning.The sequence where several characters are trapped in the bright,shiny corridor with a deadly laser beam is the highlight of the film and contains one of the coolest and most unexpected decapitations I've seen in awhile.The battle between Milla Jovovich and creepy dogs is also excellent.The climax is okay and it leaves the door wide open for a sequel.The film is well-made and looks really nice,but the lack of gore can't be forgiven.However there are better zombie movies with plenty of red stuff out there for example "Zombi 2","Burial Ground","The Beyond",Romero's "Living Dead" trilogy,"Flesheater","Meat Market" series etc.The game is also a lot more scarier-if you want a really good,albeit forgotten horror film which is quite similar to the first "Resident Evil" game,please check out "Scarecrows"(1988).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fan of The Games or Not, This Movie Still Sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil video game series and zombie movies. Now, while I could start off this review criticizing the movie for having almost nothing to do with the games, I won't because that is the least of this movies problems. If you've ever wondered why video game movies suck, look no further than Resident Evil.Every problem that a video game movie has ever had is here. A thin plot, bad acting, lazy directing, crappy dialouge, bad effects, I think you get my point. Now, as with most video game movies, the flaws I mentioned about were to be expected and I figured that the movie would at least have some good zombie action. I couldn't have been more wrong! The action in this film is so bag it's almost laughable. Most of the action consist of generic shoot em up scenes and slow motion martial arts type fighting with Milla Jovovich. Thanks to the lazy directing of Paul W.S Anderson, the film is incredibly boring and every scene consist of the same repetitive set up. Characters walk slowly through hallway, predictable zombie jump scare, characters kill zombie, repeat. It grows tiresome fast and I wanted to shut the movie off about halfway through I was so bored. While watching, I was actually shocked by the fact that these movies actually have a pretty big fan-base of people who actually think the story here is good and the characters are interesting. The only positive things I can say about the movie is that it does have a good setup and Mila Jovovich looks hot as hell.Despite most of them being duds, I do believe it's possible to make a good video game movie. Resident Evil however, is only going to convince people that it's more impossible than it was before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this movie is not really a bad one, its just that its not a good Resident Evil movie, the story came out of nowhere and Anderson screwed up the whole storyline, as a Resident Evil fan, the movie is horrible, as an action fan i must say its not bad, but not great. Alice is a copy of Alexia Ashford and Jill Valentine, and making her the MAIN character, and with powers and stuff like that, just damage the Residenr Evil saga, because it isn't even close to the Resident Evil storyline. Making a guy called Spence the responsible of the outbreak its even more stupid, no one was the responsible in the actual storyline. The squad that went to the mansion it's just plain wrong, and contradicts the sequel, because in it they talk about Jill Valentine being right about the zombies, but... in the storyline movie Jill never went to the mansion!!, that was in the Resident Evil original video game!, not in the first movie!, the S.T.A.R.S. went to the mansion in the first game, but in the movie it was some kind of squad, that, like the rest of the characters, came out of nowhere. One more thing... the Licker its just a mutant zombie, the mutation of the Crimson Heads, that are already mutated zombies... and... here is like a mutant of some kind that has the NE-T Virus in it?, well, another mistake and a waste of the good Tyrant, the monster boss of the original Resident Evil. I forgot some mistakes, but if i put every mistake of the movie here the message would last forever Concluding: well, the movie its not really bad by itself, but using the name of an awesome video game saga and telling a whole different story its like Tomb Raider, Super Mario Bros and Street Fighter being good movies... but the aren't, they are just movies screwing up the whole history of their respective sagas... and that's exactly what happens here: Regular action movie; Horrible, Awful, Stupid Resident Evil movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst video game adaptations .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing this review just to comment that I don't agree with all the comments that say that it was one of the best adaptations of a game into a movie . What is more ,I think that I didn't make any justice to the games. First of all ,I liked the games ,but it seems that Paul W.S. Anderson ("Morta?l Kombat " ) doesn't know very much about the game except that the enemies were zombies . First ,the game have a dark and thrilling atmosphere ,while the movie prefers to replace it with a scenery closer to a sci - fi movie,being noisy and pompous about monsters ,like "Alien " with some good effects ,but isn't very thrilling . Second ,it have many irrelevant character that just appear to die one by one ,and that 's nothing original . I guess that the movie gives more importance to the visual aspect ( that doesn't have many similarities with the game ) but in general lines it's a empty and irrelevant movie that have too many elements in common with many other movies . But it isn't a accurate adaptation of the game . the good things : the cast was great . Milla Jovovich is perfect as Alice ,the heroine . The same is for Michelle Rodr?guez ,even when she made a pathetic character that just appear to die . And some effects were good . But that isn't enough to make better this movie .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about this project I was so happy, being a big fan of the resident evil franchise and being scared out of my mind playing the games, I wanted to be the first at the door of the local cinema to see it. It was the worst "horror" film I have ever seen in my life. It was not scary, the plot didn't make any sense and when the end came and left open for a sequel I nearly hit the roof. Where was the mansion with deadly traps? Where was the BAD-ASS Albert Wesker? Where has gun-nut Barry Burton? What the hell was the Queen? a spoilt little brat inside a computer, even for a computer I think it needed acting lessons. The only decent actor/character in the whole film was Colin Salmon, even he didn't make it. I have never been a fan of Paul W.S Anderson (makes you think what W.S stands for) and from now on I am never gonna see, play or even look at anything with Resident evil on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" is a LOT better than I ever hoped it would be and, even though it still isn't a very good movie, that's quite a big compliment. It's based on a video game (Capcom's hugely successful video game, to be more specific) and usually that's not a very good sign, since all those game-based horror movies have absolutely no story construction and the special effects as well as the set pieces always look far too hectic. "Resident Evil" looks good, very good even, and the story is surprisingly endurable, despite being first-class nonsense of course. The film is also very gory and action-packed but the only thing it totally hasn't got are genuine frights. And I heard that rather disappointed the fans of the game (personally, I never played it) because that is generally acclaimed to be really terrifying with disturbing images and unsettling graphics. The movie opens bustling and to-the-point, with employers of the Umbrella Corporation (a company that pretty much took over the world economy at the beginning of the 21st century) getting trapped after the outbreak of a dangerous virus. The large building complex ? referred to as "the Hive" ? is located underground and a team of heavily armed commandos, accompanied by two security guards with amnesia, have to invade it for further investigation. Once inside the Hive, the team encounters many unpleasant surprises like zombie-employers, mutant Dobermans, hi-tech anti-burglary measures and a top-secret army project with a gigantic tongue! After the captivating opening, "Resident Evil" rapidly turns into a routine horror/action movie with blunt characters and atrocious dialogues. Paul W.S. Anderson borrows many ideas and style-aspects from other genre films, like "The Matrix", "Aliens" and George A. Romero's trilogy of the Dead. Michelle Rodriguez and Milla Jovovich are tolerable as the tough girls, but they work too hard on their bad-ass-image. Would a smile, if only a little one, have hurt them? The rest of the cast is filled with adequate performers even though they'll most likely never get a star on Hollywood Boulevard. Anderson's directing skills have obviously improved since "Mortal Kombat" and "Event Horizon", as this accomplishment looks a lot more surefooted. "Resident Evil" is a very watchable film but I still don't regret having waited patiently to see it until it aired on television. There are a handful of admirable moments (my favorite remains the death-by-laser scene) but overall it remains a boisterous mess.</fullReview>

Anderson was directing, I kinda knew what was coming. I mean, let's face it; his directing skills are just as bad as a dead dogs breath... The eerie music, spooky atmosphere, great characters and fine story which the first game contained was completely gone in the film. Andersons attempt to scare and entertain us failed on every level possible. I almost feel sorry for him, but mostly, I feel sorry for the real fans of the games.If you want an intelligent and scary horror movie with good character development, then avoid the film at all cost - On the other hand, if you're into brainless action flicks, then this might be the ticket for you...I give this film 3/10... 1 for the nice red dress worn by Milla - and 2 for the decent portrait of the Umbrella corp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror movie with no scares, and one of the dullest "action" movies I've ever endured.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making movies based on video games is A BAD IDEA. There, I've stated the obvious. Obvious to most of us maybe, but apparently not Hollywood, who despite the fact that there has NEVER been a good one made, have done it yet again. 'Resident Evil' is "inspired" by the popular zombie butt-kicking game of the same name. A game I have never played, and after sitting through this tedious, overblown bore, never ever will. Okay, to be fair, I've been told that the movie bears little resemblance to the game. I really couldn't care less. As a movie it stinks. Obviously taking the overrated but still enjoyable 'The Matrix' as its model, 'Resident Evil' totally lacks any of the excitement and freshness of the latter movie. I think you just have to look at Paul "B.S." Anderson's CV to work out the reason why. The movie combines action and horror in such a way as to be both frenetic and dull simultaneously, and without any chills or thrills whatsoever. To make a zombie movie with absolutely NO horror in quite an achievement. Milla Jovovich best known for the dreadful sci fi mess 'The Fifth Element' is not someone who I hold a torch for. She has only been in one good movie to date ('Dazed And Confused'), and I can hardly remember who she played in it. She is without doubt a beautiful woman, but I can't think of any other reason to praise her. Milla's sidekick is played by the spunky Michelle Rodriguez who impressed me in her debut 'Girlfight', but who has made lame action movies ever since. Her character here is a walking cliche, a kick ass tough talking Latina seemingly cloned from the one played by Jenette Goldstein in James Cameron's 'Aliens', a movie which is ten times more exciting than this. The only other actor I recognized in the cast was Eric Mabius ('Welcome To The Dollhouse'), but hell, I was battling to stay awake throughout. I nearly gave up after the first twenty minutes, but decided I must at least watch until the supposedly "classic" doberman scene, which turned out to a snooze. After that things didn't get any better. If you want to see a genuinely scary zombie movie try some Romero or Fulci classics, or the underrated 'Living Dead At Manchester Morgue', and if you want to see a thrilling and engrossing SF death trap thriller go no further than 'Cube' (or pick up a copy of Algis Budrys' classic 'Rogue Moon'). If you want to play Resident Evil play Resident Evil, just don't bother sitting through this garbage. My Mum always said that watching TV will rot your brain, and if this movie is in your DVD or video playing I say she's hit the nail on the head!</fullReview>

A trained team of commando's have to break into a facility to find out why the computer running the place killed everyone inside. What they find when they turn the computer off is that the computer was trying to hold back scores of zombies and other creepy things. The plot isn't anything original, but the movie is performed to perfection. Not as good though as classic zombie movies like Dawn of the Dead and such it still entertains. My main complaint is they killed the leader of the commandos to quickly he was my favorite character (the poor guy didn't even get to be killed by zombies, but really cool lasers).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... to ever be exposed to celluloid.SOME SPOILERSResident Evil follows the cliché and the stereotype right smack-in-your-face down to the letter. Excusing the fact that this is yet again another blatant Aliens hack, what we have here is one tough chick with a questionable past leading a bunch of commandos (except her reason was never explained clearly) into ground zero of monster-infested territory. All sound familiar?Paul Anderson shows once again what he does best and that is try to rip off past successful horror-action flicks with high budget slick special effects and show absolute no regard to continuity or a plot that makes sense. Good God the amount of crap that was displayed on the screen. We have plenty of cannon-fodder here who wander off for no apparent reason (other then being plain stupid) to be chomped on by zombies that appear out of the blue (and disappear just as quickly) or diced up by slick special effect laser beams! This happens way too often by the way. We have also the, err, undead themselves that seem impervious to close range 9mm rounds, but yet some skinny supermodel actress knocks them out with martial arts? Speaking of undead, the story itself how they were created is pretty hilarious. It's not really the virus as some of veteran gamers of the series believe. It's really this evil machine that went HAL9000 on its or hers or whatever folks. Funny stuff!To add to the camp factor, we also get to have a sex scene. Simply can't do a movie of this caliber without one. All in all, Resident Evil might seem good if you're into the mindless mayhem with bad acting and crayon written scripts like the godawful monster flicks from the Sci-Fi Channel. Otherwise, skip this crap and go for mindless mayhem with real style like Blade 2.Score: 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film with very low expectations. I enjoyed director Anderson's sc-fi horror movie 'Event Horizon', but 'Mortal Kombat' and 'Shopping' were just terrible. I then heard that they had rejected horror mastermind George Romero's script, and that Anderson's script used amnesia as a major plot device. Tip: Amnesia = sucky script.I was pleasantly surprised, however, as I began watching the movie. It was by no means great cinema, but it was entertaining. It was definitely familiar ground, ripping off Cameron's 'Aliens' and Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead', among other films, but you could easily get into the stylish, mtv-speed movie. The only distraction from enjoying the movie was the way the team got separated and then back together again for no logical reason ("Where's the rest of the team?" "I dunno, we lost them!"). The only distraction, that is, until the ending.SPOILER WARNING:Then, when I was really enjoying the movie, the ending happened. Remember the ending to 2001's summer blockbuster, 'Planet of the Apes'? Remember how it felt convoluted, like it had been tacked onto the end of the film? 'Resident Evil' has an ending that makes that ending look predictable. It makes no sense! It was Twilight-Zone-esque, except that it was really very stupid. We're supposed to believe that several days have passed between her falling asleep and waking up? Why did Umbrella take her to the public hospital? How were they able to take them at all? Why weren't there zombies roaming the streets? How did the virus get out? What happened to the hunk?The whole ending felt like they were trying to shock the audience, and pave the way for a sequel. Lame, guys! Just because an ending is predictable doesn't mean it's bad! It can be comforting to see the guy get the girl (or in this case girl get the guy) and save the world. Oh, I'm all for surprise endings, but not when they don't make any sense! This movie left a bad taste in my mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This goes to show what schlock Paul Anderson creates when you give him a couple of millions dollars and free reign to write up a script that insults even the perosn with subzero IQs. Resident Evil should as well be called Scream if you saw Resident Hack Last Summer. I mean for crying out loud every single dumb horror movie cliche is done here. It's like watching Scary Movie all over again. LOL.Really the only people who keep claiming this movie is the best video game to movie translation are the same people who also claim Final Fantasy as the best video game to movie translation. Yeah okay, there goes your credibility there.Gag meter: -23422 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A really boring and dull movie. Cheap and unconvincing special effects. Lame actors. No plot. An awful soundtrack. Simply put, this is a very boring movie. There is nothing to say about the plot, because there is none. Almost no gore, and no suspense either. Doesn't deserve to be called a zombie flick. It almost feels like Uwe Boll directed this crap. It was almost as boring and lame as Alone in the dark. The first ten minutes the movie feels a bit interesting, but it goes downhill after that. There are no characters to care about. Nothing. At the end of the movie I totally lost interest and nearly didn't make it through the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cant believe i just wasted about an hour and a half of my day to watch a crappy movie which was based on a game. Now, i have played the game and it is quite good, maybe if the story was based on the story from the game but no, it wasn't. They changed the story which is one of the best bits of the game.This movie is obviously for the people who don't watch many horror films and who don't play any games.I personally thought it was crap and even though i am eager to watch the sequel (to see if they stuck to the storyline a bit more, which i highly doubt) i am still going to say it once more.This movie is for people who want simple story lines and who want no explanations at all.. For people who haven't played the game and for people who don't watch horror films...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil: The Movie is just a waste of what could have been a great adaption if stayed true to plot of the original game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is pathetic. Anderson has bought to life a boring, stereotypical 'blockbuster' type film which is an insult to the original games. Being a huge fan of the games, by the way, dating back to 1996 when it was first released, I know what I'm talking about. In this film, Anderson has developed his own ideas into the world of Resident Evil and created what's known as 'The Hive'; a 'never heard of before' top secret laboratory located in a beehive-like facility under Racoon City. First off, I must admit, that the beginning of the film is impressive - with the suspenseful clip of the virus being handled by a white suited scientist provoking fear and excitement. Also the introduction of the 'Umbrella'Corporation is pretty interesting. The whole idea could've worked, I suppose, if Anderson had made the trademark zombies look moreterrifying than just using extras with bluish coloured skin and tomato sauce slathered across their face, uttering 'Ohhh, Ahhh' and walking like they're either elderly or disabled. The 'Licker' in this movie looks like a bloody cartoon! I almost laughed at the image of it eating that dude on camera, it looked ridiculous. Also, Anderson used what looked like Dobermans' covered in a layer of barbecue sauce to portray the 'Cerberus'; which again, I laughed at when I saw it at the cinema. There's not even mention of a Tyrant in this film, which is again, a total disappointment, as Tyrant's are the the ultimate enemy in each and every Resident Evil game. Anderson should have based this film upon the original video game. Somewhere dark, haunted, in an old mansion. He should have used zombies that looked like decomposing corpses, which sound like a bag of crushing bones with each step they take, instead of stupid people with blue makeup running around sounding as though they're having an orgasm. Characters from the video games would have also been nice in this film, however Anderson, in his own little stupid world, creates 'Alice' and a bunch of commandos who invade 'The Hive' and then just try and escape again. In conclusion, I'd like to state that I truly believe this film (and later its sequel Apocalypse) could have been a lot more successful in they stayed true to original plots of the first and second games. I would have enjoyed to see that Spencer mansion explored much better than the Hive, and would have been more excited and scared by watching zombies that actually look dead and that are frightening. I don't think it was necessary for Anderson to make this into another stereotyped blockbuster film, as it already had an incredibly strong fan base and would have become a cult classic if it told the story of Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield's survival within the Spencer Mansion in Resident Evil 1. I wouldn't recommend it to any one who is a fan of the games as it's insulting and you'll only end up being frustrated at Anderson's lack of respect to the games' honour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A virus that turns people into zombies is released inside a secret research facility. A couple of expert (I'll use the term lightly) soldiers are sent in to retrieve... something... I can't remember what it was, but I'm sure it isn't very important. Along with them are two amnesiacs and some other guy. Once inside, they have a limited time to get out again. Unfortunately, the dead have risen and zombie bashing ensues.You can't expect too much of a film based on a video game, but all the same - Resident Evil feels pretty sloppy. It has got a low budget feel to it, just witness the sparse settings, dodgy effects, and amateur make up. There isn't much in the way of character development either, so it's not easy to give a damn what happens to them. Also, it's not good when there are numerous plot holes in a film with little plot to begin with.There is a distinct lack of action as well. It takes close to half the film before any zombies show up, and even then it's just some erratic shooting accompanied by too fast editing and deafening rock music. There's not a lot of gore and blood either, which isn't good considering that it's a zombie film after all.It's not the worse film ever made - the premise is quite good, but wasted - but it resembles too many other films, and fails to show anything new or even remotely exciting. Milla Jovovich does her best with what little she's given, but she deserved better. Obviously, director and screenwriter Anderson doesn't have what it takes to put together even a half decent video-game film. There are worse films out there, but that doesn't mean that there's any reason to see this one. [1/10]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was terrible by any standards. As a stand alone film it just lacks any dramatic tension or suspense. As a film of the game it doesn't work on practically any level. It has a completely different atmosphere, cast of characters and plot to the game. With most computer games you might think that this is acceptable, but resident evil was so great because it actually had a good plot and atmosphere, it was a pastiche of zombie horror movies such as dawn of the dead and evil dead (old mansion out in the woods). This movie has none of the values of the original games or movies, its a true popcorn movie, by the end you feel like you have eaten so much rubbish that your burps smell funny and you feel like you are going to be sick. Anderson destroyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil. Ahh, such a good videogame collection. I got into Resident Evil about 3 or 4 years ago, when I played Resident Evil 2. Then Resident Evil 3. Last Christmas, I finally played Resident Evil. Easter, I played Resident Evil 0. I know, that's not them all, but those are what I have played. An absolutely great videogame collection.Why am I saying this when I'm supposed to be reviewing the film? Because I just want you to know that I love Resident Evil. The games that is. The following review may make you think I don't like Resident Evil. I only hate the film. I love the games. Shall I begin then?Now, I warn you here that there are Spoilers, but in case someone misses this line:[SPOILER ALERT]Okay, when we start, we get some labs and some idiots getting themselves killed inside a lab. This can almost make you think that we're about to get a good film. The scene is relatively well done but with the dash of stupidity in it here and there. Not bad this scene though.Sadly, once we get to the Mansion, this hope slowly dissipates. Now we get the overused "Black Opps come in to do their thing". They want to go to the Labs and do some stuff that I can't really be bothered to remember because if you've seen it once and didn't like it, you won't want to see it again.Once they get there, they couldn't come up with any ideas about how to kill off the only good characters in a scene creuly ripped from Cube! And not only that there is a MAJOR goof up in that scene! There is space at either end that could be used to hide in so as to not get killed by a Laser! But they kill the character's off anyway.The rest of the film sees poorly crafted Zombies with what looks like bits of vegetable stuck to their heads and other poor effects. I wouldn't go into detail but I feel I want to.The Zombies we see look like malnourished staffworkers and don't even have the decent Resident Evil Zombie stumble. They don't even have flesh hanging off! I'm sorry if this is too vivid or soemthing, but I've got a Resident Evil Remake Poster and I see a Zombie with skin flaking. The fact that Romero didn't Greenlight it cost it. Greatly. Romero is, in my opinion, the god of Zombie Films, especially when teamed with Tom Savini's high quality special effects. Sadly, Anderson had neither.Anderson claims that they were to look like they were desiesed and that by putting make-up on the main areas of the body and to make them look like they inhaled tyhe virus and yadda yadda yadda. They aren't diseased anymore, moron! They're dead! They died! The chemical has kept them animated! They aren't diseased anmore, they're descesed!But back on the subject of effects, you must recall the sound effects of the Zombies in Resident Evil, the Games. The raspy moans, the sound of mutilated flesh merged with torn cloth being dragged along a corridor. Suddenly, we have a bunch of people wearing special effects rediculously (Wounds that look like they cut deep into the Flesh but completely clean around it doesn't look right) that make hissing, not groans, hissing!Now, I have to say something about the actual plot. Okay, not even a reference to a Character from ANY of the games in this film. There's barely a reference to Resident Evil. Racoon City is mentioned about TWICE in the entire film, despite this being the one of the places we see most of. Look at it this way:Resident Evil: Okay, this was set on the Outskirts in a Mansion that Anderson never heard of.Resident Evil 2: It starts on the streets of where? Why, Racon City. Where are you most of the game? The RPD Building, ofcourse.Resident Evil 3: You spend most of the game wandering and figthing on the very streets of Racoon in RE3 and you don't leave Racoon until the end.I don't know about Resident Evil: Codename Veronica really, but I think it is set elsewhere so my point is not of use here.Suddenly, we have this Secret Lab under Racoon City that was never mentioned or visited in a game. Did Anderson even play Resident Evil 1 for longer then 5 Minutes?"So this here is the Hive under some Mansion that suddenly exists in some Mountains. Don't know what the Mountains are called cos I played the game for 5 miutes. I'm sorry, what? Spencer Estate? What is that? Ar..klay...Moun..tains? Are they part of the Andes or something?"And we also have someone who is about as close as we can get to everyone's favourite G-Virus Securing Guy, Hunk. Obviously, the guys who made this film had't played Hunk's Bonus Scenario, but heard a little about a Black Commando securing a Virus. Now, may I point out that these people obviously got killed by the first Licker in Resident Evil 2 and assumed it was a boss so stuck a Licker in and made it look awful in appearance but scare the characters. And I admit to this. Lickers are scary. But most of the time, people are smart enough to shoot them, removing the fear, unless they, for example, jump through a window the first time you've played Resident Evil 2. And how come we haven't even a mentioning of Wesker or Birkin, who not only did much work on the T-Virus but also (Brikin) worked on the G-Virus, yet no mention of the G-Virus or the T-Virus?Now, I'd like to have my say on the Special Effects? *cough*bunch-a-hacks*cough*. They stole from Cube to kill off probably the only good Character/s in the film. But I won't dwell on that bit. I want to dwell on the pathetic creature effects. Creature effects are present? What the hell? Running up a wall to kill a Cerberus by kicking it in the head?"Er..Plot Hole Designer Guy, you did a good job of explaining why this gal can run up walls and rip off the Matrix! Here's a bonus!"And it kills the dog! Easy as that! How stupid can you get!?Now, she goes through 1 Clip and kills ALL those dogs? That's about 2 or less Bullets a Dog. Now, I don't recall EVER having the pleasure of only using 2 shots to kill a Cerberus. Ever. Another thing is that 1/3 of the time, the Dogs looked like Dogs that had been covered in Tomato Skins, another 1/3 of the time, they were horribly shiny turds of CGI that never once looked real and the final 1/3 they were just heads on sticks (They're supposed to be growling. All they do is stay VERY still and stare which can only really mean heads on sticks). The Licker didn't even look realistic. It was too shiny. And too...non...Lickery. It barely looked or acted like a Licker. Licker's are smart, stealthy and dangerous. Remember in Resident Evil 2 when you're in the interogation room? One (Or two, I think) jumped through the window, scaring the hell out of you and showing they're smart enough to use the Camoflauge of the mirror to catch you off guard. Hmmm...Licker just hits at the window. Later it has its tongue stuck down? It's tongue is strong, I beleive, and acutally may have torn itself off insted of just getting stuck there. And it's Claws did what for it's escape? It didn't try attacking anyone, pulling the thing out or tear through its tongue. And what it did? Pulled and flailed a bit. Pathetic. Fullstop.The end of the film is even worse. Why would they want some moron who I don't even think has a name and I couldn't care for the Nemesis Project just because he got a nasty scratch on his arm when the Red Ape (It doesn't deserve the title of Licker. Lickers scared me. This thing looks more like a mobile piece of muscular jelly) cut it. I got cut loads of times in Resident Evil 2 by Lickers. I must have been scratched atleast 8 times by Lickers through the game but I'm not turning into Nemesis. And why wouldn't the other anonymous character (According to Behind-the-scenes her name is Alice. Not that I noticed. I don't recall her name being used in the entire film) just get the Vaccine into him? And Umbrella are better at getting subjects, they don't use failing, flailing actors.I hated this film. These people don't deserve to ever make a film together ever again. I absolutely refuse to watch this ever again. I would sooner boil my Head in a Deep Fat Fryer, stab myself in the Chest wth a Turkey Carver and then watch Coronation Street insted of phoning an Ambulance whlist my House was on fire then watch this film again! It is akin to NotLD 30th Aniversairy Special. It was utterly awful . And it had something it was based on that was simply excellence (I own the original NotLD, both in Black and White and Colour). I kid you not though, Resident Evil the film is THE worst film I have ever seen apart from Total Reality (And that sells on DVD for about ?1.29. And it is shoved into Computer Games Sections at Game just to get rid of the damn thing!). I apologise to any fans of the films (NothLD 30th Anniversairy, Total Reality and "Resident Evil") but that is how much I hated this film.If you were thinking about buying this film, take your money, save up, and buy either the Resident Evil Remake or Resident Evil 0 (It may leave a few Plot Holes but this is Good! VERY GOOD! I know, I've played it.) and if you don't have a Gamecube but love Resident Evil, buy one and never regret it. Resident Evil (The Film) deserves to be only found pushed to the bottom of Bargain Bins for 99p. And that should only be worth the Empty Box. The Film itself is worthless. This isn't Resident Evil. This is just a bunch of useless idiots trying to cash in on a well loved franchise by using Zombies and Models wearing pathetic clothing amongst bad actors and pathetic looking Zombies. Never, ever, ever watch this film if you have EVER played a Resident Evil Game or even seen a Zombie film and liked them. And the only really good film Anderson made was EVENT HORIZON. Atleast that was any good.0 out of 10. I'm even inclined to say 0 out of infinite!</fullReview>

The subject matter has so much potential which is evident in the games. This could have easily been rated PG-13 if there was one less "f**k" and if the producers didn't want you to think the movie had to be good cuz it was rated R. The most fun had with this movie was when me and my friends were watching it and making fun of all the crappy acting and story. Michelle Rodruguaeauss or however you spell her name..(I'm too lazy to check) always has a scowl on her face like she just smelled something really bad...maybe it would make sense if there were some damn corpses there but there is hardly any gore. And when she says "When I get outta her I gotta get laid"(or something like that I was laughing to hard to remember.). Well good luck with a scowl like that...ewwwww. Or maybe she was scowling cuz she knew how bad this movie would be and that her carear would be in limbo..doomed to be in awful movies like blue crush crush for the rest of her life. bad bad movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is NOT Resident Evil...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a thought: if you're going to make a movie about zombies, put them in more than two scenes. I am not a big video game buff, but I'm familiar enough with the first two RE games to know that they were scary as hell, had fantastic atmosphere, and much better characters than this piece of trash. Guys- all you had to do was stick to the games! Most of the audience has never played them and you could have thrown in enough surprises for those that had. There is not one suspenseful/scary/emotional scene in this big empty glitter ball of a movie. There's also a surprising lack of gore for a zombie film. And the zombies themselves are laughable...not frightening. At some points you might be confused as to who's a zombie and who isn't because the human characters get about as much development as their undead enemies. Let's start with Alice played by Milla Jovovich. Being that she wakes up with total amnesia, how in the hell are we supposed to give a rats ass about her? Just bc she looks hot in a little red dress? Give me a break. Then there's the cookie cutter cliche group of soldiers. Note to Michelle Rodriguez: wearing a permanent scowl and rolling your eyes halfway back into your head does not make you look tough... it makes you annoying. If she made that "tough bitch" face one more time in this film I was going to scream. Eric Mabius has gone from great films (Black Circle Boys, Welcome to the Dollhouse) to all out crap (The Crow: Salvation). Eric, you're a talented boy... stop sinking so low.What is redeeming about this movie? Not a damn thing. The special effects are horrid, the zombies look lame, and there is no sense of dread or danger that the games handle so masterfully. What's the most tragic is that this movie had so much potential. Instead of sticking to its source material they decided to make a horrible little genre pic and stick the RE name on it. Oh, and the film boasts one the single most irritating commentary track you'll ever hear. At one point the director says this isn't a zombie movie. Then Mr. Anderson, you should have let someone who thought it was take the reigns of the film bc it's based on A ZOMBIE GAME. And I have completely lost all respect for the very unintelligent Ms. Jovovich who doesn't even understand how a commentary works until twenty minutes into the whole thing. In a word: insipid. Look it up. If I dislike the movie before the commentary, I HATED it afterwards.Few so-called horror films have ever been this uncreative... and given some of the garbage that's come out lately that's a hard thing to achieve. The bottom line is the movie is not scary. You can throw in the train from RE2... you can plaster some walls with Umbrella logo... hell, give us a few undead dobermans... but that a good RE film does not make. There is no tension, creepy atmosphere, or any believable threat. Fans of the game should skip this travesty. Those unfamiliar with it should not expect anything more than your typical Hollywood, soul-less, no IQ horror/action film. It's too bad original director George Romero wasn't behind the camera. Oh, what might have been...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the worst film I've ever seen and I've seen Batman &amp; Robin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is awful and Paul Anderson (Not to be confused with Paul Thomas Anderson, who is a much more talented director and even though I don't like his movies I at least appreciate that he knows how to tell a story)has accomplished a great feat by making this movie bad on so many different levels: the plot, the dialogue, the special effects, the acting, the characterization, the gratuitous nudity (while appreciated by the men in the audience was no way justified). If only one of these aspects had been at fault I could have looked past it but unfortunately nothing was handled well. Firstly in an age of digital effects like those seen in Lord of the rings and Spider-man audiences have come to expect good effects not Zombies created with a bit of green make-up and dogs covered in tinned spaghetti the one digital effect they did spend any money on looked like it was created on an etchasketch, I was more impressed with the graphics in the game than the film. I understand the budget was fairly low but even low-budget horror movies have still managed to produce genuinely scaring looking effects, one only has to watch "From Dusk 'til Dawn" or "The Evil Dead" to see that.The plot's only good point was that it was an original piece of work with nothing I could see taken from the game apart from some of the names and monsters, but if you took away the dogs, the licker, the umbrella corporation and racoon city and called the virus the U-virus or something similar then nothing would remind you even slightly of the game, which can sometimes be a good thing if the writer can come up with an original story better than the one in the game, but he can't, it's predictable (you know who the bad guy is after the first 15 minutes) there is no suspense other than that created by the overly loud sound-track which accompanies ever scare so you can hear the "surprise" coming every time. In an age of self-knowing films like "Scream" it's hard to believe that it takes the characters the entire length of the film to realize their in trouble and I'm pretty sure the word Zombie isn't mentioned once. This may have been a conscious decision to avoid getting called a "typical zombie movie" but that is exactly what the film is so why try and disguise it, there are gaping plot holes that the dialogue tries to cover over but fails, such as how the virus goes from an airborne virus, which would presumably affect the squad, to a contact transmitted one even though the virus clearly needs to be injected into rabbits and it would surely make sense to stay as an airborne virus to reach as many hosts as possible or to engineer it so that it couldn't become airborne from a safety point of view not change from one to the other as it felt like it. The dialogue could have been written by a child it was that simple and very stupid there was no wit, which is a well established feature of this type of movie and of life in general, but none of the characters display this "laugh in the face of danger" attitude audiences have come to expect and enjoy. I have read the George Romero Script on the net (although there is no guarantee it was actually written by Romero) and whoever actually did write it isn't important as it is much better than the film, even in it's first draft stage. The numerous characters are all given enough dialogue to give you a 3-dimensional feel to them and all are dealt with in a fitting way, the story is close to the game but still entertaining and suspenseful, the creatures are well used and fit in to the story aptly and while it would have required a much bigger budget it would have saved me the 2hrs of boredom sitting through the filmed version gave. Maybe it is unfair to criticize the acting considering the material they had but nobody made the most of it and there was never any sense that they were real people but instead objects to be dispatched by various badly conceived monsters and awful special effects. I can only imagine all the actors involved pleading to be killed off. How Mila Jovovich gets away with showing so much flesh in her movies including this one is a question I'd like answered especially when it is so unnecessary. I wasn't the only person in the audience who laughed out loud at some of the terrible scenes in this film and I can only hope that Paul Anderson isn't allowed to make any more films although with him already signed on for Resident Evil 2 it seems the movie going public will be bored by his awful movies for many years to come. An man sitting behind me in the cinema commented, once the film had finished, that it was "The best film I've ever seen" I can only assume this was the first film this person had ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A secret experiment. A deadly virus. A fatal mistake. A bad movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING! This WILL contain SPOILERS. Please read no further if you don't want to be spoiled... Anyhow, first things first. I'm not sure how so many people enjoyed this movie, as it was rather bad. The movie starts promising, but quickly takes a turn for the worse. The idea for the story is good, but it was horribly put together. There was very little dialogue, and what little there was seemed to be yelling and swearing when a zombie appears. When the preview shows people almost getting killed, that's exactly what you see in the movie. When someone is about to be killed, the camera cuts away, and you hear a splat-type sound. I'm not sure why people say this is so bloody, as there was barely any. There were absolutely no scary parts, and certain portions were just plain boring. I saw this at a 50 cent theater, and at least 25 people left during the movie. I wanted to, but I thought it had to get better. MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD : Well, eventually, the group of people dwindles from around 8 (I think) to the final two. Yep. Everyone dies except two of them. At the end, as the last two leave the nest, they are both taken away for "questioning" or something. The scene cuts to later and the girl is alone in a room. She makes her way outside to find that the zombies have killed everyone in town. She stands alone with a gun, and the camera zooms out, preparing the audience (what's left of them) for a sequel that nobody in their right mind would go see.This was a horrible movie to say the least, and unless you're a 13 year old who is obsessed with the video games, you probably won't like this flick. (Although you may just want to check out the "worst movie ever.") Ha ha ha!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Dreadful: Appalling video game film as vivacious as a rabbit punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost a year ago, I compared the two video-game movies "Tomb Raider" and "Final Fantasy" to Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston, respectively, because "Raider" had annihilated "Fantasy" in the summer box office race.Now the latest to step between the ropes is "Resident Evil," also based on a popular game series, and it's easily the Mike Tyson of this genre. You're probably thinking, why? Is it a heavy hitter that boasts a knockout punch? A movie that mows down everything in its path and leaves the audience awed and asking for more? Not even close. Simply put, it's because it bites.What's wrong with this film can be summed up in one word. Everything. "Resident Evil" is a painful, slow-moving exercise in sheer torment for every single one of its 100 minutes. Never before have I groaned in agony, buried my face in my hands and shook my head in disbelief so often in a single movie. "Evil" is so horrible, it should be used by police as a confession extractor. There is not one redeeming quality to be found whatsoever.Is it frightening at all? Yes, it will be for those who go into this dreck expecting menial details like a decent story and acting.Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson (not Paul Thomas Anderson of "Magnolia" fame), spun straw into gold with "Mortal Kombat," but doesn't make lightning strike twice as he again eschews a competent script in favor of flashy visuals. In this case, it's gunfire, zombies, short dresses, speech-drowning music, poorly developed characters, bad editing, plus more gunfire and more zombies. "Evil's" lethargically-paced wreck of a plot is composed of long sequences showing people skulking through quiet, deserted locations, looking alarmed at every little sound, before unleashing loads of ammunition. Then the process is repeated minutes later."Evil" opens with an explanation of how scientists and workers at an underground laboratory called "The Hive" are suddenly exposed to deadly chemicals that look like neon mattress springs. This biological disaster has transformed everyone into ? surprise! ? flesh-eating zombies. (What were you expecting, the Rockettes?) Responsible for this havoc is the Hive's supercomputer, dubbed the "Red Queen," who sounds like a high-pitched HAL and is represented visually as a small holographic girl. Don't ask.Enter Alice (Milla Jovovich), an amnesiac since collapsing unconscious in her shower. After changing into a Sturgis chic outfit of a very short red dress and very tall black boots, she spends an eternity investigating a huge mansion before abruptly being captured by a team of soldiers and taken to the Hive, where she's joined by another hostage, Matt (Eric Mabius), plus old flame Spence (James Purefoy) and tough-chick cop Rain (Michelle Rodriguez). As if you couldn't guess already, they combine forces to investigate the Hive and fight off the unimposing zombies, whose extent of a makeup job looks nothing more than having their faces covered in flour with a blood capsule to chew on. (They can also survive as much as five gunshots, yet are instantly dispatched by the undersized fists and feet of the female leads.)The pasty-faced automatons express more excitement than the actors who sleepwalk through their equally lifeless roles. Purefoy is the lone player who isn't a total laughingstock. Mabius is gifted with lines like "She's right...we're gonna die here," in between repeatedly shouting the F-word for no reason. As usual, Rodriguez simply overexerts herself: "After this...I'm gonna go get laid." Her face is again frozen in her trademark head-down, eyes-up sneer. (Does her head slope downward because her protruding lower lip adds extra weight to it?) Entertainment Weekly recently stated that Jovovich "could be a knife collection away from becoming the next Angelina Jolie." It seems they forgot a few things: marketability, athleticism, and charisma. Little details like that. Jovovich doesn't yet have the star power to successfully carry a movie on her own. She sees only a mere thread of action in the whole film, including the much-publicized and dopey sequence in which she battles Dobermans who look like they've been doused in spaghetti sauce. She is stone-faced in a majority of her scenes, and lacks vitality in any physical activity such as firing a gun or fighting off the zombies. When she does emote, it's in a silly moment where she pleads with a wounded soldier who insists on being left behind. Anderson tries to hide the lack of depth in the script by constantly putting characters in compromising positions in order to utilize the ever-predictable jump-scare tactic. They're always reaching a hand out conveniently close to something that, in turn, you know will suddenly grab them. Plot expositions suddenly pop out of the blue, courtesy of cumbersome flashback sequences as Alice gradually regains her memory. Considering its intense buildup, the monster known as "The Licker" has no impact on the film at all. And on a local note, what was up with the San Francisco backdrop if the film takes place in (fictitious) Raccoon City?The worst part of "Evil" is courtesy of editor Alexander Berner. After a despondent scene where Alice and Spence hover pensively over the body of a main character's relative for several minutes in an empty office, the very next shot is a jump cut of them frantically running for their lives in a totally different location before pushing through a door and slamming it shut. I sat aghast as I wondered how the director could be so blind to allow such an ugly transition to get into the final print. Capping off this unabashed embarrassment is a miserable ending so obvious in touting ? God help us ? a sequel, that it might as well have been announced in huge letters on the screen. Listen up. There is an outstanding movie called "Tomb Raider." Buy it. It has a plot. It has a script. It has exhilarating characters. It has a brain. It was the best film of 2001. And it is more than light years ahead of this apathetic mess. To call "Resident Evil" a better film in any regard is sacrilegious. It's like saying the Cowsills are a better rock group than the Beatles. Keep your distance unless you are willing to sit and be tortured into submission for an hour and a half. I have spoken and you have been warned. 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, AVP: Alien vs. Predator, Death Race, Pompeii), I had always heard of the popular zombie survival horror video games series, and I had enjoyed the George A. Romero Living Dead films, I was hoping for the same entertainment with this video game based film. Basically the film starts in the secret underground laboratory located beneath Raccoon City, called The Hive, owned by the Umbrella Corporation, an accident occurs and a deadly chemical called the T-Virus is released into the facility, the artificial intelligence security system, The Red Queen, traps all workers inside to contain the infection. Alice (The Fifth Element's Milla Jovovich) awakens alone in a deserted mansion, she is suffering from short-term amnesia, she is shortly accompanied by police officer Matt Addison (Ugly Betty's Eric Mabius), before he is subdued by a military unit, sent by the Umbrella Corporation. The commandos consist of leader James "One" Shade (Colin Salmon), Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez), medic Chad Kaplan (Martin Crewes), J.D. (Pasquale Aleardi) and two others, they have been assigned to shut down the main computer and quarantine the virus, and along the way also meet fellow amnesiac Spence Parks (A Knight's Tale's James Purefoy), he was in a sham marriage with Alice, to protect the Hive's entrance. To get to the Hive the team must first travel the long underground train system to reach the facility, and pass through the various, and dangerous, security and weapon systems they unintentionally activate, including a laser defence system that slices most of the commandos into pieces. Alice and the remaining members manage to get to the circuit board containing the Red Queen system, it is deactivated and all doors are unlocked, but the team had not counted on the release of a horde of zombified people, these undead creatures were formerly the staff working inside the Hive, they have been infected by the T-Virus. After battling with these flesh hungry mutated people, Alice suggests reactivating the Red Queen who will be able to explain what happened in the Hive, the artificial intelligence explains the infection that spread, that the virus is contagious and reanimates dead bodies with an impulse, they are driven by the basic need to feed, one bite or scratch from a creature and that person will become one themselves, trauma to the head is the only way to kill them. The team try to navigate their way out of the facility and back to the train to reenter Raccoon City, but the zombies are all over the place and blocking their path, as well as mutated dogs, and an experimental beast made from evolution in human flesh, and they must also be careful not to bring the effects of the T-Virus to the surface and spread the infection further. Also starring Ryan McCluskey as Mr. Grey, Oscar Pearce as Mr. Red, Indra Ové as Ms. Black, Anna Bolt as Dr. Green, Joseph May as Dr. Blue, Heike , Makatsch as Lisa, Jaymes Butler as Clarence, Stephen Billington as Mr. White, Fiona Glascott as Ms. Gold and Jason Isaacs as Dr. William Birkin, also narrating. Jovovich is great being the kick-ass woman who slowly regains her memory and a bunch of martial arts and gun skills, Rodriguez is also feisty, the supporting cast all do well also, the special effects and makeup for the zombies, mutated things and scientific stuff are all cool, and the music by shock rocker Marilyn Mason gives the action edge, it is exciting compared to the rubbish or average sequels that followed, a great science- fiction horror action film. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have LOVED to see G.A. Romero make a comeback with a "Resident Evil" movie: zombies are his territory and he would have been able to pull some depth to it. Everything would have clicked, sure hit.INSTEAD, the producers handed R.E. to Paul "I've only directed flops" Anderson who (as we all saw) had NO originality and NO perception for this matter whatsoever. His approach reminded me of that such of a kid's in a candy store: "ooh we got to squeeze in these cool elements (the train, the dogs, the monster in the end) from the game, and we got to put in some matrix-type action and ooh I saw this cool death-scene in the beginning of "Cube" and, and... oh yeah, we need a talking computer! With a hologram!""Excuse me, mr. Anderson, but we can't fit them all into a 90-minute movie""SURE WE CAN! We just cut the suspense and the zombie on-screen time!"Yeah. Of a zombie horror movie. I don't think RE was all that bad though, a 5 out of 10 = watchable.It just p***es me off that the producers don't seem to be taking us "old school" horror fans seriously. I mean, would hiring Romero have been too big an investment? Or didn't they want the material be too controversial? With Romero this could of NOT have been less than a 7 out of 10 movie! Probably even a new "Dawn OTD"...? Definitely something to give MPAA and purists gray hair, for a long time :)What saddens me furthermore is, they'll (the producers) most likely end up screwing the upcoming Jason vs. Freddy all over: "Hey guys, we could save 10c by rewriting Alice and Tommy off! I mean, who remembers them anyway? And while we're at it, let's change Robert Englund with another actor, C'MON, NO-ONE WILL NOTICE!" Go ahead, make it a PG-13 movie while you are at it, to attract more viewers to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a disgrace to the games. The direction was crap Anderson is lazy instead of relying on suspense and atmosphere he relies on poorly executed jumps scares and you don't jump because your scared you jump because they amp the music up so loud you cant help it. There was not one genuine scare in the movie because you don't care about any of the characters they are all badly written clichés. The action was boring and stupid there was one real battle with the zombies and in it they just kept shooting them in the chest magazine after magazine in the chest I thought they were supposed to be special ops a highly trained military force and not a bunch of idiots. The scene were the lead character (who Paul Anderson for some reason thought would be a good idea to put into a tight red dress for the entire movie for no reason) jumps of the wall and kicks the dog was laughable as was most of the movie. Anderson Should be banned from film making all his movies are (in my opinion) unoriginal cheesy and stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of both George Romero's films and the original video games I found this movie to be horrible. No, I don't expect every film based on a game (or a book) to be identical to the source material. What's wrong with this film is what's been wrong with movies (especially horror) for the last fifteen years. It caters to the short attention spanned. Quick and illogical cuts peppered with bad camera tricks took me right out of this movie. One minute someone is on the ground surrounded by undead, the next he is 'edited' up onto his feet and running for his life. HUH?I thought the 1940's and 1950's had it bad with Abbott and Costello running the Universal monsters into the ground. Hey, at least their films were INTENTIONALLY funny. Resident Evil isn't even UNintentionally funny. So, with no humor, that leaves horror to carry the film, which it doesn't. Why? Because like most films of the last 15 years, it's all quick cut action with no suspense. Creating tension takes time and consistency, something most modern film makers don't seem to understand. This film plays like a commercial or a music video without music.Once again, the characters are completely unsympathetic. They say dumb things and they do dumb things. Once again, the 'modern' tough, smart, strong, cool, sexy female stomps all over the proceedings with muddy feet. SHE BOUNCES OFF A WALL AND KARATE KICKS ZOMBIE DOGS! Oooh! I'm so scared. I'm just not sure what to be scared of! I suppose I'm scared of seeing an equally appalling sequel.If you haven't seen this film - DON'T. This is 90 minutes you can never have back. In the age of DVD, there's a wealth of good horror to be found. Better yet, Video games are fast becoming better than modern films. Resident Evil the game and it's sequels (especially 4) out class this pile by miles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" is the first of the film series that adapted the popular video game franchise into the world of movies. Milla Jovovich was chosen to lead the franchise after her success on "The Fifth Element". I can only speak about this first entry to the series as I have not seen the other ones, but I was not impressed at all. These 100 minutes (with credits) had basically everything you'd expect from a weak action movies that relies on spectacular effects and sacrifices story for it. They included stuff like love relationships, sex, nudity etc. to make this look slightly more interesting, but none of these aspects got convincing elaboration. It all just felt thrown in for the sake of it.I will not deny that this is a film worth watching for its technical aspects and there are some decent scenes actually, but it's all shallow and unconvincing if the characters are so badly written like it is here the case. By the way, the monster humans reminded me a bit of the walkers on "Walking Dead". Interesting aspect that they also included the idea that they were dead already despite still moving with the clotted blood reference. But that was one of really not too many smart aspects in this film. Jovovich and Rodriguez may be very attractive, but in terms of acting I'm not too sure if they can carry a franchise like that. Admittedly, you have to say in their favor that their male co-actors were even more forgettable. It is the same like almost any other Bernd Eichinger production and Paul W.S. Anderson film: A lot of style over substance and just not a great story or great writing. Forgettable movie and it's odd to see this has 3 sequels already with number 4 in the making. I really hope the quality gets better, but judging from this one here, i do not have much intention to watch the other films soon. Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underwhelming but all out horror thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do you make a video game adaption work, hire Paul W.S Anderson? No that's not it, what about cast Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez? Well no but it feels more promising, oh I know actually, lets just make an all out crazy movie with little realistic dialogue and some poor acting. See that seemed to do the trick because this movie is a poor one, I didn't find it completely bad but it's still pretty bad anyway. You know I'm the kind of film fan who can truly enjoy movies with a premise like this but when they cast the wrong people behind the camera and on it, you just can't forgive the producers for this one. Resident Evil is based on the popular video game of the same name and definitely see's the kind of action you might expect from such, not all together a really un-enjoyable ride, but just a movie that is unlikeable. We see Milla Jovovich waking up and not knowing what the hell is going on, we also see James Purefoy with the same old predicament and both seem to need to know what's going on. In steps a whole team of people who have been sent in to investigate a thing called the "Hive" an underground facility that seems to have done some bad things to test subjects and even employees. The film is packed full of insane action, kick ass stunts and zombies (including zombie dogs) and really does pack quite a punch. I didn't feel this film was bad because of the action actually, it is what makes this slightly exciting and at least the movie has a certain horror element too it and can make you kind of jump.It wasn't the directing that made me cringe, it was the writing which seems to rip this movie apart, the cast can seem almost lifeless at moments with this script and the small talk is well, none existent. The cast do give it their best at certain times but in others it can feel as if they are trying too hard to make this dramatic and Anderson does nothing to help them. I think the only real redeeming factors in this are that it is not awful and not even maybe fully bad but still just poor, as I said the fighting and all the things like that are the only things that keep this a float before it sinks into the abyss of movie garbage. As for the actors themselves I can't say I liked any of them, Jovovich is not bad but she fails as her role to lead the movie and ends up in moments being second fiddle to more exciting characters. Michelle Rodriguez is probably more exciting than her but even she can not make this any better, coupled with the writing too, I just couldn't forgive this movie and felt disappointed. The story is played out well kind of full blown just go for it which does work in it's favour somehow, I didn't want any plot for large parts of this because I was enjoying the fighting, there are way too many obstacles set in this movie but I can say at least you get a few thrills and that's what is important. So all in all it is Anderson who truly damages the film, not as much with Jovovich or the cast as they are just sucked into the director's work. I think in fact I know for a fact many will enjoy this and think me crazy for saying this is poor, but just look at the film properly and really don't let it take you for a ride without first showing you its poor skills. I do however recommend this to all horror fans and action aficionados as it basically will do what it says on the tin really, scare and thrill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning of the 21st century, the Umbrella Corporation had become the largest commercial entity in the United States. Nine out of every ten homes contain its products. Its political and financial influence is felt everywhere. In public, it is the world's leading supplier of computer technology, medical products, and health care. Unknown, even to its own employees, its massive profits are generated by military technology, genetic experimentation, and viral weaponry....It seems so cool, doesn't it? And yeah, I was very intrigued by the beginning, those awesome-looking turquoise vials of some zombie virus. Then a homicidal computer, similar to GlaDOS from Portal or CAS from the Tower (1993), begins torturing and killing every scientist in the lab, locking the place down (I'm nostalgic for the 1985 film Warning Sign). It was so amazing...But then the character Alice is introduced, and she wrecked the film. They were less concerned with making a good plot and more with actress Milla Jojovich's inhuman action kicks and punches. The scene where she leaps along the wall and karate kicks a mutant lab dog's head in, what was that!? A very unrealistic at best film, really only worth watching once, unless you're one of those gaming nerds who can't get enough of Resident Evil.I did buy the movie novel, it was actually much better than the film itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first "Resident Evil" film is a very, very guilty pleasure. Dopey (if not just plain dumb) beyond belief but a TON of fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world of Video-Game-to-Film adaptations is a very dark place in the world of entertainment. Over the past 20 years, starting in the 90's, video-games have become increasingly elaborate, cinematic and sophisticated in terms of storytelling, often delving into deep plots and rich character development that rivals the best in Hollywood filmmaking. Especially in recent years, with the release of games like "Uncharted", "Heavy Rain" and many others, which feel more akin to interactive films than they do like old-school video-games.Yet, Hollywood has yet to figure out how to properly release a video-game adaptation. Starting with the abysmal 90's adaptation of "Super Mario Bros.", the studio system has displayed once major flaw over and over again that has plagued every video-game adaptation since: Studios do not understand, nor do they make any effort to understand, video-games and gaming culture.Studios (and many modern producers, directors and writers) seem stuck in a very 80's mindset that games are merely mindless entertainment without stories, and/or can somehow be made "better" by violently altering the source material's stories and characters. And thus so many video-game to film adaptations are released that bear little-to-no resemblance to their source material. Yes, almost every single video-game film has relied on making radical and unneeded changes to their source material, under the delusion that they need to change things to make it work. To date, there have been virtually no video-game movies that have actually resembled the original games.And Paul W.S. Anderson's "Resident Evil" is definitely a major offender in this respect. Yes, it is a film that almost exclusively alters, disregards and even disrespects its source material, turning the original slow-moving and deliberate Romero-esque video game into a goofy, pseudo-James Cameron-inspired action extravaganza.But you know what? Looking past how much it disrespects the original "Resident Evil" game franchise... it's actually not too terrible a film. Oh, it's bad. Pretty darned bad. But it's also wildly entertaining, and is clearly full of the rampant eye-candy that Director Anderson relishes in. And in terms of sheer, unadulterated entertainment value... you could do much worse.We follow Alice (Milla Jovovich), an amnesiac woman who awakens in a seemingly deserted mansion. After encounter another survivor (Eric Mabius) and a group of commandos (including Michelle Rodriguez), she is whisked away into "The Hive", a technologically advanced underground compound below the mansion, run by the "Umbrella Corporation." Alice, Matt and the commandos are forced to investigate the complex, in order to figure out why it was sealed off, and survive when they realize researchers and scientists of The Hive have become ravenous, zombie-like creatures.The acting isn't too shabby. Jovovich is a lot of fun in the role, underwritten though it may be. Mabius does come off a tad boring, though. And Rodriguez, who I've actually quite admired in some films as a touch-yet-sexy chick, is pretty good in her role.The production is also pretty decent. If there's one thing writer/director Anderson knows, it's how to make pretty pictures on screen. The production design is convincing enough, giving us sleek quasi-futuristic designs, and the production design does lend to some cool action sequences and even a couple of reasonably intense horror segments. I did find some of Anderson's choice in shots and compositions to be over-done at times, though.Unfortunately, the writing is pretty dreadful. Ignoring the fact that it essentially disregards the original video game (save for a few character names and passing references), it's way too fast, and the dialog is very wonky.But still, this is one of those movies where you care more about the images than the written words. As mentioned above, Anderson is a king at making "pretty pictures", and here, asides from his more over- the-top visuals, he delivers on some great action beats and decent sequences of suspense. So I can't say the film is a total loss just because the script kinda sucked. Anderson seemed to have the mindset that he wanted to make a fun action-horror movie. And I think that's pretty much what this film is. It's criminally stupid at times. It's under-written. But there's enough guns, gore and even some exploit-o-riffic nudity in a few sequences, so I'd say audiences looking for a good time should get what they're pay for. I like it as dumb fun as a 25-year-old male, as do my college-aged friends and even my 50-something-year-old mom. So that should tell you that it's worth checking out once for sheer dumb- fun.I give it a 6 out of 10, just for entertainment value. However, if you are looking for a film that is very well-made or true to the video-game source material, you will be very disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"More zombies." Kristl said in a tried voice. She put down the empty cup that had held her raspberry slush puppy. It had not really helped with the exhaustion she felt, which had been brought on by watching a marathon of Resident Evil movies.."I like zombies." said Henry."Love at first bite?" "Gosh. That is so lame and that from you..""Just tired." Kristl whispered."Overall an adequate movie. Zombies, shooting, people dying, weird monsters and Milla Jovovich. The tension is built up slowly as it takes a long time for the movie to show the monsters. I think they appear past the thirty minutes mark. It is a good thing. Don't lay down all the cards at once. While I don't get attached to most of the characters they aren't too disturbing. Personally I find it a pity that the Hispanic girl Rain at the end turned zombie, but i didn't feel sorry either as she might as well die, because she just kept having the same facial expression. Overall it was is pretty predictable with forgettable characters. Even to Milla seems a bit tame." "I find it hard to rank a movie like this. How can you compare this movie to something like the Godfather series or to stick to the same genre, movies like those from the Dead series or Aliens. Just very hard to do." Kristl said."Personally I think the movie marred by the start. The whole movie hinges on the fact that this super secret high tech laboratory controlled by a computer is incapable of stopping a virus from spreading through air-vents. Also a bit strange that people and dogs turn into flesh craving monsters by an airborne virus but when a few hours later the soldiers appear, they only get infected by being bitten. You have to accept that this one virus behaves in different ways depending on how it infects living beings. It might be conceivable ,but it all is a bit stretching it." Henry said."So..what it comes down too is an adequate zombie flick that might entertain people. Mostly people who are interested in zombie films that aren't too scary. Anyone else will probably find better movies to watch." Kristl said"There is one thing that puzzles me and it is the reaction of Alice to the death of Rain. Although Alice reacts to the death of the others with suitable shock, she burst in tears when that guy shoots Rain in the head when she turns zombie. I mean she cried like she just lost her lover. I wonder.""Maybe she just collapsed from exhaustion?" Kristl said."Maybe they were in love?" Henry suggested."You thinks so?""Hot steamy lesbian love." Henry said, "You know it."Not again, Kristl thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>funnily enough, my interested faded once the zombies arrived. The opening was chaotic, bringing you into the film immediately and the introduction of Alice up too the zombies was interesting. The vibe which the hive generated - a feel of imminent doom inside chrome walls, set up the rest of the film well. Now, it suffered in the character sector. The most important necessity in a horror is a strong group of characters; even more so than the frights themselves. Alice herself is weak and unlikable while the armed forces sent to investigate the hive also lack any charismatic flair. Take Michelle Rodriguez's character for example. Her chronic crumpled face syndrome did nothing but cheer me on for her to die.Resident evil might of been the film to bring the zombies craze to the 21st century, but after watching similar celluloid's such as 'The walking dead' I can only feel obliged to hate on the style in which is used to create a sense of rapid danger for the hordes of zombies. The jagged, blurred style of motion used does nothing but weakens the suspense. I feel that they've failed at creating any fear towards the zombies. Add the awful characters and we're left with the action which is frankly dull. They might as well be shooting at...Well,a bag of bones in all fairness , as the lack of appeal &amp; emotion involvement with the guys down in the hive leaves me wishing that they take there shooting down to the target range.There are some good moments to be watched: the lasers and the dogs. And The opening 45 minutes lived up to it's billing. However, for a horror/action film, Resident evil is tame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil (2002)* 1/2 (out of 4)A secret military unit enters a secure location known as "The Hive," which was hit with a bio-hazard material, which has caused those inside the building to become zombies. I've never played the video game that this is based on but I'm really not sure you need to in order to understand what's going on in the film. I can see why some people might enjoy this but to me it was a pretty big bore from start to finish. I think it's easy to say that director Paul W.S. Anderson has no problems when it comes to style and action but I think RESIDENT EVIL is the perfect case for the "all style of no substance" complaint. The first forty-minutes of this movie had me looking at my watch every few minutes because it was dragging so slowly. I'm guessing the director wanted to build up some suspense leading up to what's going on in the building but even someone such as myself knew what to expect so why they just kept delaying what was coming made little sense to me. Once the zombie action does start things pick up a little bit but after a few attack scenes you soon realize that you've seen this way too many times before and this here really isn't adding anything new to the mix. Well, I guess the zombie dogs were something new. I thought Milla Jovovich was good in her part but the rest of the cast members were fair at best. The gore scenes really aren't anything new and I found some of the CGI to be pretty bland as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil is a horror film written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson. The film stars Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, and James Purefoy. It is the first installment in the Resident Evil film series, which is based on the Capcom survival horror series Resident Evil that borrowed elements from the video games Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2.The story follows amnesiac heroine Alice and a band of Umbrella Corporation commandos as they attempt to contain the outbreak of the T-Virus at a secret underground facility.Resident Evil presents Alice and Rain,two members of a commando team assigned to infiltrate the Hive, an underground research laboratory owned by the faceless conglomerate known as the Umbrella Corporation. A bio-engineered virus has been released into the maze-like Hive, turning the facility's employees into mindless, flesh-eating zombies. A single scratch or bite from one of these rampaging ghouls dooms its victim, so the commandos have their work cut out for them as they attempt to reach the Red Queen, the lab's supercomputer -- and their sole hope of halting the spread of the contagion. Before they can complete their mission, however, the soldiers must overcome a variety of deadly obstacles, including mutant dogs, lasers, and a genetically altered beast known as The Licker, whose strength increases with every victim it slays. Alice and Rain also discover that the release of the virus may not have been an accident, and that a cure may exist somewhere in the deadly Hive.Resident Evil is more a live video game than a movie.Despite of its outstanding visuals and production values,it loud,cheesy and formulaic.Also,its primary purpose is to entertain and astound the viewer with its special effects rather than tell a story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original - and only good entry - in an increasingly lousy series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil was Milla's first "I can do it all by myself role, and the double edged sword of being in a pretty good and more-successful-than-they-thought film is that so far she has had to star in three sh*tty sequels.Resident Evil was alright though, and for a while it was a minor highlight in the awful game or comic book to film group.Resident Evil takes place in an underground facility run by the Umbrella Corp, located beneath Raccoon City, both names classic examples of why foreign game developers should consult with native English speakers if they plan to prepare a game for that market.Have you ever heard of a city as stupidly named as Raccoon City? Would you choose to live there? Wouldn't you fully pull the p*ss out of anyone that you knew that did live there? I mean seriously... And if they worked for Umbrella Corp wouldn't that only sweeten the deal? I mean Umbrella Corp?!? In essence the big-nawty Umbrella Corp (tee-hee) has made some whiz bang virus that has apparently been unleashed in the massive underground research facility, and the thousands of staff working there have been locked in to prevent the virus from escaping.The full implications of the virus are unknown, and the impact of the virus on the trapped staff is not shown in the early goings on, we do see in some initial moments that it isn't all sunshine and rainbows for everyone though.Cut! And Scene! Milla J wakes up nekkid on the floor of a running shower, how long the shower was running wasn't calculatable but her pale white skin showed no signs of "pruning", I looked... for a long time... in freeze frame.Milla looks around to find herself in a large mansion-y building, with evidence that she lives there, and clothes carefully laid out for her. Now dressed in a strange fanboy-fantasy outfit of a red dress over combat boots (which she later adds a black leather jacket to. Huh?), Milla has no memory, no weapons, or no understanding of why she is there. At this stage I'm not sure if she even knew she was supposed to be acting, all she did was look around with wide eyes and her lower lip perpetually dropped for her early scenes.A strike team shows up with a squad leader who looks very much like a robot (mouth closed though), it appears that Milla has something to do with things, how or what we don't know yet. At least she now has friends.And a name, Alice.The team announce their intentions to move into the underground facility, now dubbed the Hive, to see exactly what is going on. They enter through a sneaky door in the Milla-Mansion.After a short zip down into the Earth on a subway style train system the crew end up at the gates of the underground Hive, from here on in numerous variations of "JUMP" scares are the order of the day, each with an accompanying "BOO" noise.Their mission takes them to where the AI system that runs security for the facility, called Japanese-game-developerly the Red Queen, "she" is personified by a hologramatic young girl with a British accent, who thankfully seems also programmed to spout menacing dialogue when it is deemed to be most unsettling.Like a rapping granny, a "black-acting" old white guy or a talking animal in an ad or kid's film (non-animated, cartoons are supposed to talk), it just gave me the sh*ts.There is a cool visual, but logically stupid scene in a security hallway, where a series of laser patterns sweep the hall, starting with a straight laser that they can step over, and progressing to more complicated patterns that begin wiping off various digits and limbs, before expanding into a Julianne style dicing pattern that shreds all inside.Why have the first three or four patterns before bringing out the sure fire crowd pleaser? Anyone who has played the game knows that it is about fighting Zombies, and as 99.3% of viruses nowadays in films create nothing but Zombies it seems why don't we just acknowledge that they are already here? Once the Zombies arrive it seems clear that the crack squad aren't really that well-trained, many of them simultaneously lose the plot and they seem to scatter in all directions, there is also much infighting and bickering, and it takes them forever to realise that a headshot drops their assailants.Alice rapidly comes to realise that whoever she is and however stupidly she is dressed that she has skillz, and that these skillz are effective VS zombies and zombie-dogs alike. (Although if you watch the couple scenes where she fires a gun pay attention to her eyes, she blinks hard with EVERY shot fired. I guess some models turned actresses just aren't cut out to be cold calculated cinematic assassins.) After escaping the initial onslaught the survivors discover they have only a limited time to escape before they are forever shut in (and therefore dead), which you would have thought relevant information to know prior to heading in! There are various sub-plots that mean little and add nothing to the film from this point. The zombies seem to inexplicably vanish from the film for very long stretches after the first headlong rush and a new CGI-assisted menace is introduced, I guess sort of like a level-boss in the game really.Final Rating - 6.5 / 10. Despite all the sarcasm and crap written above this is actually an effective little movie, it can't help it that it was followed by three sub-terrible sequels... so far.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad for a game fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know where or how to begin because it's really tough for me, as a game fan, to describe what I felt when I saw this movie for the first time.First of all, I played Resident Evil for so many times that I can't count. All first 3 episodes are one of my favorite games and my favorite kind of genre.The introduction of the first game is quite exciting, showing us all the cinematic importance of the game with a man stepping into a corridor, being attacked by something unknown and the name "RESIDENTE EVIL" appearing in the screen in red blood. Then, the game opening shows how everything started. Of course the actors were a lot like amateurs but it was innovative and frightening for a game those disturbing scenes till the game finally starts into a hall in an anywhere mansion. The main characters of the game were Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, Albert Wesker, Barry Burton and Rebecca Chambers. This brief description of the game is just to make clear how the movie starts as a completely mess.I think that, to say something about this movie, we have to say if from 2 different point of views: as a game player and as a non game player.As a game player I couldn't understand why they have changed all the original plot of the game. None of the original characters was there and all the interesting facts of the game have been totally ignored. All of the original game characters had different and well defined personalities and each one of them have its importance during the game story, something that do not happen in the movie for the fact that Alice is the main character and everything surrounds her. The cinematic importance of the game has been completely forgotten in the movie and all the frightening atmosphere of the game was totally lost. For a first impression, I liked the fact of Milla Jovovich as the main character just for the fact that she's not a box office name but she's an action star and a name needed for the movie's success, but she is an awful actress. Her face is always the same from the beginning to the end in each movie she's cast, with no exception. But what I keep asking myself is: "Why Alice as the main character? Why all that stuffs about a girl suffering from amnesia, The Red Queen and The Hive, when we already had an interesting plot from the original game?".The game plot involve a group of special agents that are lost into somewhere full of all kind of monsters that, in fact, are zombies from a genetic experience accident by a part of the Umbrella Co. that's hidden under a mansion for its illegal studies content. This is also an interesting plot for an action movie because it's simple, original, understandable and full of action (that's what action movies is all about). And why did they had to make something so complex in the worst way? But the worst thing is that they did something so strangely complex that's almost impossible to insert the original characters during the movie or in its sequels. So, as a game player this is an awful adaptation.As a non game player I could find the movie quite funny. The movie starts well giving a detailed explanation about the happenings over the Umbrella Co. until the virus takes control of everything. The zombies are interesting because jumps over your eyes that all zombies are people not dressed well with dirty make up. That thing about Milla recovering from an amnesia all, discovering her fighting techniques under pressure situations are so def that is hugely laughable. It's laughable because it's a common situation in the history of action movies and very few of them made it quite well as The Bourne Trilogy. It's also laughable because it's not in a movie called Resident Evil that that situation would be taken seriously from the writers and the audience. Milla Jovovich, as said before, is one of the worst famous actress of history and I can't understand why people like her so much as she isn't an actress because she's never acting. She's always looking with the same way, she's always with her mouth half-open when she's amazed, frighten, happy, sad... and she's always shaking her jaw when she has something quite important to say as: "you'll die!" I liked some scenes that I don't remember by now because they were too short. Lot of people hated the final scene, claiming that it was a scene for a predictable sequel, but I liked it a lot and I think that it's the kind of impressive scene I was waiting for during entire movie and it's the first time when you can finally realize the complete chaos and destruction that Umbrella Corporation caused and how it should be if something like that happened in real life. So, as a non game player I had an enjoyable time watching that movie but it could be a lot better.That's sad. The movie suffers from improvement failures over the potentials of the game, and the game (and also the fans) suffers under this awful adaptation.</fullReview>

This was just ridiculous when the man stood in the place and he got chopped! Why did he not just run away from the lasers? I don't like it when they make the games then make it into some mutant thing. In doom the game, the creeps were from hell but in the film there were all created by scientists.

		<fullReview>Every thing Anderson did right with video games movies on "Mortal Kombat" he seems to have forgotten by the time he got to this project. I'm not even a fan of the "Resident Evil" games and I can tell that this film changes much of the source material. I mean, was the whole computer going nuts and underground laboratory aspects necessary at all? It complicates the plot when it didn't need to be complicated. The characters are stupid, that's for sure, often doing things wrong just because it adds to the "drama." Milla Jovovich is sort of attractive, I suppose, but not much of an actress and certainly not strong enough to hold down a project as weak as this. The fact that she was engaged to the director at the time makes her casting even more bogus. The special effects are pretty good with some interesting looking monsters. However, it isn't much of a zombie movie as they don't really appear in it at all and most of the gore is pretty soft. "Resident Evil" is just plain dumb. Just to think that this could have been directed by George A. Romero? Grade: D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil Kicks Ass IF ...you understand the game/movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe I speak for hundreds of cats my age and younger and some older that have loved playing the Resident Evil games for years. The game itself has a pretty decent plot, not to mention the game play keeps you interested and coming back for more. The movie does NOT fall short of entertaining those of us that love the game - and even some that have never played the game but understand that it is based on one. The star of the movie, Alice, played by Mila Jovavich, is a phenomenal character. Not only is she sexy as hell, she can kick ass better than most male characters in zombie movies I've seen! And she only gets better and better as the movie progresses. The plot outline makes sense and you'll find yourself rooting for Alice as she blows zombie after bloody zombie to pieces. As far as the gore factor goes - its there. IF your wanting a 'suspense' movie - I'd say look elsewhere. This is definitely more on the side of a gore action zombie flick. Not only will you have the pleasure of watching the zombies die a million deaths - we also get to see members of the crew die in many creative ways....just to mention - one of the crew gets sliced into a million pieces by a laser net down in the pits of the Umbrella Corp. This flick is NOT only for teenage boys and male adult equals as some would say....this movie is for those that appreciate a good gore action flick with a sexy heroine!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best of it's genre and sub genre and a darn good flick in general</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never play video games, so I have no attachment to the theme. I saw the sequel a year ago and thought it was lame and derivative, though I liked Milla. I also thought she was the best part of "The Fifth Element", acting against one of the worst movie killers of all time, Bruce Willis. (OK, he put in a few good roles here and there.) So, I got the DVD of RE and it blew me away. The production value was far superior to almost any of those techno-cyber-man-vs-computer flicks, along with it being better than most zombie and action movies in general. It had the same sort of set and theme as the original 70's techno-science thriller, "The Andromeda Strain". The acting and characters were spartan but right on cue. Though most of the team members tended to look alike, they all had some personality and acted more like real people than some soul-less, Ahnuld type killing machines. Milla's body language was excellent, and she was sexy without hamming it up an ounce. She deserved an Oscar and is a pleasure to watch. THough the one scene where she kicks out the mutant dog was lame. Her character suffered from amnesia due to a nerve agent in the beginning and there was a dream like sequence when she awakes on the floor of her shower and is utterly blank. That scene was filmed in a huge German mansion that the Nazis and Communist used for a retreat, done in red, as her skimpy dress she wears. She has to reconstruct her past while battling zombies, genetically engineered killing animals and the Red Queen, or the AI program that runs the hive. But she always maintained her humanity and femininity throughout the horrors she faced and fought. She was paired with Michelle Rodriguez, doing her macha latina schtick as one of the security team members. But the two of them actually complemented each other and it worked well. Michelle Rodriguez as Rain Ocampo offered up some pretty decent comic relief and lines too!The sets and mechanical efx are great, but the cgi beasts were weaker. The cinematography and editing were first rate. The soundtrack was pulsing techno that drove the already good plot along, it was great too.In short this movie set a benchmark for all those cyber-mutant-techno-action-zombie movies that few will beat. Throw us the action, but at least have real people and great but spare efx. It's sequel, of course, was a turkey compared to this. It was made in Europe, which explained it's good techno style, Funny, but my man George A. Romero was supposed to direct it, but gave up. I don't think it would have been as good. Basically, this movie first rate period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Playing the game is more fun than watching the film, having said that it ain't too bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We start with some opening narration (by Jason Isaacs) that goes something like this, 'Confidential Report. Subject: the events leading up to the incident at Racoon City'. The narration continues, 'At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Umbrella corporation had become the largest commercial entity in the United States. 9 out of every 10 homes contain it's products. It's political and financial influence is felt everywhere. In public it is the worlds leading supplier of computer technology, medical products, health-care. Unknown even to it's own employees it's massive profits are generated by military technology, genetic experimentation, viral weaponry'. The film then cuts to a seemingly normal research facility. An unknown person or persons steal a futuristic looking case of vials containing some sort of top secret green and blue substance. Before leaving they smash one of the blue vials and the substance inside is spread throughout the rest of the building through the ventilation system with horrifying results! A beautiful woman (Milla Jovovich, her characters name is never mentioned but it happens to be Alice so that's what I will call her for the rest of my review) wakes up, lying naked in a shower inside a very posh looking bathroom. Alice has no idea who she is or what she is doing there as she has total memory loss. Alice explores her surroundings, she leaves the bathroom and discovers she is in a large, and seemingly deserted mansion. She sees a note that says "Today all your dreams come true". Alice finds some rather fetching clothes, a long sexy red dress and a pair of knee high leather boots. A heavily armed elite squad of soldiers, Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez), Chad Kaplan (Martin Crewes), J.D Salinas (Pasquale Aleardi) plus two more whose names are never mentioned (Torsten Jerabek and Marc Logan-Black) burst in through the windows, hey what was wrong with the doors guys? The one in command (Colin Salmon, like Milla his characters name is never mentioned during the film) seems to know Alice. Along with a mysterious man who claims to be a cop called Matt Addison (Eric Mabius) they all get on-board a train and find yet another survivor named Spence Parks (James Purefoy) who also has memory loss like Alice. They all travel on the train deep underground to the 'Hive'. The soldiers explain that the 'Hive' is located under Racoon City being half a mile underground at it's deepest point. It is a top secret research facility owned and operated by the Umbrella Corp. and houses over 500 scientists, technicians and support staff. The 'Hive' is controlled by 'Red Queen', state of the art artificial intelligence that takes on the holographic appearance of the lead programmers daughter (Michaela Dicker). They say they are there on a search and rescue mission as 'Red Queen' went homicidal and killed everyone inside the 'Hive', to try and find out what happened and to destroy 'Red Queen' if necessary. Things don't go according to plan however. There may be a traitor in the group, and a horde of flesh eating zombie office workers created by the Umbrella Corp. developed 'T-Virus' which is what all the fuss is about doesn't help their cause. Nor does the fact that in an hour the 'Hive' will be sealed, permanently with them still inside to stop any potential outside contamination! Will they all make it out in time? Can they put an end to the Umbrella Corp. research and deadly 'T-Virus' it has created and contain it so not to let it spread outside and infect millions of people? Written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson I think playing the game is ultimately more fun and rewarding. All the best ideas in this are taken from the game, the rest come from Aliens (1986) which this film resembles strongly. The script, to it's credit, moves along like a rocket and tries to add some twists here and there but for the most part they are fairly easy to see coming and not surprising. At least it's never dull or boring. I found the horror elements extremely disappointing, the zombies don't turn up until over half way through the film and there is virtually no blood or gore in it at all, apart from a CGI decapitation with no blood. I did like the skinless dogs, but they were taken directly from the game though. As was the big monster at the end which was also quite cool, if a little fake looking. A decent amount of gore would have helped this film no end, the potential was there with zombies Vs heavily armed soldiers but no, just a few bullet hits and that's it. The zombies don't eat anyone either. The action elements are also average at best, a few CGI enhanced fights and a couple of sequences that try to be exciting but generally aren't. I would have preferred the filmmakers to have more of it set in the Gothic cool looking mansion rather than the high-tech labs and offices as it would have given the whole film a much creepier atmosphere. Acting is OK for this type of thing but no-one is going to win an Oscar, and Milla Jovovich is a real babe in that dress and those boots as she kicks but. Everyone else involved has to deal with standard horror stereotypes and clichés. It's not a bad film I suppose as it's well made moves along a nice pace and entertains to an extent but it could have been so much more in the hands of someone with talent and imagination. Resident Evil plays like a cross between the game and Aliens, if the sound of that appeals to you you may like it otherwise you probably won't. Average, but worth a watch none the less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent update of post-apocalyptic zombie horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I was pumped at wanting to see the Resident Evil movie upon its release. I had been a fan of the videogames and wanted to see how theywould translate it. It is quite evident that the filmmakers had a good concept of the game and were familiar with it. However I was skeptical on seeing another translation from videogame to movie, as most have been awful. Another important thing for the game to succesfully translate well, it would have to be R rated. If you had played the games, you would understand why. The failures of other games into movies were to rate it PG or PG-13 just to get kids in the seats, good plan, but not always the way to do it. The best example being Mortal Kombat, and its even worse sequel. When the MK games debuted, they were extraordinarily popular and notorius as being the most violent games ever made. So turning it into a hammy PG-13 movie really destroyed its hopes of relying on its history and turned off hardened fans of the games' series.So I was delighted Resident Evil got the R rating, but waited for home release before giving my thoughts. I heard many comments from critics and the average movie going people and it was mixed reviews all the time. So what did I think?The movie was good for me as a fan of old Italian horror and zombie flicks, even though they were mostly poor films, they have a following like no other sub-genre in film history. I like the post-apocalyptic feel and look of the movie and its easy to say it was made with great style, but the substance was lacking. This would be partially in effect of the director, writer and editors.I did enjoy the way they were able to make a story, but when they ran out of ideas, just cramming it with zombies for 5-10 minutes of screen time til you get to the next point in the story is a cheap cop-out. The casting of the movie was also interesting. Milla Jovovich as a sc-fi/action/horror hero? Michelle Rodriguez fresh off a support role in The Fast and the Furious? and Eric Mabius? Obviously they weren't going for star power and having the two women as the leads was a peculiar choice since the games almost always had a strong male hero.Jovovich however, worked for me after the movie got going. She was easy on the eyes as usual, but kicked some ass along the way. I liked the choice for her in the movie but Michelle Rodriguez's character should have died off right away. She doesn't have the charisma or likeability to want her here, unlike her breakout performance in Girlfight.Paul Anderson has made sci-fi and action before. In Event Horizon and Soldier, both which weren't too good, but showed he had a technical know-how and a sense of visual flare. Same goes for this one. The action scenes are fairly well done, and he does add a few effective scary sequences.Jovovich and Mabius will be back in the inevitable sequel in the early Spring of 2004, but director Anderson skips out and serves as producer as he is working on directing yet another videogame/movie crossover, the mediocrely anticipated Aliens Vs. Predator. This time he hands the directing duties over to Alexander Witt, who has spent most of the past few years as second unit director of photography on some good movies. These include Pirates of the Carribean, xXx, The Bourne Identity, Red Dragon, Blackhawk Down and Gladiator to name a few.While I hope the sequel improves on the downfalls of the original, I do reccommend it, slightly to those who enjoy sci-fi horror, the videogame series or zombie flicks. It isn't as gory as the works by Lucio Fulci, Ruggero Deodato, Umberto Lenzi or George A. Romero, but when was the last time you saw a zombie flick? Especially one from Hollywood?I give Resident Evil (2002) ***/4 *'s</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hoping it would be creepier than it was. But as a few other posters already pointed out- the director is not very good at creating suspenseful situations or characters you care about. I agree with another poster who said that the editing was really disjointed. Characters appear in places, and you don't know how they got there. There are some plot holes as well, i.e. why was the "cop" there to begin with? How did he know about the mansion? I knew this movie wasn't going to be a work of art or anything. I knew plot and all that were not that important, but at least it could have been scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, I wonder what the video game's like.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So obviously I make no secret of the fact that I've never played the video game on which this movie is based, although I can't say it's that easy to come up with what the objective of a game would be that would inspire a movie like this. Not that I hated the movie or anything, but I think the story here would work better as a game than it does as a movie. First of all, the foundation of the story as a whole is based on a gigantic fallacy, or a series of gigantic fallacies. Specifically, the poisonous gas in the movie that basically reanimates dead people, turning them into flesh-eating zombies, supposedly works because, as it's explained in the movie, the body is still active even after death (`for months,' one character explains).The problem here is that, while it's true that it is a widely accepted myth that hair and fingernails continue to grow after death (also mentioned in the movie), it is not true at all that hair and fingernails continue to grow after death, it just doesn't happen. There is, in fact, a recognized postmortem lengthening of hair and fingernails, but it's not because they're growing, it's because the dead skin is receding, revealing the hair and fingernail material that was previously underneath the skin. So in a sense, hair and fingernails do, in fact, grow after death, but it is a result of the decay of the body, not in any way a product of still-functioning hair follicles and whatever the glands are that produce fingernails. Another reason that the movie gives for the ability of the gas to bring dead people back to life is that cells continue to reproduce after death. This may be true, but it would certainly never happen at the level required for a cadaver to be operational enough to be a zombie. Cells that have no incoming source of oxygen have a remarkably short shelf-life.So now that I've unnecessarily pointed out that logic has no place in this movie, I might as well point out that, for a horror film, the chronology of the plot is remarkably well thought out. I like that it starts with a couple elite agents who have lost their memories of what they have been doing and why they find themselves at the places where they wake up. Milla Jovovich plays one of these officers, and the other is supposedly her tactical boyfriend/husband is a life that she can't remember. As the film goes on and the cast find themselves deeper and deeper within this underground lab called The hive (and more and more surrounded by the living dead), their memories gradually come back and they realize their old jobs, motives, etc.As far as plot, that is very original for a horror film, especially one involving zombies. You think of a movie that is centered around a gas that turns dead people into cannibalistic zombies and you immediately pretty much know how the whole movie is going to go. In Resident Evil, however, the majority of the tension comes not necessarily from the walking dead that are trying to eat the cast, but ultimately more from the awakening memories of certain characters who find themselves to be enemies, turning guns on each other even while the dead pound on the doors trying to sink their teeth into their flesh.Oh, by the way, that's another thing. Not only does this gas reanimate the dead by utilizing the fictional continuation of bodily function after death, but once turned into zombies, they have the ability to turn others into zombies with the slightest scratch or bite. So not only does this gas turn dead people into cannibal zombies, but cannibal VAMPIRE zombies. If they bite you you turn into one of them. No wonder they came up with the idea of internal strife as a way to create more tension, because the original premise of the effects of this gas are pretty ridiculous. It was created for military use, although I can't imagine a military use for a gas that, when used, would turn entire populations into walking dead, turning entire cities into the disaster that we see in the final shot of the film. Entire continents and, ultimately, the human race would be wiped out with a single use of such a weapon.Michelle Rodriguez takes on exactly the same role that she played in the ridiculous movie The Fast and the Furious as well as the somewhat less ridiculous S.W.A.T. She always plays a very impressive, very tough role, but her half-lidded tough-girl routine gets real old real quick. Milla Jovovich is just as staggeringly beautiful as ever, yet taking on another role that is fathoms below her ability, and really the rest of the cast kind of blends together, with no one standing out as important or with much of an impressive performance.Getting back to the story, like I said above, it's actually pretty impressive conceptually, but then again you have to overlook such forehead-slappers as the machine coming to life (embodied, for some reason, in the voice of a little British girl), becoming self-aware, and trying to terminate the people there to shut her down. She apparently has managed to create a gigantic monster out of some sort of organic material the source of which escaped me, as well as whole herds of dogs that seem to have no skin and no other purpose for existing than to attack anything that moves. Cleverly animated, but certainly one of the things that raised a few eyebrows as to where they came from or what was the point.Recently I've been seeing previews at the movies for a Resident Evil 2, which is most of the reason that I went back and watched this one. Based on the fact that this movie ends with a shot that is also seen in the trailer for part 2, the shot with Alice (Jovovich) emerging from a manhole to find the entire city in a state of complete destruction, the gas having infected the population above ground, I assume that part 2 takes place in an above-ground setting. I also like that the preview starts off looking like an advertisement for some sort of beauty product, which leads me to believe that maybe that will be something that the dead use to cover up their deformities and the fact that they are dead, thus allowing them to sneak up on the living. Although if that happens, it would refute the claim made in this movie that they have no cognitive function other than the primal instinct to feed.At any rate, a fresh new setting, above-ground, would provide a whole array of new possibilities for a sequel to this movie. In fact, in order to save money, sort of kill two birds with one stone, they might even be able to double their profits by calling the next movie something like `Resident Evil: 28 Days Later.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is more of a ripoff of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD than it is based on the popular video game. It concerns a bunch of military recruits trapped in an ex-science lab fighting a supercomputer and zombies, zombies, and more zombies. That's where the derivative nature of the film comes in. They spend the bulk of the film shooting and being attacked and eaten by zombies. Perhaps fans of the video game will find some value here, others beware. U.S. version was edited of gore to receive an "R" rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sort of a `Night of the Living Dead' for the cybernetic generation, `Resident Evil' features a group of people trapped in a futuristic subterranean biological weapons laboratory who are forced to do battle against a host of mutant, flesh-eating zombies. Based on a popular video game, the movie feels like virtually every other film in which characters are trapped in an enclosed setting where they find themselves being systematically knocked off one by one courtesy of some malevolent, super-human force. (Think `Alien,' think `Invisible Man,' think `Deep Blue Sea,' think `The Thing,' think several dozen other movies). But `Resident Evil' is not content to steal merely from those movies. We are also treated to the slow-motion, suspended-in-midair kickboxing moves from `The Matrix' as well as the slide-and-dice laser beam from `Cube,' which manages to leave body parts galore strewn all over a shiny hallway floor.Perhaps because the characters all seem to look and sound so much alike, I kept getting the impression that the filmmakers were reusing the same actors in different parts. How else to account for the fact that characters seemed to die in one scene, only to be miraculously resurrected for the next? (And I'm not talking about the zombies here). Or perhaps it is simply because the screenplay allows so few of them to distinguish themselves as individuals that we end up getting that impression. Though the art direction and special effects are state-of-the-art, the script seems woefully undernourished. But then again, this has become far more the rule than the exception in this particular genre of late.`Resident Evil' actually has a rather intriguing beginning and a very effective (and brave) ending. It's too bad that so much of what comes in between the beginning and the end reeks of second-rate horror movie theatrics. `Resident Evil' is nothing more than George Romero given a hollow, modern sheen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superbly well done cinematic achievment.RESIDENT EVIL gets a ****/***** stars!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RESIDENT EVIL, was so much better than I expected. The movie itself was not just a horror, but a thriller/action film as well. Great combination of these traits, as well as great characters, special effects, plot development, and just plain weirdness, make RESIDENT EVIL truly one of the best horror films ever. I own the first Resident Evil game(got it used), and never got real far, because I got an XBOX around last year when it came out, but now after this movie, I think I might just play the RESIDENT EVIL game more again! The movie really does go along with game nicely. The plot and characters aren't exactly all the same, but the basics are, and it's almost that you'd expect the game came off the MOVIE, instead of vice-versa. If you want a great horror, thriller, or action movie(or all three), rent RESIDENT EVIL-I assure you that you won't be let down. 4/5 stars.NOTE: This movie is pretty gorey, so if you don't like gore, don't get it. Then again, why would you get a horror/action movie if you don't like gore?:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Paul Anderson has done two of my favorite films--"Mortal Kombat" (I know it's based on a video game but I liked it) and "Event Horizon" (one of the most unsettling sci-fi/horror films ever). This movie (also based on a video game) isn't good as the other two. But for what it is, it's great.A virus is mistakenly (?) let loose in a huge underground city run by a corporation. It kills everyone there and a military squad is sent down to deactivate the central computer. But the computer is active, aware...and angry. Soon the squad is dealing with flesh-eating zombies, zombie dogs and a huge, scary, angry mutant.The plot is needlessly complex and convoluted and brings the movie to a screeching halt so characters can explain what's going on. Also this movie goes out of its way to show Milla Jovovich nude more than once. But still, I enjoyed this movie. The acting is OK except for Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez--they're both very attractive but are terrible actors--there blank faces and lousy dialogue readings got annoying. The male members of the cast were, on the other hand, very good. The special effects are stunning and the movie is very loud, very fast, very violent and FUN! The booming music score helps propel the movie along. Also it has more than its share of creepy moments (the voice of the computer spooked me for some reason--it's a little girls voice!). Blood, violence, noise--hey, what more could you ask for? Worth catching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil was not a good movie.I watched this movie not being a fan of the game, but a huge fan of zombie-killing movies in general. I was expecting more from Resdient Evil than the other videogame movies. Although Resident Evil was better than said movies, that's not saying much. Since it was an 18a movie, I was expecting some gruesome scenes. Instead, I was presented with some cheesy laser cutting action, which unrealisticaly seemed to go right through the guys, leaving no identifiable burns. It would have been a lot nicer to see some sizzles and cracks, or maybe to see that dudes intestines fall out as he jumped up. But unfortunatley, the movie quickly moves away from any images of real gore. To me, this was pretty bad, considering this was supposed to be a zombie killing movie.The movie also had some confusing parts. Twice the main character, played by Milla Jovovich (which may have been the only really good part of this movie) was surrounded by zombies and it seems there is no hope, when suddenly she appears climbing up a ladder away from them, or closing a door on them.The zombies themselves were not that great either. The movie totally abandoned the style that I can even respect in the game. There were no axes, knives, chainsaws, flamethrowers, or other such weapons of violence. Instead the victims used guns to create small little holes in the zombies that did nothing. The makeup of the zombies wasn't anything out of the ordinary either.Some people have said that the story matters more in Resident Evil. Um, but the story isn't that great either. Just another cliched example of the all powerful evil bioweaponry cooporation. And if I wanted a story, I'd read a book.Resident Evil is the perfect example of how someone can mix a beautiful woman, zombie killing action, a creepy mood, and a heavy metal soundtrack and somehow manage to corrupt and detract from each element to create a 5/10 star movie at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of action, sci fi and even (good) zombie movies I found this movie vastly overrated. The action is nearly non existant, the sci fi was thin and stretched but the zombies were just ok. That majority of this movie is movie is cliche after cliche and you almost always know whats going to happen next. Its pretty obvious who will survive the whole ordeal right from the begining, and who the 'secret bad guy' is amongst the team. There are also some major holes, like there is a point where everybody is surrounded by zombies right when they first get attacked, then the scene changes and some of the team are just running, wow, I guess the zombies just let them by eh? Or I love the fact that these people come back to the team later on in the movie and yet again, didn't have to deal with the dozens zombies they had to walk through to get back to their team (which you hear hitting the door when thye close it).If you're desperate for a zombie movie, I guess its worth a rental, or maybe you're a huge fan of the Resident Evil games, but otherwise I can't even recomend it for rental... much less the price of a movie ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An over-sincere but occasionally effective remake of a computer game. Pretty, young hard nuts have to try and get out of a concrete sarcophagus. Along the way they have to battle a Hal (Kubrick's 2001) ripoff, a small army of zombies that make Shaun of the Dead look like a serious film and another character who shall remain incognito because a) it would be a spoiler and b) it's shoddy CGI and doesn't deserve discussing anyway.A whodunnit-type subplot is also in play to keep you interested, because the killing sure as hell won't. It works OK and despite their relentless 2-d seriousness the characters are all adequately presented; I've always liked the girning, Hispanic tough-girl Michelle Rodriquez who manages to convince despite being typecast (see the equally contrived S.W.A.T.).You'll watch this if you want exactly what you expect but in a different package.

		<fullReview>The gift of the IMDB is that it gives people like me the oppurtunity to voice his reaction to a film and now I am going to indulge on this privilege. THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN! First of all the music overwhelmed the dialogue: during the action sequences the actors lips would be moving but all you would hear would be the techno-musical score that resembled the sound of a hammer pounding on a bag full of electronics. Perhaps the filmakers were so embarassed of their final product that they tried to cover it up with the soundtrack. Another thing that I noticed was that there were few establishing master shots, so the actors would go from room to room and the audience would not have a clear idea of where they were coming from or where they were going. It could be that the producers didn't want to invest any money into a good production design so we are stuck with tight, cookie-cutter shots of the enviroment. That takes me to the story itself, which is nothing more than elements from other, better movies (Alien, Dawn of the Dead and Outbreak). And worst of all, just when you think it's over, the movie adds on an epilogue to set up a sequel. All I can do is hope that this film losses enough money to convince the producers that to make a sequel would be truly evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of video games. I love the medium just as much as I love movies, but when a couple of people up at Hollywood decided to merge the mediums together, 9 times out of 10 the merge turns out to be a waste of time and money. Your money, that is. This movie is nothing more than a cheap cash-in on a great series of games. It is a huge disappointment on a vast array of levels.The only area this movie prevails in is it's action, but even that area is in really rough shape. The action is violent, gory, and devoid of all intelligence. The action ranges from some neat zombie vs. human confrontations, such as being the human's being trapped in a sewer and zombies are approaching from all possible sides, but at other times there are some real stupid sequence taking place (Kung-Fu lady vs. Zombie Dogs!) that are really embarrassing. Plus, the action gets really stupid when the CG starts to kick in, given that the CG looks dated compared to today's modern video games. No joke.All other areas in the film really suck. The story is bogus, disjointed, and incoherent. The acting is bad (probably intentional, given the voice acting in the games is bad as well), and the production values are not as high as they should have been. To top it all off, you get Paul W. S. Anderson, a man who has brought more shame to the movie industry than Nixon brought to politics. His stupid one-liners, dumb cinematography, bad editing, and pitiful script should be the prime examples in this country's film schools on how NOT to make a movie.To be honest, I had a little fun with this dumb movie. With all the absurdities and such, I just decided to make a joke out of the movie and not take anything serious at all. I think I wound up liking the film because of that.All in all, Resident Evil is a corporate cash-in on the name that really dose not deserve such a bad adaptation. Unless you desperately want to see zombies get their fillings of brains, just avoid this film unless you really want to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly believe that Paul Anderson thinks adding heavy metal music to a zombie-littered action sequence will somehow improve the genre of 'horror'. What he fails to see is that Resident Evil in all aspects *should* be regarded as a horror film (with elements of action.) What he has managed to create is some obscene attempt at all-out action (involving horror elements.) What could possibly go wrong with that? Well, in all honesty; horror isn't scary with some teenage metal band pounding your ears whilst a plague of zombies fills the screen, looking very unimpressive. Where's the atmosphere? Play the video game - you get bucket-loads; so why isn't that reflected in the film? I was very disappointed that the film is obviously aimed at the male 15-18 teenage-angst market, although I guess that's to be expected, as it is a videogame. Overall, tedium... unless you're into loud shouty heavy music interrupting a (quite stylistically) shot movie. Just hope he doesn't **** it up with Alien versus Predator... Yet that will be aimed at the same market. Gah! Still, nothing can be as bad as Mortal Kombat... How could a person who made something as stunningly tense and atmospheric as Event Horizon make trite like MK and Resident Evil?I voted this film as a 1-star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Video gaming is bigger business than movies! But movies innovate and create society where games borrow from and reflect elements of society. So its quite an interesting challenge in putting together a film project on a video game.First: you cannot, must not innovate. To emulate a video game you have to aggressively steal from other projects. You have to exclusively rely on stereotypes. That's because games have to have a passive imagination in the world: you have to not think about what it is or how it is put together so you can focus on the problem at hand. Films are all about creating a world in such a way that the registration of that world is the whole point; it should be engaging work.So here we have borrowing from `Alice in Wonderland,' `2001,' the zombie films, the Alien films and on and on.It is about fighting the building like so many haunted house films (and `Cube'). It is also about fighting zombies. No, you have to fight an alien creature (sexy girl losing her military companions). No, that's not right, you have to fight the selfinterested supercomputer. Oops, the real threat is doublecrossed conspiracy. Wrong again: the battle is the `the man.' Another twist: none of that matters since some combination of all the above has destroyed Toronto.This could have been really, really cool. It could even have been fun as we are buffeted among all these different types of films, each a discrete genre in itself. But no one involved has a smidgin of cleverness. Just one art director would have made all the difference. All we get is a map of the hive that doesn't correlate.Obviously, all the bucks were put on Milla. But she is as dumb as they come, so what you really need is someone who can photograph her well. She knows how to relate to that. But watch closely: no one did during regular filming. The studio went into remedial mode so added a lot of closeups that are distributed throughout. These are photographed with a fashion magazine sensibility with entirely different makeup and lighting than the surrounding scenes. Gives us good face, but sort of chops things up. That is to say: this was not done in the style of `Fifth Element' and `Joan' which was made by someone who knew how to photograph a face amidst action and who was smitten by that face.Maybe next time some better talent will be brought in.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

What we got was a cheapo British film with limited special effects and crap sets. The only special effects that were tagged onto this prosaic exploration of concrete tunnels and an office building were the laser slice up session, the CGI Alien creature rip off, the unexplained red dogs ( some which seemed to be a real dog covered in paint )a few slow motion bullets a la Band of Brothers and the Matrix and the hologram of the little girl. The rest was low budget British TV movie fare of the lowest order. Very basic zombies. i.e paint ordinary blokes in white paint, and add a bit off blood. Then the script. Where do you begin ? Basically take Aliens Space Marines and replace them with clichéd SAS types straight out of Ultimate Force. Don't even change the Hispanic girl Marine from Aliens, keep her in. Chuck in some Bourne Identity amnesia for the two central characters. This helps when they look bored and confused and disclaim their lines as if wishing they were somewhere else. Add some water. Hey it worked in the Abyss ! Then when the rushes still seem boring, throw in two nearly nude scenes of Mila for the teenage pervs to salivate over. If they'd had the bottle to make them fully nude it might have been worth the wait. But like everything else in this shoddy film they were half hearted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS... After a year since I last saw this mockery of film-making, I figured maybe a second-viewing would help me tolerate this film. That had to be the second biggest mistake of my life next to agreeing to go see Wing Commander. The mistakes and flaws in the film were made that much more obvious with a second-viewing I nearly had to gouge my eyes out in spite of its sheer medicority and utter ridiculousness.I tried to like this film... it was, after all, based on the cheesy video game from Japan that had some pretty good moments. I guess it was too much of a task to have both actors and a script in a movie even though Anderson has made some horrible films with some decent acting (Event Horizon) or cheesy acting with a pretty good film (Mortal Kombat). Resident Evil has neither. The plot is generic, and serves only as an excuse to develop a senseless sequel, have Milla pose half-nude (to appease the RE fans I figure) and have plenty of zombies go ballistic. With some stretch of the imagination this COULD be tolerable and FUN but there are two very glaring mistakes in the film that stand out like a leper in a crowd:1) Their choice of Actors - Cheesy, screwed up action films have only 2 saviors, excellent action sequences (to some degree), and at least average acting. Brotherhood of the Wolf, as ridiculous of a story as it was, had very decent acting and incredibly well-done sequences and cinematography. Resident Evil, with its silly storyline, had characters with the uncanny power to read their lines off script cards. Impressive. Can they act that horribly, or did they put effort into it? The leader of this ragtag bunch of soldiers was pretty cool. He could deliver all of his lines in monotone and display one facial expression. Needless to say, he was killed off quick. In fact, nearly all of the useless soldiers were killed off quickly (just like John Carpenter's Vampires) which I guess was a plus for Anderson. Michelle Rodriguez, playing in vain as the Vasquez-hack of Aliens (more about this later), tops him by emoting one emotion along with her delivery of lines in monotone. Sad, she was wasted in this film. A myriad of other characters share this same profile, including the dear Milla who can kill zombies with martial arts even though an entire clip of a MP5 will do nothing. By the way, why was she trained to do this? She could kick some serious behind for no explicable reason yet her partner/husband (this was never explained either) had none of the training? I assume all of this was discarded to ensure the people will return for the explanation in the sequel. At the other end of the spectrum, we also have Eric Mabius, who could display two emotions... slightly confused, and very confused. You know I've read the early drafts to this heinous monstrosity and he annoyingly keeps adding about how the suspense of this movie will freak you. Sorry, buddy, your whole crew of actors actually made us laugh more.2) Hacking other movies - I can point out at least a half dozen different scenes where Anderson (who loves to recycle other people's work) pulls from Aliens. These aren't subtle attempts, or clever renditions. I'm assuming his thought process was like this:Anderson: Wow, I just thought up of a cool and gruesome way to kill off all of my useless actors! What can I do to make it "suspenseful" and filled with "tension".Anderson's Brain: How about watching the movie Aliens and copy the scene where the marines were attacked for the first time?Anderson: Good idea! Let's see, I'll take the Hive, the Queen, and even the Aliens popping out of nowhere and snatching people. I could even recycle the lines without changing them! I am a GENIUS!Pretty pathetic, and I'm not even going to bother pointing out the stupidity of some of the plot elements or the other movies it borrows heavily from (like Odyssey). By the way, if this T-Virus was so powerful we are led to believe, why does it take a millennia for it to take effect on a live person? All in all, I couldn't find a single shred of entertainment in this. Why would I? If you took a recipe for Chicken with sauce diable and you thought it'd be neat to recycle it and throw in tang and peanut butter, it's not going to taste any good.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? This movie is one of the worst of 2002. All it basically is is a video game, nothing more. Plus, the whole Resident Evil franchise is BADLY overrated anyway. So, would you like to know why this movie sucks? It's clearly because that while I was watching this movie, trying to remain sane, I could not help but churn my stomach at a scene involving a laser slicing through ALIENS rip-off soldiers. Come on! Was this a message from the screenwriters saying that they ran out of ideas? Another thing is that I'm not saying that ALIENS rip-off soldiers are a bad thing. They did the same thing in Doom (2005). All I wanted to say is that when you want to kill off a cast, you have to come up with some plausible way of doing it. Plus, what makes me mad is that this movie could have been fun! It could have been cool! Why would someone write something so ridiculous?Nothing new is added, nothing interesting to look at, and nothing to get your spirits up. This is sci-fi at its worst. Do yourself a favor and watch 28 Days Later. It's a better zombie movie than this garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, well when you think about it, making a movie from a video game that primarily is a shoot-the-baddie's game there will be some big holes in the storyline and the plot. This is actually a movie that i had left twice before finally finishing it. When thats said i think the storyline and the plot is great, seen from the perspective that there wasn't enough of this from the game to make a movie with. But seen in the present of other movies in this genre or other movies that has been made from videogames, this one really sucks. Even if you are a huge fan of the games, this movie will ultimately make you suffer.The effects: The effects are on some occasions wildly and hugely overestimated. In some scenes a 45' can blast a hole in a building big enough to drive a lorry into the building, and in other scenes the exact same 45' can be used several times on a Zombie character and almost leave no marks.. In some scenes you see costumes that could be taken from "lord of the rings" and in other scenes they almost fall off the stuntmen wearing them!! Especially in one scene where some of a chase is in slowmotion you can see that everything on that actor/stuntman that are a part of his / her outfit is moving and shaking. If you like the genre of movies made from videogames and you want to see this one, i wont disencourage you. You'll find out for yourself. If you want to see some other movies made from videogames "DOOM" is much much better, even though that one isn't great either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was suppose to be based off the hit video game Resident Evil in which you play members of a special group in a mansion fighting off zombies and other chemically enhanced monsters. In this movie, our specially trained highly equipped special forces are killed by......lasers. More than half of the team is taken out and honestly, the monster madness isn't really much. This movie was pretty ridiculous. I thoroughly hated the movie. It is not faithful and it is not even a good adaptation of the games. The script is pretty silly. The action is god awful. The story itself is written by a monkey of a man as well as directed by one. I don't think this movie is very good for anyone. Even the blind would be offended. Weak acting from Milla Jovovich and bad acting from anyone else. So basically, go outside for a long job before you even think of watching this movie. It would do you a lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Disappointing Movie With Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it about zombie movies ? The Romero movies had good scripts but were let down by the technical aspects while LIFEFORCE and 28 DAYS LATER were brilliantly directed but had woeful scripts . I thought after watching the first ten minutes of RESIDENT EVIL someone had got the balance right with the opening hook featuring some impressive novelty deaths . The problem is after this good start the movie then spends the next forty minutes going nowhere . We know what's going on because most the audience is aware of the computer game so we have to put up with some seriously uneeded exposition about Alice , the combat team and the Red Queen computer system . What makes it all so annoying is that you're left with the impression that the producers wanted the movie to appeal more to a mainstream audience rather than fans of the game then at the very last minute abandoned their initial instinctsThere are a couple of good aspects that stop RESIDENT EVIL being a total flop , it's good to look at on a visual level while a mainly British cast do manage very convincing American accents , and not all the main characters survive ( watch out for those lazers ) which makes the movie unpredictable . But again I have to point out the movie would have worked better still if the producers ignored the fan boys and made a movie with a wider mainstream appeal . As it stands perhaps the 1970 DOCTOR WHO story Inferno is the greatest piece of fiction featuring zombies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i read in a magazine that ``the no talented one`` paul anderson said he was a fan of the games (yeah right) . if so then it would have been kept close to the game story line with some changes not an entire cast change and a different mansion from the game mansion the masion looked totally different from the game one the least they could have done was build some set pieces to match the mansion in the game.it gets me so angry to think that this movie could have been something special and what do we get someone who does not know how to make a good film. i mean look at his record - soldier/mortal kombat/event horizon they are not exactly great or goodfor that matter. any person who like`s the games who think`s this is great needs to open their eye`s and actually watch it 38 minutes pass without a zombie 38 minutes. and where is the hunters or the plant 42 or the tyrant or the fire snake or the lab monsters (the things that crawl across the ceilling in the boiler room in the game) none of those were in it why ?.i have found an address for the original Resident Evil movie script if you would like to know where it is (the script) contact me. it`s better than the script that got the green light .this movie is average no more as are all anderson`s movies. it frightens me to think what he is going to do to the nemisis film well here`s some tips for it.(1) have more zombies in the movie this time and make it more action because the first half of the original was boring nothing happened for 38minutes well just over 38 minutes before the first action scene. people getting trapped in a bloody tunnel is not what i would call action so MORE ACTION MORE ZOMBIES.(2) if you are going to have the nemisis in this movie use - Kevin Peter Hall as the nemisis he was the one who used to play the part of the Predator in those 2 action movies - perdator &amp; predator 2. he would be perfect as the nemisis and the right height as well.(3) get rid of Milla Jovovich and get some one with talent and some one who`s attractive like oh Miss Julie Condra she would be perfect as either jill or claire . she is in the movie - Crying Freeman an absolute beauty and a good actress. she is more than capable of taking the lead role in the evil movie`s.(4) decent heavy music like - Iced Earth / Annihilator / Anthrax / Sentenced / Charon. Iron Maiden / Dimmu Borgir / Megadeth (old school style) / there are too many bands to mention but they are all better than the muck that was on the soundtrack oh well i will make an exception Rammstein were the only decent band on it. there should have been more talented bands on it instead of this commercial metal nonsence.(5) replace the director (this should actually be #1).i could go on and on all day about how bad this movie is but i have better things to do. rating for the movie 3/10 could have been way way better.</fullReview>

I'm not going to go into any specifics of the film; it's not even worth the effort. It's not just because it's based on a video game, either.. The people who made Silent Hill managed to do a decent enough job transitioning that video game to the big screen.Resident Evil, nor neither of it's two sequels, has any redeeming qualities whatsoever.

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the Resident Evil video game series. So when it came out in cinemas I was very excited. I was disappointed to hear that George Romero had been replaced, with the guy (Paul W.S. Anderson) who brought us such treasures as 'Mortal Kombat', and 'Alien vs. Predator'.Still I was hopeful, despite my better judgment. I was expecting the same brilliant terror I'd come to love in Resident Evil. My hope was crushed as the movie began, flashy special effects, soulless action sequences. It was as if someone had taken the story, and hammered it into a shadow of itself. I expected survival horror, what I got was cheap action with cliché Hollywood shock scenes.This was not the marvel I expected. It lacked atmosphere, and relied heavily upon overly dramatic music suited only to excite a brain dead audience of zombies. A tribute to the works of George Romero, should never have been trusted in the hands of Paul W.S Anderson, butcher of great concepts.Even recalling this experience sends shivers down my spine, but not in the way Paul W.S Anderson and his team of Hollywood butchers intended.</fullReview>

That, what is acceptable in a game, is not in a movie. You see, "DOOM" wasn't good either but it was better.Even the fact that the movie starts quite promising only adds to your disappointment when zombies appear. Cheap, cheap, cheap...Original? You'll see a computer with self-preservative instinct, amnesia victims, underground (literally) secret labs, a corporative private army, a deadly virus, a predictable betrayal and all kind of old third-rate nonsense. Scary? Then only scary thing I found about RE is that you can advertise this kind of hackwork as an art and get away with it. Entertaining? You'll thank god that this realm of boredom only lasts for 1.5 hours (more than needed anyway).2/10 for Milla Jovovich and James Purefoy. There's pretty much nothing else to look at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films I've seen so far in 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember reading somewhere that George A. Romero, the great horror picture director, was originally slated to write and possibly direct the transformation of the playstation video game of the same name to the screen. Then it was also reported that the studio decided to go with another director on the project which to me indicates 1 of 2 scenarios- 1, Romero had lost his edge as a zombie film artist and did maybe write a bad script, or 2 (which is what I believe), the studios couldn't recognize what was possibly an intelligent script in the tradition of his "Dead" trilogy (I can only speculate by the way) and decided to go with something that was a lot more dumbed down for their standards.Whichever is the case, this is the result, a zombie movie where, truth be told, the zombies aren't quite the most ominous and terrorsome threat to the people in attendance in the film- a mega computer system in the form of a semi/mute HAL in a military complex is and that is one of many flaws and miscalculations here. Another is that the script has the dialogue span that a 10 year old would consider short winded (and this is a rated R movie) and development, yes even in action, that is not really good. In fact, the only thing keeping me from failing this is that the zombies when they do appear, look OK and the laser death sequence is a bit keen.In short, this is the type of living dead movie where you can see what's on the other side of the spectrum of a movie like Day of the Dead (Romero's least effort) where there was more talk than action which didn't work that well and then this where even the action doesn't help to elevate poor writing (at least Day had a memorable ending). Hardcore Resident Evil fans should stick to the games and movies. Grade: Between D- and F+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Umbrella Corporation is one of the largest companies in the world; nine out of every ten homes has at least one of their products, usually health-care, medical or otherwise. However their main profits come from military projects and weapons research, with one such facility being The Hive ? an underground series of secret labs, employing 500 technicians and controlled by an AI computer called the Red Queen. When the computer detects a viral outbreak in process she seals the Hive and kills everyone. A team are dispatched to find out what happened and shut down the computer; along the way they collect Alice and Spence, sentries to the Hive entrance, who have lost their memories and a cop. They follow their mission but quickly learn that things are not as straightforward as they had planned for.Although I like to think I'm a cinema elitist, I am pretty much a sucker for dumb action movies but when this came out at the cinema I just couldn't bring myself to go and see a video game movie that seemed to be universally slated by the critics. Also, I am easily freaked out by zombie movies and these factors all meant that I didn't bother. With the film coming onto television recently I decided to give it a go and found it to be as weak in certain areas as I had expected but was surprised by the way I actually enjoyed bits of it. The plot is interesting on paper but in reality is used just like a video game ? the characters working though each level with some getting picked off on a regular basis. As a story it is no use but it does enough to set up some exciting moments. The film's big corporate edge and sense of foreboding is good at the start but as the film relies on gore and effects it becomes increasingly ineffective right up till the usual big monster at the end.Of course this is not to say that it is a wonderful film, because it isn't. Rather it is a derivative piece of noisy trash that is aimed at teenage boys and those that just like things to go "bang" regardless of the narrative but, as such, it works, pushing all the right buttons for people who enjoy this sort of stuff. The cast are average at best, thanks in part to the video game direction and lack of interesting lines/characters. Jovovich is usually worth watching and she is a fairly enjoyable action heroine here but she has nothing more to do than that. Likewise the support cast features some solid, gruff performances from Rodriguez and Salmon but the others just about do what is asked of them. The creatures are not that scary, only gory and the direction fails to provide consistent scares; trust me, I'm easily scared by zombie movies and this one failed to do anything for me ? especially when they end the film chased by what looks like a mix of bad cgi and rubber.Overall this is not an awful film, just a fairly average one that will only really appeal to its target audience. Outside of teenage boys (and their adult equivalent) the weaknesses here will be too much but for those of us that just want a bit of mindless action without being too demanding will find this watchable if hardly brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Macho &amp; Violent.....And That's Just The Women!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 21st century science fiction/horror story should have been much better than it wound up. To me, it had a couple of major problems, namely: It had very few likable characters and way overdone violence. Regarding the latter, even with the good special-effects, nonstop violence only serves to become boring after awhile. When are filmmakers going to learn this? Certainly not director-writer Paul Anderson, who was responsible for this after two previous bombs in "Event Horizon" and "Soldier." If you recall, those movies also were disappointing.The women in here are Hollywood's new type of heroine: tough-looking, tough-talking and overly macho. Whatever happened to nice girls? If you lived on another planet and only watched movies made on Earth, you'd think women were physically tougher than men, and all want to act like men. Michelle Rodriguez played a character ("Rain Ocampo") who personified this misconception to the hilt. She was annoying, to say the least, as was this film in general which is made to satisfy millions of immature young males. Judging by the amount of reviews here, the filmmakers succeeded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AMAZINGLY WELL DONE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start off by saying that I was blown away by this movie. I am a big fan of horror movies. And seeing as most video game to movie adaptions are utter complete crap, I wasn't expecting too much from this movie. This movie grabbed my attention from the first frame and held it to the very end. I know what you're thinking...."Resident Evil a '10'?" Let me tell why this is is so well done. The games mostly focus on a company doing genetic experiments and create zombies. Mayhem ensues. The movie starts out telling you a little about the corporation. Not too much to make it a drawn-out scene, but to give enough to know what is going on. Anderson then makes a seamless transition from the intro right into the lab. The opening scene is done so well, without using a lot of dialogue and letting the music build up the tension. The score really makes the movie. A different score would have made this just another zombie flick, but Manson does his best work to date. (And I'm a big Manson fan who owns all his albums. I am eagerly awaiting his next release after hearing the Resident Evil theme.) The score starts with an ominous sound, followed by a creepy keyboard intro and a simple driving bass riff. As the song progresses, more and more tension builds as drums, guitar and the other sounds are added. This song is short, but works so well with the opening sequence in establishing the tone of the movie. Gothic, haunting and creepy all at the same time. Now about the other fronts. This isn't on the same level as some other movies. It isn't a brilliantly written script. The subject matter isn't very intellectual, but rather primal and savage. When making the judgment, you have to view the movie for what it is. A fun, gore-filled thrill ride. The actors don't do anything oscar-worthy, but they do portray their characters well. The make-up work IS oscar-worthy. While its not on the same level as something like Lord of the Rings, it is still quite amazing in its own right when seeing how many zombies they have to create. I would say the film is well-directed, seeing as the director did make an enthralling movie that kept me glued to my seat for the entire time. I don't think I've been so brought into the world of the film then with this movie. I also jumped at a few parts, which is doesn't happen often. This also has one of the best endings I've seen in a movie. So far, this is hands down the best horror movie I've seen in 2002, one of the best movies of 2002 and one of my favorite movies of the horror genre. I'd place right next to Night of the Living Dead, the other masterpiece. In fact, you could almost call this a modern version of the 1968 classic. Now, for the poor reviewers I have this to say. You probably didn't like this just because Romero didn't direct it. And while I consider Night a classic, I hated the other 2 movies in the Dead trilogy. And you can't say the movie didn't capture the spirit of the game. If anything, it captured it all to well. As with all movies, there are those who love and those who hate. My advice? Give this a try expecting nothing and just watch and enjoy the movie. You'll thank me later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually, it's something of a mixed bag, but the good far outweighs the bad in this case. I'll start with the bad first. The bad news is that the film seems a little tame in comparison with the computer games, which are some of the bloodiest and most creepily atmospheric releases the video game world has seen. Often, when you want to see blood gushing everywhere, all you will get is a relatively nice and clean death. A bit disappointing, but that's to be expected when the Moron Picture Association of America steadfastly refuses to acknowledge that adults watch films, too.The good news is that the same creepy atmosphere that made the games so grand, and made such interesting films as Night Of The Living Dead the way they are, is well-represented here. During each and every scene, one almost leaps out of their seat, anticipating the attack of a spider or a licker. The clever references to the games are also quite well-done, as is the reference to Day Of The Dead. Milla Jojovich really does a great job of bringing Jill Valentine to life, and the rest of the cast, anonymous though they may be, do a bang-up job of supporting her.Frankly, I cannot wait for the director's cut on DVD. I want to see more blood and gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I'm incredibly bored and this movie is on TV now and I forgot how bad it is. So, I'm going to fill the next hour and a half with this pap and write as I watch. There is not one memorable character in it at all, apart from Milla Jovovich, who I would decline to actually refer to as a "character". She spends most of the runtime looking at things with a stupid, wide eyed glare, only taking a break to bullet time kick a dog in mid-air. Oh, and then there's Michelle Rodriguez looking angry, and sounding angry. Scary.Everyone else is just a cardboard cutout, never fleshed out or even given a decent line. They jump through a window at the beginning - I guess that's what Paul WS Anderson considers "character development"... All the dialogue that follows after that is a bunch of useless, boring exposition. Who are these people and why the hell should I care? There's too many of them, all of them generic and never given anything to do.The film simply looks ugly and drab - nondescript metal corridors and rooms full of boxes and hokey machinery. A talented DP could make this look good, but instead it comes across as overly sterile. And the insulting computer generated map of the facility is just... ridiculous. Could this movie be any more aimed at morons? The zombies are pathetic. The action is poorly filmed. Most of the time we get a shot of someone firing a gun, sometimes in slow motion. The gore level should have been much higher, at least there would have been something to look at, but instead there is barely a drop of blood. Zombies drop to the ground in a bloodless heap while dusty squibs explode sporadically and unspectacularly. Aside from a few shots, you'd think they were aiming for a PG-13. Maybe they were, knowing PWSA.Why PWSA felt the need to stray so far away from the original atmosphere and story of the game is beyond me - surely, a talented writer could have structured a tense, claustrophobic zombie story set in the mansion, with the STARS team as characters? Instead, we got a derivative, half assed rip off of a bunch of different horror/sci-fi/action movies, and none of it works. There is no story here, just a bunch of crappy clichés and poorly orchestrated "scary jump" sequences where something crashes into a window. No tension at all.You know, there's movies as silly as this one, but they succeed because they KNOW they're silly. They wink at the audience. Instead, PWSA treats his audience with contempt. This is completely soulless, franchise film-making. You just know he came into the suit's office and pitched how he could make a dumb movie on the cheap, and the fans of the game would come in and see it regardless of how bad it was. He didn't even ATTEMPT to make a good movie.Back into another smoky corridor, suddenly filled with zombies. Horrid, obnoxious industrial metal music blares at the viewer while Milla "kicks ass" in slow motion again. Poorly edited, poorly filmed.Random guy: "We're all gonna die down here." Milla: "No, we're gonna get out. All of us." Ergh, this is gonna go on for another half an hour isn't it? Oops... Time for some weird flashback. OK, there's an antivirus. Fantastic... Who cares at this point? Oh, and "Spence" was the guy who released the virus... Who the hell is Spence? I guess he's one of those random cardboard cutouts that have been walking through the movie for the past hour and a bit. He looked so much like 3 of the other background characters, and didn't have barely a line of dialogue, so I would have never suspected him. What a brilliant twist! So now we have a Licker... crappy CG but it's by far the best thing in the movie so far. Too bad every shot of it is so short that we never get to really see it in action. And now we have another classic cliché - the action/thriller countdown, conveniently displayed on screen in big, digital numbers. Oh, and followed up by the return of a character that we all thought was dead! How surprising. I can't wait for the next cliché. Hahah, there it is. "Spence" is a zombie and he jumped at Milla - shocking! She then uttered a one liner and hit him in the head. Just lucky we have the big green digital watchface counting down to the end of the movie! Can't wait for it to end.So, now the Licker is jumping around inside the train. Sparks are flying everywhere... This must be the "climax". Milla just bullet-time shot it in the head. Didn't see that coming... Oh... and it's dead already. That wasn't very impressive. Michelle Rodriguez turned into a zombie and got shot in the head... How tragic. I was so very attached to her "angry" style of acting.FINALLY! The movie is over - and the last shot was probably the most impressive thing in the movie. It looked kinda cool... But that was very unsatisfying. And now there's some awful, lame nu-metal blasting over the credits. Horrible. Absolutely horrible. PWSA should be ashamed. And if you liked this mess, you should be too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes the fun out of movie watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a throwback to the movies of the late sixties and seventies, which were meant to take the fun out of movie watching. It reverts to the old Nazi standard of Hollywood in which any woman with dark hair and any man with fair hair must die, and the Nazi ideal of the blonde woman and brunette male live. The movie bends over backwards in its Nazi idealism, and it wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so trite and predictable. We get this 99 time out of a hundred, and it is dull, and it just isn't fun for anyone who isn't a Nazi. Can't say much about the plot. There is none. Can't say much about the acting. There is none. Can't say much about the characters. They are one dimensional cardboard stereotypes. Can't say anything good about the writing or directing. Total bomb. And depressing, too.</fullReview>
