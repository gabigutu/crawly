		<fullReview>Perhaps no other cinematic depiction of revolt against colonial rule is so detailed, vivid, and specific as the 1965 Battle of Algiers (La battaglia di Algeri, just reissued in a new print and having limited distribution in the US). It's a vivid and very specific recreation of the insurrection against the French in Algiers in the late Fifties that shows how the French systematically eradicated that insurrection. It's also a story repeated with variations in dozens of parts of the globe now, as then. But as I'm not the first to note, it's neither a partisan tract nor a user manual. It was therefore foolish of the Pentagon to watch it recently as if tips on how to control Iraqi `resistance'/'terrorism' were to be found in it, and it has been equally foolish of the Black Panthers or other revolutionaries to watch it seeking tactical information for their struggles. Those tactics did not succeed; but neither did the effort to quell the independence movement: the French won the battle but lost the war. A process that might have proceeded peacefully in a matter of months, takes years to happen. The film documents the sad foolishness of solving conflicts with violence, the maximum loss and suffering on both sides and the protraction of the inevitable outcome.The insurrection The Battle of Algiers describes was effectively quelled through the leadership of the bold, methodical French Colonel Mathieu, who as we see succeeds in eliminating the organizational structure of the resistance, `triangle' by `triangle', using torture to ferret out names and locations of the autonomous `terrorists'/'partisans,' then killing the `head' of the `worm' their structure represents so it can't `regenerate.' Once this happens, after a merciless French campaign following a general strike, the sympathizers in the majority Algerian population are totally demoralized; but two years later a vigorous national independence movement `suddenly,' `spontaneously,' springs forth, and not long afterward France has to grant Algerian independence. It's at this point, rather than at the moment of Mathieu's momentary triumph, that the film ends.Gillo Pontecorvo undertook his masterpiece after prodding from the resistance leader, Saadi Yacef, but he made a film equally sympathetic toward and critical of both sides. We see as much of the French dissection of the situation and repression of it (by the police chief, then Colonel Mathieu) as we see of the `terrorists'/'partisans' planning and execution of their actions. We see Colonel Mathieu as an appealing macho hero with moments of noble fair play, a shades-wearing, cigarette puffing veteran who moves around with clarity, honesty, and panache; he himself has a `partisan' background. The `terrorist'/'rebel' leaders are serious, intensely committed men of various types, from the sophisticated intellectual to the young firebrand. There are no `heroes' here; or, alternately, if you like, they're all `heroes.'Mathieu appears before the press beside the captured `rebel'/'terrorist' leader - an unusual move in itself - and expresses his respect for the man's courage and conviction. The `rebel' leader in this scene is eloquent in defending `terrorist'/'rebellion' methods such as the use of baskets filled with explosives in public places. `Give us your bombs and we'll give you our baskets.' Mathieu for his part effectively explains to the journalists the necessity of torture to short circuit the `rebellion'/'terrorism'. After this explanation, the film, typically systematic at this point, begins showing a series of tortures of Algerians being carried out.The first image we see in the film is the shattered face and body of the small, tortured Algerian man who's broken down and revealed where Ali `La Pointe,' the firebrand, the last remaining leader, is hiding. Then we see the `terrorist'/'terrorist' leader Ali and his closest supporters trapped like deer in their hideaway, their faces soft and beautiful. The splendid black and white photography works like William Klein's Fifties and Sixties images (he's one of the key visual commentators of that period stylistically) to powerfully capture the edgy soulfulness of the North African people and their gritty Casbah milieu. Much of the film's power comes from the way Pontecorvo was able to work, through Saadi Yacef, directly in the Casbah among the real people - as Fernando Meirelles worked in the favelas of Brazil recently with local boys to forge the astonishing City of God.The voices, which are dubbed, as was the fixed Italian filmmaking style, work somewhat less effectively because of obvious disconnects between mouth and sound at times, but the French is so analytical and the Algerians' Arabic so exotic-sounding (even to a student of Arabic) that they work, and the insistent, exciting music composed by Pontecorvo himself in collaboration with Ennio Morricone is a powerful element in the film's relentless forward movement.The fast rhythms of the editing are balanced by the stunning authenticity of the hundreds of Algerian extras who swarm across the screen: it's in the crowd scenes that The Battle of Algiers really sings. There are many superb sequences of street fighting, of people massing at checkpoints, of the French victims innocently assembled in public places; and like an exhilarating coda there is the scene of joyous victory as Algerians celebrate their independence in the last blurry moments. This is a film (again, like City of God) of almost intoxicating -- and nauseating -- violence, complexity, and fervor. Pontecorvo's accomplishment, though, is the way through showing the leaders analyzing and debating the action he freezes any impulse toward partisanship in its tracks. The evenhandedness of the coverage works a Brechtian `Alienation Effect' so you don't get caught up in rooting for one side or the other.The sequence of three pretty Algerian women carrying out an operation is a particularly memorable one -- but only one among many. First they take off their burqas and cut their hair and doll themselves up French style and then they get past the checkpoint into the French quarter to leave handbags full of explosives in a bar, a dance club, and an airport lounge. Again close-ups of faces in the bar and the jive dancers with jaunty jabbing elbows in the club show a brilliant use of image and classic editing: first the innocent, vulnerable faces, then the explosions. Here our sympathies for the French victims are fully awakened. Another sequence of Algerians removing bodies from a building has all the power and sadness of Christ's Passion.There's no point where as in a conventional thriller we feel excitement and sympathy for the perpetrator, because we see the cruelty of the perpetrator and the humanity of the victim every time. The Battle of Algiers is a final triumphant use of Italian cinematic neorealismo. The killing is observed neutrally, but with sadness, as part of a stupid game caused by ignorance and played out compulsively when a political settlement would have been infinitely better - a stupid game observed with astonishing zest.Revived thirty-five years later in a new 35-mm. print, its grainy beauty pristinely vivid, The Battle of Algiers remains a superbly made machine that plays out the addictive game of `terrorism,' repression, torture, revolt, and full-fledged insurrection as effectively now as when it was first issued. Like any classic, it's of its time and of all time. There's a lesson here, but it's not for partisans or colonialists: it's for all people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be mandatory viewing for every American</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Battle of Algiers" is simply one of the greatest films every made. If film making can be about truth as well as fantasy, then a movie that includes a title card telling viewers that there is not one foot of documentary or newsreel footage in it must deserve viewing."Battle of Algiers" contains scenes that seem so real, you suspect that they couldn't have been staged. When three Algerian women come down from the Casbah to plant bombs in the French quarter of the city, you can almost cut the tension with a knife. When the bombs go off, you think they must have been real bombs. And when you see the devastation they leave in their wake, you cannot fail to be moved. The massive rebellion in the streets at the end of the film also seems so real, you sit wondering how many extras must have been injured filming those scenes."Battle of Algiers" combines brilliant photography, crisp direction, an intriguing plot and some very fine acting. Throw in a terrific music score, splendid editing, impressive special effects and the best example ever of docudrama style production and you have a masterpiece of film making.But film making is not nearly as important as human life and no film in general release today says more about America's current involvement in the middle east and many other parts of the world than this picture about the French in Algeria, made more than three decades ago.Every American should view this film, then think about our current occupation of Iraq.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A savage war of peace.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An historian writing about the Algerian war against the French colonial authorities entitled his book "A Savage War of Peace". "The Battle of Algiers" provides many answers to that enigmatic title. It does not attempt to show us the entire war but centers on the city of Algiers. Even though you are told at the beginning that no documentary footage is used it is at times hard to believe as many of the images you see have a stark and often unsettling reality to them. Considering that this was a co production between Algeria and Italy the film is remarkable in that it does not turn itself a political tirade by taking sides. Instead the camera is a sort of neutral observer allowing us to witness events that spiraled from individual demonstrations to a full scale war of savage intensity. French officers who fought the Nazis a few years before degenerated into the mode of their former enemy while Algerians had no problems exploding bombs that would kill their own people. The camera shows no heros or villains but humanity in its darkest forms. This is a powerful film with superb direction and cinematography. It truly is one of a kind and once seen will never be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unforgettable study of occupation and defeat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1962 after more than 130 years of French colonial rule, Algeria became independent. Gillo Pontecorvo's `Algiers' shows the decade leading to that liberation in a powerful story about Muslims asserting their rights through violence, hiding, and plotting in the Kasbah, a demiworld of narrow, winding, seemingly endless alleys that are the only protection the rebels have from the eyes of the French. The re-release of the 1965 black and white film is a convincing story of a people who do not want to be occupied and will give their lives so their families can one day be free.The story centers on a couple of Muslim leaders, the charismatic Col. of the French forces, and the bombings and shootouts that at one point averaged just over 4 per day. The film's sympathy is for the Muslims, but the Colonel has moments of reflection that could be sympathetic, especially with the revelation that he was a member of the resistance in WWII and may have suffered in a concentration camp. The director shows the influence of Italian neo-realists like Roberto Rossellini (`Paisan') by shooting in documentary style on location, using non-actors (except for the Colonel), and generally avoiding an agitprop angle.But the film's sympathy in the end belongs to the occupied people. When 3 rebel women change appearance to look French, infiltrate, and plant bombs, the irony obvious to American audiences in their current struggle is a tribute to the strength of the narration and characterization and the universal dislike of occupation and subjugation.The torture of the Muslim prisoners is the most poignant relevance to the recent scandal in Iraq. The Colonel's justification for the practice to gain life-saving information is classic `ends-justify-the-means' logic still being used by great nations. In fact, the Pentagon reportedly had seen this film during the first days of the second Iraq War; some say they learned nothing from the film, which is an unforgettable study of occupation and defeat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I ask myself why we never see these kind of movies on TV, instead of airing again and again the same old lethal weapons, jurassic parks, and other similar stuff? This is real cinema, this is why it is considered a form of art!With the metaphysical crudeness of black and white, the dramatical facts of the Algerian rebellion against the French are accounted. The movie has the realistic appearance of a chronicle. And there are tons of intellectual honesty, too. I mean that there are no white hats VS black hats. You can see terrorists troubled as they are about to leave a bomb in a cafe. Policemen who struggle to save an arabian child from being killed by outraged crowd. Most of all, I like the frank words of Colonel Mathieu about the "bad methods" he's using during interrogations... Watch the movie and you will know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I could locate a videocassette of this film--subtitled, not dubbed. The first time I saw it, I was a little put off by what I thought was a pompous disclaimer that "not one foot" of documentary footage had been used. But, in light of the finished product, it's a remarkable statement. If a film has better captured the harsh and ugly realities that are an inevitable part of a true revolutionary movement, I never saw it. It is greatly to its credit that one never gets a sense of "good guys vs. bad guys" here--only of people trapped in a truly impossible set of circumstances, from which no escape is possible without confrontation and bloodshed. It was depressing to see this movie in Berkeley in the early 70s, and hear the audience cheer the "heroic" Algerian revolutionaries while booing the "villainous" French, in view of the great pains that had been taken to present a balanced viewpoint. This film is thrilling, heartbreaking, thought-provoking, and beautiful--sometimes by turns and sometimes all at once. If you haven't seen it and it show up anywhere in the vicinityh, drop everything and go--and pray that it's subtitled and not dubbed. (There are dubbed prints and, as is usually the case, dubbing pretty nearly wrecks it.) This is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

With the tradition of Italian Neo Realism and French New Wave - i.e. shooting in location and casting nonprofessional actors, The Battle of Algiers harshly seals the ugly realities of both French Legion and Algerian Guerillas - i.e. indiscriminate bombs, tortures, and scapegoats.

		<fullReview>Just when I thought I was starting to hate every movie in sight, I had the amazing priveledge to watch "the Battle Of Algiers" which is this amazing account of the oppression of the Algierian people by the French in the 1950's. When the movie starts, we see 4 people hiding from the French Army. Then all of a sudden, this amazingly haunting music starts, and we're told the story in flashback of how the Algierian people tried to revolt against the French Soldiers.From what I understand, the movie uses no documentary footage, which is amazing as some of the scenes in the movie must have taken a great deal of effort to produce., There are some pretty amazing crowd scenes and the explosion scenes are just breathtaking.Also, I guess some of the actual revolutionaries are in the film as well. They are pretty hard to point out as all of the acting here is amazing, very realistic.So, looking for a war movie? Dammit, don't go for Private Ryan, go to Algiers. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>If one has not seen this film, one cannot begin to imagine Pontecorvo's extraordinary achievement. The acting is so natural and convincing that many viewers and even some critics assumed that the movie was a documentary. Only a master director could have taken this raw acting material and gotten such performances out of it. And despite his leftist viewpoint, Pontecorvo neither ridicules or demonizes the French, as does Michael Moore the Americans in his recent putative documentaries Bowling at Columbine and Farenheit 9-11 -? though I do a disservice to Pontecorvo to compare his work to that of Moore.See this movie now that it has been released on DVD in the United States and learn from the history it so brilliantly conveys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best historical film ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Battle of Algiers might well be the best historical film ever. It stands out as a splendid work of art, as an extremely accurate depiction of a specific time and place, as a political hymn to independence, and as a thought-provoking philosophical reflection on violence, and on the relationship between ends and means.It depicts the crucial years 1956-1957 in the Algerian war of independence from French colonial rule: the leaders of the independentist FLN decide to make Algiers a battlefield through strikes and terrorism in order to shake colonialism and to unite Algerians. The French respond to this urban guerilla with a ruthless control of space, separating European and Arab (the 'casbah') parts of the city, and with a brutal hunt of the FLN leaders through the torture of lesser militants. The French paratroops under gen. Massu, col. Bigeard and cdt. Aussaresses (blended in the film into a synthetic and fictitious character, col. Mathieu) eventually 'win' the battle of Algiers, but they end up 'losing' Algeria, as their repression has only fueled nationalism. The film therefore ends with the vision of Algerian crowds demanding independence ('Istiqlâl') as they march through the streets of Algiers in 1960.While this is an accurate enough analysis of such a complex war (even though interestingly de Gaulle is absent from the film as it intends to show how independence was conquered, not handed from above by French authorities) it is also a metaphor, as the film works on many different levels.It is a masterpiece of editing and cinematography. The combined use of space and music is stunning: when the french paratroops take possession of the Casbah, literally filling up the frame, gaining control of the streets, rooftops, hallways, courtyards, their superbly choreographed movements are underlined by a haunting theme by Morricone &amp; director Pontecorvo. In these sequences he rivals not only Rossellini but Eisenstein.It is also strongly influenced by the New Wave in its manner of filming faces of protagonists. Some of the most beautiful moments in the film (as the beginning in Ali's hiding hole, or the scenes before the explosions in the bars) consist of protagonists' faces, victims, perpetrators, bystanders, shot in close up, in a beautiful black and white, without comment or voice-over: their common humanity is shown as well as the determination, the inner flame of those fighting for independence.I would disagree with other reviewers saying the movie is is unbiased: the film was commissioned and encouraged by the new-born Algerian state, and Yacef Saadi, a leader in the war of independence appears in prominent role. While the violence of both sides is coolly examined, the film justifies that of the Algerians, if only by showing (in a slightly dishonest way) that it always responds to the violence of the French. This question of precedence (who started to be inhuman?), though in the end quite pointless, has long poisoned mutual understanding between French and Algerian memories of the war. Another bias, explained by the FLN financing and staging, is the almost complete absence in the film of the middle ground, those neither in the terrorist FLN or in the paratroops, desiring to live in peace. They have existed, in both sides, as the examples of writer Albert Camus and his friend Mouloud Ferraoun show. This is quite understandable as it might not fit in the epic text depicted in realistic manner by Pontecorvo. However, in the film, the Algerians that are not committed to war are shown to be gangsters and pimps: this is a minor flaw of the film and its only touch of propaganda.All that said, the film is a stunning visual, historical and ethical masterpiece. Sadly and ironically, it capture a fiery desire for liberty at the very time (1965) a military coup by Boumediene overthrew Ben Bella in Algeria, repressing liberties for the decades to come. Most of all, it is one of the most potent depictions of and reflections on violence (in the twin and extreme forms of terrorism and torture) to be seen on screen.The most powerful image of the film remains the vision of a FLN militant broken by torture and forced to confess the hiding place of his chief. His haunted look, exhausted stance, empty eyes, grotesquely dressed in a paratroops' uniform, stand as an indictment of colonialism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1954, the National Liberation Front of Algiers shots many French policemen beginning a movement for the independence of their country; in return, the Chief of Police plants a bomb in the Arab quarter, killing many dwellers. The NLF sends three women with bombs to two bars and the Air France office in the European quarter, killing many people. The French government sends the military forces under the command of the abusive Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin) that does not respect the human rights and uses torture to destroy the NLF command. In 1962, the Algerians finally achieve their aimed independence."La Battaglia di Algeri" is a powerful and impressive masterpiece about the fight that happened in Algiers in the period between 1954 and 1962 between the Algerian resistance and the French military forces. A couple of months ago I saw "Mon Colonel", another magnificent movie about this dark period of the mankind history. In both movies, we see no difference between the methods used by French in Algerian, or the Nazis in World War II, or the South American's dictatorships in the 60's, 70's and 80's, or by the American in Iraq, of the Chinese in Tibet. "Liberty, Fraternity, Equality for us, but torture and abuse of the human rights for the others" should be the correct sentence applicable to most nations. Therefore the writing of Machiavelli in "The Prince" about the behavior of the "princes" along history could be updated to the disrespect of human rights by powerful nations against weakest ones in the name of their best interests. This movie is impressive because it seems to be a documentary, with grainy cinematography and non-professional actors, in a perfect contemporary Neorealism. I am not familiar with the work of director Gillo Pontecorvo, but I really believe that this movie is his masterpiece. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "A Batalha de Argel" ("The Battle of Algiers")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film attains a level of importance that has never been achieved before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all go to the movies because we love to be entertained and it's hard to argue that it's the greatest form of entertainment but when serious viewers talk about film in terms of being important you would have to expect this title to be instantly brought up. This film covers the years from 1954 to 1962 in Algeria when the Arab section of Algiers started an uprising to fight the French and gain their own independence. Ali La Pointe (Brahim Haggiag) is a petty thief and hustler and when he gets out of jail he teams up with El-hadi Jaffar (Saadi Yacef) and together they form the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) in which they start terrorist attacks.*****SPOILER ALERT***** French authorities bring in Col. Mathieu (Jean Martin) to head the anti-terrorist unit and he uses methods of torture to slowly eliminate the insurrectionists who hide behind walls in apartments in the Casbah. Eventually Col. Mathieu kills Ali and it seems that everything will go back to what they were but two years later the Arabs take to the streets in huge numbers which causes the U.N. to take notice and in 1962 Algeria finally gained it's independence.This was made by Italian filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo who shot this in the actual locations in Algeria and used mainly non-actors in his cast (Martin is the only professional) and the story is based on a book by Yacef who not only is a survivor of these true events but is cast in an important role. Pontecorvo has created a film that seems so real that he had to have a disclaimer put into the credits stating that no newsreel or documentary footage was used which is incredible because there are so many scenes in which it appears that real events were caught on film. The script does it's best to show both the positive and the negative of both sides of the French and the FLN but it does seem that Pontecorvo leans towards the side of the Arabs. This all takes place in a time when most American viewers were not aware of what terrorism was about and in 1965 it was probably easy to just point at the French and think they should just get out but now in our day and age audiences are a little more sophisticated to the world and it's politics. There are scenes that take place that we will probably never see done again because of the lack of safety especially the shots of the bombs exploding and the (so-called) actors scrambling for their lives. Another point in the film shows a French soldier bursting into an apartment to search it and accidentally stepping on a crying baby! There is no doubt that this is one of the most important films ever made not just because of the subject matter but in the skill that Pontecorvo applies to achieve his vision. In 1965 this may not have been perceived as a truly great film but now 40 years later it's looked at as one of the most important films ever made and one that is studied by military personnel and those in the Pentagon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can A Mere Movie From 1966 Influence The 21st Century ? Maybe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What everyone forgets nowadays is that the French contribution to counter insurgency warfare was " The ink spot strategy " which was very effective against the Viet Minh in the early stages of the French Indo-China conflict 1946-54 . The same strategy was used most effectively by the British in Malaya in the 1950s where it crushed a communist insurrection , though it was painfully ineffective when the Brits used it in Afghanistan 50 years later . We can all remember the hurtful comments about France being shouted from The White House during Dubya's era but didn't stop the irony - if not out and out hypocrisy - of the same politicians watching this film in order to pick up a few tips on counter insurgency warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan Before tonight I saw this almost 20 years ago and have never forgotten it . What I remembered most was the very even handed dealt out to both sides . This doesn't mean it tries either side as light gray , more like very very dark gray which neither side should be proud of . Based on the grim realities of the time . The French are happy to carry out black ops against the rebellion by blowing up innocent Algerian citizens making out houses are used for bomb factories and brutally torturing interned suspects while the Algerian rebels ( FLN ) blow up innocent civilians at coffee bars and sports stadiums , their victims not being the French military but innocent men woman and children . There are moments that can only be described as surreal irony where for example an Algerian child is stopped from being beaten to death by a French gendarme This is a political film that shows a neutral point of view . In this type of conflict nearly everyone is neutral . Both the French and FLN try and make a headway in to turning the neutral in to being on " Our side ". Watching it in 2012 however you must be aware of one thing: The FLN are Muslims but they don't want to make a liberated Algeria in to a theocratic Islamic state - they're ( Relatively secular ) nationalists fighting again French colonialism . They're offering the Algerian people freedom from France not freedom from freedom . There's a subtlety to the ideas being put forward by both sides . The French realise not everyone is a terrorist whilst the FLN realise not everything can be solved by violence - revolutions need the will of the people . I could spend all day discussing the complex views put forward but there's a word limit of 1000 words . Just watch it and understand it There's some obvious flaws to the movie . One is that many of the deaths are a bit too bloodless . Another is that we never see what is happening outside of the Algerian capital though the war in the countryside is referred to . Perhaps the biggest complaint is that two years after the main action the story jumps forward where more violent demonstrations take place without the benefit of historical context but if you understand revolution it's because the occupying power hasn't provided any political gains to the wider Algerian population after temporarily beating the FLN . All insurrections are political in nature and if politicians can't bring a political carrot to the table after beating the insurrection to death with a stick then the violence will continue periodically and ultimately end in defeat . I do hope all politicians in charge of a NATO country realise this</fullReview>

It's hard to believe the film's claim that no real news footage was used; some of the later protests and city-wide survey shots look like could have come from contemporary news.Also, this movie's hardly biased.

		<shortDescription>A perpetually relevant story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS BELOW** Despite the visual style of this film, which makes it seem almost like a documentary set in the 1950s, contemporary viewers will find it strikingly relevant to the present day. Set in French-occupied Algeria, it tracks the story of Algerian resistance and attempts for liberation, and French countermeasures. While it does not paint an especially sympathetic portrait of the French, it doesn't shy away from showing Algerians placing bombs in civilian areas either. It does, however, depict the way that no action is without cause or consequence. From the very beginning, it is quite frank, without being gratuitously gruesome, about the ugly realities of torture ? something of a taboo in the present climate ? and of the way that violence begets violence, in an unsustainable spiral. Interestingly, although the film ends with a seeming defeat for one side, those watching the film today will know how things turned out in the time after the closing events. This knowledge gives a special poignance to the seemingly futile actions of resistance.Although the movie's focus is on the central character, Ali La Pointe, a young Algerian who becomes politicized and radicalized after witnessing an execution by guillotine, it really is the story of the Algerian community as a whole. The film depicts the steady accretion of humiliation and despair around the core of French occupation. Many youths are unemployed, and the contemptuous treatment they receive at the hands of the French, to whom they are of interest only as servants, save when pretty girls are whistled at, serves to further stoke their anger. The initiation of Ali into the FLN is like joining a gang ? he must prove himself by making himself vulnerable. The FLN addresses not only the material losses of the Algerian people, but also their loss of dignity. The daring raids against French police, the seizure of the microphone used to blast disheartening messages into the Algerian quarter, and other such tactics function to unite and uplift the community by putting active resistance on open display. The French respond by escalating violence even further, killing children, and the Algerians then respond with a further escalation.By incorporating women and children, Ali and his cohorts weave themselves into the fabric of their society. The women are handled in a particularly interesting way. A far cry from the two-dimensional arm-candy found in big budget Hollywood productions, these women neither sit passively at home, keeping the fire going for their men, nor do they behave like macho caricatures. In one particularly affecting sequence, three women each put on makeup, color their hair, and adopt western dress in order to head into the French zone and plant bombs. The women are variously fierce, or appear to have their hearts pounding in fear, each according to her own temperament. The intensity of their desperation for self-determination is palpable, even after so many years of occupation. Despite this, the director does not hesitate to show who is going to be killed by the bombs they plant. Many of these people are innocent or unknowing, like the small child with ice cream, or the teenagers happily dancing to music. When the bombs go off, there is panic, and shattered bodies are carried out ? once again, violence has begotten violence.The French response is to continue to bring a sort of 'scientific' pressure to bear. Colonel Mathieu (played by Jean Martin ? interestingly this is the only major role played by a professional actor) is completely impassive and unemotional in his approach, treating the FLN as a problem to be solved. He requires of his superiors that they allow him to abandon all humanity and brutalize any captive, as needed. He is thus delighted when he is given an 'excuse' to pen the Algerians into the Casbah, like rabbits. His every move is polished and calculated, and he even laments, "Why are the Sartres always born on the other side?" The French are shown destroying shops ? and then handing out loaves of bread. Surely there is no more striking illustration of how colonialism functions than that one. When he captures the rebel leader, he allows him to speak to the press, but only for long enough to make the point that he has been seized ? he ends the interview before he begins to engender too much sympathy. His theory about the rebels is in fact in some respects accurate: violence does not win wars ? the goal of the FLN is to show the populace at large that it is possible to resist. During the scene where Colonel Mathieu alludes to his own capture by Nazis in WWII, one wants to shout at the screen. Did he learn nothing from his experiences? Has he not found any compassion at all? The haunting sound of ululations ringing out in grief over the city suggests that it is perhaps this very element, the compassion of the Algerian people for one another, that ultimately enables them to oust the French, despite their superior, scientific tactics and their sophisticated weaponry. It would seem that the lesson here is obvious, but regrettably it is one lesson that people appear to need to learn anew with each generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A balanced and fascinating historical piece with lessons that extend far beyond Algiers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sections of Algeria are seeking independence from France, but there is no political will for them to e rewarded it and, if anything, the French are unwilling to give it and must demonstrate their strength by holding onto it. The formation of the FLN sees the struggle for independence take on a violent edge as terrorists (or freedom fighters) strike quickly and unseen, killing policemen across the city. As the situation spirals out of control the French bring in the Foreign Legion to take over, under the leadership of famed soldier Mathieu.One of the few films where I actually care about its IMDb rating, this is a strong film that surprised me by how balanced and even-handed it was. I don't know the whole history of the situation (outside of what this film tells me) so I'm not really set up to say how accurate it is but it is convincingly realistic and the apparent lack of bias in the telling makes it easier to believe that the film has not been made with a significant political agenda for one side or the other in play. Filmed in a style that put me in mind of the French New Wave films, it looks very natural and uses real locations to very good effect. The violence shown is shocking because I never expected such scenes ? perhaps they are not graphic in the way that Hollywood does violence to entertain us, but in a "realistic" documentary-style film it is hard not to be affected by the scenes of torture.By focusing on the guerrilla warfare of the FLN and the French's military efforts to defeat it, the film continues to resonate today ? which is why it was allegedly shown in the Pentagon and also why it continues to have a high rating on this site. Historians warn about learning the lessons from history and the concept here of the French defeating "terrorists" by using methods that completely lose the battle of ideas and the famous "hearts and minds". It makes such points by simply allowing them to make themselves ? ie the history is replayed warts and all and the lessons are clear (but sadly difficult to learn it seems).Overall then an impacting story that is very well told. Using a documentary style adds to the realism but it is the even-handed retelling and refusal to take sides that makes the film so strong and so relevant. With events in the world indicating that we haven't learnt much from even our recent history, this is definitely worth seeking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Birth of an Algerian Nation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers is a very unique war film. It is a documentary-style depiction of an uprising in Algiers against the French, and has the rare distinction of being told partly from the point of view of the radicals who, in this case, were terrorists. The film is very informative because, unlike most war films, it is told alternately from multiple points of view. This switching back and forth between several different perspectives provides a unique experience in watching the suffering that went on in Algeria during that nation's struggle for independence. (spoilers) This is a startlingly realistic and often painful depiction of Algeria's struggle; it does not make the subject matter easy to swallow, which is one of it's better points, in my opinion. I think that in films, especially war films, realism is the most important aspect of the entire picture. You could have amazing acting and spectacular directing and cinematography, but if anything is obviously falsified or exaggerated, that one thing can ruin the movie on its own. The Battle of Algiers does not go out of its way to provide a happy ending, although independence is eventually achieved by the Algerian nation. The goal of the Algerian people is reached, but the extensive cost of human lives is clearly and explicitly presented.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Algerian, I watched this movie 2 times a year for 20 years, this movie is a part of my story. It helped me to put imagines and sounds to stories I heard from my teachers, cousins, as my grand-parents and my parents still can't talk about that horrible war.By now, as I'm growing old, I understand that this movie is not the 'Truth', it was 'war', and in a war even good people can do horrible things. And I know what I'm talking about as I was there, in Algeria, during the 'Dark Decennial', while we were fighting against our own people whom turned terrorists in the name of Islam.So for those who will watch this film, please just remember not to judge any of the parties : Algerian /or/ French. It was a war and no war is nice, people die, and those who survive will suffer. Films/art are a form of exorcism for that pain we keep silently inside.I like this movie, because I saw tears in the beautiful green eyes of my grand mother every time she watched it and it always gave her a good opportunity to cry for my grand father that she lost during the war. I saw my father crying for his father that he never knew, and saw him also being closer to his mom because. For me, this movie will always be a 'Good movie to watch in Family'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Battle of Algiers" undoubtedly ranks among the most unique, innovative and essential war films to date. Especially because it comes entirely without the pathos, glorification, special effects and artificially created drama that crowds want to see to get some entertainment out of war. Instead the viewer gets a fresh historical scenario - the 1956/57 Algerian insurrection of the National Liberation Front (FLN) against the French colonists. Following the events laid out in the "Souvenirs de la Bataille d'Alger", a book written in prison by of one of the former FLN leaders, Yacef Saadi, it is an unvarnished account of a brutal reality that emerged as a natural consequence of colonial oppression. To add to the realism Yacef Saadi - now an Algerian senator - even plays a key part in the production.Outstanding feature of the film is that director Gillo Pontecorvo opts for a breathtakingly dramatized documentary style, a genre where he came from and clearly feels at home. The result is very close to newsreel footage, which makes it look like no other comparable war picture: Executions, demonstrations, strikes, bombings, interrogations, the house-to-house guerilla warfare look so real that Pontecorvo had to point out explicitly that not a single frame of actual documentary or news footage was used in the film. Furthermore the film stays as unbiased as possible and portrays both sides of the conflict: the rebels with the few, risky and desperate means they are capable of organizing to hurt the enemy, and the French paratroopers under Col. Mathieu striking back with unrelenting force in order to crush the FLN's backbone. The picture hasn't lost any of its relevance since the day it was made, as an uncomfortable question on both sides of a conflict arises again and again: Do the ends justify the means?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politically, tactically, socially astute. Also, a thrilling movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most war movies are peopled by overgrown children, or technicians, or cartoon heroes and villains. "The Battle of Algiers" is nearly alone in its fully believable depiction of adults at a particular time and place being molded by wartime experience. Only "Band of Brothers," in my opinion and to my knowledge, is worthy of comparison. In the other direction, the formulaic leftism and phony pretensions to knowingness in Pontecorvo's "Queimada" result, I guess, from its subservience to the director's thoughts rather than close contact with real events."Algiers" is a more complete film than "Brothers," showing the battle, if not the entire war, from inception to results, from the perspectives of the all the main combatants and bystanders. This is possible because the historical conflict was more circumscribed, and, despite its documentary feel, because "Algiers" has more fictionalization, such as combining several real people into one character and inventing others. Nevertheless, and with the provisos that there are honest debates and I am no expert, fundamental strategy and character have not been essentially falsified.The movie opens near the end of the battle, with a chillingly unexaggerated torture of a FLN rebel by the French army, and then proceeds to the beginning. "Algiers" shows a city that is largely either French and bourgeois, or Moslem and proletarian. Not comfortably so. The French have a professional army, but are in a demographically precarious position. Among the Moslems, socialism and secularism are in the air a bit. Most people fear being caught on the losing side, and try to wait and see. Consequentially, small numbers can tip the balance of power. Terrorism and threat of later reprisal are used to force people off or onto the fence. The rationale for the French strategy of policing and torture is also carefully laid out."Algiers" has a neither sentimentalized nor over-cynical understanding of human nature, and is very good at bringing alive the vagaries of charisma and public moods. At stake are lives, and ideology, and religion. The characters have thought hard about what is achievable, and what they are willing to sacrifice to win or survive. Appalling as are torture and random slaughter of innocents, by the end we have seen enough through the eyes of both sides to grasp how they came about.In the closing scene, the FLN's loss of the battle is juxtaposed with its later winning of the war in a way that suggests that France's loss was the logical result of France's brutality. But the intervening period is not depicted, and, to the movie's credit, causation is not clearer than in life. With hindsight, which includes the knowledge that the FLN's current extremely brutal war against an Islamist rebellion has worked, we can see that effectiveness of tactics depends on many details. Even though we know the history, the movie's tension is genuine because the outcome was not preordained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When 'La Battaglia di Algeri {The Battle of Algiers}' premiered in the United States in 1967, it carried a disclaimer, assuring the audience that "not one foot" of actual newsreel footage was used in the compilation of the film. This should give you some idea of the picture's startling documentary-realism. It's plain that director Gillo Pontecorvo began his career producing documentaries, and it is thoroughly exciting to see him exploit his knowledge of the medium to achieve incredible resonance through its brutal and frank depiction of an anti-colonial revolution. There are countless moments when you could swear that Pontecorvo made use of historical footage; surely such a passionate rally comprising hundreds of people could not be recreated so flawlessly for the screen. The camera sits amid the protesting civilians, is jostled by the crowd, reacts frantically to the spatter of machine gun fire, and trembles with each horrific street bombing. Accompanying these images booms a suspenseful musical score, composed by both the director and the great Ennio Morricone.'The Battle of Algiers' recreates the Algerian War of Independence, from November 1954 to December 1960, focusing entirely on the capital city of Algiers. Unsatisfied with remaining a colony of France, a selection of determined civilians (Brahim Hagiag, Yacef Saadi ? the latter playing a fictional version of himself) form the National Liberation Front (FLN), who sought to reclaim their independence through acts of terrorism and bloody violence. The escalating bloodshed leads to the introduction of French paratroopers, led by Colonel Mathieu (believed to be a combination of real-life officers Colonel Bigeard and General Massu, and played by Jean Martin). In a bid to combat the frequent street-bombs and police officer shootings, Mathieu employs any possible means, including lynch mobs, murder and harrowing methods of torture. The colonel's justification for ordering these acts is chillingly simple: "should we remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences."Another element for which 'The Battle of Algiers' has been praised is its relative lack of bias. Though the end of the film betrays an unmistakable support for the rebels' cause (an unsurprising outcome considering that it was partially funded by the Algerian government), it is often difficult to decide for which side you should show sympathy. Perhaps it was just my post-September 11/Bali bombings mentality coming through, but, having entered the film without any background knowledge, I spent much of it cheering for the charismatic Col. Mathieu and his paratroopers, hoping that they'd quickly and efficiently destroy those cowardly, café-bombing terrorists. Unlike other seemingly-similar revolution pictures (such as Eisenstein's 'The Battleship Potemkin (1925)'), 'The Battle of Algiers' doesn't attempt to push any clear agenda: every character on each side possesses a staunch inability to accept defeat; every character achieves great things and every character commits acts of violence too horrifying to even imagine. There are no clear-cut heroes and villains here; everybody is a hero and everybody is a villain. This is the way that life is. This is a revolution at its most truthful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ignored classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I want to add is some more background behind the conflict. Again the main source is Alistair Horne's book "A savage war of peace". Alistair Horne wrote a trilogy of books on 20th century French history incorporating Verdun, the fall of France in 1940 and the Algerian war. Although Britain also had an empire it seemed to be able to extricate itself from it in a less bloody manner and those colonies that did see conflict did not see the kind of bloodshed France experienced in Vietnam and Algeria. I think Britain was able to see that the concept of empire was politically, militarily, economically and morally unviable. The French did not seem to see it that way. Alistair Horne wrote that the French seemed to think that if the rebellion was repressed they could carry on ruling Algeria like Ian Smith's Rhodesia or apartheid era South Africa, a totally unrealistic option. I suppose all whites have to accept that attitudes were much more racist in that era which explains a lot. Also I suspect that after the humiliation of 1940 the French military were determined to win a battle. What is not generally known is that most of the Free French troops that fought in Italy and France in 1943/45 were from French north Africa. The brutal battle of Cassino in Italy was brought to a conclusion by these colonial troops making an outflanking manoeuvre over mountainous terraine. Most of the troops liberating Paris were colonial. The natives were liberating the mother country and many of them later led the FLN. French dissatisfaction with the ongoing war led in 1958 to General Charles De Gaulle being called out of 12 years of retirement. Most Frenchmen expected De Gaulle to crush the FLN but De Gaulle was a statesman not a 3rd rate politician and could see that long term France had to let Algeria go. When this became clear the French military in Algeria felt betrayed and astonishly tried to stage a coup d'etat in mainland France. It failed of course and many rebel officers went underground and formed a terrorist group called the OAS which murdered people in both mainland France and Algeria. The coup attempt was a PR disaster and most French people now wanted out of Algeria.As independence for Algeria approached the OAS atrocities in the country made the situation untenable for the white colonist population after majority rule arrived. A million white colonists, many born and bred in Algeria fled for mainland France abandoning everything they owned and worked for in an incredible mass exodus. It was a retreat for western civilisation as villages and churches were abandoned to decay to be consumed by the majority Muslim culture. The OAS continued their campaign of terror in France, attempting to assassinate De Gaulle. And this of course inspired Frederick Forsythe to write the book "The Day of the Jackal", later a film. So whilst I feel sorry for the colonists who lost everything, their advocacy of "Algerie Francais" against a tide of De-colonisation was un-realistic and un-workable and led France and Algeria into a brutal and costly conflict. Fortunatly France was able to call on a man of the calibre of Charles De Gaulle who was able to convince the nation of the unpalatable truth, end the war and take France forward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has an "epic" reputation but you should not for a moment imagine that you will be treated to film-making on an epic scale. This is as intimate as any film about warfare is ever able to get.The focus is on guerilla warfare and its practitioners. There are is no glory or machismo involved, these are authentically frightened people driven from political protest to suicide tactics.Rather than being able to confront the enemy face on the N.L.F. spend most of their time hiding in disused buildings, using children as bomb-runners, and fleeing from soldiers disguised as women. When the occupying French forces are fleshed out they are either insouciant and world weary, as with Jean Martin's Colonel, or simply teenagers on their National service and anxious to get home. The political focus of the film is on the science of revolution; propaganda, counter-propaganda, determinism, etc. Therefore the viewer is not stirred or moved by the film but rather hit with the fact that certain conflicts are irreconcilable and there is nothing to be done about it. In this sense it is one of very few films with a Marxist concious that will ever hope to reach a mass audience. One brief technichal difficulty lies in the excessive use of real outdoor photography bleaches the majority of the screen white, and therefore makes the subtitles at times difficult to read. However it remains one of films most implacably well informed films of conflict.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a second generation Algerian immigrant to the states, I am familiar with Algeria's history. So, when I heard this way made by the Algerian government, I was expecting a typically biased propaganda film. I was wrong - very wrong.This is one of the most realistic war films I have ever seen. It is made even more impressive by the fact that it was made in the 60's, before big budget Hollywood effects, and it was made in what was, at the time, a third world country. It is also realistic in the fact that there is not set "good" or "bad". It shows that in war, everyone must go to extreme measures, trying constantly to top the enemy's gruesome acts. The scene when the suicide bombers know they are about to kill some of their own people along with the French is stunning.The characters are very well acted as well. This could be due to that fact that the film was made right after the revolution, so it was still fresh in their memories. I suppose I am probably biased, because this film tells the story of my ancestors country, but I'm sure most non-Algerians could agree that it is a very important film in this new world we live in. I rank it with Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line and Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket as the best war films I have ever seen. And I have seen a LOT of war films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I disagree with the comments here stating that Gillo Pontecorvo's *The Battle of Algiers* is an even-handed account of the Algerian uprising in the Fifties. I had always thought, perhaps simple-mindedly, that the movie was clearly on the side of the denizens of the Kasbah. After all, the script was inspired by the life and activities of a FLN leader who also literally acts in an important role in the movie. Seeing the movie again -- via Criterion's absurdly lavish 3-disc (!) edition -- did nothing to alter my opinion, though it DID provoke some new perspective on why the movie may SEEM even-handed.In two words? Jean Martin. He plays Colonel Mathieu, a former Resistance fighter and concentration camp veteran, now in the untenable position of winning a battle in a war doomed to failure for the French. Martin happens to be the only professional actor on the premises, and this probably explains his dangerous magnetism on screen and his ability to get us to immediately latch onto him for "identification". Everybody admires a good soldier, and Mathieu is exactly that. Cool, world-weary, competent, tactically brilliant, not above admiring his enemies, sophisticated. Everybody admires a good actor, also, and Martin gets all the good lines in *The Battle of Algiers*, which is really unfortunate, because we should be admiring the Algerians instead of this professional oppressor. This is the flaw in Pontecorvo's movie that, in my opinion, prevents it from being a true masterpiece. Col. Mathieu damn near unbalances the whole thing when he irrupts into the movie about a half-hour into it.The problem is that there are no equally compelling Muslim figures in the film to balance off Mathieu. Jaffar, played by the above-mentioned real-life FLN leader Saadi Yacef, is an important character to the plot yet has no interiority. The young man playing the fiery "Ali La Pointe" LOOKS magnificent, but the script doesn't do much for him, other than to tell him to look angry. We don't get to know the three women who tart themselves up as French sophisticates in order to sneak past the checkpoints so that they can plant bombs in civilian areas. The teenage boys who shoot the gendarmes to death are just faces in the crowd. Pontecorvo's magisterial Neo-Realism manages to be both dry and diabolically partisan: after all, a nameless mass of people avoids having character flaws, and Pontecorvo and Yacef don't want to muddy the waters with unlikeable individuals. (But perhaps we don't want that either, as the Algerians' cause is eminently just.) If you want to be politically correct, you may congratulate Pontecorvo for refusing to present the Muslims in a traditionally melodramatic way, but this approach fails the test of great drama: development of character.Having said all that, I also don't want to be misconstrued: *The Battle of Algiers* is a great and important film that is an almost mandatory viewing experience, given the shocking and scandalous similarities between what's going on in Arabia right now and the events of the Algerian uprising depicted in this film. It appears that officials at the Pentagon screened this movie for themselves a couple of years ago: one hopes that the scenes of torture in *The Battle of Algiers* didn't give them some kinky ideas for Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, though it's rather hard to imagine what other uses they could get out of the movie (besides, of course, the obvious lesson: don't mess with the Muslims). The scenes of torture, terrorism, and the loud clamoring for freedom will alternately raise blood pressures and stoke outrage, regardless of an individual's political bias. The cinematography by Marcello Gatti is a culmination of Neo-Realist and cinema-verite techniques, and the score by Ennio Morricone is groundbreaking.Make an effort to see *The Battle of Algiers*; it will truly pay off. No film released in the Sixties has more relevance for us today than this one. 7 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

All I can say is that the acting, plot, and cinematography are among the best I've seen. - I never really knew anything about the FLN, Algeria, or the French occupation until I saw this movie. Afterwards I felt much better versed on the subject and even was able to make parallels into modern terrorism and anti-western sentiments felt by Islamic countries. I never realized how far back the roots go. This movie is also fair in portraying brutality on both sides. It definitely appears to be objective in its treatment of the subject matter. - The acting is just. Amazing. Whether it be colonel Mathieu or the various Algerian actors, every performance is done to a tee. - The score was interesting. It included a lot of percussion and a few strings. When I find out that it was Enrio Morricone, I wasn't surprised. It was awesome! My advice, check this film out. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie opening sequence is bird's eye view of Algiers, showing us the European part and the indigenous quarter ("Casbah", hinting us the main rivalry of the movie. Pontecorov's work is extraordinary, we can see his passion for cinematography by letting the camera moves and speak for it self, as the film develop we can recognize the importance of the footage which took place in the "Casbah" itself of Algiers just few years after the end of the struggle (and the following independence), the narrow alleys and cooperativeness local population. I was happy to find, though, involvement in the production of Algerian was huge, never the less the participant of some ex-FLN fighters as actors, the movie does show us the terrible affect of terrorist action against the local European civilians. Furthermore, the portrayal of the French army was decent, consider their complicated task in converting battlefield tactics into heavy populated areas. I think in such delicate issues, and of course if the main purpose is to bring the audience neutral opinion, Pontecorovo did an excellent job. The movie, except from the great history lesson, is relevant for today also, we can refer to it in different clashes around the world involving regular army forces and guerilla fighting.</fullReview>

In a magnified way it showed the process of a subtle attack that would eventually make a big impact. This movie makes it easy to understand why a suppressed culture would organize extreme attacks on the people it felt suppressed them. Every detail of this movie showed this process as if it were real from it being filmed in black and white to the costumes and the music. As if being there I was carried along with the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Educational and Entertaining without Bias</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is remarkable for it's ability not to over-identify with one group or cause, it allows us to see from a very objective place, the perspectives of both the militants of Algeria and the French Colonists and Military, without bias. Both are portrayed with equal objectivity very successfully. A film in the style of realism, it looks much like a documentary, but actually uses NO "News Footage," at all and is completely staged. This is quite remarkable and quite an accomplishment. The movie utilizes all non-actors (except one), even more amazing, and uses real locations, and people as the characters. All of this adding to a sense of a documentary, which it is not. Even one of the main characters is played by himself (the Producer of the movie (Saadi Yacef, playing a character based on himself - - El-hadi Jafar. The scenes are all shot on location with a hand held camera, utilizing natural light, locations, and real people. This film is "Realism" with a documentary feel. Music is very important in this film and was scored by Maricone, who has done hundreds of films and did a wonderful and often hauntingly beautiful job on this film. The premise of the film is that there is a loss of cultural identity when a country is colonized, which has certain costs and ramifications, and that, no country can ever, in the end, be run by or ruled by others. It has never lasted, and is always temporary. Racism is a main subject of this movie as one group (the French colonists) try to impose their value systems on the Algerian people, and the resistance that takes place. The film also depicts, especially through the "raw," uneducated Protagonist "Ali," the use of illiteracy, which is a weapon in colonization, and how lack of education is a problem here. Ali is also one of the most complex characters in the movie, as well as Omar, the little boy. This movie makes an effort to show both sides of the story, the rationale of each side. The movie also served as a sort of "cautionary tale," of what could happen in Vietnam, and for this reason, the film was banned in the U.S. The film did actually turn out to be prophetic in this instance, and when it was released caused quite a stir. It also fueled the fire surrounding the plight of the African American in American ghettos, as equated with the Algerian Casbah, and the socio-economic implications. The movie also serves to humanize the "Terrorist," giving them a face and cause and showing their motivations. "Why does a terrorist become a terrorist." Since its initial release, this film has had a resurgence and has been used by groups as diverse as the "black panthers," to the U.S. government in briefings and instruction on urban guerrilla warfare. So in many ways, it is a very contemporary subject matter, even though it was made over 40 years ago. In addition, one of the scariest scenes of the movie is when the children beat up an old drunk man for no reason. This is a foreshadowing of the new generation of extremist terrorist that we see today. This is a movie of yesterday, and also a movie of our times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Like Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As this film unfolds, we have a sense that things are happening before our very eyes. The movie is so documentary-like as to seem like a stationary camera has been set up in the midst of turmoil. The French imperialists are the reason all this is happening. Obviously, years of "rule" make the day to day existence hard to change. Do all the Algerians want an overthrow of French rule? Probably not. Maybe not even a majority. As the rebels blow up restaurants and airport waiting rooms, the police are torturing the rebels. It becomes a cesspool of the lowest form of human degradation. And yet, what else can be the answer when a single entity has such a foothold and ultimate military power. As is usually the case, attrition does the job. With our current situation in the Mideast and Afghanistan, will we find ourselves reproducing what happened to the Russians? Unfortunately, there are no easy answers because the fight is against oppression. The kicker is that there is so much human and economic expense involved in these situations that often it takes centuries. We need to ask ourselves what is gained and one cannot put a price on the human soul. This is a masterpiece of movie-making should be seen by any who think revolutions are clean and the enemy is easy to define.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film received Oscar nominations in 1967 and 1969. First time I have ever seen that.It was nominated in 1967 for Best Foreign Language Film, losing to A Man and a Woman; and was nominated again in 1969, when Gillo Pontecorvo was nominated for Best Director, and he was nominated along with Franco Solinas for Screenplay.It shows up on many Top Ten lists as it illustrates the timeless march of men fighting for their basic human rights and freedom. It could be a film about the West Bank or Afghanistan, or any other locale where men struggle to be free. It just happened here to occur in Algeria. This is a timeless film about freedom and the horrors of war.One of the interesting aspects of this film is how real it looks and feels. This is done without using stock footage. It was filmed that way, and presents a picture of war that is hard to stomach. It will make all other so-called "war movies" seem like cartoons.Jean Martin as Col. Mathieu was outstanding, especially when he was defending the use of Bush-Cheney tactics to defeat the Algerians.One has to realize watching this film that the Algerians didn't like being occupied by the French any more than the French like being occupied by the Nazis or Iraq likes being occupied by America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb anti-war drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Battle of Algiers" is a film that everyone should see. It presents the historical account of the struggle of Algerian nationalists for independence from French colonists, and in doing so clearly displays the total futility of war. While not as renowned as "All Quiet on the Western Front" or "Paths of Glory", "The Battle of Algiers" is a better film in my opinion. Whereas some antiwar films rely on powerful speeches said by great heroes to portray their stance, "The Battle of Algiers" has no Paul Baumer or Colonel Dax. Neither Ali la Pointe, the leader of the independence movement, nor the French Colonel Mattheiu, who is in charge of the operation, ever states that what he is doing is wrong. Instead, we have only the shots of bodies, both French and Algerian, being carried away from the locations where bombs have gone off. The style of direction resembles that of a documentary, thus bringing about a more realistic feel. You won't find Kirk Douglas or Lew Ayres here. The result is that the characters don't seem larger than life. This is not a drama made by a Hollywood producer looking for an Oscar; but instead, it is a somber portrait of the futility of war. Add in Ennio Morricone's score, and you have a great film that is completely different from almost anything you will ever see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that rings true even 40 years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my film professor showed us this movie in class he mentioned that it was also shown at the Pentagon when the war in Iraq started. The military wanted a way to make its generals understand the actions the people they were going to fight were taking. While it might still be hard to understand why people would resort to terrorist actions, this movie does prove to be a very useful tool in getting people to realize what can drive people to consider going down that road.The movie tells the story of Algeria's road to independence from France in the early 1960's and was filmed in a documentary style, making it hard to remember sometimes that the image we see on the screen is only a reenactment of actual events. In fact, some of the main people who actively participated in the revolution acted in this movie, reliving events from their past.I grew up in a country that experienced terror attacks like the ones that are shown in the movie on an almost regular basis. Seeing scenes like the bombing of the discotheque or the bar hit a little too close to home for me, bringing up memories of similar images from popular hangouts in my home town. But it also made me see the other side of those attacks, the side that I never saw in those images from my childhood. I can't say that I condone the use of violence or the killing of innocent people, but watching the movie and what the people of Algiers went through that made them choose that path, made me understand the other side of terror a little better.The documentary style of this movie doesn't show one side or another as the right one. It gives you the facts of what happened, and how it ended. And this is the greatness of this movie. It doesn't take sides, it just lets you see things for how they were, and lets you decide which one you want to identify with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers is a 1967 black-and-white film by Gillo Pontecorvo based on events during the 1954-1962 Algerian War of Independence against French rule. Economic and neighborhood segregation between Algerians and French, it made Algerians feel foreign and inferior in their own land. They had all the rights to fight because theirs was a war for independence. French on the other hand, were fighting for their dominance over Algiers. I personally was very surprised by the Algiers women's role in this movie especially during the time they went to place the bombs in the most French frequented public areas. I like those scenes for another very important reason as well. After seeing an Algerian women sacrifice her hair, dressed up like modern French lady and looking at a little boy eyes eating ice-cream and knowing that she will kill that child after a few minutes, it all left me as a viewer without any good or bad opinion about Algerians. Furthermore, that's what this movie is all about; to not point who are the good and the bad characters in this movie, but to show the reality of this war. The involvement of children in the war was very significant and helpful element of the war as well because it is harder to punish or to catch a little child, as we saw in this movie. They were moving through the French military checkpoint transporting weapons then after will be used to kill the French soldiers. Also, the French tortures especially in the prison to make Algerians talk about the FLN members, were a very disturbing scenes of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>conflict between native Algerians and European settlers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers, a film by Gillo Pontecorvo is based on events during the 1954-1962 Algerian War of Independence against French rule. It depicts the conflict between native Algerians and European settlers in which the two sides exchange acts of increasing violence, leading to the introduction of French paratroopers, under the direction of General Massu and then Colonel Bigeard, to root out the National Liberation Front (FLN). The paratroops are depicted as "winning" the battle by neutralizing the whole FLN leadership through assassination or capture. However, the film ends with a coda, depicting demonstrations and rioting by native Algerians for independence, in which it suggested that though the French have won the Battle of Algiers, they have lost the war. The movie reminds me of the current situation in Iraq. In May 1, 2003 President Bush announced "Mission Accomplished"; however, four years after his announcement, the battle has been intensified. Children shoot soldiers, women plant bombs in restaurants and suicide bomber are increasing. This movie is about independence and fighting for belief. The belief is profoundly rooted in people of Algeria that brought independence to Algeria. It is a lesson that US must learn, military action does not work against strong, deep rooted belief. History is repeating!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning view on Algeria's struggle for independence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers is a multi-layered film describing the attempts of Algerian rebels to gain independence from France in the 1950's. The French bring in military might, but the guerrilla tactics of the rebels prevent direct assault. Thus the French officials are left with an unclear path of bringing order to the city. The film chronicles individual terrorist plots and attacks, while also describing the attempts of the French army to react and hunt down rebel power. The small attacks slowly build up into a brilliant, touching conclusion.The person that stood out the most was Colonel Mathieu, a confident and cunning head of the French military. He made an admirable character from his first appearance in a paratrooper march to his final statement. The rebels meet our expectations; there are a few major rebel figures, but none of them have the unanimous command like Colonel Mathieu. They are also imperfect. The plans are drawn up quickly, but the goal is always the same: to stimulate Algeria's resistance to French command. Overall, it makes for an uncannily realistic plot structure.The film is loaded with material and messages that will keep you thinking long after watching it. It is not the usual well-defined revolution that we expect; rather, the rebels are terrorists whose bombs kill innocent people, while the French army is very orderly and (despite torturing prisoners) civilized. Neither side is perfect, and its hard to tell what side is right. This makes for a highly realistic vision that is as complex as it is political.The only major downside to the film is that, although filmed professionally, the quality of the footage and sound is not always the best. It isn't enough to detract much from the experienced viewer, but its a shame that it could not have been better preserved or restored. Other than that, the film is masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best political films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best political films ever, about the 1954-1957 uprising of Algiers against French colonial rule. As the film shows, the uprising was brutally crushed, but the seeds of independence had already been sown, and in 1960 a new uprising, covering all Algeria, would rise up, and the country would become independent two years later. The French colonists, who numbered more than a million and who had lived in Algeria for more than a century, would be expelled after wards, marking a complete defeat for France. Made in 1965, with financing by the Algerian independent government, it is nevertheless surprisingly fair in some aspects. It shows the brutal terror tactics employed by the FLN (the main Algerian liberation group) like bombing bars and discos used by the Europeans. It also shows the French colonel in charge of suppressing the revolt (played by the only professional actor in the cast) in a quite positive light: in a film without true heroes, he is probably the most sympathetic character, competent and self-effacing, even if he doesn't flinch in using torture to crush the revolt (torture being in his mind the only method to destroy the FLN's cell structure). And, perhaps inadvertently, by showing the terror tactics used by the FLN, it suggests the oppressive, antidemocratic nature of the future independent government of Algeria. Overall, one of the must-see films in every cinephile list (and in any person interested in the politics of the region or in anti terror tactics).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inside and outside...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although in the final analysis there's just a single "side" (we're all, like it or not, made of the same stuff- to the very core), it can be- and has been, interminably- argued that there's an inside and an outside (especially if you're a politician or a religious fanatic). "Place your bets," someone says at one point in THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS. That one statement says much (too much, perhaps) about wars like this one. The bottom line is, all too often, the bottom line (and nobody knows that as well as Americans: in this country, money not only Talks, it clearly Walks- especially when one is forced to ante up in the hallowed halls of Justice, which can be an expensive proposition, indeed). The opening sequence with the guillotine lends a Grand Guignol ghoulishness to the proceedings. Evenhanded film-making? Perhaps. As someone posits along the way, "Men have two faces." Two men, therefore, have four faces. Some of the carnage here has all the objectiveness of newsreels, and THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS certainly manages to capture the feel of a city (and two Peoples) under siege. (The claustrophobic interior shots involving explosions are truly amazing; it's a miracle no one was killed.) When the soldiers (whose bullying has forced fed-up civilians to strike back) opt to "make their own opportunities," by way of torture no less ("Legality can be inconvenient."), one can't help but lament- again- the timeliness of this movie. Excellent guerilla film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Should we remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences." - Colonel Mathieu Algeria, 1954. After over a country of French colonial rule, the people of Algeria are preparing to rise in revolt. The terrorist group FLN begins a rebellion with a rapidly escalating series of terrorist attacks and assassinations. The local authorities are unable to stop this faceless, increasingly ruthless enemy, and so an elite division of French paratroopers led by the coolly professional Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin) arrives to deal with the situation. The French engage in a brutal but effective crackdown which includes mass arrests, assassination, and use of torture, which ultimately kills the FLN off. However, the people of Algeria have been inflamed, and Independence soon becomes inevitable."The Battle of Algiers" is simply a brilliant movie. Gillo Pontecorvo has created one of the most stark, brutal, realistic depictions of guerrilla warfare - a film which has been viewed and used as a guide by various terrorist groups since its initial release. In abstracts rather than particulars, it is extraordinarily pertinent to the War on Terror that the US finds itself faced off against today, as America finds itself being forced to concede the moral high-ground to win a potentially unwinnable conflict.Pontecorvo's film spares no one. Every side, every group of people is shown as being nasty in its own way. While Pontecorvo's film is on the side of the FLN, it does not shy away from showing their actions, such as placing bombs inside diners and discos, killing and maiming teenagers and even children. Likewise, the French army's techniques of assassination and torture are shown as well. It's clear that from a purely moral point-of-view, neither side has the high-ground.In regards to the film's politics, I would hasten to say that it's a bit unfair to compare the situation in Iraq today with the film's setting, except in an abstract way. For while we have only recently conquered Iraq and have no intention of colonizing it, France had occupied Algeria for over a century and indeed considered it to be not just a colony, but part of France itself. That being said, in regards to the tactics of both the terrorists and the French counter-insurgents, and the never-ending cycle of vicious violence - well, it's obvious why the Pentagon screened this film as a guide on how to combat terrorism.The film's bleak, realistic visual sense gives the impression of a documentary; we feel we are really living history, not just watching a film. The violence is not particularly graphic, understandable considering the time in which it was made, but we do see at least the aftermath of mass shootings and terrorist bombings - maimed and bloody bodies and destroyed homes have their own power, even if the actual act was sublimated. There are some genuinely disturbing sequences, as when a group of Algerian children beat a drunken man to death, the montage of torture, and of course the famous scene where three Algerian women disguise themselves as Frenchwomen to carry out a series of bombings. Ennio Morricone provides a desperate, driving score which allows the message to hit home.On one last note: the cast is made up almost entirely of non-professional actors, with one notable exception. It is to the immense credit of Pontecorvo and screenwriter Franco Solinas that they made the film's antagonist, Colonel Mathieu, not a typical fascist-type monster, but an immensely sympathetic, refined man who would rather not be doing these nasty things, but recognizes he has to. His scenes where he addresses the press about the tactics of the paratroops (another scene which could be ripped from the headlines today), and his one-to-one talks with captured terrorist leaders, show that he is a genuinely decent man making the best of a bad situation. Jean Martin, a celebrated stage actor whose film appearances are generally less-than-memorable ("My Name is Nobody" and "Day of the Jackal"), turns in a truly astounding performance. The cast of amateur actors is equally impressive, particularly Ali la Pointe, the fiery rebel leader who is a man of action more than ideas, perfectly played by Brahim Haigag.It is impossible to understate the importance of "The Battle of Algiers". As a primer for both terrorists and counter-terrorists, it continues to be one of the most politically influential movies ever made. Thirty years later, with the US engaged in a vicious struggle against terrorism, the topics covered in the film are as pertinent as ever.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant synthesis of historically accurate drama, Italian neo-realism, and cinema verite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gillo Pontecorvo's 'The Battle of Algiers' is a masterpiece in the finest sense of the word. Few films are as emotionally and intellectually stirring, and complex. The film follows Ali La Pointe (Brahim Hadjadj) as he joins and eventually attempts to lead the FLN in the Algerian revolt against French colonial power. Opening with the end we see La Pointe hiding in the wall of a FLN hideout as an FLN member tips off the French army as to where he is hiding. The French Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin) is standing on the other side of the wall he is hiding in warning him that he has to come out or he will be forced to blow up the building, killing everyone inside. Then Pontecorvo brings the audience back to before La Pointe joined the FLN. This gives the film a hunting residue of looming failure, a pure sense of hopelessness for the rebels you are pulling for. Or at least the rebels I was pulling for. Part of the beauty of Pontecorvo's portrayal of the rebellion is that it isn't one-sided; it doesn't attempt to say the rebels were right and deserved their independence and the French were occupying dictators. It tends to lean that way, but the portrayal is much more complex than that. Both sides kill innocents in an attempt to seek revenge against those who have injured innocents on their side. The audience relates to, and respects, La Pointe and the FLN, while despising their methods. At the same time you can respect Mathieu and the French for their attempts to end things peacefully and the respect Mathieu shows for the FLN leaders he captures, in private and in the press. Taking in equal parts from the Italian Neo-Realistic tradition and the 60s cinema verite school, the film alternates between gritty footage of the FLN roaming the city streets, plotting and planning their revolt. Humanizing and immortalizing them. Then the footage jarringly rotates to more documentary style footage of Algerians in the streets, striking, protesting or roaming the markets of Algiers. Shot in a, sometimes, grainy black and white the film finds beauty in rawness and jarring, rough shots, finds beauty in the hideous and the luscious. Every bombing, interview, jail, city street or hole in the wall carries a dark, sweeping, beauty that the audience doesn't have to search to find. Easily one of the best films on wartime politics and on revolutionaries ever made. It's haunting, the kind of film that will stick with you for days, leaving you grappling with moral complexities and desiring to determine a more definite sense of self. This is what cinema should be. It can be hard to communicate when a film is this good in an era when criticism lends itself towards the sensational and the linguistically fluid for even the tritest trash film, but this, this is a powerfully moving film. A mix of the raw and harsh eye of Cassavetes, the violently prophetic scenarios of Scorsese and the morally marginalizing notions of Kubrick at his best. An absolute must-see for anyone who considers himself, or herself, a fan, not of film, but of cinema. A film that has never been more apt for America, contemplating the moral complexities of war, and the utter lack of that proverbial line where right and wrong collide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of documentary style film making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film should be required viewing for anyone who wants to understand specifically what we're up against in our "war on terrorism." Even though Gillo Pontecorvo's film was made in 1966 and documents events that took place in Algiers four years earlier, little has changed in terms of the mindset, structure, strategy and implementation by terrorist organizations, almost as if they've been in a vacuum all these years; indeed, this is the major cause of the "Arab Predicament" today. Watching THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS, it would seem this film is more documentary than cinematic fiction, and with Marcello Gatti's grainy B&amp;W photography (many scenes filmed with a hand-held camera), this impression is not that far off the mark. Since the struggle for independence from France was so fresh in the minds of most Algerians, the participants in the actual events were used in the film, and once Pontecorvo and his team recreated the atmosphere and visuals, the emotions of the people were ignited again and suddenly they were no longer acting. While THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS does take a position on the conflict, Pontecorvo is remarkably even handed in his approach and does not shy away from difficult questions, but confronts them with brutal clarity and honesty. Watching THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS is an intense, powerful experience, and Ennio Morricone's subdued but emotive score gives the images a resonance that will haunt the viewer long after they've dissolved into closing credits.</fullReview>

The Film is so real that sometimes viewer think that some scenes are original,hundreds of people marching, tanks, police and the blast scenes are very original when there was no green screens and VFX at that time, the story the performance of non-actors from directors point of view is excellent, the expressions of people, the mood, the scenario, the music its a combination of all art forms together. Gillo Pontecorvo is one of the great director in the history of film making no question about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Highly Relevant?If Not More So?Iconic Resistance Film Attacks Colonialism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It feels redundant to talk about a film as iconic as Gillo Pontecorvo's "The Battle of Algiers". Still, as a descendant of the colonized (and quite possibly the colonizer, too) it's hard not to get affected by what could very well be the greatest anti-colonialism film ever made. Something as potent and political as this demands a reaction. "Algiers" is among a handful of films that are so exceptional and humanistic they ought to qualify as required viewing for a better humanity: Mira Nair's "Salaam Bombay", Koreeda Hirokazu's "Nobody Knows", Kieslowski's "The Decalogues", and Lee Chang-Dong's "Oasis", to cite a few.'Two hours' and 'black &amp; white' aren't the most appetizing words even to the most adventurous of cineastes but here the story is quite absorbing, the work paced well, and the mood of resistance so palpable, one barely notices the film's length. Algeria's National Liberation Front (FLN) and one of its top leaders, Ali La Pointe (real name Ali Ammar?), are the obvious protagonists and, despite what some reviewers say, it's very clear that the colonizer, France, is the devil here. It's in the employment of war tactics where it gets blurry. Both parties resort to violence and murder for entirely different reasons, the Algerians' nobler than that of the French, but does purpose supersede the moral dilemma? Does the struggle for freedom justify murder?Despite the quandary, it's quite easy to root for the Algerians especially when they're led by a reformed petty crook-turned-revolutionary. "Algiers" is a classic underdog film with a heavy dose of historical credibility. In other words, "It happened!" We repeatedly see the Algerian 'rebel' forces getting crushed by France's more superior military forces and it's very commendable and heartbreaking to see them fight back over and over again. And how. It's astonishing to finally witness the film's legendary realism. I actually cried at some point when Ali's situation seemed very bleak.The history of colonization and oppression is naturally full of fascinating stories of rebels and revolutionaries, loyalties are tested, courage is in high demand, traitors abound, nationalism is in action. Sometimes I wonder how fellow Filipinos and I would've acted back then under Spanish oppression. Books I'm sure barely do justice to these crucial moments in history (not mention distort the truth rampantly) so to see a chunk of it staged in a very realistic manner on film is quite poignant for me. "Battle of Algiers" is easily among the most well-made films I've ever seen, heavy yet accessible, a well-deserved film icon that is still being talked about long after 1966 and will be so well beyond 2006.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the crowning achievements of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers is one of the greatest pieces of cinematic history. Unarguably the leader of its genre - war/politics - each frame of this masterpiece is cinemagic.Based on Saadi Yacef's biased memoirs, but done in a much more neutral manner by Italian communist filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo, this has a marked Neorealistic influence stamped on it. From the opening frame when an Algerian is tortured into revealing the whereabouts of Ali La Pointe and the movement of the paramilitary into the casbah to nab/kill the FLN leader, you'll know this is the real McCoy. There gritty realism, the amazing crowd scenes, the hustle-bustle, squalor and beauty of the Casbah weave a cinematic magic.The bulk of the action takes place during the eventful year of 1957 in what started out as a gentlemen's war but eventually degenerated into all out civilian bombings when the French played dirty by planting a bomb in the casbah. The FLN retaliation is swift and brilliantly executed - disturbing though it is. The tactics used by the FLN and French Army as shown in this film have been studied for years by various terrorist organizations (especially the PLO) and by governments (including the Pentagon).There are so many wonderful moments in this film that you get sucked into another world, another time from the word Go! It is wonderfully watchable and intelligent at the same time. The dialogue is superb too - especially Ben MHidi's "Give us your bombers, and you can have our baskets." In real life, the vastly experienced Ben MHidi - an elder of the movement - was in his early 30's when he "committed suicide" so that gives you an idea of the youth of the FLN support base.Unmissable!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Americans do not seem to learn from history of the French: first in Vietnam (we lost, as did the French who were smart enough to give up earlier) and now in Iraq (an unwinnable war, which the French knew would not be winnable).To understand the film better, it would be wise to read Alisair Horne's brilliant book, A Savage War of Peace. To say this film represents both sides is not true. The French, supposedly the more civilized country, looked down upon the Algerians and as the violence started coming from the Algerians, the French escalated their violence (in absolutely appalling methods) thereby increasing the Algerians' violence. Would the French have responded to calm, reasoning with the Algerians? I don't think so. The British did not respond to the colonies' plea for release; it took a Revelutionary War to do that. Is revolution only acceptable to Americans if we do it but not good if other countries do it? Would slavery have been abolished if not for the Civil War? I don't think so. Would the Civil Rights Act of 1964 have been passed if the violence of the white leadership of the south hadn't acted so murderously towards the activists for the blacks? I don't condone violence in any way but sometimes people feel there is no other way and the US should not be hypocritical of the frustration and pain that cause people to rebel in the only way they know how.This film is amazing and Pontecorvo had to put a disclaimer about the reality at the beginning of the film because it looked so real.But read the book!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An authentic and riveting movie that certainly will strike a lot of familiar chords, given all that is happening in the Middle East. Though the filmmaker probably sympathized with the Algerians, this movie does not present a particularly sympathetic portrayal of the FLN and Arab side. Indeed, in some respects it is an indictment of terrorism and it most certainly does not glorify the use of violence. The main players on the Arab side are shown to be callous if not murderous, and the French commander, while ruthless, is by no means a stick figure. A most informative and realistic movie, surprisingly objective--and I speak as a person who, believe me, was not rooting for the Algerians even once!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EXCELLENT, PROPHETIC MOVIE !!!Released in 1967, this movie provides a clear insight into the roots of Islamic "radicalization" as a reaction against the poverty, exploitation, corruption, and degradation caused by colonialism.Several shocking ideas (for a film from 1956):1. A large group of seven-year-old boys beat a drunk to death to "improve their community"2. French police take vigilante justice against an innocent man's family by exploding his home late one night3. Revenge bombings by Muslim females of an Air France flight and two cafés (not suicide bombings, incidentally)4. French military uses waterboarding (I kid you not) and other tortures to extract information, "false flag" events (World Trade Center, anyone?) to justify circumventing laws, and "suicides" to eliminate "non-cooperative" rebel leaders.5. The United Nations, as usual, is impotent.Combined with any good documentaries about the history of African-Americans and the history of Native Americans, an astute viewer comes to the realization that Europeans are the devils who have brought misery to peaceful people throughout the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the title I expected this to be a war movie, but I did not realize Algiers is a city, and the battle is actually a struggle for Algerians to live in their home country without fear of the French who are suppressing them.I've seen very critically acclaimed classic foreign films before, so I guess I might have had my expectations too high. For example, two of my favorite foreign films are "Bicycle Thieves" and "Rashomon," but those films actually do interesting things with their camera-work. With The Battle of Algiers we just get a lot of standard (boring) camera-work with a lot of static shots to focus on conversations about the action rather than focusing on the action itself.The best aspect of the film is the characters who are a part of the rebellion and their motivations. We are introduced to one of the main characters in a very interesting way - this secret group of rebels does an initiation on Ali by checking to see if he would be loyal enough to shoot a cop, but they don't tell him this. We can see the manipulation this group exercises, though in their eyes it is necessary recruitment, and we should see it as this too since it is the Algerians who are the victim to French occupation of the city of Algiers as well as of the entire nation of Algeria.With the filmmakers choosing to revisit a scene from different view points there is obviously non-linear chronology, but I only understood this at the beginning and towards the end of the film. I was confused how the scene fit into the scenes surrounding it when it was shown for the second time in the film. I will have to rewatch this film some time in the future - after all it is regarded as one of the most important films ever made.I think I enjoyed the conclusion of this film much more than any part which preceded it, and that's because the conclusion is the most inspirational sequence of the entire movie. It is uplifting to see how Algerians rise up again years after the first rebellion group is decapitated (a metaphor you will understand if you watch the film), and this happens without great explanation. The message implied by the film is that this first group of rebels may not have been successful, but the group inspired the people of its nation to stand strong for justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Italian screenwriter and director Gillo Pontecorvo's feature film which he wrote with Italian author and screenwriter Franco Solinas (1927-1982), is inspired by a memory from 1962 which is based on personal experiences. It premiered In competition at the 27th Venice Film Festival in 1966, was shot on locations in Algeria and is an Italy-Algeria co-production which was produced by producer Saadi Yacef. It tells the story about the political and ideologically ingrained liberation front in Algeria, the militaristic and ideologically ingrained French Army and the people of Algeria who had been living under the Regency of Algiers (1525-1830) and under French rule since the annexation of Algiers, Algeria in 1830 by the then Kingdom of France and how they changed the history of Algeria. Distinctly and precisely directed by Italian filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo (1919-2006), this quietly paced fictional tale which is narrated by a narrator and interchangeably from multiple viewpoints, draws a densely measured and retrospective portrayal of a mid-20th century war regarding colonization and a country's struggle for independence and self-determination whilst living under another country's rule. While notable for its atmospheric milieu depictions and reverent cinematography by Italian cinematographer Marcello Gatti (1924- 2013), this narrative-driven story about paramilitary recruitment, bilateral relations between France and Algeria and the strategic, totalitarian and barbaric methods used by both sides of this massacre of human lives which were as atrocious as those used in the preceding Second World War (1939-1945) where France, amongst many other countries, was annexed by Germany and a precursor of numerous later wars which continued the annihilation of the living, the convenience of impunity which exemplifies inequality for all those human beings on this planet who has and has had the ability to go through this life without killing anyone of their fellow human beings and the should be abolished and spiritless culture and industry of death where saving bullets is prioritized over saving lives, reflects this historic, incoherent, unjustifiable and downright ignorant notion that a five letter word can only be achieved through violation of international law and the sometimes though not always unintentional murder and slaughter of both involved and neutral bystanders which at any given time might be babies or children guilty only of being born, whose deaths are under no circumstances defensible by this la-la land term called collateral damage, and is no eulogy or glorification, reverence or vindication of retaliating militaristic violence concealed by grandiloquent codes of honor, but rather an understated elegy which was initiated by a living insider witness of these historical events and member of the National Liberation Front Algerian and made eighteen years after many Palestinian Arabs were driven of their homes in Israel, escaped and laws were passed by the introductory Israeli government which prevented them from returning to their homes or claiming their property.Released many years after an Egyptian goddess may or may not have existed in ancient Egypt, three years after a French filmmaker made a narrative feature called "Muriel" (1963), two years before a person with the given name Susan wrote: "I'm learning to bring judgment against the world.", six years before an American filmmaker named Dick Richard made a feature film regarding a sixteen-year-old man who dreamed of becoming a cowboy, was recruited by a group of cowboys, got the feeling of belongingness, started believing that his leader was sent to do what he did by ? and ended up on the prairie holding his hat on his chest whilst a river was running out from his eyes after having buried all of his friends in the ground whilst a song written by an English poet in the late 1790s called "Amazing Grace" was sung by a female voice, eleven years before the guillotine was abolished in France, twenty-four years before an American group of musicians called Guns N'Roses sang the words: "?and history hides the lies of our civil wars?", twenty-five-years before an American singer and pianist with the middle name Ellen sang the words: "?I've been looking for a savior in these dirty streets?", forty-six years after a twenty-six-year- old Tunisian street hawker ended in self-immolation in Ben Arou, Tunisia after allegedly having been assaulted by a female municipal officer and in doing so initiated a revolution, forty-eight years after a Norwegian singer named Anne Grete Preus sang the words: "? consider carefully what you should mean - - it can become costly to stand alone?" which originated from an ironic poem written in 1963 by a Norwegian 20th century author and eyewitness of this battle named Jens Ingvald Bj?rneboe (1920-1976) and forty-nine years after an Iranian-Swedish émigré, refugee and musician sang her own written words: "?Just because its black in the dark - - doesn't mean there's no colors?", depicts some dense studies of character and contains a great and timely score by Italian composers Gillo Pontecorvo and Ennio Morricone. This historic, reflective and humane testimony and reconstruction of real events from the late 1960s which is set in Algeria in the late 1950s and early 1960s when a French-Algerian historian named Dani?le Djamila Amrane-Minne collaborated with the persons who were most instrumental in the armed conflict, and where the actions and the views of men from both sides are presented and informatively depicted, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, subtle character development and continuity, the self-explanatory and alluding comment by a member of the French army after dressing an Algerian prisoner in a French uniform: "Now, he is nationalized." and the many good acting performances by French and Algerian citizens, actors and actresses.

I would rate it along with Battleship Potemkin, as the best propaganda movie, I have ever seen. The specialty of this movie is the way it is filmed. Black and white cinematography which also gives the impression of a documentary. I really thought, I was watching a documentary in History Channel than an actual movie. Editing is crisp as well, which really helps in not lingering in the death scenes which is the case in many other movies. The movie does not have a single protagonist or antagonist which according to me is the victory of the movie.I am so glad I watched this movie as not only a part of movie history, but a part of world history as well.Rating : 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Algerian Government subsidized and hired Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo to shoot a film to recount the bloody clash between FLN (Algerian National Liberation Front) and French colonial only few years after its independence (1962). The film was not only won GOLDEN LION in Venice in 1966 and an Academy Awards nomination for BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM in 1967 but also was nominated for BEST DIRECTOR and SCREENPLAY in 1969 for a rare second round. THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS impresses its viewers with a haunting collection of close-up portraits of various people (both French and Algerian) under a soul-searching orchestration emphasized by stark chiaroscuro, it was years after Italian Neo-Realism, but the non-professional cast (the only pro is a wiry and bulged-eyed Jean Martin, who commands a stance of military mettle perfectly) and locale-revamping contributes a great amount of authenticity in the final work. There are plenty of overlooking angles with extensive depth of focus to examine and the city and enlighten one's appreciation, plus there are fleeting montages of torture under interrogation are disturbing but can potently generates a sense of boldness to show audience the cruelty in reality. However the most indelible ones are the waiting-for-the-bombs-to-explode experiences, with camera panning over innocent white victims-to-be unwittingly relish their last moment of hedonism, utterly guarantee a surge of compassion out of shock value terms. Therefore, the film should also be extolled by its unbiased perspective in telling its stories from both parts, dispassionately channels viewers to witness the vindictive constitution lying underneath common humanity and the aimless and reproachable tit-for-tat acts ensuring. There are radical debates as regards the essence of revolution, a much more penetrating motto is revolution doesn't mean war and terrorism is not a means to win a revolution, which should be indoctrinated all over the world, especially to those tinderboxes where religious and political threats are pervading rampantly at present. Showing no partiality to either sides is not an easy move since the production was backed and green-lit by one of the government, thus the film is a genuine gem in retaining the integrity and fabricating a gripping panorama of a chain of bloodshed and baring its true color under the stark daylight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still don't know what to make out of "Battle of Algiers". It focus to much on the few terrorists in the beginning and that the french military was just protecting the europeans (maybe with an iron fist, but it isn't shown). There is no story development to show how live was in the colony at that time and how intrusive the actions of police and the french empire conflicted with simple people. This makes it a bit difficult to get the context for of the reason for the uprise. Maybe this is because the movie was made so soon after the events and out of fresh memory that the writers saw no reason to talk about it. The Algerien war was very bloody and the french troops were doing everything else then obeying human rights but amazingly no comment about that. Don't understand why an algerian movie isn't putting this on their agenda.And finally i find that the most interesting part - after the initial group is defeated - and a peoples mass movement starts is just shown in less then 10min in a news summary style. I have to guess again, maybe because mass scenes were just not financial possible to recreate with the small budget of this film.Conclusion: A nice movie to watch with good cinematography that deserves it 8 star rating here on IMDb but gives too little political information and leaves the average viewer without and increased understanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply Brilliant is how I would describe this movie. Done in black-and-white, at a break-a- neck pace, it unravels the intense, life changing confrontation of the Muslim Algiers, against the French occupancy. Filmed in a documentary style, it brings us in the midst of the conflict, and developing of a revolution, with mind bugling intimacy, and as every genius work of Art it asks more questions, than gives answers. The terrorist that we deal with nowadays, are caricatured into uneducated, dirty desert monkeys, dying not for freedom but for a chance to get some pussy in heaven, but one forgets is that it's quite the opposite. That the people that stand behind it all, are highly intelligent, well organized, extremely well educated and idealistic. And in the case of this movie, they are freedom fighters. Please don't misconstrued this as a justification for terrorism, just don't make a mistake of simplifying things to some absurd notion that its a number of virgins in heaven that motivates these people. Perhaps at the lowest ranks, it what gets people going, but the higher ups are motivated by something completely different. Even in case of world tr center, it was done rather symbolic, (people forget that the same thing is done in "Fight Club" with the only difference that there are no people in the building), to show how that place created unfair trade treaties all the time, and it's the cause of poverty in many countries. A perfect example would be China, with whom once the trading was allowed, their economy boomed. (by the way all this came to me after I watched this movie, I am not that much of a political person )))).Mostly important with every step of the way, with incredible clarity, tension and on-the- edge-of-your-seat intensity, this film explains the inner motivation of both the French occupancy, and the soldiers that come to defend it, and the opposition that eventually leads to revolution and independence of Algiers. All character's actions, no matter how heroic or horrific are understood, sympathized and relived by the viewer, with often unexpected personal discoveries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Battle of Algiers is relevant today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers is an Italian film directed by Gillo Pontecorvco, which was produced in 1966. It depicts true events which occurred during the Algerian war of independence from France, which was fought from 1955 ? 1962. The events depicted in the movie occurred during the Battle of Algiers which took place from 1954-1957. This film has been ranked in the top 100 films ever made. It was banned in France for five years where it was finally released in 1974. The Battle of Algiers is an important commentary on guerilla warfare. Revolutionary guerilla fighters holed up and grouped together in cells in the Casbah section of Algiers. French paratroopers attempted to wipe them out. The movie is about this struggle and the methods used by both sides. The tactics of the National Liberation Front (FLN) guerilla insurgency and the French counter-insurgency are shown in the film. The French colonial power committed atrocities against the civilian population of their Algerian colony and the colonized insurgents committed atrocities against the civilian population of their oppressors in a spiraling escalation of violence. The FLN engaged in acts of terrorism by placing bombs in public places such as restaurants, nightclubs, and airports, indiscriminately killing civilians in the European Quarter. The French paratroopers tortured, intimidated, and murdered members of the FLN. The use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique is depicted. Algeria eventually won its independence in 1962. Some of the scenes that really struck me were the incidents of waterboarding by the French Paratroopers, the men of the FLN covering themselves in burqas like women to disguise themselves and escape detection, FLN women dressing like European women and carrying bombs in baskets, and in the end the women ululating in victory when Algeria won its independence. The Battle Algiers is as relevant today as it was in 1965.The film was screened by the Pentagon in August 2003 as a field guide to fighting terrorism. Former National Security Adviser, Zbigniew Brezezinski, said: "If you want to understand what is happening right now in Iraq, I recommend The Battle of Algiers." This film was also used by the Black Panthers as a training film. I am sure there are other terrorists groups that have been influenced by the film as well. The Boson Bombing suspects come immediately to mind. The film, shot in black and white, is a triumph of realistic production values and heavily influence by Italian Neorealism of the 1950's. It was filmed on location in Algiers using the real locations in the European quarters and the Casbah. It was so realistic that Pontecorvo had to issue a disclaimer that not one foot of documentary or newsreel footage was used in his two hours of film. Everything was shot live. The film was nominated for AcademyAwards for Best Foreign Film, Best Screen Play, and Best Director. It was the winner of the Venice Film Festival Golden Lion Award.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Battle of Algiers" shows how a people will resist colonization, even when the colonizing power, France in this film, creates, in their own minds, a more lavish lifestyle and promising future and have the audacity to considers the natives, the Algerians, fellow first-class citizens in the land that is home to the Algerians to begin with! The Algerians are resisting because they have enough confidence in their own abilities to make positive changes in their country for themselves and their posterity. In short, it is up to the people of a nation themselves to make their own decisions and see to it that their future holds promise and bears progress. No other nation, whether more powerful militarily and economically or not, should feel or think that they know better for a people what they need to have in order to be a happier nation or whether the influence that they are exerting upon the native population is necessarily the correct and best choice for that population and their future. 'The Battle of Algiers" attests to the fact that the freedom of a people to make decisions affecting their livelihoods and history as well as their cultural pride cannot be compromised or manipulated. The same way that Ali Le Pointe's character was willing to die for what he believed was right for himself and his people, so to was the entire nation (men, women, and children) of Algeria ready to lay their lives down in order to be in control of their own destiny and move forward and better their situation their own way ? the way the Algerians willed it to be! Not the way the French deemed it correct.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film because I finally was able to witness the other side to our never ending battle on terrorism. Although this depicts Algiers revolt from the French it's similar to the what's being played out in the Middle East. Living in America, the word terrorist is now associated with people who want to destroy American freedom. I've never been a fan of this idea and always was interested to learn more about the other side, the people who never get a voice. Although I didn't agree with either side in this film, it was interesting to see a more objective stance that almost felt like a documentary. There are shots that feel so real, it's a little uncomfortable, which I guess is how it should be. This film isn't for everyone; it doesn't have an obvious bad or good guy and also doesn't have a set protagonist. Although Ali La Pointe is supposed to be the protagonist, it's more about the people as a whole and their struggle for freedom. It's an interesting film that definitely sheds light on present matters as well as historical ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers is a film which should really be seen by everyone. This year's Arab Spring and Occupy protests make the themes which were presented in the film just as relevant today. An aspect of the film that I really appreciated was its unbiased presentation of the conflict between the French colonizers and the Algerians that they were going to great extents to oppress. Another aspect which I found astounding was that there was not any documentary footage that was used. The unbiased presentation of the issue led me to have an unbiased opinion on the matter as well; sure, the French were definitely wrong for colonizing Algeria, but I also feel that Algeria was going about things the wrong way. Viewing the film can be beneficial in the sense that it would help others in their pursuit of revolution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this brilliantly filmed movie you can understand why filmmakers such as Spike Lee and Oliver Stone were influenced by it. Although Spike Lee's "Do The Right Thing" and Oliver Stone's "Salvador" are not about colonization, the human conditions and issues that "The Battle Of Algiers" addresses is relevant enough to inspire filmmakers who want to make a movie about human oppression, which exists in many different forms. The way in which Pontecorvo utilizes his skills and cinematic elements available to him to address not a single protagonist, but tell the story from multiple perspectives is one of the reasons I believe this film is successful. The film is able to effectively illustrate the socio-economical problems of colonization and is not biased in faulting either side. The fact that the movie did not fall into the traps that previous movies about colonization had is also something to be praised. The colonizers were not seen as single dimensional killing machines, but rather people with sense and a consciousness as we see in Col. Mathieu. The film also shines a light on terrorism showing the reason, thought, and purpose behind public bombings. The film justifies the realist genre it falls under, and it is hard to believe that every scene was completely staged and scripted instead of documented. It is hard to watch this film and not be left with compelling thoughts or lingering emotions, which, in my opinion, should be the goal of every good filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting film, maybe a little confusing for audiences unfamiliar with "independent filmmaking". The story is so well told that you don't even need to understand the language to get it.I think it was a very wise move by the Pontecorvo to show different attitudes in the characters on the Algerian side. Even though they were all fighting for the same cause, it was good to see a representation of the different types of members of the movement. Some wouldn't sacrifice anyone's life and some others were complete extremists, willing to die and kill anyone for the cause.There are some very memorable scenes in this film, like when a group of women sets out to place bombs in strategic points of the French area. Another great scene happens when Ali La Pointe is hiding behind a wall with other members of the Algerian moment. The tension can be touched as they wait the impending explosion of a bomb that will kill them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the same time I watched Battle of Algers I was taking a Political Science class, which was mostly related with comparative politics around the world. Coincidently, we happened to have just discussed in depth France and their past. Battle of Algers is a beautifully crafted film. I especially appreciated the fact that the director Gillo Pontecorvo was neither Algerian nor French because he really humanizes both, rather than favors one over the other. The issue of colonization has been in our history since the beginning and a film like this really opened my eyes to the broad picture. It allow me to see the difficulties of the resistance and their reasoning and the colonizers purposes. My favorite scenes would have to be when the Arab women were walking through town going to plant bombs and while they were there the camera cuts to different people that are in the locations that are about to blow up. This shows the humanity of each of those people and how they all have a story. For a minute or two I thought that possibly the women were not going to go through with their plan, but after realizing what the French had done to their people they didn't think twice. Being that I am a big De Sica fan, I was really satisfied by this film. Neo Realism is my favorite type of films; no professional actors, all on location, no sound stages, real light, and not thoroughly scripted really capture the dignity of the people. I really felt as if it was a documentary but it was all staged. This is a true film and now one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "Battle of Algiers" (1967) nothing in the film is documentary footage but an actual film with non-professional actors. The events cover from 1950-1962 in Algeria. Before 1962 Algerians had been under French Colonial rule but after years of fighting in 1962 they received their independence. This was the birth of fundamentalism. The French tried to make Algeria there own and input their beliefs into the whole Algerian nation. However, the Algerians weren't any bi standers but did anything possible to get rid of these invaders. A big concept found in this movie is Neo-Realism where it captured the reality of oppression. We discovered how the Algerians were living in somewhat all right houses but compared to the French they were the ones on top. The French personally did care too much about them but as soon as things got rough, they too action. The Algerians only wanted their independence where they can practice their religion, express their culture and pass on their beliefs to future generations. Wouldn't you be angry with a group of people taking possession of one's homeland and fighting over what originally was yours?</fullReview>

This is a movie that shows that oppression occurs all over the world. Even today this movie is still applicable to how power is and how we perceive power. This movie can also cause the viewer to question their stereotypical view of who is bad and who his not. The passion in the characters cause creates a tensive compassion for the audience. Especially in a time when many people view people from certain countries as evil. The battle fought in this movie is more than for Algiers, it is for oppressed people and societies worldwide. Personally I found it to be a movie that is perfect for discussion (not debate) on modern day issues of why we do what we do.</fullReview>

This movie isn't as action packed as most war films but the scenes that do have action look as if it was actually happening on screen and wasn't staged, which allows the viewer to really immense themselves in the story arc and truly get a feel for the impact of war on both the French and Algerian citizens . From Col. Mathieu's interview with the press to Ali's encounter with the police officer when attempting an assassination everything seems so real and by the end of the movie both sides are pulling at you for your support. This was a great movie and I suggest that everyone should watch this film as it is both entertaining and historically important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best war films ever. You'll feel watching a documentary, that grainy look is impressively real and it enhances the overall visual experience. You'll feel you're watching footage from the Algerian war and not a movie, this is enhanced by the acting and how the camera becomes almost invisible (only a great director can make this, thank you Pontecorvo) and it's a way to understand the people and the culture behind Algerians after 9/11, where everyone coming from that side of the world, were called "terrorists" without a logical reason.We follow Ali La Pointe while he tries to survive in the streets of Paris and how he becomes a guerrilla leader who fought for the independence of the Algerians from the French. What makes this movie unique is that it humanizes the "bad guys", they're not a monolithic group, they have different reasons to fight and this is how you as the audience start to think about their reasons to do these despicable acts.There's a scene involving a woman on a mission: to put a bomb in a cafeteria full of innocent people, including children, that will make you think about a lot of things and probably would make you think that maybe this girl with the bomb has her own reasons, her own goals even if she's doing something horrible and maybe this is the only way she has to achieve her goals.A though provoking movie. A great family flick. Forget The Muppets this holiday season and bring the pop corns, watch this movie with your kids. It's like watching a dirty special on the History Channel but 10 times better.Try to find the Criterion Collection edition in Blu-ray. The sound and picture quality is as good as it gets!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that truly achieves neutrality for an artistic purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Battle of Algiers", Pontecorvo makes a conscious effort to present an impartial dramatization of the events that took place in Algeria in 1957 by neither demonizing, nor idealizing the Algerian resistance. The film delivers an unapologetic perspective on the injustices faced by the Algerian people, as well as their radical backlash against the French army. Some cringe at the striking similarities between this film and the current situation in the Middle East. But instead of interpreting it as a prophetic approximation of the present, one quickly learns even after all these years, and even though it has taken on many different forms, the battle between Western idealism and Islamic fundamentalism has had a perpetual presence in the world that will not vanish until both sides relinquish the toxic need to impose their views on the other.Pontecorvo's most accomplished scenes throughout this film happen when characters are on the verge of a decision. The culmination of these decisions will make you feel shocked, moved, and often angered, but surprisingly not at the characters choices, but at their circumstance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Brutality of War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers is recognised as a classic film, having a high IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes scores and being placed 120th on Empire's 500 Greatest Movies of All Time in 2008. There is a great reason why it is so regarded, getting all areas of filmmaking right and having such an impact that the French banned it: the French need to learn to accept criticism.As the title suggests the Battle of Algiers focuses on the Battle of Algiers between 1955 to 1957 during the Algerian War of Independence. Gillo Pontecorvo's film focuses on both sides of the conflict, Ali La Pointe (Brahim Hadjadj), a young ex-prisoner who joins the National Liberation Front (FLN) and becomes a senior leader and Lieutenant-Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), a Free-French veteran who heads the Counter-Terrorism operation.Pontecorvo shows the harsh nature of this war, the Algerians fighting for independence, a simple nationalist idea of self-rule and the French, whilst not explained in the film, fought for two main reasons, the first being Algeria was seen as a part of France and the closest colony they had India that British had and they had already suffered two major defeats, World War II and Vietnam, they did not fancy a third. During this conflict there was no real good guys, the FLN were willing to use women and children to pass on messages, weapons and place bombs in busy cafés. Teenagers are used to kill police officers and the FLN organises strikes to show it is a wider movement. On the French side Mathieu is show to be a competent commander and that leaders of FLN work in cells so they could not betray each other, but the French resort to torture, checkpoints and quick raids, using intimation and violence. Whilst the Colons (French colonists) start to turn their racism against Arabs into violence attacks against anyone Arab, including children.Pontecorvo sets out to show the wider picture of what went on during the war: it was a tough, brutal war that American Generals during the Iraqi War have studied the conflict because of the similarities between them. There are a lot of modern parallels, from army officers having to talk to the media, the army trying to use media for their own aims, that there is two sides and two stories during a war and that characters are mixed, what is considered a legitimate target, what is terrorism, who is your real enemy, how you gather popular support and many more issues. You could thrown in a lot other historical events that are similar to Algeria, from the General Strikes in Apartheid South Africa to the Arab uprising.There is great acting throughout the film and you could easily believe in them and their actions. They are fully developed and there is a true mixed picture because that is what the world is like. Both sides were willing to do unpleasant, illegal acts. Pontecorvo knew how to add tension in a film, from the action scenes, to where people hide from the police and army or weapons. The music really adds to the atmosphere, some of the best judge music as the tension builds in scenes. There is no glamour in this war.</fullReview>

It had a great stuff in it and it is perhaps one of the best war movies ever made and needless to say it is not a fictitious story but a true story from the pages of history.The stages of revolution that is portrayed, the forming of the organization, the plotting of attacks, actual operation of attacks, some of them which are carried by women and children is so realistically shown in this movie. Even to this day, these happen in many parts of the world. The makers of the movie have struck a perfect balance between the features of a documentary and a feature film. Kudos for them for that.One more important thing to be noted is that the makers have not taken any sides, be it Algerian or the French while narrating, but the story is told form a neutral point and is one more point which adds beauty to the movie.If you are a fan of war movies, or a student of history then this movie must be in your watch-list!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A harrowing and powerful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who says history lessons have to be boring and drawn out? They can also be visceral and intense in the form of a movie like The Battle of Algiers. This film tells the story of one of the bloodiest revolutions in history. The French occupied Algeria was a desolate and harrowing landscape that became a bloody battleground for the revolutionaries who would stop at nothing to regain control of their country. The film focuses on the leaders of the revolution as they plan violent terrorist attacks against the French to show them they are deathly serious. Parts of the film are also from the French army perspective, following General Mathieu as he hunts down the leaders of the revolution and aims to take them down one by one. These two perspectives create a balanced view of the war, one where we are never quite sure who is in the wrong and it is up to the audience to discern if the shamelessly brutal methods the Algerians use to gain independence are justified or not. It is a difficult film, but one that is executed with visceral beauty and grandeur.The Battle of Algiers is a fascinating film that tells a emotionally chilling story about the determination and anguish of the Algerian people. Both sides are victimized in this story as the Algerians have their freedoms stripped and the French civilians living in Algeria pay the price through the revolutionaries acts of terrorism. There is a steadfast amount of determination here that is almost disturbing. However, I refrain from saying it is reasonable but there is of course reason behind the violence. These people want their freedom and they will stop at nothing to gain it. The various characters and perspectives in the film exemplify this determination so well and at such tense lengths that there are times where you won't even believe your eyes.On that note, The Battle of Algiers is also an intense audio-visual experience. The sights and sounds of the film are haunting yet so compelling. Ennio Morricone, one of the all time greatest film composers, leads the action of the film with a brilliantly chilling score which makes scenes of destruction and desolation all the more harrowing. The film never holds back, displaying to us the grotesque results of the violence which this revolution brings about. Bodies of children. Demolished homes of innocent civilians. These things disturb us and yet we never know who to blame. It makes the film all the more fascinating. Gillo Pontecorvo directs with harrowing grace and glorious chaos that absorbs us into the action so well. We are thrown into such insanity and disorder via the noisy rallies and the always bustling streets of the ravaged Algeria. The Battle of Algiers is a film which throws us into the middle of an experience and forces itself upon us, making us handle every emotion. It is not just a film, it's an experience.By todays standards, The Battle of Algiers may not seem like much but considering it was a film made in 1966 this is an impressive feat. The film doesn't sugarcoat anything. It is brutally honest and viscerally real. You won't find films like this from the time period often, especially ones that chronicle true events. This is a triumph in filmmaking that has forever changed the face of political cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even tough the director of the movie neither french nor Algerian it is more on the Algerian sight since I felt more empathy towards Algerian sight. Yet some parts of the movie gives tips about the Algerian culture but it doesn't fulfill the theme or philosophy under it for example when Ali la Pointe says Hasan "I only afraid god" it is because Muslims are taught to be afraid of god but it is not the afraid in literal meaning. To be afraid of god is if one do something wrong he/she looses the god's compassion and consent . The earth born people are not the subject of to be afraid of so you don't have to lie or do wrong on a purpose of being threatened feelings. how these people kill the french then? because it is permissible to kill to defend your country in Islam. Further more it is the highest rank to die as a veteran for your country. Veterans are the most respectable and sensitive points of Muslim cultures. More over, the reporter's voice saying that that the Muslim's echoing with those unintelligible and frightening rhythmic cries is actually called "zilgit" . conversely what reporter defines zilgit , it is actually thrown at the weddings or folk dancing . it is basically the sound of the excitement of happiness or ecstasy of being together or celebrating something with other people. it is the sound of sharing a common excitement together. the french reporter saying about zilgit as unintelligible sound is very alien definition . Eastern Muslim people act mostly emotionally and so called" unintelligibly by western mentality. Algerian people is absolutely oppressing at the casbah and being torched at the prisons Algerian people is considered as an ignorant and uncivilized people by french . Soldiers laughs at the man drooping mouses out of his box .it is obvious that they are less developed in technology and science as other Muslim countries but their immaterial world is more developed than french even tough french don't realize it. such as their pride and woman's dignity is their dignity either they know that woman or not it's a divine matter. These people live for their dignity . that's the reason Ali la Pointe hit the guy instead of running away police. They have a sad state of freedom in casbah and considered as a link or number but human by french. they are torched killed oppressed. The psychological battle is as intense as physical one. french mostly announce or dictate that NFL is nonfunctional and announce the names who were captured. on the other hand even a child believes their freedom battle he sneaks and takes the microphone and courage people. NFL was been dissolved but they throw themselves to the roads with the cloth flags and making their body a bulwark because It's this way: being captured is beside the point, the point is not to surrender.</fullReview>

It is different than many of the American war movies that seem to glorify battles. This movie does not make a statement about whether war is good or not, it just shows the sadness of war. Based on the historical Battle of Algiers it shows the real cost of war and the price of freedom. In using the boy who helps Ali by reading for him the director shows how his generation is literally needed to help the cause, but the metaphor is about how the movement needs the younger generation to succeed. The director does not really concentrate on the ultimate outcome of the war, just the horror of the battle and that it pretty unique for a war film. This film is still relevant because so many countries around the world are involved in their own fight for freedom. It is not saying war is good, just that it is tough and the way that they are fought is very sad.</fullReview>

The UN has the power to enforce the French patrol to leave or stay. Both the Algerians and French fight for the side of the UN. The Algerians revolt by planting bombs in public places and gunning down French officers. The Algerians are angered that they can't live the way they would like in their own native land. The Algerians can't even marry outside their community.

It is a true test of character to give up control for another's freedom and the French are definitely not portrayed as compassionate people in this film, but rather rational when the Algerians are left to act irrationally out of desperation and a place of extreme emotions. The actions of both sides heinous but the really atrocity comes from the act of insubordination. Making others feel dehumanized and inferior alone would be cause for revolt. This film speaks to a person's soul and truly makes me appreciate freedom to choose my religion and carry out the traditions pertaining to, without judgment or persecution. Shot as if it could've taken place in real life, you see both sides take a stand, who would you side with? Watch this film to experience a fight for the right to life!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Survival of the fittest" -- the driving force of terrorism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is so critical to be the leader irregardless of which side you are on. I felt as if both the French in particular Col. Mathieu and the FLN leaders, the Algerians were forced to engage in evil in order to create some form of good that is deeply rooted with freedom as well as cultural identity. Behind the uprising for the Algerians lies nationalism and behind the French lies the ideals of colonialism.Overall the movie was truly brilliant and well thought out. This is one of my favorite movies of all time in cinema. It really opened my eyes to the art of film making. The ability, creative force and dedication that is required in order to produce a real work of art was clearly behind this particular film. I admire this film mostly because the footage looked very realistic as if they were the "real deal", having known that all the shots were recreated and not archival just impressed me moreover. Also I am so astounded and fascinated by the ideology and issue of war as depicted in this film. I even ended up writing my research paper in English class regarding terrorism mainly inspired after watching this film. It makes me wonder what truly drives terrorism and war itself. Out of all the movies I've seen in my college film class, this one is the only one that truly struck me the most. When one watches this film, one can't help but think about the ethics of war and people's ethical responsibility when one is faced to deal with it. At certain scenes such as when Algerian women would drop the bombs in public places that were surrounded with a great deal of civilians, I can't help but feel that helplessness for the civilians. Then again when I see scenes like the French blatantly disrespecting Algerian culture such as the scene when an Algerian couple had to marry in a rush in secrecy because they are not allowed to get married in their native tongue, I can't help but also sympathize as to why they are trying to revolt against the French. One of the reasons why this film is so moving is because it is not biased. As a viewer, you get to see both sides of the coin. Many would most probably side with one side, but I could not. I really believe that this film is something future generations can refer to in terms of critically analyzing the roots of war and terrorism. Obviously terrorist acts like 9/11 should not be condoned but we must try to at least understand it at a deeper level. This film has so many implied lessons that we can learn from. From tactical lessons of acquiring success like empathizing with the enemy or perhaps proportionality in terms of the outcome of people's actions. At the end though I just can't help but trace myself back to human nature and Chrales Darwin's theory of evolution: "Survival of the fittest". I think that partly the reasons for war lies in human nature's biological component of trying to adapt with change also it's human nature to feel such strong emotions that more often than not result to disputes or disagreements. It is not a question why this film should be watched. It MUST be seen that's the bottom line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Battle of Algiers" is one of the most realistic film portrayals of war that I have ever seen. The story accurately portrays both the atrocities committed by the French colonizers and the horrors of modern terrorism used by the Algerians. The film is so important because of its unbiased approach, which is most likely a direct result of hiring the Italian director, Gillo Pontecorvo, to shoot the film. Pontecorvo shot the film as realistically as possible and it more closely resembles a documentary film rather than a war film. The recreation of the events in Algeria feels more authentic than any film I'd seen. Since the film uses mostly local and unknown Algerian actors in the streets of Algiers, you truly feel that in some moments you are apart of the film.The film is full of memorable moments and horrifying images that are sure to stay with you. One particular image is that of a child eating an ice cream cone in a restaurant before it is bombed. The scene creates such a sense of tension because it's obvious that almost everyone in the restaurant is going to die. It's an angering and heart wrenching scene that makes you think of the innocents affected by terrorism. In contrast, the scene that prompts the Algerians to start using widespread terrorism, involves a vigilante band of French police bombing the home of a suspected terrorist. The audience knows that the man is innocent and the bomb has unforeseen collateral damage when it destroys half the neighborhood. The next images are of the bodies of women and children being pulled from the rubble. With contrasting images like these it's difficult to choose a side in "The Battle of Algiers," which is what makes it such an extraordinary film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although La battaglia di Algeri was produced by an Algerian, Gillo Pontocorvo managed to make a film that is surprisingly un-biased. Both Algerians and the French are responsible in the escalating casualties throughout the film. The film avoids pointing fingers in a "he-did-it-first" style (although "she" is just as guilty). By avoiding a film with blame, neither of the sides actions are seen as justified. In true Italian Neo-Realism style, he used non-actors, shot on location, and gave the impression that large amounts of the film are taken from archival footage. The combination of this style along with a view detached from bias help make this film more than about France's imperialism and the FLN's terrorism. By escaping the individualistic events, La battaglia di Algeri can demonstrate easier that both sides committed their own atrocities. Each side had its own ideology and adamantly believed that they were doing what was in the best interest. By becoming blinded by their ambition, they were able to kill large groups of innocent people. Col. Mathieu is the only person who can openly admit how horrible he acts. Jean Martin, the only actual actor, portrays Col. Mathieu in a surreal, almost metafictional style. His talented acting harshly contrasts against the rest of the crew giving him an other-worldly presence. Every time Col. Mathieu talks, it seems that he is not so much a part of the action as much as he is breaking the fourth wall and talking to the audience directly. Despite the moral code that Col. Mathieu reinforces into the audience, the film feels very much like a textbook on the issue of imperialism and revolutions within their former colonies. Taken out of the context of the Algerian War, this film helps demonstrate the issues and conflicts that can and have arise on either side post-imperialism. Representations of similar conflicts can be found now and throughout the past century and long before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Battle of Algiers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very powerful film that basically is asking how far will you go to fight back against you're oppressor and how will you do it. This film is so powerful because we see the view of both sides. We see the French side of the army taking over these people and we see the Algerians side and them doing whatever they can to survive. Neither of them is good or bad. They both commit horrible acts on each other and never seem to fins a peace until after the story of the film is over. This film just makes you feel for the Algerians so much that you can't help be on their side but they go about their objective the wrong way sometimes. You attain so much respect for them though for fighting back as they do. In the end their whole purpose was to get their whole community to fight back and they finally did. Instead of bombing and killing they come together and march on the French. The film is all about the power of resistance and how far you can take it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as great movies are concerned, this film is the cr?me de la cr?me. Its been watched countless times as an example of what to expect when the state or a foreign power is forced into conflict with a civilian population armed with their wits, their intelligence, and what little weapons and technology they can get their hands on. It's not difficult to see how the current conflicts in the Middle East and the American reaction to them relates to this film. In fact, the story of this film relates to any major conflict between an invading force that is more technologically advanced and seemingly more powerful than the population it seeks to control. Both struggling "freedom fighters" and the governments that seek to eliminate "terrorism" appreciate the film, as it was filmed in a way that creates no sense of hidden variables or any sort of a Manichaean world view. The film is one of the best examples of a world where black and white concepts simply do not exist. At one point, one of the French colonels in charge of stopping the Algerian resistance movement explains that the French government has only two options, and that any concept of right or wrong simply has nothing to do with the task at hand; that if the French want to stay in Algeria, they must accept what must be done, and that entails putting up with brutality and torture as the means to accomplish their end. This film can best be described as "real." Nothing about it seems contrived, everything mirrors real life and the gray areas of the world that so much suffering seems to thrive in. Whether you feel that the French are in the right or the Algerians have the moral high ground, Pontecorvo's film will leave you with a better understanding of the other side, despite the fact that you may loathe everything that they stand for. For every act of violence in the film, one cannot find true justification, only explanation, but perhaps that is Pontecorvo's point; that explanation and understanding is enough to get humanity towards whatever sort of peace it tries to attain. Even if you can't appreciate the film for its style, drama, music, or any cinematic aspects, the message is one that all humans can learn from and appreciate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing storytelling and editing throughout this entire movie. It made me feel like half of what I was watching was real, even though it said that these images were fake. The way this film is made you can see the tension in the air as each power hungry country does whatever they can to gain control. The scene of the three women willing to blow up the French base held major significance to me, especially because they were women. It just goes to show the depths these people are willing to go for freedom and what can happen when one tries to subjugate a people, but at the same time it shows how troubled they are at the things that the feel must be done in order to gain freedom. The same thing goes for the opposing side. Despite French occupation, you can tell it is troubling them that they are there and the things that they do in order to maintain control. This is a jaw dropping film that leaves you at the edge of your seat, primarily because it chooses to take no sides. You have no idea what side to be on because it sympathizes with each person. Great film making and a must see for sure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever depicts the vicious cycle of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gillo Pontecorvo cleverly and calculating depicts the Algerian War. War is an endless cycle and a tough subject to depict. It is anything but glamorous, and should be understood by both sides. Ali is a depiction of a strong character that would stop at nothing for the freedom of his people. Our eyes are opened to the vicious cycle of war and what goes on in a country seeking independence. Other countries and cultures can relate. It is no surprise women and children participate in the Algerian resistance. War harms all who participate on some level and innocent bystanders as well. Gillo Pontecorvo has a natural talent for portraying the right feelings and emotions he wants his audience members to feel. The ending was unfair for the French to decide to blow up Ali and everyone inside in hiding spot, including the boy; but after all, war is unfair and unjust. Achieving the goal set forth at any cost with immoral measures and complete disregard to the human life. There is an apparent tension between the surrounding social conditions and the aspiration of Ali all the other people seeking independence. The tensions between the French and Algerians portrays the struggle from both sides; the consciousness of revolution stirring amidst our hateful society hinders progress. Everyone possesses the love of humanity in our hearts and the the film shows the struggle and immense power of the people!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bias in the face of atrocity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since it's inception in 1895, film joined other artistic mediums as being a reflection of the society that produced it. Be it through Orson Welles' reassessment of the meaning of the American Dream in 'Citizen Kane,' or Robert Downey Jr. fighting Arab terrorists in 'Iron Man,' film has been the medium for countless artistic pieces exemplary of the values and concerns of the society that created it. One such example is Gillo Pontecorvo's tour-de-force, 'The Battle of Algiers.'Focusing on the struggle for independence between the Muslim natives and the French Colonialists, 'The Battle of Algiers,' was lauded by critics for the gritty and cracked magnifying glass it cast on war and colonialism. Released a mere four years after Algeria was declared an independent state, the film's use of Neorealist and documentarian-techniques as well as its unflinching violence leant a visceral urgency to the picture. Not content to show the struggles for freedom of some long forgotten war, or white-washing the affair by casting the likes of a Gary Cooper as the head of the Muslim resistance, Pontecorvo's use of dark-skinned non-actors who had actually taken part in the struggle provided the bloodshed with the impact one would find sterilized from a more mainstream picture.Rather than casting modern concerns against a historical backdrop that could often go over the head of escapism-seeking film audiences, the truth is exposed in unambiguous concerns. By capturing the recent past through a modern lens, Pontecorvo avoids sentimentality, and the expressionistic caricature of evil often found in historical fiction narratives of the time.Many of the people involved in the production of this movie were actively involved in the war of independence just a few years earlier. Although Pontecorvo and writer Solinas set out to objectively make an a film to show the oppressive nature of colonization, and not to demonize the French, a biased approach was seemingly unavoidable given the crucial involvement of Saadi Yacef and Salash Baazi, actors and de facto producers on the project. Yacef was a major figure in the FLN and extremely anti-French in his account of events. The Algerian interests in the movie are well established as although technically presented as a neutral documentary style view of the war, the protagonists of the film are the Algerian freedom fighters and the French are the less sympathetic oppressors.In the writing and production of this film, Pontecorvo and Solinas' ideas, such as the protagonist being a French paratrooper, faced plenty of opposition from the Algerian involvement and were ultimately scrapped. While less even-handed than initially intended, given the countless negative representations of Islamists, or darker-skinned racial others in the previous seventy-one years of cinema, perhaps this somewhat biased portrayal stands to even the playing field and tell another type of story than one is expecting to see. By allowing audiences the world over to experience the injustices of colonialist powers over the Third World, and empathize with these racial others, the picture can be a stepping-stone towards the West's understanding of how their actions in poorer countries can have damning consequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that hits close to home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest irony of this film is how similar it is to our "war on terrorism." If you think of the french as Americans and the Algiers as the citizens of Iraq, one can't help but to realize that we're doing the exact same thing as the French and that the terrorism being brought upon our soldiers is nothing more than retaliation from a people that refused to be conquered. If Bush had watched this movie from beginning to end, he might have revised his invasion of Iraq. This film does a brilliant job of telling us what happens when you try to dominate people. The Battle of Algiers doesn't favor either side in the film, as both are doing some deplorable things, but the message that reached me in the end was that people can't be conquered. The film doesn't shy away from its realism as it confronts the conflict with brutal honesty. None can say that either side is truly good, when you see the evils they both commit, but you can at least realize that there's a reason for every action and to not label things as good or evil. The movie is an intense experience that will make you question what's right and wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Battle still rages with power.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four decades after its release The Battle of Algiers remains as emotionally powerful and timely as ever. Its semi documentary look and universal theme addressing a people's right to run their own country and not some foreign colonizer or more pertinent to today's front page, despotic dictator, has not lost an ounce of its urgency or punch as the same part of the world including Algeria itself wrestles with self determination. Street thief Ali Lapointe is doing time in an Algerian jail when he gets religion after witnessing the execution of an independence fighter. On the outside he attempts to enlist with the FLN but is first tested to measure the depth of his commitment. Passing that he becomes part of a cell that encourages strikes against the French oppressor but when this fails the cell turns to violence. Career officer Colonel Mathieu is given command to subdue the rebelling Arabs and he does so by imposing greater restrictions and resorting to torture of Casbah residents and suspects.Director Giullio Pontecervo's cold sober story telling rhythmically carried along by Ennio Morricone's score and cinematographer Marcello Gatti's lensing of the vertical Casbah battle field in all its restrictive claustrophobia makes for an ideal stage to depict an oppressed people brought to the edge with nowhere to turn. While Pontecervo shows both sides resorting to atrocity he clearly sympathizes with the Arab cause and takes every opportunity to make French paratroopers look like Nazi Africa Corps and act like Gestapo. Conversely he does not glamorize (or infect the film with a movie star ) the cold dispatch of Ali and his compatriots instead leaving it up to the immoral situation to make its case.Mirroring the Viet Nam conflict during its release and used as a training film by terrorists around the globe since then The Battle of Algiers remains a provocative and absorbing watch that should continue to resonate not only as a call to arms but as an example of cinema at its most powerful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No need to add to the assessment of this film's quality, but I can throw some light on aspects of the film. Someone who was present at the making of this film clarified to me what the significance of this film was, and why certain things are as they are.This film was commissioned after independence during the short reign of Ben Bella, but was not completed until after the coup of Boumedienne. The short- lived Ben Bella revolution was full of the ideals of genuine peace-loving idealism and cooperative socialism. The dispassionate message of the film was very much in tune with the intellectual thinking of the regime. (Compare, perhaps ,the film "Memories of Underdevelopment").Unfortunately the regime was easy prey for a military coup which happened during the making of the film. The crowd scenes, remarked on as so authentic, were in fact made so because this was the only form of gathering allowed immediately after the coup, and one is watching an odd blend of staging and reality, where Algerians were taking to the streets in a disguised protest against the coup.Are there any heroes in the film? Well, yes. If one looks closely towards the end of the film one can see the scrawled message "Un seule hero - le peuple" - (only one hero - the people).In a way then, one is witnessing not just a film about what had passed, but the beginning of the unfolding of the Algerian tragedy as it later became, and that is part of the film's potency.Beware of seeing this film and the events it portrays through today's prism. The question of religion did not arise - the movements were anti-colonial &amp; nationalistic at first, as portrayed. Later socialist, secular, communistic and cooperative, but finally succumbing to militarism. These cannot be termed as "Muslim". Only after the failures of the subsequent militaristic and anti-democratic governments that popular political Islam gained in importance.As a footnote it may be observed that one of the Milk Bar bombers became a political figure in her own right, married a later president, and is, as I write, the Vice-President of the Council of the Nation. In appearance, she could still easily be mistaken for a French women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Historical Masterpiece of Documentary-style Realism ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies affect your heart in their depiction of the darkest sides of human nature. Some others challenge your perception of what is right or wrong. And some movies penetrate your senses, elevating the cinematic enjoyment to an extraordinary level. "The Battle of Algiers", Gillo Pontecorvo's masterpiece of documentary-style realism, combines these three elements, turning a war movie with unknown actors and minimal dialogs into a unique cinematic experience."The Battle of Algiers" is a fictional documentary about one of the most controversial periods of French history, during the decolonization era, when Algeria was a 130-year-old department of the French territory. But, as powerfully illustrated in the first frames, there was the city and there was the casbah. The film opens with a powerful symbol, the dorsal spine of its narrative, the cultural gap: a key element in our understanding of the roots of terrorism in one side and torture in another one, our hearts freed from any bias.Pontecorvo conveys his message by injecting an implacable logic in the script. When the 'hero' Ali La Pointe, a brave hot-headed fighter, joins the NLF, his first mission is to shoot a French policeman? with an empty gun. Later, Jafar, his mentor explains that it was the only way to prove he wasn't a spy; French could have sacrificed an Algerian to infiltrate a spy but not one of them. The same faultless logic is illustrated by the other main character, Colonel Mathieu, whose impeccable speech delivery and sunglasses are one of the most iconic elements of the film. Mathieu teaches us (through his soldiers) how the guerrilla's triangular structure means that each member knows only three persons, his leader and his two subordinates. "To know them means to eliminate them", which implies the tactical use of police methods even if it flirts sometimes with illegality. But since the prisoners must maintain silence for one day to let time to the organization "to render any information useless", we understand that one can't make omelet without breaking a few eggs.The same logic applies to terrorism: in the movie's most chilling part, we realize the efficiency of the NLF methods in a masterstroke of editing. We follow three women not visibly accustomed to wear occidental clothes or to cut their long hair, a precious symbol of beauty for Arabic women. They dutifully make themselves look pretty and occidental enough to fool the French guards who don't even search them. Each one leaves a bomb hidden in her basket in a public place. Besides the editing which creates one of the greatest cinematic montages, the directing prevents the film from any desensitizing effect of violence. Pontecorvo shows us the faces of the soon-to-be victims, laughing, chatting, a kid licking an ice-cream and young people dancing, fresh and smiling faces making ours particularly uneasy. Even the woman who planted the bomb avoids looking straight before leaving not to let an ounce of guilt weighing her heart down. But I was devoured by the guilt of being "part of" the operation, when the first explosion occurred in a devastating realism and the boys and girls went out of the dance-club, I just wanted to shout them not to go back inside ? The bombing sequence is the part of the film that definitely contradicts any accusation of bias. But to keep the vital dosage of impartiality, the interview of the NLF member Ben H'midi indirectly explained (not justified) the use of terrorism with an ironic "Give us your bombers, and you can have our baskets" "The Battle of Algiers" shows the origins of acts we label as cruel with never putting them into perspective. When the only rule is to win, the ends justify the means: "Should we remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences." says Mathieu. Even the civilians are killed by the NLF, through terrorism or heartless drive-by shootings. But the film doesn't exalt these acts nor does it dehumanize the authors: Mathieu respects Ben H'midi's patriotism and even Jafar admits it'll take more than terrorism to mobilize the population. Still, it's no surprise the film has been screened in the Pentagon during the Iraq War or Israel during the Intifada. This highlights the power of movies, to understand urban guerrilla is almost impossible without watching "The Battle of Algiers". But as documentary as it is, it's still a film, in the good sense of the word.I don't think the movie is as dispassionate as it's often described, the last discussion with Mathieu reminds the old adage, winning the battle, but not necessarily the war. It was a tactical not strategic victory. And yes, for some reason, the war started again, concluding the film with one of its most spectacular scenes, featuring so realistic riots, I still wonder how Pontecorvo recreated this. The climactic conclusion will haunt me forever through this scene where the policeman asks the population "What do you want?" and then, behind the mist, you hear people's shouts punctuated with Algerian women's strident yodels ? they shout and dance, waving the new Algerian banner in one my most thrilling cinematic moments, even more relevant when you think of the current events in Egypt, Tunisia and other Arab countries, the shouts of despair and chants of hopes, from overly passionate populations who know the value of freedom enough to fight for it.This in an exhilarating movie which, more personally, made me shudder so many times I thought I left my window open. But then I realized this sensation in my shoulders was the weight of affiliation, to a culture that seems to get things the hard way, a hot blooded culture that inhabits the eyes of my Algerian grand-mother who lived that time ... a sensibility that I inherited, making me react to the beautiful closing theme with deep emotions and hopes for a better future ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Battle of Algiers, a film by Gillo Pontecorvo (who is interestingly an Italian director, not Algerian), was originally a controversial film when first released in America due to the negative connections people would draw to Vietnam. What's really amusing is the fact that years afterward, President Bush actually held a screening of this movie in the Pentagon. Bush completely distorted the message of this film and saw it as some sort of manual as to how to defeat the terrorists (oh boy...) I really admired the visual storytelling element of the film, which had a very documentary style to it. All the "war" scenes looks like actual footages. I also really liked how Pontecorvo set up the character of Ali La Pointe. The first scene we get of him is this guy running away from the police. He trips on the foot of a wisecrack French guy and Ali has a choice, to keep running to avoid getting caught by the police or to teach the French guy a lesson. Ali punches the French guy in the face. There's no dialogue, no long introduction, just a simple scene and right away we know what kind of guy Ali is. Another interesting point I realized while watching the film was that usually in film where a group of people are conquered by another, the conquered group is usually somehow culturally/socially converted and integrated into society but the Algerians were completely segregated. There wasn't even an attempt to "moralize" the "savages." I think that's why we get the term of the kasbahs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Battle of Algiers was a great movie that portrayed the struggles of the Algerians for their freedom. The way the movie was filmed made it so that I couldn't tell who the bad guy and the victim was. The movie equally showed the destructions that each side caused without much bias on each side.The scenes where each side were bombed by the opposition, they were both filmed in a way that you would sympathize who ever was on the receiving side. This made it even harder to pick a side, which let me really question the justice of the uses violence in those circumstances on either side. Even so, I sympathized with the Algerians because, I am an Korean-American, and because Korea went through similar oppression by the Japanese. Another great aspect about this movie was how realistic the shots of the attacks were. For example the scene where the racing track was blown up it was so realistic that it made people think that the movie was a documentary. A scene that caught my eyes the most was the scene where Ali is tripped by a Caucasian man and they exchange a very intriguing stare. Even though Ali was on the floor, his did not waiver as he stare into the Caucasian man's eyes. I thought that this scene was a great metaphor of the relations between the Algerian and the Americans as a whole. Because even though the Algerians (Ali) is oppressed by the Americans (Caucasian man), the Algerians don't lose their pride and fight on to regain their freedom.</fullReview>

Combining the fact that people are refusing to understand their fellow man's plight, and the true grit of those being held down mentally and emotionally, this film is a true eye opener. When we feel as though we are doing something good for someone else without factoring if they really wants it, this movie shows how the human spirit fights back. For these Algerians to resort to tactics that are at their disposal to "fight the power" is similar to what our American Revolution was built on. I am not a fan of innocent people getting injured or murdered, but the questions that comes to mind is 1) How do you get to those who HIDE behind innocent people and 2) Is fighting for how you want to bring your children up really terrorism?</fullReview>

The Algerian resisters, who make terrorism to achieve their goal, or the French, who colonized the Algerians. Filmmaker does not make the mistake to portray the terrorists as caricature characters. Movie does not make a mistake like romanticizing the terrorists neither. It just shows the mindset of terrorism, under what circumstances a person would commit such crime? This movie should be displayed in schools, aired on TV, streamed on youtube for free, and newspapers should tell people to watch this movie. So whole nation may have a better understanding about what we are dealing in Iraq, especially in Afghanistan. That would save many lives and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Battle Algiers"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Battle Algiers is a very influential movie because it dealt with issues that the nation face and it is true even to this day. The film explores historical events that take place during the Algiers Battle. Not only does it relate to the United States but relates to those Nations that fight for their freedom. Author from IMDb: dankagvoic from United States comments "This movie was made in 1967, over 30 years before 9/11. When 9/11 happened, I thought who in this world does that? Who kill(s) innocent civilians in the middle of the day by crashing the plane into the building?" I completely agree with his comment; when 9/11 occurred I was in middle school and it didn't make sense to me how people could: first of all, kill themselves and kill innocent people. But after watching this movie I got a sense of what it all meant. It was not just people being suicidal but had an utterly deeper meaning. A meaning that goes beyond hate but focuses on the pain. Overall I found this film provocative and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always liked war films but I think The Battle of Algiers shoots up to the top of my list of favorites. This film is based on the events that took place while the French colonial rule in Northern Africa during the Algerian War, most notably the Battle of Algiers. What I really love about this film is that it takes you into the mindset of a normal citizen and you understand why they become a terrorist/insurgent. It's a little terrifying, to be honest, to see what lengths they'll go to in order to insure their freedom. But at the same time, their reason behind the actions is justifiable. True, it leaves you questioning both the French and Algerian for their actions; it's like an unrefined chess match, each move escalating the tension until it just snaps and the violence just reaches an all new high.It's shot beautifully in black and white, leaving viewers under the impression they are watching a piece of news reel. It's brutally realistic and you can't help but wonder how they shot the explosion scenes. The film is raw and it pulls at the barest of human emotion. You feel empathy for the Algerians, under a rule they no longer want. It's an amazing piece of art and comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Battle of Algiers focuses on the events of 1957, a key year in Algeria's struggle for independence from France.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an excellent artifact of the Algerian revolt against their French Colonists in the late 50's early 60's. Many reviews have mentioned how the story of this movie parallels what is going on in Iraq in 2004. It is odd that the policymakers did not notice the slight things that can turn a normal citizen into a terrorist/insurgent. It is how this country was founded There are no faults with this movie. The transfer from Criterion is perfect. It shows how an occupying force wins the battles but loses the war. This film is honest, and balanced, it's so real it's almost like a documentary. As this was made more than 40 years ago, I think a younger audience would benefit greatly from this masterpiece. The movie mentions a relative calm between 1957-1960 before demonstrations and further activism finally forced the French to leave. Though not explicitly stated, I would not be surprised if being aware of other African colonial states gaining their independence in that same time period served as inspirational catalyst to inspire a new leadership to take the place of the individuals primarily the focus of this movie focused mainly in the 1950s. Done in a near newsreel documentary style this film does show the power of struggle for independence on one hand, and the desire to maintain colonial authority on the other. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romania hears you loud and clear.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This strongly reminded me of the Romanian Revolution in Timisoara in 1989, so it was well received, especially by me. It did pose a strange (yet convincing to some) justification behind people who bomb public areas to make a statement. Side note on the special effects- they were extremely realistic, I can imagine that it would be the equivalent of today's Avatar status CGI. This film had a LOT of thought put into it, acting was convincing especially because it was done with people that indeed participated in the revolution in Algiers. On a historical note, whole thing that was going on with France was extremely hypocritical considering that France had their own revolution against the high ruling class, so it's rather interesting to see them acting like the ruling class over another COUNTRY and find absolutely nothing wrong with it. As far as the ending goes, I can see how it promotes peaceful protest, in the end bombs didn't solve the problem. One of the people I saw this with commented that if it wasn't for the violence beforehand, there wouldn't have been a peaceful revolution in the first place... However I'd reference the Romanian revolution. It was peaceful on our side, yet the communists did not only respond with rifle fire upon the protesting crowds, but also made use of tanks and killed many more that way. I love this work of art and I can totally see why it's one of Spike Lee's favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gripping Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Battle for Algiers offers a chilling depiction of the Algerian struggle against French colonization. Tensions mount as a cauldron of violence erupts, leaving both physical and psychological scars in its wake. This is a story of a people overrun by foreigners, who refuse to lose their homes, country, and identity. This is a story about a cause in which people believe so deeply, that they are willing to sacrifice not only their lives, but the lives of innocent people. This movie offers a different perspective, and an avenue in which the roots of terrorism can be understood. Although the various methods used by the characters are disturbing, the reasoning behind their actions is understandable. Both the French and the Algerians are depicted as engaging in questionable behavior, the basest elements of human nature can be seen through the actions of both of the opposing sides. Upon watching this movie, one would hope that a genuine understanding and sympathy for any ethnic group that has had foreigners impose a new way of life upon them could be had. This is a very enlightening film in regards to portraying the human emotions, frustrations, and rage that accompany any battle, war, or conquest. This is a movie for all those looking to understand the struggles of another people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review and deeper analysis for this wonderful film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers I believe, is the basis of Pontecorvo's fame - a model of how without prejudice or compromise, a film-maker can illuminate history and tell us how we repeat the same mistakes. This study of the Algerian guerrilla struggle against the French colonialists in the 50s should be looked at not just as pure cinema but as a warning to those who seek by force to crush independence movements.No doubt I was aligned with the seditionists by the unconscious nature of the appeal. The test of this comes in the unforgettable sequence where three Algerian women plant bombs at various crowded hangouts in the French quarter. Masquerading as Europeans, carrying life and death in a hand basket, they would be sinister femmes fatales (I love Noir by the way, took a class on it last year) in another context. But we have been made to collude with their perspective and look through their eyes at the innocents about to be slaughtered.The French settlers are particularized?in vivid snapshots of teenagers dancing, men sipping drinks and idly chattering, a toddler licking an ice cream cone. The women take no pleasure in their mission and shoulder full responsibility for its appalling consequences. But history has spoken. If we can accept the grievous necessity of these deaths, then we consent to everything. Pontecorvo has penetrated our Western self-absorption and let in the harsh light of reality. If not, the movie at any rate offers iconography?checkpoints, interrogation rooms, torture chambers?that has become timely again and worth meditating on.This is today for the US. This is our history, now I think it's time to take a look from the other side of the table and see what we are truly doing in Iraq, and around the world.What does the IMDb community think about this? Do you think that history truly repeats? If so, would today be the prime example? Am I completely wrong?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Battle of Algiers" amazed me at how real everything was. Of course it was only but a few years after this whole revolution took place so the feelings and passion was still there. Not one person ever came out of character because they embodied those people so well (some even played themselves). It was really amazing to see so many people so passionate about a movie. I'm sure the actors didn't even care about the paycheck. They knew they were a part of something special and wanted to make it great. It's a shame it was banned in the United States, for it could have taught us a lot and maybe we wouldn't even have had so much support for the War in Iraq or Afghanistan. People would have seen similarities between the two. This film is universal because so many people have colonization in their heritages. Millions of people can relate to this film which is what makes it a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so important as it tells the story of the independence of Algeria. A lot can be learned about the history of Algeria through watching this movie. Another great thing about this film is that it will hold your interest. I was entertained and educated at the same time. It was great seeing the Algerians waving flags in the air and shouting for their freedom in this film. Since the film is in the French language with English subtitles that adds to the authenticity of this film. The film is in black and white instead of color and that is a great thing because it causes the viewer to focus on the Algerians fighting for their freedom in the film instead of the cinematography in the film. This film can be used as a great educational tool to teach others about the history of Algeria.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful film decades later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Battle of Algiers" is a stunning black-and-white film which tells the story of the violent clashes between Algerian Nationalists and their French Colonial rulers in the 1950s, but mostly tells of the rise and fall of the spirited 1957 resistance campaign. At several times I wondered if I was watching documentary footage, as this obscure film achieves tremendous realism with expansive casts of extras, sparse music, excellent crowd sound and on-location shooting. At many times it does feel closer to documentary than scripted drama as it follows many stories, but chiefly that of Ali la Pointe, an illiterate petty criminal who becomes radicalized in prison and rises to the upper echelons of the resistance. The movie shows atrocities committed by both sides and doesn't seem to show undue sympathy for either, a remarkable accomplishment for any film, let alone one made so soon after the events and on such an emotionally charged topic as colonial resistance and terrorism.At some points the film rivals the great scenes of any crime and war movie as we see the characters on both sites execute their plots, be it paratroopers storming a rebel hideout or female bombers infiltrating hangouts in the European Quarter. The pacing is a bit slow at times, at least compared to the just-for-entertainment greats of the genre like The Godfather or Goodfellas, where this film's 5+ minute female bombers sequence would be shaved down to a minute and set to orchestral or rock music. The slow pacing, even if it's to a bit less exploitative music, does come off as a weak point of the movie, but one must remember that this movie is conveying meaningful emotion and real-world lessons, it's not just showing us people committing intricately planned acts of violence because it looks cool on screen.Much is said about how those real-world lessons of the movie, especially as the subject is Islamic terrorism against white occupiers. If there's a better movie about an insurgency and guerrilla resistance, I haven't seen it. While I think it's foolish to act as if seeing this movie will give one all the answers about the terrorism question, it's certainly something you should be able to see and accept before you start spouting off opinions about dealing with terrorism - or counter-terrorism.</fullReview>

This film requires some degree of thought. Gillo Pontecorvo isn't stupid. Everything in this film falls perfectly into place with what he wanted.that is good for him as well as for us. Gillo Pontecorvo makes movies for him, and if other people enjoy it then that's just extra. and for people who truly love the art of film making and film experimentation The Battle of Algiers is a truly exceptional piece of film making.20 years from now this will be a blade runner, and i don't want anyone who saw this movie in 2009 and hated it buying the super 3 disk spectacular blu ray directors cut unrated edition when it comes out in 2030 and then saying its a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with universal themes of freedom and independence, and a global reach that would resonate strongly with anyone who believes in those ideals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a scene in The Battle of Algiers that left me in awe. It is a wide shot of a road with a right turn up a slope. Hundreds of Algerians pack the street in a strike for independence while a huge French tank rolls across the tarmac towards these people, forcing them to the sidewalks. The scene's unbelievable realism stems from director Gillo Pontecorvo's decision to shoot on location, use local non-professional actors, and achieving a grainy, organic visual style through hand-held cameras and newsreel style editing.The entire film is shot in this manner. As a result, The Battle of Algiers is often considered a breakthrough in cinema, the first of its kind. It is a fictional film based on something that has happened in real life, and of which it portrays so realistically that it is hard to believe that it is not a two-hour long documentary footage.Released only four years after the independence of Algeria, Pontecorvo's film touches upon a nation's suffering and hope during the French occupation, detailing the violent activities of the National Liberation Front (FLN in abbreviated French), a revolutionary group that was systematically wiped out but whose sacrificial efforts became etched in the collective psyche of the Algerians, prompting them to rise up to their oppressors.The film is also noted especially for its outstanding direction, of which Pontecorvo deservedly earned an Oscar nomination for. Scenes where hundreds of innocent Algerians roam the streets only to be gunned down by the French military evoke a powerful sense of unjust and tragedy. The use of wide, composed shots and long lens allow the situation to unfold almost like a live event, its visual scope unparalleled at that time.Of equal impressiveness are scenes of bombs planted by the FLN that explode in a number of crowded places. The camera captures the real-time explosions as the non-actors try frantically to get away from the blast. Considering that this was the sixties when computer visual effects were not in existence yet, these dangerous feats could only be filmed as they happened.Even though Pontecorvo's film tries to emphasize on the plight of the Algerians (with disturbing scenes of torture), it is still a fair, unbiased take on the French military. It portrays Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), the chief officer in charge of restoring order to the colony, as someone who understands and sympathizes with the enemy, attempting to seek cooperation with them rather than trying to annihilate them.Pontecorvo's use of Ennio Morricone's deeply haunting music as accompaniment to scenes of Algerian victims of bombings (and later, French civilian victims in another sequence) reflects the collateral effect of war on those caught in the crossfire. In many sequences, a running radio commentary delivering propagandistic messages is broadcasted, heightening the sense of realism already so vividly brought to the screen.Widely regarded as one of cinema's most important films, The Battle of Algiers is still not widely seen by the mainstream audience. That needs to change because this is a masterpiece, a film with universal themes of freedom and independence, and a global reach that would resonate strongly with anyone who believes in those ideals.SCORE: 9.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Civil-War movie ever made....................</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Battle of Algiers is based on Civil-War for the independence of Algeria from the occupation of France started by the National Liberation Front of Algiers in the year 1954,the war came to an end with the independence of Algeria in 1962.The movie shows the civil war from two different view points of both the Algerian peoples who aimed to obtain their independence at any cost and of French authorities who aimed to hold their occupation over Algeria.We see the war from beginning to end with the story of a young man Ali La Pointe who became a rebel hero from a small criminal.When things get out of control from French police the French Military intervened to handle the situation under the command of Col. Mathieu.We see the account of bloody struggles from both sides,the torture and suppressive methods used by military to end the struggle or the bomb explosions and guerrilla war tactics used by NLF to obtain freedom,both French Military and NLF try very extreme and violent measures to counter attack each other.The half documentary,half fiction style of movie from the director Gillo Pontecorvo gives us the very realistic feel and drew us close and connected to the movie.The screenplay is written very well in both documentary and fiction style.It is made with very precise technical perfection,the use of camera to create a feel of documentary movie and also the thrill and tension of a war movie gives us a unique and mind-blowing ride that can be deliver from watching this movie only. the scenes of bomb explosion,assassinations and protest scenes at end of movie were shot very perfectly and seemed to be very real with the brilliant background score by one of my favorites Ennio Morricone.Battle of Algiers is the most hard hitting and violent Civil-War depiction,i have ever seen.The best thing about the movie is that it is not a propaganda movie even if the movie was made under the authority of government of Algeria the movie doesn't justify any particular side,this movie do not have any thing such as struggle between good and bad,instead of preaching and manipulating us,this movie just shows us and tells us accurately horrible and terrifying casualties of a Civil-War.Without any doubt this movie is greatest political thriller and one of the greatest war movie ever made for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Battle of Algiers is a story about Algerian war of Independence from French. However, this film little bit different from other war film because Algiers did terrorism and director Gillo Pontecorovo was shown both sides, which are Algerians and French, story. Actually, director Gillo Pontecorvo is not French or Algeria people. He is a Italian; therefore, he could be shown both sides people in a very unruffled manner in the war of Independence film. It could see in this film, how people frustrated, humanize terrorism what they believe, and armies how to find the leader of the movement. In addition, this film was influenced Italian Neorealism. Therefore, the pictures look like documentary style, using amateur actors, and focus people who did not have civil rights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was actually blown away by this movie. It seemed, to me, to be so far ahead of its time. The whole time watching I felt as though I was watching a contemporary movie, which was filmed in black and white. Aside from the attire of the French characters, and a few scattered scenes, it seemed very contemporary. In many ways, it IS very contemporary. The battle between the Algerians and the colonizing French is a story, which has been played out throughout history, time and time again.The director of this film was purposefully chosen from neither a French or Algerian background, which turned out to be an Italian director. I don't think that the directing could have been done any better. As a testament to the quality, many contemporary directors cite this feature as a major inspiration. The major reason for the choice in director is an attempt to take neither side of the story. Although I found the film to lie a bit more on the side of the Algerians (which can be taken simply as the fact that a viewer tends to side with those who are fighting for freedom), it is rather fair to say the director did a very good job at showing the angel and devil in both sides.

		<fullReview>Not since Elim Klimov's "Come and See" has a film had such a lasting and emotional effect of me. There's a reason why it ranks as one of the most influential films of all times. It literally blew my mind, and there's no other way for me to say it. From the beautiful, sincere acting to the realistic staging, Pontecorvo did nothing to shy away from authenticity. Several times throughout viewing the film I had to remind myself that what I was seeing on the screen wasn't real, though the scenes depicted in the film are in fact as real as the emotions I felt while viewing it. One of my favorite scenes is one in which three Algerian woman transform themselves into "attractive" French women in order to sneak bombs undetected into the popular French quarter. The music that plays serves as a kind of elevated heartbeat, and you can't help but feel what they must be feeling as you look into their beautiful faces and see the fear and determination in their eyes. A scene made even more inspiring knowing that all three women are non-professional actors. I'd love to see the likes of Julia Roberts or Sharon Stone (Ha!) attempt to convey such strong emotions, using just the eyes no less! As the movie went on it became more and more difficult for me to determine where my sympathies lay. Who was right and who was wrong...it's hard to decide when you can relate to the denizens of both sides. But I do know one thing for sure, "La battaglia di Algeri" is a powerful, thought-provoking film that that holds just as much strength and relevancy today as it did over 40 years ago, and it begs to be seen again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is almost a timeless movie just like with the writings of Nostradamus different people can interpret this movie in anyway that they want too which i think is a "double sided" sword to speak. the biggest conclusion one could draw upon first watching this film is that there may bee a connection with September 11th and even though this film was recorded almost a half century before that however it seems to create a sympathy for FLN guerrilla insurgency even though they clearly are "terrorists" (according to todays standards) the audience seems to develop a connection with them and seems to almost want them to beat the french paratroopers. i have always been a fan of the star wars movies but in particular the opening scene in which the FLN are about to be blown up by the french col. Mathieu reminds me of when Darth Vader is about to blow up princesses Leia's home planet in exchange for information which would end the rebellion but the plan fails. however in the battle of Algiers the plan "fails" when the leadership of the FLN is killed yet the young boy steals the microphone and declares that the resistance is not dead sparks the flame that will continue to grow until "justice" is achieved. something i really liked about this film is that every incident could be argued as being necessary for a previous action and causes all the violence in the film is due to retaliation. there seems to be a method to the madness of this film and it makes the audience think of whether or not there is a good or bad side which is what i enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to really sympathize with either side in this movie. The resistance fighters have a right to their independence yet are attacking through terrorist acts against civilians. The French military is trying to protect themselves and their people but are doing so through inhumane tactics, such as torture, and are executing their strategy in a methodical, almost machine-like manner. What this film does well is try to show both sides without bias and let the audience decide who the good guys and bad guys are. The plot is applicable to modern day wars and raises the question, "how do you fight against this kind of terrorism?" It made me realize how little is known about the motivations behind modern day terrorists, and how the word "terrorist" should not be completely synonymous with the word "evil."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Colonization is a word that traces back to the 17th century, or so I thought. My ignorance of the Algerian War was brought to my attention when I was first introduced to the film. Is it a story of a revolution? Or a story about fighting for one's right? The Battle of Algiers draws a fine line between the hero and the villain, in this case the French army against the national Liberation Front. But who truly deserves the titles - protagonist and antagonist? Gilo Pontecorvo transports us into a time of desperation in Algeria, without any bias view; however, as a spectator we always tend to root for the home team, which in this case for me were the people of Algiers. This film is entirely scripted, from a secret wedding scene, to riots in the claustrophobic alleyways of the city. Pontecorvo delivers a respectably deep and enticing, documentary-stylistic film only some can pull off. What better time to use this technique, then re-enacting the Algerian independence movement (1954-1962). As a South American, I know what its like to fight against an unjust and corrupt government, this film conveys truth from beginning to end. After my journey to 1954 Algeria I understood that everyone has the right to fight for what you believe in. There is no good and bad in war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found The Battle of Algeri a very interesting movie, because even though it is a movie that it was made in the 1960's, it deals with many current issues. The right sovereignty of a state and the right of freedom are the themes of this movie. Even in this movie we see many connections to the Italian NE realism, like for instance the choice to use non professional actors, and to shoot the movie on actual location where the real events took place. Overall I found this movie very violent but also very thought full. We could compare the issue of Frnace colonialism over Aljerie with many other current events. The use of non professional actors made this movie even more realistic.</fullReview>

Taking place in the early 60's the tale follows Ali Lapont on his route to becoming a revolutionary leader. Dealing with the sense of repression that can not be contained, and giving an insight to terrorists motives. Even though the movie tries to explain a terrorists motives, by no means does it ever justify them. Displaying both sides in equal light, where neither the terrorists, or the colonizers are ever displayed in a more positive light than the other. Beautifully shot in black and white, and with an amazing soundtrack that accentuates every moment and feeling of the movie, there is no reason to be disappointed with it.</fullReview>

Without glorifying any side Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo manages to present an unbiased and neutral portrayal of the conflict between the Algerians and the French ? which could easily symbolize any of today's conflicts. But the movie's greatness should not be measured by its neutrality, but rather by its ability to create empathy among its viewers to both sides. The use of Italian neorealism (use of real location, non professional actors, etc?) adds to the authenticity of events and thus also to the emotional stages we go through. Perhaps the most important point this movie clarifies is that for every coin there are two sides, and for every war there are two perspectives ? none however justifies acts of violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was incredibly haunting in terms of just how unbiased both factions were portrayed and in the documentary style it was shot in. On one side you have the Algerians who are comparable to modern day terrorists with their bombing tactics and on the other, the French regime who themselves aren't completely opposed to resorting to in-discriminant acts of violence against the Algerian civilians. What I appreciated about this movie was the fact that it was directed in a way that there was no definitive "good" or "bad" side, that there are various shades of gray and that both sides were merely following the path that they felt was right. By being directed this way, it provides a more human approach to the situation because it symbolizes the fact that there are two sides to each story and that we as the audience are free to pick and choose which side was doing the right thing, if any side was justified at all. Should we as the audience support the Algerians, the oppressed citizens who were subjected to racial profiling that disturbingly mirrors current issues in Arizona and their immigration laws? Or should we side with the French regime who were only doing what their duties demanded of them and in response to the radical Algerians who bombed shops and, in one instance in the film, drove around rampaging and shooting anything that moved?The choice is yours to make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As relevant today as when first created</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers is a story of perspective, as relevant today as it was when first made, it tells the tale of the thin line between the definition of a terrorist and a martyr. There can in the end never be any sort of justification for the killing of an innocent person regardless of the cause this film however does not immediately write these actions off as malicious but rather asks the watcher to look further into the issue and examine why this event took place to begin with. Unlike just about every film made today there is no side the film makers choose; the events are simply portrayed with striking detail and we the audience must make our judgments of whom is right and who is wrong. The reason why this film leaves such an impression at least to me is because we know event such as Colonel Mathieu "interrogations," in which the information is forcefully taken by whatever mean necessary have happened, still currently happen, and will continue to happen. Mathieu himself rationalizes this in his mission statement to his troops claiming the terrorists or freedom fighters are told to keep quiet for 24 hours while the National Liberation Front changes the information the cell captured knew. Everyday it seems I read in the newspaper of deaths happening in occupied places where superpowers intervene where they should not have, or forces back by superpowers kill humanitarians trying to bring aid to a systematically incapacitated nation slowly dying because "terrorist" are aided there. We don't have to look far to see how thoroughly the lessons of our past are ignored, and the role of film is to comment, a solution is not needed the comment is where the power of the art lies.Perspective is a powerful idea because it is like a fingerprint unique for everyone, and this film explores how polarized perspective can become when a national and religious identity is at stake. The French as colonizers see themselves as creators of structure for this society to function more efficiently with lots of bureaucracy as well as European technologies, and French cooking presumably? On the other hand the French only ask for a small portion (50% or more?) of the natural resources and land. Well there was no real chance to the native Algerians to decide what happens as the French forcefully colonized the land, people moved there and a more European way of life was establish to the relief of all except the vast majority of those who wanted nothing to do with Europe in the first place. Muslim culture which had dominated the region for thousands of years was forced behind barbed wire fences where soldiers with weapons monitored its dealings. Enter discontent which became deeply rooted within the people who once owned all the land not just a portion, and like all revolutions it starts slowly maybe with non violent means but far to often something changes and violence makes its tragic debut perhaps with officers being shot as they patrol, it starts to build as the occupiers botch operation after operation more and more innocent people start to die eventually each side trying to send a louder message. The French look at the Muslim people as terrorists and vice versa, the film does not choose it merely tells the story and explores where all the anger comes from, it does not glorify the cause nor does it vilify. This film offers un-canny insight on ways to avoid the disaster of imperialism and occupation we continue to find ourselves in, maybe one day we will choose to listen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes the movies can explain the best some historical happenings and this movie is one of them.The movie helped me empathized with Muslim people living in Kashba, and how they felt like the second class people in their own country for 130 years. This movie was made in 1967,over 30 years before 9/11. When 9/11 happened, I thought who in this world does that?Who kill innocent civilians in the middle of the day by crashing the plane into the building? After watching "the battles of Algiers" I kind got idea, where are the roots of these seek suicidal behaviors related with Muslims.If you would like to understand better how does it feel like being the "guest " in your own home and have a false sense of freedom.Please rent this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fairly detestable film. The people and the circumstances are unutterably paltry - guerilla thugs against army thugs at the fag end of colonialism. History is far bigger than all this. Did the Algerian people stop to consider the legitimacy of the Arab invasion centuries earlier, not even feeling a slight twinge of irony about their heroic revolution? Nobody can claim the world should retain the status quo of a particular point in time (except the hapless individuals who get trodden on). Flux and reflux of people has moved the world forward for aeons. Morality lies in the treatment meted out by the victorious forces, not necessarily in the act the occupation itself. Here we had our faces pressed too closely into the lives of individuals and their self-inflicted pain, pride and anger. And what did it earn them? The right to suffer decades more of authoritarian rule and civil war at their own hands.Nor do women generally go bombing milk bars full of children - that reduced the 'revolution' to the level of criminal psychosis and skewed things too melodramatically, just like the pile-up in "Weekend" is hardly representative of a day out. The director was zooming in too closely and the picture was distorted simply by that.I also felt manipulated by the documentary approach and the grainy black and white which creates a disingenuous world view. The sky is still blue, the trees still green, people are still people despite any amount of film-processing. Certainly, carnage was involved, but I was resisting the the snapshot that the film presented of the world. Mainly though, seems to me that the point of any film is to invest morality and compassion in things, not strip them away for barren effect. The effect was of filming a real cock-fight, with the director secretly relishing the sight of the animals tearing each other apart but throwing his hands up and saying 'hey, I make no judgement, it happens" I don't call that accomplished art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the ones that were lost in the battle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Film depicts the French Colonization in Algeria in the 1950's. Its director Gillo Pontecorvo uses Neo-Italian Realism and a monochromatic setting to show the racial tension between the French and the Algerians. The actors are mostly Algerians, and the film is spoken 95% of the time in French. It maybe fair to say that this movie is another Conquest movie of how people of a different belief are ruled under European Ideology. This movie shows the tactics the Gorillas used to slowly one by one take down French officers. However, there is on thing that will impact you is the involvement of children throughout the film. We see children from the Gorilla side being used by their mothers as a decoyed to smuggle bombs to French own/run places. We also see the children in the places where the Gorillas bombed, and also where the French set gun fire or bombed. The Director did this to show the innocent people that lost their lives for independence. This is a movie that makes you think about the price of Freedom and who really does suffer. It's sad once you think of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"THE BATTLES ARE WON BY SLAUGHTER &amp; MANEUVER. THE GREATER THE GENERAL, THE MORE HE CONTRIBUTES IN MANEUVER, THE LESS HE DEMANDS IN SLAUGHTER" -WINSTON CHURHILL"The Battle of Algiers" Directed by Gillo Pontecorvo. This film sole purpose is not only about the retelling of a historical Conflict between Algerian Citizens &amp; the French regime in the years of 1954-1960. It's a strong powerful view of one Man's Courage to bring back Equity, Order &amp; most of all freedom to his homeland. Another Man's military conquest to exterminate the Algerians plans to overthrown the French Government by means. This is a hard film to watch or judge of any viewing, does not show bias views towards each side. Doses not follow your typical tale of good versus evil. It's more like "Disorder versus Order". The films open of aftermath of an Algerian being tortured &amp; interrogated by the French Military, spelling the beans on the where his fellows Algerians Guerrilla are hiding. The film cut to a flashback to a couple years back, we are first introduce to the character of Al la Pointe a, who later becomes the leader of the revolution. What made me feel uncomfortable in the first 40 minutes in the film were the acts of brutal Violence from The Algerian toward the French. The Algerian had enough of their government ruling of their land, their final solution was death. You some of them shooting or stabbing the French officials. Yes to be honest it bother me to an extent, cold blood killing was the best way. The French would have given up without a fight, they secret engineered a plan to seize off &amp; to make clear point they won't give up till a fight, which the French a deployed a bomb at a heavily Algerians housing apartment. The French attack worked very well, at first you realize as viewer "that good that should show The Algerians not to kill in cold blood". But then in seconds your whole perception shifts to a different direction, when you come upon the aftermath of the apartment Bombing. There some films that hardly shows the aftermath of retaliation so in order to not show sorrow to the victims. The moment to see the young children &amp; women were the main casualties of the attack. Then the whole movie becomes a classical game of chess. Which Race can strike the most efficient? Algerians activated a more well balance plan by use of Multiplying Bombs all well know public Establishment where the French socialize among each other. Makes wonder at that point who should I fear or who feel empathy more? Col. Mathieu comes in the picture; he is introduced as some kind of folk Hero or Savior. Mathieu use everything in his will power to neutralize all Algerian plans for more bloodshed towards French. In the end no side really won, just lives were taken &amp; permanently shattered. Does taking someone's land worth killing or dying for? It's taking back you land which what truly yours worth killing or dying for? Where there be at times to result a Political Solutions with using Bloodshed? These questions are questions; the Answers will never be answered. *** &amp; half starts</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was absolutely spectacular. While watching this movie you feel as if you are watching an actual documentary. The movie shows the french occupation in Algeria and the struggle of the Algerians to win their independence from them. While trying to separate themselves from the French, a group of terrorists begin shooting French officers and even blowing up diners. These Terrorists are not just displayed in the French perspective. You get to know the terrorists in a way, and see their reasoning behind what they are doing. That does not mean this film justifies terrorism by any means, but you feel like you are actually being told their story and not just the stories of the victims of their violent acts. One of the most disturbing parts of the film for me was watching the three women sneak past the French checkpoint and plant bombs in all the public places. You get to see all the different types of people that are in these places, from old men and women in casual conversation to toddlers just enjoying an ice cream. Saying that, it makes the viewer really feel for the many victims in a Terrorist attack and you begin to compare the ordinary people to yourself. This film was dramatic, emotional, and an extreme nail biter. I recommend this movie to anyone looking to see Terrorism from another angle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Altruism or Theft?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is brilliant, in telling the story of a culture; the Algerian culture that has been forcefully lost amidst the French colonization Italian director Pontecorvo shows the strength of unity within a culture. The loss of ones own cultural identity is something I have trouble relating to as I am an American born citizen. However, the film spoke numbers to audience members of the time in relation to what COULD be the possible outcome of the happenings in Vietnam and what eventually transpired. I respected Pontecorvo's efforts in remaining neutral to the French and Algerian side in his film making process. However, as an audience member I felt compassion for the Algiers alone. The altruistic "behavior" of the French were seen as a facade in my eyes. The French overtook Algeria as their own 130 years prior to the story in the film of the Algiers rebellion. They pushed the Algiers into a ghetto where they were surveyed and treated with diminishing respect. Shooting in natural locations and with non-actors made my experience of watching this film a memorable one. When drinking alcohol was prohibited in the country, there is a scene where an old man is taunted by the little children, they chorus "wino" and attack him. I felt remorse for the old man, and in the scheme of things his tiny flaw of alcoholism in the eyes of the colonized government was illustrated to me as the beginnings of a dictatorship. A ruling in which a man may not choose his drink or where he treads. The film resonates to cultures all around the world in its message of the examination of a repressed culture that rebels. Pontecorvo does not justify the actions of the Algiers or the French, but rather, he allows the viewer to come to their own conclusion on what is truly altruistic. Consistently throughout the film my conscience chorused "An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly modern in its commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What surprised me most is the balanced perspective this film depicts. The Algerians aren't just rebellious underdogs that are glorified merely because they are underdogs, and the French aren't depicted as heroes either. The Algerian faction were terrorists in every sense of the word, just like the terrorists we are fighting today: they blew up diners and dance clubs, and even planted a bomb in an airport. The French were clearly the unwelcome occupying country, complete with racial profiling and military checkpoints. It was incredible how modern this depiction felt, and it blatantly represents America's current occupation in the Middle East. The Algerian terrorist weren't blowing up innocent people because they "hate freedom" or because they hate the French. They were defending their beliefs. Not that this film attempts to justify terrorism, certainly not, but it demonstrates that nobody will allow themselves to be ruled and changed by a stronger country of different culture and history. The people will always revolt before they allow such a culture shift.It is up to us to decide who is right. The point may be that there is no right. Just people doing their jobs, or fulfilling their duty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a society that is more concerned about how people look than with what people are, this movie is timeless. It could be a recent story, and even though the movie was released in 1966. The Battle of Algiers is full of energy and suspense. For me, one of the most values of the movie is the soundtrack. Ennio Morricone did an excellent job, as always. One of the most intense moments of the movie is when the three women are acting like French and while transporting bombs with them, part of this intensity his portrayed by the music. The movie also provides a "clean" and impartial view of both sides, the French and the Algerian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit I had vague knowledge of the occurrences in the capital city of French Algeria between November 1954 and December 1960, during the Algerian War of Independence. The two opposing forces were the Casbah and the National Liberation Front. I had never heard of this film until my film teacher introduced it in class. It was interesting that the director Pontecorvo had several protagonists, based on historical war figures. I found it interesting how the story begins and ends from the perspective of Ali la Pointe -- a petty criminal who is politically radicalized while in prison, and is then recruited to the FLN by the military commander El-hadi Jafer. Jafer is played by Saadi Yacef, playing a character based on himself. The French colonialists resort to lynch mobs and indiscriminate,racist violence against the natives. It was difficult to watch when the women hid bombs on their bodies to kill the Europeans. "The Battle of Algiers," made me realize that I am going to continue to research topics I discovered in my film class.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film. You really get to understand the motivation of the Algerian liberals against the French colonist. It had the patriotic energy in this film for the viewer perfectly. Making the Algerian liberals the Antagonist and the French colonist as the Protagonist.What made it nice was not really talking about the politics of the Algerian war. Like which parties supported the liberals or which supported the French colonist, the counter arguments from both sides, etc. This was explaining the movement and how it was getting more and more popular for the average Algerian, which I enjoyed.Another thing in the film the I liked was Jafar. One of the leaders for the liberals, he was the character that was on a stand off with the French military and eventually surrendering because they were going to bomb the house where he was in. Was actually involved in the liberation on Algeria and was actually playing himself in the film.I give this film hands down, two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Greengrass once stated that if he could chose one film that he had directed, he'd chosen 'The Battle of Algiers' (1966), a raw and riveting war-drama by Italian born Gillo Pontecorvo. And you can see Greengrass' influence all the way through; shot like the real deal with a political storyline and an unknown cast, his 'United 93' draws several similarities. Director Pontecorvo was under the influence of Italian masterpiece 'Rome, Open City' while shooting what would become his own grand work; made to feel like a documentary, the film plots around the Algerian revolutionists wanting independence from French government. Using the zoom effect, Pontecorvo aims in on the details of humanity, on the shackled humanity that faces chaos. Adding on emotionally laden music by Pontecorvo himself and master film composer Ennio Morricone, the film certainly finds a beating heart amongst all the smoky ruins and bloody torture. Pontecorvo was by some back in the 60ties declared a "pro-Marxist" as he doesn't always steer his motivations objectively, but finely balances the line between propaganda and pure observation. Systematically told in its cinematic narrative and with its journalistic narrator, the film still has a ruthless undertone much because of the importance of the story and the following shackles of war. I warmly recommend this brilliant war-film of 1966 whose influence can be seen in many films - most recently in Steven Soderbergh's 'Che'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the Battle of Algiers (along with all of the equally excellent bonus documentary features) after having seen Jean-Pierre Melville's "Army of Shadows" and realized that I was watching a sequel of sorts, as the top operatives had learned their interrogation and torture techniques (on the receiving end) from the Nazis as members of the French resistance. They then went on to develop them in Indochina (see "The 317th Platoon"); and after Algiers was "lost" a few of the veterans provided "the inspiration, the training, and some of the intelligence that enabled Latin American dictators to torture and kill thousands of their own citizens" as documented in the film "Death Squadrons: The French School." They also trained the U.S. operatives in such techniques as assassinations, extraordinary rendition, and water boarding used in Guantanimo and Abu Ghraib, providing the basic curriculum for the infamous School of the Americas where so much of the U.S. Empire's genocidal activities were/are engineered.</fullReview>

I must admit that this movie is not like the usual movies i enjoy but the cinematography is so good that even an unusual fan can appreciate it. The use of black and white dramatized the emotions and depicted the dark times that the Algerians faced during French integration. The event in history is greatly represented by Pontecorvo and shows the inner conflicts of characters trying to maintain their roots in the resistance to the French. You learn about strong characters that will stop at nothing to resist integration and you feel inspired for a moments time but all too soon you get crushed with the sad reality of a failed heroic stand. Overall, the movie was enjoyable because of its raw content and use of characters. I recommend it!</fullReview>

During all of the commotion you see a naked baby boy crying outside its door?I wanted to reach through the screen and pick him up.I feel the movie tells an age long story of how a people can never be truly taken over. There will always be a fight for culture and freedom. Although this movie was about two sides of a fight, the movie never took sides. You get to see why both parties where fighting. In most battle films you pick a side in the beginning and stick with it throughout the film. This film lets you get an understanding of the Algerians and the colonizing French.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers is a deep and enlightening film that shows the struggle of the Algerian people fighting for equality and the freedom to maintain their culture. Even though the French brought technology and civilization in a so-called "peaceful" way, the need to control another culture is never a great idea and that is truly displayed in this film. The film had a new realism style created in the most authentic manner possible and many of the actors were actually citizens that had experienced the struggle that the French brought to Algeria. Ali La Pointe, the main character of the film, is illiterate and displayed as a criminal in the beginning of the film, but ends up being one of the main leaders of the Algerian civilians revolt against the French as they fought for freedom.The film is great because it shows how colonization is unrealistic in so many ways. It takes away identity, language, and culture from people that respect their ancestry. The beautiful parts of the city of Algers was occupied by the Europeans, yet the casbah "ghetto" was for the Algerians to reside and it was their country! In the end, the Algerian women provided the opportunity to fight against the French truly taking form of Europeanization which I felt was really well illustrated with the ethnic women dying their hair blonde and wearing clothing to mock European style. Overall, the film was way before it's time creating complex characters even within the female actresses and their roll of carrying the explosives across the controlled border.</fullReview>

At times it was hard to feel for the Algerians, as they seemed like mindless rebels attacking the more civilized, intelligent French. However, one must keep in mind when watching the film that these people were fighting for their independence, which requires some barbaric behavior.

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. I would consider it equal with Spielberg's Schlinder's List. The reason why I compare these two films is they are able to take a large conflict and scale it down to size and give faces the the good and the evil. The film follows the resistance of the Algerian people with the French government who has been in power for over 130 years. The basic theme of the movie, (What I took away from it) is eggs must be broken to make an omelet and a whole lot of more eggs need to be broken to win independence from the French. ALI is one of the rebel fighters who joins an organized coalition to kill as many French civilians and ranking French officials. The brains of the rebellion Djafar organizes the killings of many French citizens. Col. Mathieu is part of the French military battling to keep peace among the conquered country. After the Algerian hit squads begin killing French police, innocent Algerians are targeted for the retaliation. After the French civilians retaliate, the Algerians dress their women to look like French women to plant bombs in densely populated clubs and bars. In response to that, the French civilians plant a bomb in a crowded ghetto, destroying houses and many many people. So its a very vicious back and forth with people. After watching the movie for almost two hours I began to get desensitized to the value of life and everyone getting brutally murdered. I don't know if that was the director's plan, but I was definitely feeling psychological strain. Why I think this movie is better than Schlinder's List is the fact we get to see all of the repercussions to every action. Everything that was destroyed had a equivalent disaster that built into a massive chain of events. Schlinder's list is really focused on Oskar Schlinder for the most part. Knowing nothing prior to France's occupation over Algeria, it was a nice history lesson that I would not stumble across unless I took film 7 at Santa Monica with Prof. Carrosco. I recommend him to anyone who enjoys movies and wants to expand their understanding of film as an art-form. Back to the review. In the end, ALI dies and Djafar turns himself in to save his own life. The only criticism I have for great movies that are epic is size is the amount of energy one must invest to get through the movie. Generally I like movies to metaphorically rock my world for the two hours that my eyes are open, but it feels like Godfather long and not more violent in my opinion. Take my advice, watch the movie expecting to see people die and many times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The '60s were full of great political thrillers thanks to the revolutionary atmosphere of the time; notions like colonialism were being challenged, and the former European colonies all over the world were fighting their invaders and claiming their autonomy. From this spirit of Independence came Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers, which chronicles with some drama the Algerian resistance against the French settlers.Mixing the genres of war and thriller, this masterpiece shows the messy business of fighting for freedom. What I loved about this movie was its balance in the portrayal of both sides. Civil uprisings are ugly, and Pontecorvo shows how both settlers and settled can and will use any means to achieve their goals.First we have the Algerian resistance, targeting initially policemen. As the French authorities retaliate against civilians, the resistance soon goes after French civilians too. And back and forth in an escalation of violence which soon brings in the paratroopers with their torture methods to smoke out hidden terrorists.The French soldiers of course seem monsters, but its representative, Colonel Mathieu, reminds people those were the same soldiers who fought in the French resistance against the Nazis and who employ torture because the French public opinion Algeria to remain French. In a movie without clear heroes and villains, Pontecorvo shows one of the tragedies of war: how normal people can easily lose their innocence for their beliefs.Besides being expertly written and directed, the cast is also excellent, with newcomer Brahim Hadjadj playing a very human terrorist, Jean Martin as the impenetrable Colonel Mathieu and Saadi Yacef playing Djafar, the head of the resistance.Ennio Morricone, who most have scored all Italian movies of this period, gives us another one of his impressive scores, dramatic, exciting, tense and melancholic in all the right places.Another great aspect of this movie is the editing itself. This has some of the best silent montages I've ever seen, from people searching for bodies in a bombed out house, to three terrorist women preparing themselves to blow up their bombs, to the French soldiers invading the Casbah and rounding up all suspects. This movie works in powerful visuals without the aid of words, making it a fine example of film language at its best.The Battle of Algiers is a film not to be missed. To do so would be to ignore of the finest war movies and political thrillers ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most films lately are becoming stale, over-theatrical, and oh so predictable, mostly due to an increasing public obsession with action and sex. More films are dumb down today than ever before in my humble opinion. Maybe it's because we're all getting dumber, or maybe it's because capitalism has entwined itself in American film culture and utterly corrupted it. Needless to say, the sense of realism in films like Ladri di Biciclette, and this film, La battaglia di Algeri, seems otherwise extinct. I come from a documentary photography background and I cringe at most movies for how plastic they all are. I admire a sense of truth in everything. But from cliché romances with overpaid A-List celebrities, to absurd, fictional epics featuring talentless actors like Nick Cage and Brendon Frazier, we rarely see truth in film. The Battle of Algiers is so pure and captivating it restored faith in cinema completely for me. It is an epic of realism and emits startling truths about war and insurgency. All the while it accomplishes this reenactment of a time in history without the slightest sense of fabrication. Rarely do I applaud a movie at the credits, but at the end of Algiers, I wanted a standing ovation. Summary: A masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic and Document</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that has not only become a classic of world cinema, but has become a historical document and technical discourse in its own right. While audiences around the globe cringe at its tragic narrative, military personnel watch it in order to understand the nature of urban-based guerilla warfare. Either way, the end result is the same: Empire is a Sisyphean business.The movie begins on a raid and then quickly dissolves into the story leading up to the raid. Ali La Pointe is one of the highest leaders in the resistance of French control in Algiers, a resistance structured by a hierarchy of anonymity so that no one tier of it can lead directly to the rest. The occupiers are forced to use arrest and torture in order to ferret out every member, and only through the most extreme activities are successful. Their success, however, hardly wins the overall war. In the end, nobody wins.Gillo Ponticorvo's approach is somewhere between that of Rome, Open City and Salvatore Guiliano. In theory, he's using realistic and documentary modes of expression, and yet those very grainy frames he creates is in its own way a darkly Romantic view of society degrading. His best approach to realism is in the use of non-professional actors, who all are remarkable.Hopefully no one stops paying attention. Sure, anybody can find parallels between what happens in this movie and what's happening today, but more importantly it's important to keep in mind how the movie documents a process over a specific time, and how that process can re-arise again and again and again. History repeats itself, so it is important to always remain aware.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gillo's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"La Battaglia di Algeri" (1966) tells a very sad story. That it is true makes it all the more tragic. Yet out of this strife comes a remarkable film.It's easy to see how Pontecorvo made only a few other notable films, the most famous being "Queimada!" (1967). His star in the latter, Marlon Brando, undoubtedly was persuaded to work on the basis of Gillo's film of the Algerian-French battle.On reading and viewing the history of the making of "Battle of Algiers" I can understand how Pontecorvo put a lifetime of energy and commitment into this project. The film is unforgettable for its realistic, documentary look. There have been other films to obtain such an image, but "Battle" is outstanding in the way so large a cast was employed. Indeed, it's hard to believe so many "extras" could be recruited, much less give such convincing performances.Two critical quotes of the film are notable: the Washington Post hailed it as being "just as important for our time as the work of Griffith, Riefenstahl, Dryer and Visconti were for theirs." And the New Yorker exclaimed, "Pontocorvo and his team show the capability of convincing the cinema public that revolution, in certain circumstances, is a necessary thing." While the rebels are given a sympathetic perspective, the French are likewise fairly depicted--all resulting in a kind of observational, reportorial essay on a historical event. The entire viewing experience is quite unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A foreign masterpiece unlike any other!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gillo Pontecorvos portrayal of the Algerian war against the French paratroopers carefully studies conflict of war and how violence, through escalation, only brings sorrow to those surrounding communities. Pontecorvo's and Franco Salinas' screenplay is very well articulated with memorable quotes and a dramatic structure which that continue to keep the picture tense yet emotionally intriguing. Both Pontecorvo and Salinas chose an interaction of characters from both sides of the war to feel passionate about their stance, thus leaving the picture to sympathize for both peoples, the FLN and the French civilians. Through the deaths of innocents, violence begins to escalate from the beginning, all the way to an explosive ending. Though no protagonist took the film by storm, Pontecorvo weaved a film where all the characters were equally felt for. His structure feels like a race of increasing violent acts, beginning with small gun battles and moving into the direction of time-bombs as acts of terrorism and revenge came soaring. Ennio Morricone's score couldn't help the picture anymore than make it an emotional driven roller-coaster, providing a tear or two in the process. When tension could be felt, Morricone exploded the scene with what sounds like a score of haunting rattling noises that get louder and louder. And finally, when tragedy strikes, like the scene when the Algerians begin looking for their loved ones in the bombs ruffle, Morricone goes into a haunting notion of a score driving one to feel sympathy for the Algerians. Overall, The Battle of Algiers is a foreign right masterpiece telling the horrors of terrorism, without creating a protagonist to sympathize for. It does for what real war does, incorporate a viewpoint from both sides and showcase the peoples pride each side has. It is a haunting story about sacrifices, pride and justice all told to portray freedom as something not so free.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Battle of Algiers was one of the best films in the class I watched it in. It seems to be just as relevant now as it was in 1965. I enjoyed the time line of the way the movie plays out, with the last few minutes played at the beginning and then the series of events that led up to it after. It really makes you think during the movie about how the characters got to be in the situations that they were in. All in all, I think this movie has an important message about what is going to happen every time you try and hold a certain group of people down. Any minority group restricted in the same way that the Algerians were is going to react in the same way that they did in this movie, and the way the French acted to control the algerians and label them all as terrorists seems to remind me a lot of America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Critique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very rare to find a film that shows the point-of-view of the "terrorists" without being some major summer action-packed blockbuster film. Gillo Pontecorvo portrayed the Algerian rebels not as cold-hearted individuals, but as individuals who are struggling to keep their culture alive. It doesn't justify their actions, but it can open the viewers mind to why strong actions needed to be taken in order to get their voices heard. Sometimes the political system just isn't enough for an individual to express their outrage of what's going to their culture and country. What makes this film amazing is that story is universal. Several countries have gone through some form of imperialism. What the United States is doing to Iraq is a great example of how this film can bring insight of the "terrorists" perspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An outstanding documentary-style masterpiece. I feel rather presumptuous trying to analyse what's going on. It looks like press footage most of the time (the extras were locals). There's wonderful hand-held photography from all sorts of engaging angles just like the Tangier chase sequence in Paul Greengrass' Bourne Ultimatum. Gillo Pontecorvo isn't beyond the tension-ratcheting of Hitchcock to make the most of a terrorist atrocity. The acting is real - urgent, even. It's very exciting.The film is a great example of the power of economy. For example, Pontecorvo wrote the soundtrack as well. It's brilliant, very ? la mode ensuring that this is seen not just as another throwback colonialist struggle. That said, one can argue that there is a deliberate reworking of Renoir's Grande Illusion with its mutually respectful martial leaders talking sorrow and resolve against the grain. A modern film about an old theme.A concise and elegant masterpiece. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Uncommonly Powerful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few films with the power of The Battle Of Algiers. It is a film based on real events that gives you, the audience, the feel of those events actually unfolding before your eyes, which is a rarity to say the least. What is even rarer is what makes this film so good: it is perhaps the most successful documentary approach recreation of actual events ever produced.One of the biggest keys to the documentary approach of the film is the fact that the actors do not seem to be acting. Often it is the very fact that actors do seems to be acting that can kill the reality of a film like this one yet this represents one of the successful attempts at using not just actors but non-actors to create a seamless whole. In fact one of the best decisions made by Gillo Pontecorvo was to cast Saadi Yacef who was directly involved in the real events to effectively play himself. The advantage of this is that it adds an even greater degree of verisimilitude to the film and its approach.The documentary approach is in fact the very key to the success of The Battle Of Algiers. The cinematography wobbles, zooms and frames in the way that a documentary film would if filming these events as they were taking place and gives the film the visual reference of a documentary. The result of this is the feeling in the midst of riots, shooting, bombings, meetings, torturing etc. In short the film gives the feeling of being in the midst of a modern revolution from both sides of it.In fact it is the very fact that The Battle Of Algiers covers both sides that makes the film stand-out. It is true that the filmmakers have an obvious bias for the FLN, yet one must look deeper into the film. Despite that bias the film pulls no punches on the morals of terrorism. The very fact that is shows shooting and bombings up close and personal and the aftermaths as well in perhaps the single best example of this. Neither side be it the FLN with their terrorist attacks of the French with their paratroopers using torture is portrayed as the definite good guys or bad guys to put it in more conventional, literal terms. The film proves that one point of view is as valid as the other, something rather unique to this film. The bias is for the FLN and the journey of Ali La Pointe from average Algerian to revolutionary yet the fact is that the film shows both sides. The point of this: nobody is right yet nobodies wrong and both sides of any conflict must understand this. That fact alone makes the film as relevant today as it was forty plus years ago.Another strong element of the film is its rather sparse score. The score was a collaboration between films core master Ennio Morricone and Pontecorvo and it is proof of the old saying less is more. The score provided emotional clout to an all ready emotionally charged film from the almost thunderous paratrooper theme to the heartbreaking piece used in the aftermath of both the French and FLN bombings. In fact that latter piece alone makes clear the intent of those scenes: human suffering in universal no matter which side of a conflict you are on. It is a unique score for a unique film.The Battle Of Algiers is a unique film in many ways. From the verisimilitude of its cast to its documentary approach and unique view of modern revolutions and terrorism, few films can match the sheer power and realism of this film. It is this uncommon aspect that makes the film unique even some four decades after it was made. For anyone seeking a unique insight into modern terrorism or seeking a fine example of how a film can bring history to life after the event I recommend The Battle Of Algiers without hesitation. Watch it, learn from it and be all the better for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best docu-drama ever. Surprisingly evenhanded.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stark, unsentimental tale of the 1957 uprising against the French in Algiers, one of the earliest conflicts based on the urban terrorism and "intifada tactics" that seem so commonplace today.Although the film was made in Algeria only 3 years after independence I was "pleasantly" (perhaps not the best adverb) surprised at how objective and free of propaganda it was. The French are the villains, yet their point of view gets a fair hearing. Even Colonel Massu, commander of the French paratroops, is depicted as a cold, yet intelligent man rather than an evil brute. He is an apolitical soldier carrying out the policy of his government, and will stop at nothing to do so. The FALN are depicted as flawed heroes without halos. Just as ruthless as their enemies despite their righteous cause. I find it ironic that the present day French are so critical of Israel, although the Israelis are a lot more restrained than they were and are fighting a much less unified and more bloodthirsty enemy. If the present day Palestinian groups were as disciplined and goal oriented as the FALN (at least as portrayed in the movie) there would probably be a viable Palestinian state and at least a cold peace with Israel.It was quite interesting to see both secular and more traditional Muslims uniting in nationalism without the mindless hatred, blatant corruption, and atavistic religious fanaticism we see today. A great history lesson and great cinema, even for those who don't agree with the film's point of view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just recently saw this film, and it has become one of my favorite. This film is is about the French occupation of Algeria. It has become one of my favorite movies because it is very similar to the war in Iraq, about a foreign country occupying another while the countries citizens are rebelling against the occupation. A fact I have learned from my film professor is, in 2003 months before the U.S. went to Iraq the Pentagon showed this very film as a training video to high ranking generals, and President Bush. Pentagon officials were actually looking at the film so they can see what the French did wrong in Algeria. This is a great film because it relates to the war in Iraq, and the U.S. military is doing the same things that the French military was doing in Algeria. Though both the french occupation and the war in Iraq were fought for different reasons the tactics are the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is something special. First I have to say that I can't believe it's been made without any stock footage at all. Pontecorvo really shows his skills as a neo-realist director. What I learned from this movie is the power of culture and beliefs. It doesn't matter how strong of an army the enemy might have. If the oppressor tries to enforce another religion and a way of life it will meet resistance and nothing is as powerful as culture, language and beliefs. At night when the city is asleep and the women cries out that Middle Eastern cry of war/victory is an amazing sign of how important and strong the peoples own language and rituals can be used as a weapon so much stronger than any gun. Or when the little boy steals the microphone from the French army and encourages his people to keep up the resistance. What the US government should learn from this movie is something they should already be aware of. It doesn't matter how many tanks you'll roll in a country, or how many bombs you'll drop if you don't let the people be who they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual "Fantonian" experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theme of Battle of Algiers is universal in nature: The struggle between the "occupied" and their "occupiers". It chiefly deals with what the great social scientist Franz Fanton termed in his classic The wretched of the earth, "the pitfalls of national consciousness" ? colonialism. While it seeks to depict the colonial strife between the native Algerians and their French occupiers, what makes this film so potent even today is its ability to transcend global barriers; it could apply just as well to the Palestinian problem, to Afghanistan, our very own monumental struggle against the British Raj, or to any of the classic Latin American standoffs that pit a US-backed rightist government against Marxist left-wing guerrillas ? be it Nicaragua or El Salvador.The film depicts an important segment in the Franco-Algerian colonial strife ? the urban skirmishes between the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) and the French paratroopers between 1954-1957, commonly known as the "Battle of Algiers".It opens with the brutal interrogation of an FLN member by the French paratroopers, who is tortured into giving the whereabouts of Ali La Pointe, an important FLN fighter. We next see the roll of credits while French paratroopers are storming the Kasbah (The native Arab quarter) with a view to surround Ali La Pointe with Ennio Morricone's riveting martial soundtrack hammering away in the background. The next frame shows Ali being asked to surrender or face death by dynamite. The screen then dissolves on a pensive Ali and the viewer sees the story gradually unfold in the form of a flashback. This astounding opening sequence sets the standard for what is to follow for the remainder of the film. Director Gillo Pontecorvo, himself a man of the left, was greatly influenced by his mentor Roberto Rossellini's Paisan(1946), which made great use of "naturalism". Along with Marxist writer Franco Solinas, Pontecorvo fashioned a screenplay which would be enacted by natural actors ? not big name stars (in fact, with the exception of the French Paratroop Colonel Mathieu, played by stage actor Jean Martin, the rest of the cast is entirely made up of non-professionals!).This, coupled with the usage of 16 mm hand-held cameras gave the film a stunning feel of "realism" which is usually brought about by a documentary film ? especially in the mob scenes with the Algerian women chanting hysterically. As a result, this led to many viewers and critics being confused as to whether this film was a documentary or not containing several reels of footage. (The producers as a result, proudly put a general disclaimer on the film stating not a single reel had been used)Pontecorvo and Solinas strongly took the median path when dealing with the politics of the French and Algerian sides, though polemically siding with the FLN. The film documents the brutalities of the French paratroopers ? as is evident in chilling scenes depicting torture by using blowtorches and half-drowning victims in their efforts to decapitate the FLN, while balancing those with the terror tactics of the FLN ? as in the bombing of French public places of leisure and entertainment. The objective nature of the film, its sanctimonious attitude towards truth, and its supercharged atmosphere of political awareness have undoubtedly inspired future filmmakers like Costa-Gavras, Marcel Ophuls and Oliver Stone.For instance, we see in the best works of Costa-Gavras like Z and State of Siege, a frenetic tension and sense of political urgency which makes one aware of the reality of time and place in which one is living in. And as for timeliness and reality, Battle of Algiers is an uncomfortable reminder of the Iraqi occupation, posing important questions on colonialism, imperialism and the relationship between the "occupier" and the "occupied".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An anatomy of an occupation and revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie about the Algerian's fight for independence from over one hundred years of French occupation is a serious undertaking. If you are looking for a pleasant evening's entertainment, then you should put off seeing this until you are in a more solemn mood.When I found out that there was no documentary footage shown I was stunned since some of the scenes seem so real, particularly the crowd scenes that usually look so staged when not real. It is to the film's credit that it does not appear to take sides between the occupiers or the revolutionaries, but maintains the appearance of just reporting what happened.I came away from this with a better understanding of the minds of terrorists and how they operate, and that is much to be desired at this particular time, since the applications to current situations are so plentiful. Though there are but a few scenes of explicit torture, they provide a way to take the consideration of those practices from the abstract to the explicit.The film does leave some significant unanswered questions. Why, after over a hundred years of French occupation did the Algerian resistance coalesce so dramatically in the late 1950s? At the inception of the resistance one of the Frenchman even minimizes it with the comment that the French and Algerians have gotten along for over a century, so why should that not continue? And after the uprising had seemingly been put down, after a two-year hiatus what caused the overwhelming popular uprising that resulted in Algerian independence in 1962?After the final scene you are left to think that things are going to be great for the Algerians, but the subsequent history of that country is not all that inspiring.All of this is not to say that this important movie is a bitter pill to swallow only for its educational values - it has elements of suspense, conflict, and violence to keep your interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A film that stood the test of time"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1966 movie is timeless because the politics behind it is so strikingly relevant to today's issues, especially in our post-9/11 world. It is an unbiased film about a revolution that is started by the Algerians against the French who've occupied the country of Algeria and captures how quickly physical revolutionary tactics can turn into horrific terrorist acts, but nothing that we haven't seen already in the US and around the world. The revolution started by the NLF organization, which is doomed to become the 'terrorist' organization fairly quickly, kicks off the uprising by killing French police, then innocent French people on the streets and escalating to bombing entire innocent French hangouts. But they don't progress without retaliation from the French government. Both sides use fairly convincing justifications for their actions. Many questions are raised but conclusions are left for the viewers to insert.It is a classic war between the suppressed and the suppressors, the weak and the powerful, the more civil and lawfully awful, but what's more to this movie is that those labels can shift throughout scene to scene and that's when the analogies start forming with our situation here today in the US and around the world, becoming all the more exciting to watch. At times of war, rules are broken, policies are changed or rewritten, the humanity of each side is questioned, and powers are abused. So keep you eye glued and ear undisturbed.What I found astounding about this movie is that after watching the movie you can follow up on the movie to see what has happened after the revolution over 40 years later and you'll see that just as recently as Dec. 11, 2007 there were terrorists attacks in Algeria but this time it's not against the French but against their own people, just as one of the NLF leaders in the movie forecast about the state of Algiers after the revolution has ended, stating that chaos could continue long after. It is very interesting. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to sharpen their knowledge of Wars against Terrorism, or to just watch a great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many other reviews here will give you a plot synopsis of this film, tell how realistic the cinematic feel is or how it can help you to understand a culture so different (or not so different from your own). But what impresses me the most about this film is what it tells you about yourself. Director Pontecorvo purposefully gave this film an omniscient birds eye view so the situations can be examined unbiased and without overt emotional attachment. There is no blatant attempt to garner favor for the NLF (National Liberation Front) by showing oppressed Algierians. The French Colonialists are not shown as the evil oppressive outsiders. Col. Mathieu, who leads the anti-terrorist task force, is just a good soldier. He follows orders, he accomplishes his goal. Does he hate the terrorists or what they stand for or is he there doing his job? I think this is summed up when he replies to the reporters questions about his brutal tactics. "Should we remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences." Ben M'hidi plays the voice of the NLF's conscience. He does not pander for the audiences acceptance of their violent tactics, but explains in plain clear terms why they do what they do. "Acts of violence don't win wars. Neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is useful as a start. But then, the people themselves must act. That's the rationale behind this strike: to mobilize all Algerians, to assess our strength." Yes there are heart wrenching scenes and brutality shown on both sides of the war, no power is given to either side by the filmmakers. The French are in a superior position, making the Algerians the underdog. So there may seem to be a lean towards the native Algerians, but that is mostly a state of mind. This film forces you to make a decision on a very hard topic; by making the characters neither inherently evil or good and the actions understandable if not agreeable. The Pentagon uses this film as an anti-terrorist training video. The way you view this film tells you a lot about your state of mind.</fullReview>

If anyone is interested in the history of Algeria, I definitely recommend this film. Its grainy, raw appearance, and audio, make you feel as though you're right in the middle of the action, which needless to say, can really stir up some emotions and make you empathize with the rebel Algerians.Truly a great film!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers is an amazing Neo realistic film. It is neither glamorous, with its grainy, rough, darkish look, it brings the movie to life. At times it feels like you are actually in the movie witnessing the events unfold right in front of you. With its use of non actors and with the dialogue mostly improvised and dubbed over, gives the film a raw feel. It was shot on location by Gillo Pontecorvo in war torn Italy. The setting it self is amazing, the building structures and surroundings fit this movie very well. Some even thought it it was a metaphor for the Vietnam War.The Battle of Algiers is a powerful movie that is a must watch. Never have I been so captivated by a movie, its guerrilla style of filming adds to the amazing and unique quality in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The battle of Algeria is very powerful movie and it is still relevant today. This movie shows directly how it affected the Algerian's in every day life. The director showed people's faces close up and usually showed random people's faces on the street. The shot of people's faces perfectly make this movie more powerful. Unlike some Hollywood movie, the terrorist is not faceless and a heartless creature from a different world.Another trade mark is that an unknown narrator is explaining the story while the camera is shooting every thing that happens on the street. It has a documentary feel to it. Sometimes I feel like the camera man is right there when this entire event were happening on the street of Algeria. That makes this movie very real.This chanting hollow music is coming every time something bad or important is about to happen. The movie started with the ending and Ali fleshed back to where it all started. My favorite scenes are when three women tried to bomb the public places. The trade mark of this movie is that showing people's faces at the bar and coffee shop? innocent kid licking the ice-cream and some couples are having a good time. Conversely these Algerian women's faces have no emotion. As a viewer I can not tell what they are thinking before they tried to kill all these innocent people. In another scene, two Algerian boys are on a killing spree. They are going insane from being opposed for many years in their own land. After all you can't tell the differences between the authority figures and people's on the street because they do have the same skin color. It makes your heart winched as you watch this movie. I have mixed feeling towards Algerians and French.This movie is obviously more sympathized on the Algerian point of view yet the movie doesn't really take any side of bias. It is not really anti-French movie at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating portrayal of Algerian revolution...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 11/30/2007, 6 out of 10(Dir-Gillo Pontecorvo): Fascinating portrayal of Algerian revolution in the late 50's and early 60's from France's occupied police-rule. This is one of those movies that takes you places American audiences aren't used to seeing and brings you a perspective that is sometimes hard to swallow. This is a very good recreation of a true story about a country of people who will go to all means to bring about their independence including terrorist bombings on innocent people to get their point across. For us, it's initially hard to determine who are the good guys and who are the bad guys because both groups use similar methods to try and control the other group. The movie starts in the middle of the conflict(it's really not a typical battle) at a point where a member of the rebellion after being tortured gives away the hiding place of the last leaders in the city of Algiers. It then goes backwards to the beginnings of the rebellion and kind of shows how the main core of the group is formed and where they came from. There is an obvious slant toward the Algerian rebels despite some of their not so kosher cleansing process and terrorism tactics, but their oppression from the French government is shown as needed to be toppled at any means. The movie then continues up through the initial scene until the eventual independence that occurs, but not without many casualties. This realistic, documentary-like movie does not back away from actual violence and it's after-effects, but keeps us interested with a linear American-like story. There is definitely a little lacking in the portrayal of the characters at the expense of the story but overall it keeps your interest. The movie is definitely not like most battles, but instead is a calculated series of incidents done by both sides until someone has to give in. Eventually the French find all the leaders in the rebellion in the city, but the rebellion leaks to the countryside where it wins out in 1962. Again, the interest of this movie for me was learning a new society, it's history and it's ways more so than seeing an action-filled movie experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless immediacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J. Hoberman, The Village Voice's resident film reviewer, described "The Battle of Algiers", Gillo Pontecorvo's Golden Lion-winner at the 1966 Venice International Film Festival, as the "revolutionary du jour". I have to agree. Completely.Everything in the film could and should inspire ferocious and deeply-rooted ideologies and sentiments pertaining to one's own nation's freedom, independence and basic human rights.The film is already four-decades old and the subject that it depicts, the Algerian people's struggle for liberation and self-determination against the French colonial government during the mid-'50s, can be rightfully considered as an integral part of modern history, but even when viewed from today's vantage point (as in my case) it still manages to unsettle and stun, to provoke and inspire. "The Battle of Algiers" possesses such staggering turmoil and realism that, as the events gradually unfold towards the nationwide street revolution, one can't help but be wide-eyed and unnerved throughout the film's 2-hour running time.It works well to the film's advantage that it has managed to acquire through time an uncanny sense of historical immediacy. It feels as if Pontecorvo were still alive today working as a TV news reporter or documentarist recording with his own camera the incendiary real-life events right before our very own eyes. The Dziga Vertov principle of "life caught unawares" has moved onto a new level of meaning. It now becomes an almost-impossible task to draw the line between fiction and documentary, between what is staged and what is actual, if there really is such a distinction.In my humble knowledge, no other highly-political film of World Cinema during those times and after has come close to the feral neo-realist energy of "The Battle of Algiers"--not even Costa-Gavra's "Z", "Missing" and "Amen", not even Francis Coppola's "Apocalypse Now", not even "L'America" (Amelio), "The Mission" (Joffe), "World Apart" (Menges), "Bloody Sunday" (Greengrass), not even our own "Orapronobis" (Brocka), just to name a handful.What can even be more baffling--and thus put one more notch higher the film's above-mentioned quality--for today's viewers is how "The Battle of Algiers" can put in context today's headline-hogging and highly-relevant spate of "political terrorism", international and local. As "outsiders" having to become aware of the headlines mainly by means of TV or newspaper, it has become a necessary habit (justified or otherwise) to regard these bombings, assassinations, insurrections and any other forms of "terroristic" acts as a work of pure evil and inhumanity. This is for the reason that what we, the spectators, get to encounter immediately is the outcome, the damages done, of the event in question (the what and the how). More often than not, we don't get the opportunity to dig deep into the ideologies and motivations that led to the act (the why). If we ever had the chance to know the raison d'etre of the act, most likely the account is biased or blurred, thus further fuelling our "prejudices".The numerous bombing incidents in the film (as well as the attacks on the French officials), mostly at the cost of innocent lives and in broad daylight, can be a sure cause of alarm, considering that these events essentially ring true as to what's being delivered from today's news. But as director Pontecorvo and writer Franco Solinas take pains to give an objective account of the Algerian struggle for liberation and independence--or of the Algerian insurrection, popularly known as the Front Liberation de Nationale (FLN), if one takes the liberty to use an "extreme" description--we get to come to the knowledge that these extreme measures used by the Algerian nationals could be the only possible way to attain an extreme goal, otherwise unimaginable through "simple" and "humble" acts (like the local prohibition of vices associated with the colonial government, such as alcohol, drugs and prostitution).The unbiased account of the historical events is such that the high-ranking French colonial officers, during those tension-filled and critical moments (like the setting up for explosion of a resistance fighter's hideout), still get to exhibit some kind of humanity for their considered "enemies of the state" ("If you want to die there, then let the children out first", is one such line). Such "humaneness", though, by the very situation itself (or the description of the situation itself), gets to border on a comical awkwardness. These colonizers still manage to put a smile on our faces.An intertitle towards the film's end says that the Algerian people finally attained freedom by 1962 (not after some nationwide turmoil, bloodshed and protest, those "unintelligible and frightening rhythmic cries"). However, if we are to take bloody seriously the film's timeless immediacy, then the battle doesn't only stop at Algiers. It continues on and on, in another form, in another place, in another era. Whether won or not, only history can tell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fredrich Engels the Communist theoretician once said that so many factors shape an event that what emerges is something no one might have expected. PBS replayed last night the Algerian made fast paced movie The Battle of Algers, a docudrama of the Algerian struggle for independence, released shortly after the event in 1965 when the right saw the Algerian war as a communist inspired take over and the left saw it as a struggle for national liberation. True to Engle's axiom neither was correct. What emerged was the phenomena of Arab or Islamic nationalism, the most recent product of which left a big crater in NYC; former Russian communists also do battle with this phenomena. Hedonistic liberals enchanted with national liberation in 1962 need not sit back in self satisfaction; today the phenomena hates liberalism more than it ever did colonialism.The tactics of the Algerians would be recognised instantaneously to the casual reader of war news from Irak. Indeed President Bush might have been well advised to have studied the movie carefully before embarking on his wars in Afghanistan and Irak.The movie takes an Algerian perspective but is fair to French Colonel Mathieu whose tactics put down FLN's uprising. Torture scenes were cut from the film in US showings to preserve the sensibilities of the weaklings in the US audiences; a real American ought to be able to eat oily, buttered popcorn during such scenes.The film skirts France's waffling on the commitment to continued war, the OAS (Organisation d'Armee Secret) coup in Algeria in conjunction with the pied noir (French residing in Algeria) and the plebiscite which led to the Peace of the Brave, a French withdrawal.In many respects French President General de Gaulle accurately predicted the future Irak war when in another context, he said, "americans learn nothing from France's mistakes."With the war going so badly in Irak, I'm surprised the Regime allowed this to be shown.Comparable films include LOST BATTALION starring Anthony Quinn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant political film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers is the film on terrorism and its impact on a people and a particular region. In light of September 11, 2001, it is very current and immediate. Although many individuals write much about its objectivity and accuracy, it is a product of the 1960's about a national liberation struggle of the 1950's. It reflects the concerns of the Sixties very well--the romantic notion of the revolution and the beauty and horror of violence . . . It is a brilliantly constructed political film. One should be aware that it is a political statement by the director and the writer on the necessity of struggle and the striving for freedom on the part of an entire people. It has a definite viewpoint--"for" the Algerians and "against" the French. However, it wisely humanizes the French, and shows the honor of "Le Colonel Matthieu" and the humanity of other Frenchmen (Spoiler: the French policeman who protects an Arab youngster from an angry mob of French citizens after a bombing at the horsetrack). I would recommend this film to anyone who seeks to understand the terrorist . . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The reality of revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a note at the entrance of the cinema stating that the quality of the reel is damaged to some extent, so I didn't expect much and even took an aisle seat, planning to sneak off early. But as I noticed, every viewer stayed till the very end despite the frequent disappearance of subtitles (I don't think everyone there understood French and Italian).Other users have mentioned enough about the authenticity of the explosion and street battle scenes, which I shall not repeat. I noticed that the music that accompanies those scenes are thrillingly touching as well, and I'm impressed that the soundtrack has been preserved way better than I'd expect.Kader's quote, "It is hard to start a revolution, even harder to carry it on, and even harder to win it. And what happens after the victory?" brings out the reality of revolution, which certainly applies to almost anywhere and any time. Certainly a lesson to be learnt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that the idea of this movie was amazing. It proved that the director was able to capture a scene in the movie that made me think very intently about whether the rebels were going to give up. In the coffee/ ice cream shop, the woman who planted the bomb was staring at a little boy enjoying his snack and for a second people are forced to think whether or not the woman is about to have second thoughts due to the fact that her maternal instincts for protecting the little boy was kicking in. It was very refreshing and interesting to watch the sudden change of events when she had that intimate point of view shot with the boy but then decided to leave the bomb for the better sake of her people's revenge. Overall this movie was outstanding and I learned a lot about the Battle of Algiers, whereas before I did not even know what the battle was about or who it was pertaining to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A revolution only lasts fifteen years, a period which coincides with the effectiveness of a generation." - José Ortega Gasset Using hand held cameras, non professional actors and grainy film-stock, director Gillo Pontecorvo's "The Battle of Algiers" attempts to recreate the brutal urban phase of the French-Algerian war. Covering the period from roughly 1954 to 1957, the film is a masterclass in cinema verite. Indeed, the film seemed so "realistic" when it first premiered, that audiences had to be reminded with a disclaimer that it wasn't a documentary.Proudly anti-colonialist, the film focuses on the Muslim Quarter of Algiers, also known as the Casbah, where a group of resistance fighters mobilize and fight against the French. But though we sympathise with the small band of revolutionaries and share their desire for independence (Pontecorvo deftly shows the injustices suffered by the Algerians under French rule), "The Battle of Algiers" is careful not to romanticise its rebels. Their bombs kill civilians, they murder innocents, and at times they are more savage than the French.Ben M'Hidi, the leader of the resistance, himself articulates his disdain for violence. "Acts of violence don't win wars," he says. "Terrorism is useful as a start. But then, the people themselves must act. That's the rational behind this strike: to mobilize all Algerians, to assess our strength." Today the film resonates with current events in the Middle East to such an extent that the US Defence Department screened "Algiers" at the outset of the Iraq invasion. What's sickening is that the Defence Department uses the film as a tool to teach how to clamp down on armed resistance. The film's larger point seems to have gone unnoticed by those in Power, the US' colonialist actions, be they in Iraq, Vietnam, or across much of Latin America and Asia over the past century, echoing France's actions in this film.More interesting, though, are the documentaries included on the film's recently released Criterion DVD. In one documentary, Pontecorvo revisits Algeria in an effort to see how far the country has come since its independence. Unfortunately, he is disappointed with what he sees.As oil revenues declined in the late 80s, Algeria's governing regime no longer had the funds to bolster its dreams of modernization. As a result, an increasingly disillusioned middle class (despite a rise in university degrees, there was little upward mobility as many of the prestigious jobs were still held by the French) turned to more extreme Islamist parties who promised to return Algeria to its "Islamic roots". The ideals of these extremists were at complete odds with the FLN (The Front De Liberation Nationale), the coalition of rebels we see defeating the French in the film. The FLN, though they relied on religious forces and symbols to mobilize the population behind the cause of independence, ultimately viewed religion from a utilitarian perspective, sufficient for mass mobilization but inadequate as a template for governance.So with faith in the FLN shattered, voters turned to more extreme parties, all of whom threatened to create a kind of totalitarian form of Islam. And it is this which Pontecorvo seems to fear the most. With the engineered destruction of Marxism-Lenism, fundamentalist Islam became the world's leading anti-American ideology. The US, ironically, has been the largest supporter of psycho Islamic movements. From their perspective, better psycho dictators in power, than actual egalitarian movements. So the Algeria Pontecorvo revisits seems to be one that has shut itself off from the world and become deeply suspicious of foreigners and non-Muslims. It is a country faced with many economic and social problems, suspicious of all "western styled" government models. (Pontecorvo's doc was made in the late 80s. Today Algeria has shrugged off its nationalist roots and embraced the free market)Of course Pontecorvo makes it clear in the documentary that there is a distinction between Islam (a religion) and fundamentalist Islam (an ideology). One can oppose the ideology while respecting the faith. Secondly, he stresses that meaningful change is always slow. When asked about women being forced to wear veils and the terrible economic problems in some areas, the director states that it will take decades of revolution for things to improve. The point he makes is not to interfere. To let people decide their own fate and forge their own national identities.8.5/10 ? Though its "documentarian" style lacks the power it once had, and though realist works always suffer from a certain directness (everything communicated bluntly, little to ponder or absorb after etc), this is a powerful and influential film. Pontecorvo followed "Algiers" up with "Burn!", an even greater picture. See Costa Gavras' "Z". Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>La Battaglia di Algeri!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had for a long time misgivings about "La Battaglia di Algeri". Even being one of the milestones of the political film, I thought that it employed the traditional means used by the genre, that is, "objectivity", speeches where people tell what they are fighting for, loads of facts, not forgetting to add some "human" element (maybe some romance, children , family, whatever..) to try to make the whole more digestible. But I was really mistaken! "La Battaglia di Algeri" is a sober but deeply moving film. It portrays the fight of the Algerian people against the french for their freedom. Even if the film tries not to take sides, it is clear from the beginning that the french (short of employing nazi or israeli tactics) were fighting a losing battle, because they were fighting against a rising nation.The film describes the first beginnings of the FLN (front of national liberation) in 1954, how it grows from a small group of people to an organized movement and eventually wins the Algerian people to their side. The escalation of violence on both sides - the FLN organizing terrorist attacks in restaurants, airport, on the streets, that leave many casualties and the french police and army replying with bombings, torture and trigger-happy shootings on the streets. After each french repression shock, singing, shouting and cries for freedom arise from the arab quarters. Women, children, peddlers, merchants, people old and new, are behind the FLN fighters and do everything they can to help in the war against the french.We follow the film through some characters on the Algerian and french side. There's no demonizing of either side. We can even understand Coronel Mathieu (commander of the french paratroopers) and his views.All in all it is an excellent film. I had a very hazy notion about the Algerian war for independence, and I didn't feel like reading a book and swallowing tons of facts in order to inform myself about the subject. Now I've got a living, emotional knowledge about it. Thanks to "La Battaglia di Algeri".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raises Too Many Questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It must be impossible today to discuss this film without branching out into broader political observations. The Battle Of Algiers may be more relevant today than it was in 1966, though the situations we face today are different to some degree, it's uncomfortably close to what we're seeing every night on cable news. This is one of those movies that everyone has heard about, but fewer have seen.Filmed in a neorealist semi-documentary style, which was striking in the '60s but less impressive today, the film has the feel of old news footage, and to modern audiences unused to such a look, it might be hard to distinguish. Besides the obvious visual style and lack of professional actors, American audiences would now, as they have in the past, find it difficult to respond to a film that does not offer a clear/cut black and white storyline. Though it makes somewhat of an effort to portray both sides, the filmmakers sentiments are clearly on the side of the Algerian national resistance movement. This is one area that might raise a lot of questions. Obviously the issue of Algerian independence and its struggle cannot be recounted in a 2, 3 or 10 hour movie and it would take about 1,000 interviews with players of both sides for an outsider like an American to form any type of semi valid opinion about the events.Lately the catchword in the U.S. is "I support the troops," though the ones who say it never can give a satisfactory response as to what it means. Supporting the Paras in Algeria obviously meant supporting their temporarily successful methods, that is, torturing suspects for information. For this film to make a statement on that it could have used more graphic scenes. The use of torture and savage methods by the French Army, while proving successful in Algiers, cost them the support of the French people and led to the downfall of the government, so it was a two edged sword which Americans should pay attention to. I think the entire issue should have been recounted here in more detail.While the subject matter is even more timely today, the film making style is not, but anyone interested in current events as well as the history of Arab nationalism and revolutionary movements would be interested in this. I especially liked the character of the colonel as played by Jean Martin, he portrayed an effective and decisive leader without resorting to any kind of cliché, and you could respect him no matter where your sentiments were, a character I wish we'd see more of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that, once seen, "La Battaglia di Algeri" cannot be forgotten. It's stark and horrifying images are forever imprinted on the mind.What's so utterly striking is that no documentary footage is used, only carefully staged scenes. Sometimes literally thousands of Algerian extras are employed--a remarkable feat for Director Gino Pontecorvo.Every shot here in this elaborate retelling of one of history's bloodiest battles rings true. The actors are remarkably real, and the black and white cinematography gives an authentic look and feel to every episode.I'm not sure just how accurate the politics are here (its being banned in France is notable) or exactly what statement Pontecorve is making. It seems to be pro-Algeria, and indeed the use of torture casts a shameful blemish on the French garrison.Still, one wonders what point of view the French have regarding this terrible conflict. In the end, one ponders what it's really all about. Ownership of a piece of land? This film undoubtedly prompted Marlon Brando to agree to work with this talented director in "Burn." The director's professional career seems as spotty and uneven as his film folio. In an interview Gino admitted to only making a film when he felt like it, even if years might pass in the interim."La Battaglia" remains the high point of his career, and a lasting contribution to the mock-documentary style in cinematic art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BATTLE OF ALGIERS (1966) So much has been said about this already and there are some excellent, insightful reviews on IMDb. But I'm here to urge anyone who's not seen this to do so, and soon, for four reasons: 1. The obvious relevance in 2006 - an Arab nation fighting against occupation (I mean Palestine as well as Iraq), vivid depictions of terrorist attacks and military torture, reminding us of what is going on every day in these countries. But also. . .2. The neutral viewpoint. As a work of cinematic art, Battle of Algiers distances its POV from the subject matter, leaving us to decide for ourselves, although it gives us plenty of emotional ammunition against either side. (In the reviews, this debate continues, 40 years on.) 3. Universality. Yes, you can watch this thinking about French colonies or the Iraq occupation, but the ethical questions it poses are relevant to any political struggle for freedom.4. It's exciting! In fact, I'm going to watch it again this afternoon. Long live Free Algeria! Long live cinema verité!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Algerian Independence Strugggle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers is about Algeria's brutal war of independence with France and it's more one-sided history lesson than entertainment. Gillo Pontecorvo's film was released in 1966 and provides a documentary-style portrait of events. The Algerian insurgents, the National Liberation Front ("FLN") are presented as heroic freedom fighters while the French are nasty and ridiculous.In 1954 the FLN begins a guerrilla war with the unsuspecting French authorities. The French retaliate and there is a curfew, searches, road-blocks and torture. The French try to break the resistance movement and ordinary Arabs are attacked in the street. The FLN then kill French civilians by planting bombs in bars and cafés. The film shows that ratcheting up the violence just begets more extreme violence from the other side.Many European countries faced similar conflicts as they were forced to abandon their colonies after World War II. As a Brit I'm familiar with the narrative of an unpopular foreign power deciding how much violence to use to put down an insurgency. The UK usually decided that it was better to get out than engage in a guerrilla war with a hostile local population. The movie gives the impression that the French had some difficulty in accepting that the world had moved on and their time as a colonial power was up. Ironically, Jacques Chirac, the French president who opposed the Iraq war, served as an officer in the conflict and was wounded in action. The film's sympathies are clearly with the FLN and the film's happy ending is independence in 1962. However since independence Algeria has often been violent and unstable. By 1976 the FLN had turned the country into a virtual one-party state and banned dissent. When elections resumed in 1991, the Islamic Salvation Front were the winners. This was unacceptable to the military and in 1992 a 10-year civil war began, with 160,000 deaths. Overall the film is disappointing as entertainment and the level of brutality involved makes it a depressing story. You would also be better served buying a book on the recent history of Algeria to get a more balanced understanding of the country's conflicts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb anti-war drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Battle of Algiers" is a film that everyone should see. It presents the historical account of the struggle of Algerian nationalists for independence from French colonists, and in doing so clearly displays the total futility of war. While not as renowned as "All Quiet on the Western Front" or "Paths of Glory", "The Battle of Algiers" is a better film in my opinion. Whereas some antiwar films rely on powerful speeches said by great heroes to portray their stance, "The Battle of Algiers" has no Paul Baumer or Colonel Dax. Neither Ali la Pointe, the leader of the independence movement, nor the French Colonel Mattheiu, who is in charge of the operation, ever states that what he is doing is wrong. Instead, we have only the shots of bodies, both French and Algerian, being carried away from the locations where bombs have gone off. The style of direction resembles that of a documentary, thus bringing about a more realistic feel. You won't find Kirk Douglas or Lew Ayres here. The result is that the characters don't seem larger than life. This is not a drama made by a Hollywood producer looking for an Oscar; but instead, it is a somber portrait of the futility of war. Add in Ennio Morricone's score, and you have a great film that is completely different from almost anything you will ever see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>as fitting a tip-of-the-hat to Rossellini's post-WW2 work made in the 60's, and them some</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of times here and there watching Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers, winner of the 1966 Golden Lion at Venice, I thought off-handedly (maybe with a smidgen of sarcasm), 'this is probably one of the top 5 favorite films of like Rage Against the Machine or something'. It's not without saying though that once the film was over, and watching a bit more on the extra features on the DVD (with other directors shining light on their opinions on the film), that most of what I saw sunk in a little deeper. This is one of the best kinds of documentary-style dramas made in its time and place in the world, and goes a bit further in the right direction from Roberto Rossellini's post-war trilogy. While it's not unlikely to see Pontecorvo's own influence from the neorealist maverick, it's also likely to see how Pontecorvo takes this very emotionally charged, as-factual-as-possible story of Algiers versus France in the mid 1950s with an assured balance of pathos and style. It also works tremendously as a kind of 'statement' movie, without at all pushing it down the viewer's throats. It does have a viewpoint, as do most films, and here and there it definitely does drive home the point of the Algiers' need for freedom from the militant oppression of France.But what struck me most about how Pontecorvo and his collaborators (both screenwriter and producer as the latter of which had complete first hand contact with the events and plays an acting part), is how he approached violence and its effect on an urban climate. Through Pontecorvo's camera, we see the ugly side to both sides, even the one that we should be rooting for. France is the (supposedly unintentional) oppressor here, and in this time frame had made them a colonial power for decades, and in order to sustain order and track down their 'targets' in 1957 they go from complete militarization (shown quite starkly and simply, and like a good would-be neorealist 'as it is if we are right there') to torture tactics. Their acts of violence and brutality are however given the other side of the coin in the scenes where the lieutenant Colonel of the French troops Matthieu (played by the great Jean Martin) talks to the press or lays out his point of view in scenes. Then the other side of the Algiers, those who are fighting back early on in the film with guerrilla-like terrorist tactics go to lengths to make their messages clear through seemingly random but daunting acts of violence. Pontecorvo's point in showing both sides is almost complex while seeming simple- neither side is right when it comes to committing violence against one another in this situation. It's a very powerful statement made that doesn't cut corners, of the truth that still permeates of a first-world power, already very adept in their military powers from past (proud) military conflicts who can't seem to let up from giving the people they say they want to help and provide some leeway in establishing their own government and freedom despite the fervent opposition. Sound familiar?At any rate, the real success behind this message- which could've been done on the flip-side with a lot of pumped melodrama- is by making it a kind of hybrid of doc and fiction. Unlike Memories of Underdevelopment, which would come out 2 years after this in Cuba, it's never exactly certain when the footage is even dramatized or not. And there are two aspects to what Pontecorvo covers in his purely cinematic style that totally serves his content. One is how he deals with crowds, with the dirty city life of the Arab section of Algiers where all the madness, chaos, and just frustration takes place, in range from the scenes of people walking by in burkas to reveal themselves as the "enemy" with guns, to those startling sequences of the revolutions and multi-militant post. The other one is how Pontecorvo deals with his 'subjects', as one might call them, as they are all save for one non-actors. Like directors before him (mentioned above) and after (like Fernando Meirelles) the filmmaker here is after the right look on people, and in going almost as a bystander at times getting these people. The guy playing La Pointe- the center of the film (an illiterate petty criminal turned major terrorist)- isn't particularly 'good', but he doesn't need to be. His face tells all. In maybe my favorite scene in the film, when a female from the Algiers section sneaks into a quasi-dance hall in the European section, we get various shots of the faces of the patrons as well as her own. None are professional, which obviously adds to the complexities of this scene. Who's innocent and who's guilty in this world? Sometimes there are some very brutal moments in the film, and then there are others that sometimes even work just as a usual, well, thriller. Here and there I almost felt like I was watching a more recent film without taking into account how it might have influenced a few directors over time. With one of his best early scores via Ennio Morricone, and some uncompromising details with the multiple deaths in the film, The Battle of Algiers does come quite close to being one of those 'essential' films of the 1960's, where a political attitude or need to put onto film a time and place in the world was captured. And if it has at least a little relevance for some military-style situations of the now (and I am not at all anti-US, but the comparisons could be made with bits in the film) its a credit to the filmmakers that its basically the film they wanted to make, with a freedom relatable to the doomed characters on the side of Algiers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The War in Algeria, like most revolutionary wars, was surely a tragedy for all concerned... for the Algerian people, for the French soldiers who fought and died bravely in yet another war they were not allowed to win, civilians on both sides whose lives were destroyed by the carnage and upheaval. This landmark film has the interesting distinction of being at once a propaganda piece and somewhat even-handed. Despite being commissioned by the Algerian FLN government, and certainly ultimately siding with the rebels, it presents the French commander Colonel Mathieu (a stand-in for real paratrooper commander Jacques Massu) in a sympathetic light, and the horror brought on by FLN bombings is in no way minimized. This film achieves a chaotic, tense feel that conveys the essence of the people's war in the Casbah. The characters, almost all of whom display some nobility, commit terrible acts against their enemies, and we see an almost chivalric battle of jaded, duty-bound warriors against fiery nationalist rebels. Above all, the film showcases how the French won the battle of Algiers military but lost the war politically.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When watching this film and watching news stories about Iraq, the are many similarities. This film presents no good guy or bad guy. Both sides hold a very unique position. The French who for 100+ years have laid claim to Algeria. The Algerians, who after 100+ years of French occupation have now decided they want liberation. The Algerians are laying claim to what is rightfully their's but has been in French hands for 100+ years. The French see the Algerians as trying to take something that has been rightfully theirs for 100+ years. Who is the bigger coward? The French who use military might to beat down on the Algerian populace (innocent and guilty)? The Algerians who plant bombs in public places frequented by the French populace (innocent and guilty)? The French who rob Algerians of civil rights? The Algerians who use and ambulance to attack civilians? The movie does not answer these questions, but it sure has me scratching my head after watching it. Very thought provoking film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There will probably never be a more compelling film about revolution than Battle Of Algiers, and if you haven't seen this masterpiece then run out and get a copy of the Criterion DVD. Part of what makes it so incredible is that it was shot in Algeria soon after the revolution with members of the revolutionary party in the development team and in the cast, so it's a narrative film with a documentary's realness. What makes the film so powerful is the city and the people itself, you can sense the anger and the hope. And strangely the film can even make you empathize with the most diabolical acts of terrorism. Now, is it as unbiased as everyone makes it out to be? I don't think so. I think it is pretty favorable to the revolutionaries. Even though it shows sympathetic characters on the side of the French colonial forces, the presentation is still weighted heavily on the side of the revolutionaries. Regardless, it is a marvelous film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a perfect docudrama with no equals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be a mistake to think that what you see in Battle of Algiers is an unbiased account of Algerian history, and it would probably be an even bigger mistake to use the events of this film as your sole guide for understanding, say, the US occupation of Iraq. That said, I think this is one of the best films ever made about the nature of war--why people fight, and what they become by fighting.The main topic of the film is nationalism, and the Algerian struggle to become a nation is its plot. The people of Algeria are the protagonists and Pontecorvo doesn't really conceal his sympathy for them. Nor should he, when you consider the history of oppression, exploitation and broken promises that characterized French rule.But even though the Algerians are the protagonists, they are not exactly the good guys. We are shown the deliberate and determined way in which they target civilians through acts of terrorism, and the way that they turn against their fellow Algerians when they won't join the struggle (or won't dress or act the way they are told to).Ultimately there are no good guys per se, and Pontecorvo is careful to show the brutality and the suffering of both sides of the conflict. Some of the French participants are portrayed as cardboard villains, but there are some subtler figures as well, particularly the French colonel who remarks that he dislikes Sartre, but "likes him even less as an enemy."The subjects being shot are all non-professional actors (with one exception) and frequently they are acting out a second time what they actually did in real life some few years earlier. Their simple presence on screen is powerful, and Potecorvo's way of seeing them combines grainy, documentary realism with astounding moments of visual poetry. There are shots in this film that have a magic Bresson would envy.The main gift this film gives to Western viewers is an opportunity to see struggling (and non-white, non-Western) nations as the heroes of their own story, rather than as bit players in a story about the triumph of the US and Europe. This point of view will be an invaluable one in the decades to come; we'll need it to make new allies, as well as to defend against new enemies. Battle of Algiers reminds us that the desire to create one's own destiny (or the destiny of one's nation) is a human quality and not an American one.If you couldn't care less about the politics, you can take Battle of Algiers as a complex portrait of human nature in the modern era: courageous and noble, but also brutal and ruthless. Or, if that's still too highbrow for you, just watch it as an exciting and realistic war movie that makes Saving Private Ryan look Hollywood fake by comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black-and-white cinematography as haunting as any fiction epic of the era - very interesting indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a new print of the celebrated documentary about the 1954?62 Algerian war of independence. Although made in 1965, the Pentagon screened it last year to demonstrate what soldiers might face during occupation of Iraq. And organisations like the Black Panthers have used it as a training video in guerrilla-style warfare.Co-writer and co-producer Saadi Yacef, who also stars, based the film on his experiences as the military leader of the Algierian FLN (National Liberation Front) during that time. Director Gillo Pontecorvo, who was heavily influenced by neorealist Italian director Rosselini, was also a communist activist during WWII.Despite their credentials, the film falls short of being propaganda. The Battle of Algiers is a black-and-white masterpiece, with scenes so realistic it is difficult to believe they were scripted and re-shot years after the war had ended, albeit in the same locationsPontecorvo pioneers the use of hand-held camera and other techniques to create immediacy. The score, by Ennio Morricone and Yacef, enhances the film, interweaving percussive themes with traditional Arabic melody. The cast is made up of Ali La Pointe (played by the charismatic Brahim Haggiag), an illiterate youth who becomes the revolution's posterchild, and military commander Ali Kader (Yacef). The only professional actor in the cast, Jean Martin, is Colonel Matthieu, the efficient, hardline head of the French paratroopers brought in to quell the uprising. This film will engage you, emotionally and intellectually. I left wanting to know more. ****/***** stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Algeria 1954-62: A history lesson on film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>******SPOILERS****** The place is Algiers, the time is August 26, 1957 and the person involved is Ali La Pointe an FLN, National Liberation Front, leader trapped in a building with his men and given an ultimatum to surrender by the French military or end up being killed.The movie then goes back some three years to All Saint's Day November 1, 1954 the start to the Algerian Revolt. Ali at that time 24 years old with a long criminal record is arrested and jailed for assault and while in prison he gets influenced by one of the inmates who's executed for being part of the revolt against the French occupying government. When he's released Ali joins the FLN and makes his way up in that organization from a spy to a soldier and then to a major leader of rebels attacking French troops and police in the Casbah section of the city of Algiers. The revolt grow from taking pot shots on the French police and military to all out attacks on dance halls restaurants bus and train depots where hundreds of French as well as Algerian civilian are killed and wounded. Also the scale of attacks on the French police and soldiers reach such a point that law and order becomes almost no-existent in Algiers as well as all of Algeria by 1957. The French government in desperation sends in it's most seasoned troops into the country to quell the revolt led by paratroop commander Col. Mathieu, Jean Martin, a WWII as well as a Indochina war hero. The French under Mathieu go about to put down the rebel revolt almost if not even more ruthlessly as the the FLN rebels which only turns more Algerians, who were neutral, against the French. Col. Mathieu's plan is to kill or capture all the top rebel leaders and with that accomplished he feels that the revolt would be extinguished and Ali La Pointe is one of those leaders that Col. Mathieu is looking to put out of commission. The torture of a FLN rebel pays off when he breaks down and leads to French troops under Col. Mathieu to the place where Ali is hiding and thats where we get back to the beginning of the movie. Refusing to surrender Ali and his men are blown to pieces when the French army dynamites the building that they are hold up in and with that Ali La Pointe's contribution to the Algerian revolt is over but not for those still fighting against the French.The movie goes into the early 1960's where the revolt got to the point where the French government, in a last and desperate effort to end the bloodshed, held an open election for Algerian independence in 1962 With the vote was 91% in favor of independence on July 5, 1962, the 132nd anniversary of the French entrance into Algeria, Algeria was proclaimed a free and independent nation and thus the bloody Algerian revolt ended. Great docudrama of one of the most defining event of the post WWII world without a single inch of actual news footage. The Algerian revolt lasted eight years and cost the French some 18,000 soldiers and 3,000 civilians The loss of life among the Algerian people was astronomical being estimated a around and even over one million dead. The Algerian revolt even spilled over into France proper itself and cost some 4,000 casualties in that country in terrorist and counter-terrorist attacks."The Battle of Algiers" is one of the best historical films, even though it has no news footage in it at all, ever made and is being re-issued this year, 2004, on VHS and DVD. With what's been happening in the news it's re-release couldn't be more timely,don't miss it. It will be an historical as well as emotional experience to everyone that sees it.</fullReview>

Real-life revolutionary Brahim Haggiag portrays the fictional Ali La Pointe with a subtle intensity. Unfortunately, many of the other non-professional actors fall short in capturing such intensity. But this detracts little from the film, which just produces one memorable scene after another, until the final scenes of revolution. The film actually does an excellent job of taking into account the complexities of the French occupation in Algeria as well. I can't recommend it enough.</fullReview>

This movie is as impartial and rationally thought-out as every movie should be. Instead in Hollywood we get Pearl Harbor and The Patriot. And soon Black Hawk Down. That one looks like a downer already. Terrorists aren't mere mobs of fanatics who don't have anything better to do. The soldiers fighting them aren't a bunch of patriotic morons who got drafted as they walked out of a war movie. And this movie masterfully reveals both. The direction is superb, and the footage is incredibly convincing--so much that the movie opens with credits emphasizing that news footage wasn't used in the making of the film. But what is even more gripping is the imagery that is used before terrorist acts and military raids--men, women, and children, families, lives about to be destroyed. Don't blink.

Inevitably, they command the lion's share of screen time, but Pontecorvo is no Michael Moore. When three bombs are set off by the terrorists (women who elude the checkpoints), we see their victims, both before and after detonation. Ali, the new recruit to the rebel cause, is hardly sympathetic; he is hatred personified, even if he has plenty to be hateful about. His mentor, Jaffar, is more charismatic, yet even he seems to know things will turn out badly for him. As for Colonel Mathieu, even he is not a conventional villain. Every move he makes is either ordered from Paris or the natural progression from what comes before. What's left, ultimately, are no true good guys or bad guys, no winners, just losers.

Pontecorvo is a maniac of physical resemblance between the actor who is playing the role and the real person in the story, because of that the movie looks like a documentary which tell us the suffering of the algerian people during the french colonial period and their fight for independence, especially in the battle of Algiers which is one of the most important battles in the liberation war. After 130 of occupation and many political attempts to get algerian independence peacefully, the algerian people get just more killed and more suffering!! Some people have to be careful to compare that war for independence with terrorism ..etc . You have to read history to understand!We have seen in the movie when the french started bombing civilians in the casbah (this is real terrorism) which was the beginning of series of attacks between the two parts. I'm algerian and my parents and relatives lived in Algeria that time, I can tell you, you have to live it to know what's occupation, war and suffering! and I think what I saw in "the battle of Algiers" is worst!. I especially admire Larbi Ben M'hidi which is one of the most important leaders of the algerian liberation revolution, a man who has a good vision , who believed in the freedom of Algeria and sacrificed himself for it, even the french who tortured him, they recognized his incredible courage and that he is a rare person.The DVD is available now, you have to see it, there are many extra and many reactions/opinions of many people, Yassef Saadi, Pontecorvo, ex-french soldiers and officials , American officials..etcGood movie :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers is a controversial film about the struggle of Algerian rebels to throw off French occupation. The film depicts the guerrilla tactics of the Algerian insurgency as well as the French counter-insurgency designed to contain and squash the rebellion. Shot in a documentary/newsreel style, the film follows several narrative threads, and takes us inside the command structures on both sides of the conflict. The film ironically points out that the French commander was part of the resistance against the Nazis, and now he's in the role of the occupier, using his knowledge of resistance against those struggling for freedom. Though The Battle of Algiers has a natural back and forth rhythm, showing attacks by one side and then counter attacks by the other, in the end the film's conscience sides with the Algerians struggling for independence and against colonialism. Even though both sides are shown committing acts of violence against civilians, leading some to believe the film is being objective and neutral, the film gives a clear sense of purpose to the Algerians and celebrates their ultimate victory, even though they lose the battle portrayed in the film. As a result The Battle of Algiers was banned in France for 5 years, and the film stands as a powerful depiction of revolutionary struggle against foreign occupation, as well as the lengths colonial powers will go to in order to maintain their empires.</fullReview>

It is ineffably exciting, dynamic and truthful, a film worthy of the name "classic."</fullReview>

It shows that both the French forces and the Algerian revolutionaries committed unseemly acts: the French tortured Algerians, while the Algerians killed French civilians.Obviously, this should draw attention to colonialism in general. There can be no doubt that every colonial power has committed atrocities against the colonized peoples, right up to the present. Admittedly, the independence movements might see no option other than to use extreme methods in the hopes of getting the colonizers out of their countries. Whatever the case, the movie definitely makes you think about that. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

Pedro wanders the streets of his desolate village, making friends with local thugs and is openly abandoned by his mother who conceived him out of a rape. Bunuel effectively creates a character that has no redeeming qualities until he lands in the hands of a caring principal who runs a rehabilitation center. Near the pinnacle of "The Forgotten Ones," Pedro finds himself on a path to possible self-actualization. While in the confines of "the farm," Pedro fosters goodness that lives within. He's sent on an errand for the caring principal outside the confines of the rehabilitation center, and it is at this point that Bunuel sends the strongest message: we are victims of our society ? at least some of us are; others simply stand by and witness the raping of salvation, which is one of the more poignant scenes.

		<shortDescription>Battle of Algiers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering that none of the actors in the movie are professional, except Colonel Mathieu, Gillo Pontecorvo did a wonderful job shooting this film as if it was a documentary. It was very tolerable to watch. In this movie, the civil unrest between the French and Algerians was a tragic one. Many innocent people had to die as each group set out bombs in the Kasbahs and French cafés. No one deserved it and yet it happened because they both wanted to retaliate with each other. After watching this movie, I was appreciative to learn about the history of Algeria and France, but I felt indifferent on who was at fault. I though both the Algerians and French had a part in the unrest and they took it out on each other through violence. I was neither on the Arab side nor was I on the French side and the director of the film director made this movie just that...unbiased and to simply raise awareness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of Battle of Algiers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie, I felt an emotional disconnect. I had no empathy for the plight of the Algerians because the movie made very little attempt to show their plight. You are thrown some facts about Algerians being unhappy with French rule, given a flavor of their mistreatment at the checkpoints, but beyond that, one sees little of what is causing the unrest and cannot make an emotional connection with the characters. In fact, for me, the main character was not likable. At the end of the movie when it states that the Algerians won their independence, it is a purely intellectual process where you think, "that's good," and have zero emotional response. On the other hand, you wonder why the Algerians chose violence as the first resort instead of a peaceful strike, and you are left with a feeling of disdain at the barbaric nature of their resistance. Violence should always be the last resort and should only be in self defense. Of course, one could argue that the French placed the first bomb, but that was a rogue bomb placed for the sole purpose of inciting the Algerians to violence so that the French would respond in kind. For me, the takeaway is the age old message that two wrongs do not make a right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>personal reflection on the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie is out there and reveals just about everything that happened between the Algerians and the French. The portrayal of all the characters made the story very interesting with all the guerilla warfare. The overall story was easy to understand and realize that the French were not right in everything they were doing; along with that, the Algerians had the correct concept in getting the French out of their country but their method was a little outrageous. Like most occurrences with two or more countries occupied in one country, similar things happen and the native country tends to take more drastic measures that sometimes end up working to their advantage, but unnecessary measures were took. As all war or fighting, people become greedy and it happened in the instance with Algerians and the French.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was exciting going into the screening of this film but I found myself bored and drifting in and out of focus. This film has a reputation for being groundbreaking but I had trouble getting into it and struggled to stay engaged. I'm not sure if was the subtitles or the fact it was black and white but I found myself daydreaming on more than a few occasions. The few parts I do remember, such as the final scene where they are in the hidden room, were good so I may need to give the film a second viewing to see if I can discover how this film got it's reputation. Until then I can't say I enjoyed it much but there was enough there to give it another shot. Perhaps after a few cups of coffee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an awesome film we watched in my Film Studies Class. I learned about the French Colonization of Algeria, which I never studied before. This is one of those educational films that can be mistaken for a documentary. One could be fooled that there is no stock footage whatsoever in this movie. Director Pontecorvo was very successful in creating a Neo-Realism classic. The tone of the movie is a balance between rational for resistance and rational for colonization. There is no controversy, but plain historical facts. A nice change from all the controversy in the media. What an excellent movie to show in History classes worldwide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers is an interesting look into what a group fight for freedom must look like. What I found strange about the film is how the French were not really looked at as if they were devils, to me they were more portrayed as disappointed fathers. I also credit the director and producers for not portraying the Algerians as the most sacred creatures on the planet. The film was well done and seemed to be a fairly accurate portrayal of what it must be like to watch an urban guerrilla war take place. Now keep in mind if one is looking for a feel good, the good guys always win this is not the film to watch. It is brutal and in your face, which is awesome considering the subject matter.

		<shortDescription>Blueprint For the United States Future?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, films in foreign language with sub-titles are not something I'd watch. I am sure glad I watched this one. The film is based upon a true story.The story is of the French trying to hold on to their colony in Algeria in the late 1950's &amp; early 1960's. The French keep trying the entire film to stomp out resistance in Algeria. It had been their colony for 130 years.Once the seed of independence is planted, no matter what the French do, their cost in troops &amp; civilian deaths &amp; destruction keep getting higher &amp; higher. Considering the French have already paid a heavy price in Vietnam during this same period of history, you can understand in the end why they lost this one later. The French finally consider the cost of fighting this Algerian Independence movement too high. The scenes of torture in the film are so realistic &amp; the scenes of violence &amp; riots in the streets are so real, that you think the film makers were using real news reel footage in this film. It is amazingly, all staged.A lot of the parallel issues are here with our current dilemmas with Iraq, Afghanistan, &amp; Kosovo. We are considering that these costs are too high to bear in our media. The mistake here is that the reasons are different. It is our medias hate of the current President that is fueling this hate. We are not attempting to make colonies here like the French were in Algiers. Still, this film does bring us into some interesting parallel issues. It is well worth viewing &amp; an extremely well made film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique film, and one that everyone should see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Battle Of Algiers documents the Algerian peoples fight for independence from the French in the 50's and 60's. Heavily inspired by the Italian neo-realist movement, Director Pontecorvo used hundreds of non-actors and shot the entire film on location. This all adds to the documentary like photography with which the account is presented, setting it apart from all other war films, imbuing the action with a shocking sense of realism comparable to a news report of a real terrorist demonstration. Despite being a docu-film on the Algerian insurrection against the French, a conflict that has long been resolved, the film still remains extremely significant today, particularly due to the current American occupation of Iraq.Although I enjoy and appreciate more mainstream war films such as Apocalypse Now and Platoon, The Battle Of Algiers uncovers the pointlessness of conflict and the harsh repercussions of it, like no other war film I have seen. Taking a deliberately impartial stance, the torture based methods of interrogation employed by the French troops are juxtaposed with the violent terrorist attacks of the Algerians. This powerfully illustrates the destruction caused by both sides, and how their tactics, although different in nature, are united in their ugliness and betrayal of humanitarian values, causing nothing but death and suffering. In this respect, the film documents like no other the sad foolishness of trying to solve conflicts with violence, causing maximum loss on both sides, perpetuating conflict rather than preventing it. The Battle Of Algiers is also instrumental in emphasising how the actions of an extremist group using violent methods, can result in a racial hatred of an entire ethnic minority. This occurrence resonates powerfully across western civilisation in a supposedly enlightened 21st century, where hundreds of innocent civilians are labelled as potential terrorists because of a select few who choose to cause destruction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They don't make 'em like this anymore... "Spoilers"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Warning - Possible Spoilers" - First off, the fact that I had never heard of this movie until a couple of months ago when I was told about it is amazing. I say this because of a passion for war movies.Off I went then, from website to website in search of as much information on Battle as could've been mustered. Alas, it took only the short synopsis provided by one particular website to convince me that this is something I must have. A rare type of movie, an insightful piece of film-making by one of the last passionate directors of our time and pure cinematic power are truths that best describe Battle.The movie essentially involves the struggle of the Algerian people from the early fifties thru 1962 for independence. This struggle became organised through the formation of the "FLN" or National Liberation Front (the abbreviation might be French). The other part of the story details the involvement of one of NLF's martyrs, Ali La Pointe, an Algerian mason hoodlum turned war hero. The situation in Algeria was tense and often horrific even after the assistance they lent the French army in WWII to drive out the Germans from France and other French territories. The Algerians were obviously hoodwinked into believing that independence lay in store for them as reward for their wartime sacrifices. They couldn't have been more wrong. The French continued with their occupation and administration of Algeria only to further alienate the Algerian people. The best jobs, homes and clubs, for instance, were for the French. In addition the Casbah, a remnant part of Turkish times, growing more populated with time and fast becoming an inner city contributed to deteriorating standards of life. Mad with disgust, the Algerian people responded through the resourcefulness and determination of Saadi Yacef, also the producer and main supporting actor of Battle, to form the NLF to recruit freedom fighters. Ali, whilst in prison for a petty crime, is taken by the NLF's struggle and after acing a test in courage and resolve put upon him by Saadi, joins the organization. Thus begins the mayhem. The NLF executing French police at random, the French responding by bombing the Casbah, the NLF using Algerian beauties to plant bombs in French public places, simply represents the first half of the film. Enter the French 10th Airborne Division under one Lt. Colonel Matthieu, paratroopers who had ousted the Germans from most of France and seen many other battles. The paratroopers carry out torture on interrogation victims, impose curfews, screen Algerian people on the streets, raid the Casbah at will and are responsible for some Algerians ending up missing. All this isn't without any humour though, as Matthieu, asked by his CO to name the operation, looks out the window through field glasses suddenly seeing an ad for champagne and deciding to name it "Operation Champagne". The humour is short lived though, as Mattieu takes the city by storm rooting out one terrorist after the other, whilst suffering casualties of course, until he finally nabs Saadi. This then leaves for the climax of Ali being cornered in a hideout with a few other loyalists at which point none refuse to surrender. The film then continues to depict the ongoing fight which lasts some 4-5 years before Algeria is officially declared independent in 1962.The film's contrasts between light and the dimness of the Casbah heighten the sense of dread. Scenes of rioting crowds couldn't have been more realistic bearing in mind Pontecorvo's insistence that no documentary footage was used. Explosions actually go off in public places causing what appears to be genuine mayhem. Never have I had a lesser respect for CGI animation when stark realism was the order of the day. The acts of terrorism, insurgency and counter-insurgency are so mercilessly depicted that these scenes hold relevance till today. Suffice it to say that this film is one of the most brutal tellings of the quintessential struggle of an oppressed people for liberty.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best revolutionary epic ever made! **** out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply the best revolutionary epic ever made. It got 3 Oscar nominations and the top prize in Venise festival. Even the Pentagon screened it in 2003 to study how revolutionary movements start and see how they develop.The movie relates the algerian revolution and the struggling attempt of its people to free their land from occupying France, it is surprisingly unbiased, it simply tells us what happened without emphasizing neither the french or the algerian people, victims of both terrorism and counter-terrorism.The movie has a documentary feel to it, which gives it more impact since it is based on a true story. There are some memorable dialogues in the movie, including the one involving the press with Colonel Mathieu, and especially the dialogue between Ali Lapointe and another terrorist where they discuss the meaning of their acts. In fact, Terrorism is simply the way poor oppressed people respond to a much stronger oppressor. Many people tend to forget it. Terrorists aren't just some crazy and sadists lunatics with dynamite belts. They fight for -most of the time- very legitimate causes.This is a must-see for any history or film buff. Hopefully it will get the attention it deserves after the criterion release on September 2004.</fullReview>

Riots look real. The bombings has tons of non-stunt people being thrown around. The film is taunt with suspense. Just a pitch perfect political thriller I am hard pressed to think of a better one.Spoilers*****The fact that the pentagons have watched this movie shows that they really did understand a few of the points being made.

		<fullReview>The starkest and most effective piece of military history I have ever seen on film. Watching this at my university cinema, I was electrified and quite unable to move as the terrible, entirely true story was honestly told. Despite being a state funded effort, this film shows both the French colonial forces and the Arab opposition with utter honesty. It never shirks from the terrible brutality shown and the suffering inflicted by both sides.Interestingly it is the French commanding officer, Colonel Mathieu, who stands out as the closest this film gets to having a 'hero'. His methods are often extremely cruel (electrocution and suffocation are some of his more memorable interrogation techniques), but his leadership is unquestionable and both his men and his enemies have a huge respect for him. In light of the atrocities committed by both sides, it is Mathieu who commands the audience's sympathy.As a study of the politics behind the Algerian war this film reveals little other than on an emotional and personal level. As a study of counter insurgency warfare and military leadership it is exemplary. It is also the most balanced political film I have ever seen.Truly remarkable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Battle of Algiers is a war film based upon occurrences in the eight-year Algerian War against French colonial rule in North Africa. There were many scenes that were a little hard to watch because of all the people that were killed in the bombings while living their everyday lives. It was interesting to see how many men and women join together to seek revenge against another group. The director cleverly uses imagery to make the viewers see the insight of a terrorist mind. The attacks and battles are insane among one another, accusations towards the innocent. It was an interesting film to watch if you enjoy battle and war films. I personally don't do well in sitting still in these type of films but I did understand what the director portrays. I only recommend this film if you enjoy learning about history and wars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Astonishing and Authentic Examination of Terrorism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, "The Battle of Algiers" really could have been made today, couldn't it? I don't know if I should be comforted or disturbed that the events depicted in Gillo Pontecorvo's film so closely mirror those going on in the Middle East right now. On the one hand, it's comforting to realize that events and tensions that seem scary in the present day have been going on virtually forever, and that every generation has probably thought at some point that the world they lived in represented the human race at its lowest point. But on the other hand, it's disturbing to think that the same patterns have been repeating themselves for ages and we as a race just keep making the same blunders over and over again."The Battle of Algiers" chronicles in near documentary fashion the struggle of the Algerian Muslims against the imperialist French rule in the 1950s. Overwhelmed by the might and resources of the French military, a rebel group of Algerians resort to terrorist tactics to make themselves heard. Stuck in the middle are the everyday Algerian and French citizens, who die in bombings and attacks perpetrated by both sides, and are fed propaganda explaining how each side is working in their best interests.There's a scene mid-way through the film in which a French military commander lectures a gathering on the personalities and philosophies of terrorist cells. He explains the terrorist cell structure, and how the best way to kill the cell is to cut off its head. Sound familiar? Pontecorvo's film is engrossing, and one that will always (sadly) be relevant. His sympathies obviously reside with the Algerians -- the film ends with images of an Algerian uprising that occurred two years after the main events depicted in the movie, with Algerian people celebrating in the streets, waving flags and shouting cries of "freedom," "liberty" and such. But we do see the human cost and dubious morality of terrorist warfare, and the film fairly showcases the brutality inflicted by both groups."The Battle of Algiers" has an astounding authentic quality to it that makes it almost impossible to believe that this is a fictional film and not a documentary.Grade: A</fullReview>

Every scene was staged for the film, and every detail choreographed; even the bright sunlight of Algiers was softened with white sheets.

		<shortDescription>The 30 Greatest Films Ever Made, Continued</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(part of 30 essays I am writing on the 30 greatest films of all time. They are written in no particular order) One thing that is amazing about La Bataglia d'Algeri (or The Battle of Algiers) is how amazingly well it lures you into caring so much exactly what happens to its Muslim Revolutionaries while giving them little to no screen time. The main character "Ali La Pointe" hardly says anything throughout the entire film, but we sit on the edge of our seats wondering what will happen to him next.The film was made by Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo, with the enormous cooperation of the Algerian government. Pontecorvo also hired Italian composer Ennio Morricone for scoring the film's music, which is based on traditional Muslim folk songs (Pontecorvo had been impressed with Morricone's score for "A Few Dollars More") One of the main actors of the film, Saadi Yacef, essentially played himself under a different name, and was also the one who wrote the autobiographical book on which the film was based. The film was shot in documentary style black and white, hand-held looking. One of the more amazing things about this film is that not a single bit of documentary or newsreel footage was used in this film, which the credits points out. Its almost hard to believe the whole film isn't a documentary. You see shots of bombs going off at derby's that look so realistic you wonder how dangerous they are.The film was nominated for Oscars for best director, screenplay, and foreign film. It also won the FIPRESCI prize and Golden Lion at the Venice film festival. It was banned in France upon its release (surprise!) It was screened for the Pentagon's staff in 2003 because of its uncanny parallels to the current War in Iraq.The film follows, from 1954 to the liberation of Algeria, the attempts by the native Muslims, who are confined to their own quarter (the "Casbah"). Racism against Muslims and those of darker skin is incredibly high in Algeria, one of the films most disturbing scenes involves a shooting of a police officer. Tenants of an apartment building poke their heads out of the windows, hearing the sirens, and point at a random old Muslim beggar (who did not commit the crime) and yell "it's him! it's him!" soon it seems everyone on the street is screaming at him, yelling racial epithets, pointing at him. Terrified, the man runs for his life and is arrested by a passing police car. Reading a report on him, the police chief takes some friends with him and plants a bomb outside his wife's house in the Casbah. The blast kills many people, and the Muslim's retaliate. Three women disguise themselves as Westerers to get past the check point. Another one of the more chilling scenes involves the women, each carrying a bomb in their hand baskets, examining their would be victims. A child eating ice cream? A bunch of teenagers dancing to pop music? Relatives visiting some friends in Algeria? The film does lean towards the Muslims, probably justly so. But is mostly a non biased film that manages to play its mournful theme on the bombing of a Western café as well.Eventually the paratroopers are brought in to crush the opposition, and the character of Colonel Mathieu is played by the only major French actor who would work on this film, Jean Martin. Martin mostly acted on stage, this was his first major film role. He was strongly against the French in Algeria and cheerfully agreed to do this film. He plays a chilling character perfectly, carefully avoiding the use of the word "torture" so his methods of interrogation don't sound too harsh.Ever since the War in Iraq this film came out in a special 3 disc special edition DVD set, digitally remastered by Rialto, along with a booklet describing the history of the actual revolution and the making of the film. It's definitely worth buying. And the film is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A phenomenal film about the struggle for independence in Algeria. Similar to current events!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Battle of Algeria (1965) was a great film documenting the story of the struggle of freedom fighters who jump started the road to independence for the native people of Algeria. For years, Algerians were denied their own self identity under French colonial rule. The people were impoverished and lacked self confidence. A group of underground rebels wanted to change all that so they waged a guerrilla war against the French occupiers. Although the rebels were eventually crushed and wiped out, the people never forgot their bravery. A few years later, the French eventually left Algeria for good.The movie is not about the success of the freedom fighters. Sure they were crushed but their spirit live on. The oppressed natives rose and drove the French out. Many directors have copied from this film either style wise or certain scenes (check out the eighties flick RED DAWN, the later half of that movie was lifted from BATTLE OF ALGERIA.) The director shot this movie as a docu-drama. You'll feel for the street thug turned freedom fighter. At first glance he seems like a ordinary punk trying to save his own skin. But you get to see his transformation on screen. You'll also feel for the French general, he sympathizes with the enemy because he too was partisan during W.W.II (a theme also found in RED DAWN). The politics of this movie are pretty much left of center. People have criticized this film for glorifying a group a radical extremist Muslims turn there country into a back word country. But you must realize the director is more concerned about the idea of freedom and self identity. Repression is no fun. People should not be colonized by those who perceive themselves to be "saviors" or enlighten persons of the cloth. There was no reason why France held on to Algeria for so long. First Viet-Nam then Algeria. The empire of Napoleon III was slowly eroding away.If you love films by Costa-Gavras, Oliver Stone or Peter Watkins then you'll want to do yourself a favor and watch this brilliant movie. You wont regret it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last time I saw this film was in college many, many years ago.I had forgotten how great it was, from the magnificent Ennio Morricone soundtrack (that haunting Casbah theme is incredible) to the unsentimental characterizations. And as for characterizations I am certain the heroic Soviet Spetznaz commander in "Red Dawn" was a direct steal from Col. Mathieu. The 60's Black Panthers should have seen this movie. Before taking on the French, the FLN first destroys the criminal underworld in the Casbah, the pimps and drug dealers and junkies. As a practical matter, these people are riddled with police informants and they must be destroyed/silenced. Ali La Pointe, who used to be a petty hustler, must kill his old friends. The Panthers talked big but had they moved first against the drug dealers, they would have built a real political base that would have made it harder to destroy them. And made it not quite so easy to infiltrate and destroy them.</fullReview>

Saddam Hussein was supported by the Pentagon in his war against Iran.Now the US intends to expand its empire.But there is resistance - which takes many forms - not just terrorist bombs.Serious questions arise:Will the oil in Iraq be controlled by Iraqis for the benefit of the Iraqi people ? Will the US government vacate its military bases in the region ? Will international corporations give up control of the economy of Iraq ? Will Iraqis be able to choose their own political system ?If the answer is no - then the occupying powers may end up paying for their war crimes.Just like the French (military) did in Algiers, as shown in "The Battle of Algiers"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mother was in Algeria, at this time, with her family (They are french). It is a shame to see that after all those years nobody ever talked about the french people there at this time. It was awful for the french people there. Before the Independence, everything was fine. Algerians had jobs, food, infrastructures, water... My mother was a young girl at this time, with 2 brothers... When the war started, french civilians living in Algeria, were killed by the Algerians, and didn't get any kind of support from the french government. Actually there is been a massive killing of french people, and the french army received the order not to move to help them. Algerians people were walking down the streets with the head of french people on spikes. Other were catching french men, cutting their sex and sew it in the mouth. Then when finally my family received the order to go back to France, they left everything in Algeria, memories, house, clothes, money, youth, and were allowed to travel with a luggage. They arrived in Marseilles, people were spitting on them, and they had to build their life again. Algeria is the richest and biggest country in Africa, but still, Algerians keep on immigrating in France, because their country is one the poorest in Africa. There are no jobs, no money, no democracy. French cemetery have been desecrated. Algerians do not take advantages of their resources (Gas, Agriculture). And every year, the French Government gives Algeria, huge amounts of money, otherwise the situation is Algeria would be way worse. For people who were in Algeria during the war (like my grandpa who died couple of years ago), they died without having the satisfaction of knowing that somebody cared what happened to them, or listened to what they had to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold, brutal and hard to connect with</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with films like The Battle of Algiers is that while they offer a stark portrait of a true-life event, they also lack any kind of emotion and so connecting with the film is not easy. The film follows the events of the revolution in Algiers, but doesn't give you much of a story as to why it happened and so prior knowledge of the event is required from the viewer. I know practically nothing about Algiers, so this wasn't a very good aspect of the movie for me; and through it's lack of emotional connection; I can't help but think I'd have been better off watching the news or a documentary on the subject. The Battle of Algiers is unpleasant throughout, and we watch as coffee shops are blown up and the French Foreign Legion tortures the locals. Like Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, this film begs a question of it's viewer - namely, why are you watching this? However, while Henry had the whole 'slasher' craze on it's side to help answer the question - the events in this film are far more brutal than those in Henry, and are also on a far larger scale. Not to mention far more tragic, as they definitely did actually happen. Couple this with it's lack of an emotional side; and we have the question; indeed, why ARE you watching this? It's not entertainment, that's for sure.The cinematography is very bleak and offers a stark portrayal of the events that the film is depicting. This is the film's major strong point - it looks very nice. None of the cast stands out individually, but the ensemble comes together nicely and the acting is extremely realistic, so much so that what is being depicted could easily be documentary footage. The main backbone of the film's substance focuses on the common 'war has no winners' theme that a hundred films have depicted before and after it; except even this is brought down by it's emotional void. While films such as Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front gave you characters to feel for; The Battle of Algiers has none and even though it's message is still felt, it's not as potent as it could, and by rights should, have been. Due to the current state of the world, most notably the current mood in the USA, The Battle of Algiers can easily be used as a benchmark to draw parallels with nowadays, which in a way has given it a new lease of life in today's society. On the whole, I respect this movie for it's technical achievement and the fact that it offers an unbiased account of an important event in history. But I don't like it.</fullReview>

The characters delivered a good performance however, because there were many characters it was first difficult to familiarize with the characters in the beginning.I think the film did a good job of presenting to the audience the message and meaning of the film. I enjoyed the ending because it kept the audience questioning after the end of the film in discussion. The film was nicely put together and the style of the film made it peculiar in a way where it was unpredictable of what would happen next and kept the audience on the edge of their seats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps it was the black and white, or the content, but this film was just not for me. I struggled to stay awake during the film,( though that might have been due to a long week and too much to do). I could not relate to it in any way, and, in my opinion, films should be relatable. In addition, it was difficult to watch the violence. The story did not interest me, as most other historical films do. It was meant for an audience that did not include me. Though the film is made documentary-style, there was no actual footage from the riots shown. This is especially interesting because of how real everything looks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first came across this film while researching on terrorism for an honors undergraduate course. After viewing the film, I later decided to review it at length.Originally released in 1966, Gillo Pontecorvo's film graphically depicts the Algerian urban uprising against the French colonial administration. It is filmed in black and white, in the form of a semi-documentary. Considering the subject matter, it remains astoundingly non-partisan while striving for objectivity -which it attains. There are striking similarities between the film and recent events in the American-led war on terror. As a matter of fact, this film portrays the inherent paradoxes of terrorism in such a clear way that one can only wish that it captivated a wider audience -particularly among policy-makers. The boundaries between freedom-fighter and terrorist are cleverly blended leaving it up to the viewer which side to pick. This is no Hollywood flick so the moral choice is not served to us on a silver platter. Both sides are guilty of war crimes.Naturally the film works on many levels and will certainly be enjoyed by the film buff as well as anyone interested in wider political issues. The soundtrack deserves specific mentioning, coming as it does from the maestro Ennio Morricone himself.The film gives an inside account of the tough decisions policy-makers are forced to make on a daily basis when it comes to foreign occupation. Sensitive viewers beware: this film contains gritty violence that carries a sense of realism that will remain with you for days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rather Forgettable Piece of Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in Algeria in September of 1966, this war film was made for a budget of $800,000. While box office figures are currently unknown, the film did very well critically, being considered one of the greatest political films of all time. The slow paced 120 minute story follows a group of revolutionaries in the 1950's, a time when fear and violence grow, leading up to a fight where the people of Algiers fight for independence from the French government. In my eyes, this was solely a propaganda film, and I found nothing special about the performances of the actors. Director Gillo Pontecorvo isn't completely incompetent, however, as most of the film utilize a newsreel/documentary style. This unique take is an interesting perspective taken by cinematographer Marcello Gatti. This is still a rather bland looking black-and-white film that isn't completely exciting. Individual monologues are worth a curious listen, but there's nothing in the film that wants me to root for the main character, who is nothing more than a low life street urchin. The very believable events are portrayed in this film with great accuracy, and the set are authentic, thanks to its choice of location, mostly being filmed at the Casbah. Overall, however, this is a rather forgettable piece of propaganda film that may only appeal to world history buffs. I, however, found the style of filming cool enough to score this an ALRIGHT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelous Propaganda!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I said, this is great propaganda, but not *perfect* propaganda. Perfect propaganda works on you without you realizing its propaganda. "Pan's Labyrinth" is perfect propaganda. However, the weaknesses of this movie as propaganda is also its strength as a movie. The French audience was fairly well familiar with the atrocities of the FLN (the Algerian rebels) so the filmmakers couldn't just not address that as would be ideal. They still manage to soft-pedal the atrocities of the FLN against Arab Algerians and secular Muslims without ignoring them entirely. The hinted at religious extremism of the FLN probably works against the movie's intended cause more today than it did in 1966. And while the filmmakers cleverly play-up class differences between the European Quarter and the Casbah, and imply that the FLN only started targeting civilians randomly after the cops did it first, it doesn't *quite* the justify the bomb attacks in infidel sites such as bars and dance halls when the camera lingers so long on the faces of the young people and children.In short, the film is as likely to justify for the viewer the eventual use of torture to end insurgency as it is to horrify the viewer. That was certainly my reaction.But the filmmakers inability to totally ignore horrific side of the insurgency -- the side beyond any attempt of romanticization -- is what makes this story so believable. You will probably feel more ambivalent about the end of this movie than the filmmakers intended. That's why it is still so watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film is, in fact, biased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this film for a class and was flabbergasted when i saw that some poor moviegoer out there had been deceived into believing Pontecorvo's film about the Algerian revolution was unbiased. While this is a testament to the director's ability, i felt it necessary to explicate the situation more fully for anyone who might stumble upon this account of the film and watch it under the impression that it is an objective presentation of historical events rather than a subjective interpretation of those events. Naturally, this film sides with the underdog FLN freedom fighters and highlights their terrorist strategies. While i understand that many western viewers believe that any film that portraying french unfavorably must be unbiased, i would say that this film is structured to manufacture an unfavorable opinion of the French in any viewer. While i would personally be inclined to side with the underdog Algerians anyway (French history itself is an indictment of colonialism), everyone must recognize bias for what it is. just wanted to clear that up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's easy to see whence this derived so much of its cinematic power: from pure unflinching realism. But more than that, from clever construction of the visual narrative using hand-held footage within moving vehicles (presaging "The French Connection") and the analysis through 'surveillance' cameras.In terms of what we demand from film today, this is all quite retro. Its ideas have long since been absorbed into mainstream film -- recent topical examples include "Red Dawn" and "The Siege". Today, we expect a narrative game with the viewer; there's none to be had here, just an ugly reminder of the end days of European colonialism.Unfortunately, historical revisionists seize on this as 'evidence' of Western hegemony and injustice - as if Islam never occupied and forced into dhimmitude major tracts of Europe for centuries. Or as if Islam never harried Mediterranean Christians and enslaved them in vast numbers (Americans, too, among them - remember our war with the Barbary coast over this issue - enshrined in the 'shores of Tripoli' from the Marines' Hymn). Or as if armed intervention wasn't necessary to decisively turn that tide in the West's favor. The fact that Europeans/Americans can criticize themselves in film, but Arab Muslims will never direct criticism at themselves speaks to the deeply inherent cultural superiority of the West, and tends to make us stronger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very good but oddly filmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a documentary-like film about the Algerian revolution against the French in the 1950s and 60s--though 95% of the movie is set between 1956 and 1957. At first, it appears to be a documentary-like film about a revolutionary named Ali Le Pointe. It follows him episodically from his teenage years, to his joining the FLA (the Algerian Independence group) and follows many of his terrorist exploits as well as those of his compatriots. However, despite this being the focus, the film then diverges towards other characters and even after Ali's death, the film continues--giving spotty accounts all the way up until their independence in 1962. While the film is greatly admired and it does seem to show both sides of the equation, it looks as if the film was made by two or more directors and then pieced together, as the focus and style of the film changed repeatedly. While this doesn't undermine its overall impact, this keeps it from being a truly great film.Also, and this is definitely a politically charged opinion, I had a bit of a hard time watching this film. While the French (and British and others) were dead wrong to establish colonial empires, the organizations that in many instances replaced these empires scares the life out of any thinking person. Also, no matter how noble the cause, so many innocent people were murdered it makes you wonder if it was all worth it or was it just a chance for nihilists to kill for the sake of killing?</fullReview>

Something I could appreciate was that no actual documentary footage was used in this film, but some scenes sure felt very real in a way that put the viewer right in the middle of the action. Based on the Algerian revolution of 1962. But the grit and grim of this film never brought me to sympathize for the rebel Algerians. I never managed to be won over by the "others". At least not whilst bombing innocent civilians. I felt no remorse for any of the fugitives and therefore couldn't find myself enjoying this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pro French bias in the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the film tries very hard to be neutral and succeeds in portraying the Algerian characters as sympathetic, the depiction of many more French deaths than Algerian betrays a subtle bias. The reality was that at least 100,000 Algerians were killed in the war versus 10,000 French. Yet the film shows many more scenes of random killing of the French than Algerians caught in the cross fire. A significant omission is any portrayal of the aerial war in the mountain villages although it is alluded to by one of the FLN leaders. Otherwise, I found the film to be very balanced in its portrayal of the suffering endured in this conflict by both sides. An excellent and gripping film which is reminiscent of the present day struggle going on in Iraq.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Battle of Algiers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I definitely would have never watched this Algerian/Italian film if I hadn't seen it featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, it was a title that sounded like it could be interesting as well. Basically, shot in documentary style and commissioned by the Algerian government, this film sees the guerrilla war between the French foreign legion and the Algerians between 1954 and 1962. We see the battle from both sides, as the French were defeated in Vietnam and want to prove their worth, while the Algerians want independence, so the military forces from both sides are sending in weaponry and bombs to claim their victory. We see the bad things that happen to those who were part of, and some innocents that were, until the final conclusion when Algeria won the war and achieved their independence. Starring Yacef Saadi as Saari Kader/Djafar, Jean Martin as Col. Mathieu, Brahim Haggiag as Ali La Pointe, Tommaso Neri as Captain, Samia Kerbash as Fathia, Fusia El Kader as Halima, Ugo Paletti as Captain and Mohamed Ben Kassen as Petit Omar. I will be honest and say that the story, if there was meant to be one, was a bit too complicated for me most of the time, the only scenes I can really remember are the various attack, torture and fighting scenes, so for those I can agree it is a watchable political war drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Gillo Pontecorvo, Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen and Best Foreign Language Film, and it won the BAFTA UN Award. Good, in my opinion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a rather thought-provoking film from the guy who brought us the movie, "Quemada!" It is the mid 1950s where Algerians are fighting against French occupation and colonialism (the French had been in Algiers for 130 yrs.). A young, ambitious man named Ali volunteers his services with a terrorist organization to combat the French.The shooting of French police and innocent Algerian and French people motivate the government of France to send in military aid to ward off the terrorist activity. Only until 1962 did Algeria gain its' independence.What bugs me about this film is that the F.L.N. rule over Algeria was no different than the French occupation. People were still in the same situation they were before their "independence." However, the film director is a devout Marxist, which explains why the terrorists were portrayed as heroes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analysis of Film for History 110B</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Conflict, torture, and rebellion are just a few of the actions seen in the film the Battle of Algiers. This film depicts the struggles of the Algerians against the French who have occupied Algiers for many decades. The focus of the film is on the start of a rebellion and the pivotal characters in the rebellion, it follows the rebellion through riots, torture, and needless killings until the leaders of the rebellion are killed themselves. However even though the leaders of the rebellion have died, the rebellion is reborn a few years later and the Algerians successfully gain their independence. The film contains a high emotional and intellectual impact. It depicts the cruelty and inhumanness of both the leaders of the rebellion who gun down innocent French citizens, the French soldiers who watch emotionless as an Algiers is tortured and then later blame the Algier for not giving in sooner. In addition, the Algier is treated almost with camaraderie as the Algier is given coffee and clothes and patted on the back for him to lead the way to the rebel hideout. The film reveals the deadened almost blank expression the French soldiers depict as someone is tortured. It contrasts with the passionate, almost zealous rebels who gun down and try to run over French citizens. It is a stark contrast and yet it shows that no one is free from the devastation and destruction of the rebellion. Although the French soldiers target the rebellions, little harm was done to other Algerians initially and the French soldier Mathias appeals to a woman whose home has been occupied by the rebels to ask the rebels to give themselves up. This can be compared to the rebels who are willing to gun down and run over any one they feel are not native which includes French citizens who are attempting to make lives in Algiers. There is a sense of horrified fascination as the rebels use an ambulance to gun down French citizens who are minding their business and one of the rebels attempt to run over the French citizens. This will also share a resemblance at the end of the film where Algerians demanding their independence are gunned down by French soldiers, have bombs thrown at them, and chased by armored tanks.Although the Battle of Algiers occurred in the 1960s, the struggle for power and dominance and the need to assert power can be interpreted as universal and can occur in the present. Even though the "war in Iraq" began for reasons some are still unsure about whether due to weapons of mass destruction or to liberate Iraq there is a power struggle occurring. What is tragic that soldiers who believe in American and the people are Iraq are being killed because issues are not resolved peacefully. The people of Iraq are similar to the Algerians in that they are battling against people they believe are invaders and that they have the capabilities to run their own country and have their independence. Although the French and today the Americans are battling for different goals, both have invested too much time, energy, and money to leave the natives of that country alone and leave. Although the Algerians were able to gain their independence, it was not without the cost of the destruction of the country and millions of lives of the French and Algerians. Today, there is still the struggle for power and independence. Although history is taught so that with knowledge gained the same mistakes can be prevented, history still has the potential of repeating itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rather weird, really. The film leaps straight into the Algerian insurrection without providing background or any depiction of the French rule of Algeria, or even of the Algerian people's demand for freedom, and thus makes the Algerian National Liberation Front seem like a criminal organization dedicated mainly to killing policemen. The French ultimately catch up with the Algerians in brutality, and the camera fairly clearly sympathizes with the latter, but the film makes no real attempt to evaluate the justice of the rebel's demands or the necessity of their resorting to terrorist methods.The viewer who does not begin with the notion that anyone connected to a colonial power deserves to be killed is left inclined to sympathize with the French, simply because most of the murders in the first hour or so of the film are committed by the Algerians, but one assumes that the story leading up to the first terrorist attacks would provide some justification for them. Not seeing the history, one can't judge.</fullReview>
