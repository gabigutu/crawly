		<shortDescription>The Best Movie I've seen for a long long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am surprised about the negative comments that some people made on this web-page. I can see how some people might not experience the same kind of uplift or joy that most of us lived through when seeing the movie. But that some viewers felt insulted and betrayed because the movie did not depict "reality" as it really was or is, is not fair.I must concur with my fellow proponents of the movie -- it was a great and very satisfying movie. It provided me with something that everyone in one or another shape or form needs -- Hope. The movie showed the cruelty of life and yet managed to shed some light and insight into the beauty of love and life in general.I urge anyone who has not seen La Vita ? bella to go out there and watch it. If we all take with us just little bit of that hope and love that this movie is trying to convey; this world would be a much better place.Thank you for reading this and I hope you enjoyed or will enjoy the movie as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand how other reviewers see this as a film about the Nazis or the Holocaust. It's not!!! "Life is Beautiful" is a film about love, optimism, courage and inner strength.To be honest I can't get this film out of my thoughts and decided to write this brief review in the hope that I could move on."Life is Beautiful" is an unforgettable film. You go through emotions you were surprised could have for a fictional film. The story, although totally implausible, is uplifting and depressing at the same time.Please see it for yourself. Have a box of tissues handy.Best film ever seen!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that have a lasting effect on you. After watching it, I found that it has less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the human feelings and the beautiful relationship of a father and his son. The holocaust provides the ultimate context, that brings and highlights the story and adds yet another deep dimension to the movie. No such piece of art has ever before combined laughter and tears of sadness in me before and that is the miracle of the movie. The realism of the movie is not its strong point, but then again it is not supposed to be; this helps in bringing the audiences to a state of mind away from reality, focusing on the feelings generated by forgetting about all external events and developments of the war. Despite that, the movie does not fail to point out an element of the nazi psychology demonstrated by the doctor who was obsessed with riddles. This portrayed the nazi 'state of mind' (if ever such an expression existed) as a sick mentally disturbed state. Life is really beautiful as you watch Guido's relentless efforts to make a lovely exciting experience of the concentration camp to his son. You get exhausted just watching him going through his painful day and yet you smile as he speaks to his son and makes him laugh. One can go on forever describing the creativity of this movie, but one will not be able to capture all its beauty in writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb tragi-comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roberto Benigni's Vita e bella, is in many ways similar to Chaplin's Great Dictator. Both are comic attacks on fascism, but the former's is the more successful. Benigni initially accesses the emotions of his audience through simple comedy, which is a pleasant mix of Keaton and Chaplin. Romance ensues with his real life wife Nicoletta Braschi. The first half of this film has been seen by various critics as being inferior to the second, but this is certainly not the case. In the first section we follow the delightful romance that will eventually lead to marriage and the creation of the wonderful Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini).It is the first half where the audience can laugh the loudest and delight at the immense comedy talent of Benigni. Unlike so many films nowadays there is nothing crude or course, his is simple innocent humour, which is all the more effective. The way he ties together little strand in the film to create comedy elements shows a great writing ability, and a mastery of timing when it comes to their execution on screen. Various incidents related to the rise of anti-semitism and fascism in Italy show that there are sinister forces at work which come to the fore in the second segment.Guido (Benigni) moves events on from Tuscany in 1939 to the last year of the war in a concentration camp. In this period he and Dora (Braschi) have had their son Giosue (Cantanarini). The five year old greatly reminds me of Toto in Cinema Paradiso, and plays an equally important role in his prospective film (though in Paradiso's case it is at the beginning of the movie). The relationship between the two is very similar to that of Jackie Coogan and Charlie Chaplin (though Benigni, unlike Chaplin, keeps the best of the comedy moments). Guido attempts to keep from the boy the horrors of what is going on, and this eventually manifests itself as a game where the aim is to score 100 points, with the winner winning a real tank (which, of course appeals to the young boy). Comic moments are still present, that involving Guido's translation of the rules of the camp is particularly notable, but it becomes somewhat more difficult to laugh when we consider the gravity of what is going on.The emphasis begins shifts, and we realise that this is a film about human spirit above all else. Guido not only appeals to the audience due to his comedy and sheer pleasantness, but also in the way that he loves his family and the measures that he will go to to protect them.This is certainly no Schindler's List, but it never pretends to be. Occasionally events seem a little contrived, but this does seem to work in the film's favour. However, this film avoids the tendency of Hollywood to go far over the top in emotional and credibility terms.Benigni shines like a lantern throughout the picture, showing that he is a talent, not only in comedy terms, that far outshines his peers. Cantanari is a delight, and Braschi also plays her part well. There is even an appearance by The Magnificent Seven's Horst Buchholz as Doctor Lessing, a man who events change for the worse.Please don't let the fact that it, to all but the Italians, is a foreign language film. The language itself adds a beauty of form to the film, much as it did in the case of Il Postino. This has to be a certainty for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, though something tells me that it will be overlooked for other awards as it is Italian and not a mainstream English language picture.Please see this film, and make up your own mind. It is appealing in so many different ways that I'm sure that you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, entertaining, and amazingly intense and dramatic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it sad that so many people are so narrow-minded that they will not watch a movie that is black and white or, in this case, is subtitled. I feel sorry for people who refuse to watch a movie like Life Is Beautiful just because it is a foreign film. They have no idea what a beautifully acted and directed film this is, and they'll never know what an amazing experience they are missing. Life Is Beautiful manages to walk the extremely thin line between humor, fantasy, and tragedy. Sure, the film is clearly comedic, but nevertheless it manages to very effectively communicate the tremendous losses suffered in the Nazi concentration camps and has scenes at least as intense as any scene in Schindler's List. This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It manages to be so encompassing that you hardly notice the subtitles are even there. I proudly cast my vote of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be one of the best films ever made. I've never seen a movie with such a balance of hysterical comedy and serious drama. Roberto Benigni totally deserved his Oscars. People on this site have said such negative things about him and this film. Mr. Benigni had a lot of guts to make this film, and there's not another film like it. He handled both the comedy and drama aspects beautifully. I loved the beautiful cinematography, scenery, and the characters. This movie is magnificent in every way. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw the movie was when I was about seventeen or so, and I never forgot it. The incredibly human characters (such as the doctor who loved riddles), the fantastic script-writing, the amazing acting, and of course the heartwarming story. This movie proves once and for all how strong we are, as humans, that in the face of adversity we can make the best of things. There is so much love in the characters; Dora's love for her husband Guido is boundless, as well as Guido's love for his son. Sure, it's a slightly unrealistic movie, but hey, aren't they all a little unrealistic? I've also seen people review this movie and say that it made light of the Holocaust, which was of course a dark point in history. I don't think so; I think that it's only delicately handled, and because of that, the movie is one that a person can watch in one sitting without being thoroughly disgusted by mankind. I would say that those who think this movie is too "light" are cynical and bitter. The whole point to the movie is to show what love is capable of, and to provide encouragement and perhaps guidance. This movie changed my life from the first time I watched it. I came away with this feeling that no matter what I have to face in life, that I can overcome it. This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone over the age of eleven. The acting is superb (though Roberto Benigni is a little over-the-top, LOL), the story heartwarming and easy to understand. It's excellent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most aptly named movie - A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never in my life seen a movie that so truly symbolizes its name and its message. Roberto Benigni - 'The Italian Treasure House' has probably given to his viewers his best. The story, the performances, the entire theme of a person performing his duties as a husband, as a father is very 'moving' and inspiring. 'Life is beautiful' as the name goes is about a Jewish man, who falls in love with a non-Jewish lady, marries her, has a kid and who is then taken as a prisoner in a concentration camp along with his wife and kid. But the way he protects his kid from the horrors of the genocide, how he always tries to find ways to make his wife and kid smile and laugh, is what makes the movie, a MUST SEE.It is certainly one of the best movies that I have seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best foreign language film I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I typically don't care much for sub-titled movies. Foreign films to me are slow and about nothing. So I naturally went to see Life is Beautiful with a chip on my shoulder. I wanted to hate it. I wanted it to be just another movie that Hollywood was praising to show that they were an intelligent bunch of people. Oh boy was I in for the surprise of my life. Not only is this film good, I honestly believe that it was the second best film of 98, next to Saving Private Ryan. The mere fact that Shakespeare in Love won best picture over not only Ryan but over this, is a joke. It's actually funny.Benigni did everything in this film. He wrote, produced, directed and probably swept the floors at night. There is that much raw energy in this film. There really is. For someone to have that kind of vision is truly incredible. And not only is the film a terrific cinematic experience because of the importance and seriousness of the subject matter, but it is one of the funnier films I've ever seen. When Roberto is translating the German soldiers insructions to his son so that he isn't scared, it is at that moment that you realize you are under his spell. He's got you and no matter how much sceptisism you may have about the film you know you're witnessing a classic in every sense of the word.I loved this film. Loved everything about it and I am so glad that I got to see it and cheer Benigni at the Oscars. He certainly deserved his best actor award and he should have gotten more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A satire set in a concentration camp, tough a hit internationally, was thought by some critics to be in bad taste...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mixing humor and the Holocaust isn't anything new: Ernst Lubitsch's 'To Be Or Not To Be' is just one enduring classic; Mel Brooks' 'The Producers' is another; and 'Life Is Beautiful' has the small-town charm and ambiance of 'Amarcord,' and light-straight satire of 'The Great Dictator.'Set against the stark reality of World War II Europe, Roberto Benigni's sentimental fable is not a film about the Holocaust, it's a film about life and hope merely against the backdrop of the Holocaust... It's not a denial of the Holocaust, it is a manifestation that humor itself can be courage... It's not about betraying the experience of millions of Jews, it is about the great lengths a father will go to protect his family from the horrors of the Nazis... It's a demonstration of the power of cinema, it's art without claim, hope without fear, dreams without limitations... It's a motion picture about love, not a documentary about the Nazis... It delivers a powerful message that despite everything?life is truly beautiful... The story begins in 1939 Italy, where a simple, free-spirited Italian Jew Guido Orefice (Benigni) and his poet friend Ferrucio (Sergio Bini Bustic) have dreams of owning their own bookstore... For now, however, Guido must be satisfied to wait tables, while Ferrucio is unable to get a job...Benigni's character is introduced during a long set of fast comedy scenes, particularly when he meets a cute gentile woman, Dora?Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife... When she 'falls out of the sky,' and he quickly nicknames her 'Principessa'... When he rides, in a fascist ball, on a horse painted green... When he turns a gloomy rainy night into a red carpet event... When he is caught by the Nazis as he hurries about securing the safety of his wife and son.. When his car speeds, without brakes, through a village and is mistaken for a king... Guido falls hard for the radiant schoolteacher, daughter of a wealthy family, and pursues her with all the charm and imagination he can discharge... In one sequence he pretends to be a school inspector and gives an impromptu speech on racial superiority before the assembled students and teachers, ending with a striptease...That hilarious side of the film takes up the first half... Benigni (who also wrote and directed) borrows a bit of Chaplin's grace and a bit of Groucho Marx charm... All of the action is so neatly contrived that the film essentially ends when it's over, and then begins again with the introduction of Guido and Dora's cute five-year-old son Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini) few years later... There, in 1945, we catch a glimpse of their enchanting household, but things are soon shattered, and the Nazis take Guido, with his tolerant uncle (Giustino Durano) and little Giosue off to an unidentified concentration camp... Dora races to the train station and demands to be put also on the train... At the death camp, and in order to protect his son from the nightmare of the place, Guido uses his imagination by creating the illusion that everything that's happening is just a game, an epic game that will be exciting and fun...He convinces Giosue that by hiding from the Gestapo soldiers (whom he refers to simply as the "men who yell a lot") and maintaining silence, he can gain the necessary points to win a tank... Not a toy tank, but a full-size tank, which they'll be free to take home...As co-writer, Benigni (with Vincenzo Cerami), doesn't just mix drama and comedy, he often hides drama in the comedy... The film does not dwell on the horrors of the camp, nor does it ignore them... With a memorable score by Nicola Piovani, "Life Is Beautiful" is an important film, triumphant, timeless, and sublime... It manages to entertain, educate, and move with its potent combination of humor, poignancy, and dignity... Roberto Benigni has taken pure horror and turned it into a love story between a man and a woman, between a father and his son... As an actor, Benigni manages with his wise and simple performance to make us laugh in tragic situations... He was very realistic, natural, distant from great special effects, far from Hollywood style, only nice and beautiful cinema...The film won Academy Awards for Best Actor, Best Foreign Film and Best Dramatic Score...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie About Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life Is Beautiful takes the premise that love and hope can survive the most trying of conditions, in this case a Nazi concentration camp. Most everyone knows this very popular and honored film, so I won't belabor the story. Briefly, in my humble opinion, this film deserves all the accolades it's been awarded. A near perfect film, my only gripe is that Mr. Benigni's performance could have been more understated, especially the half of the film that's set in the concentration camp. But this is only a slight complaint. For a joyful, life-affirming movie, Life Is Beautiful is tops. But be forewarned, as its principal backdrop of anti-Semitism and Nazi murder, it is not a very happy movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie filled with love &amp; hope.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love La vita ? bella/Life is beautiful. It's one of my favorite movies and Benigni is fantastic! I laughed until I cried when he translated the Nazi soldier´s threats to Italian. I was skeptic to non-English movies before, but after seeing this movie I can easily say that I'm not. I thought it would be a problem that I didn't understand the language, but Benigni isn't just a talking actor. He is an acting actor, and I don't think I missed a lot being dependable to the subtitles. I sure hope not, but I guess you always miss a bit.I have seen other movies about the Holocaust, but they have all been so dark. Not surprisingly since the the Holocaust is a dark chapter in our history. But it's painful to watch them. It's easier to watch La vita ? bella, because it's not as dark, but it still succeeds in telling the story about the Holocaust.And Roberto Benigni doesn't joke about the Holocaust as some criticizers claimed. He simply puts some love and hope into it. And I get the message. Love is everywhere, even in the darkest of places.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler Every once in a while a movie comes along which makes you question the kind of man you are. How do you handle situations? If you were put in the same situation, Would you come out of it smiling? Do you have the courage? Guido (Benigni) did. Life is beautiful charms you right from the opening shot of the beautiful Italian countryside. It takes you into the life of Guido, a young Italian Jewish Waiter who has a beautiful way of looking at things. he never seems to look at anmything negatively, in fact, his frivolous view to life is what makes you sit riveted throughout. I don't think he's delusional, he is a very serious man, and he sees the gravity of situations in his life, but he doesn't want the people around him to feel it, hence his ever-smiling, effervescent demeanour. It all seems like a fairy tale. His landing into the school as the impostor school inspector and lecture on the virtues of the navel... His galloping down into the ballroom on the horse and whisking his bride away towards a happy life... His superspeed bike ride down the town square... things that we all dream of. An untouched innocence. The movie takes a dramatic turn when he finds himself in a concentration camp with his son... His made up story of how the camp is a game and the father-son team are the leading competitors... An unmatched courage. Not one to cry in movies as a rule, I found myself alone at home one day, and when the boy is hidden in the little box, looking at his father being led away at gun point, getting scared... and then, the father doing what he usually does to reassure the boy that the situation is not as serious as it looks... the clown march... I felt tears roll down my cheeks. And then, i started sniffing... after a while, the sniffs turn into sobs, and ultimately, when his father is dead, and the boy sees the American tank coming towards him, the elation in his eyes, the jubilation at winning first prize... it turned the sobs into a full fledged howl. Thats when i got the message... That's when the maginitude of the sacrifice made by the father in an effort to protect his son hit me like a thunderbolt and hasn't left me since. Thats when you realize that life is all about loving, and protecting and cherishiong your loved ones. and despite all the troubles, the despair and the danger that one may face, Life is... Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambivalent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a son of Holocaust survivors, I skip movies on this theme. This is a protective mechanism that I use to avoid painful emotions, but it has denied me the experience of such films as "Schindler's List"."Life is Beautiful", I was told, is not a holocaust film. It is emotional, but deemed "safe". Well, I saw the film, and find myself strongly ambivalent about its message and content. I would love the oppurtunity to ask the creators: did you simply use the Holocaust as a convenient backdrop to your story? Was it just stage and scenery for the players (much like the opera depicted in the film)? Will others find similar Holocaust venues to fit their stories? I don't have the answer. I personally was hurt by the "Hogans Heroes" type story depicted in the second half of the film. I have been told by my own parents of painful yet poignant stories of parent and child in the Holocaust that contrast by their stark reality, to the fairy tale as depicted in the film. As stated at the top, I am ambivalent. The film serves our children well. More than any other film I have seen, it shows us, in a way a four year old understands, the absurdity of treating anyone, even "Visigoths and spiders", differently than we would want to be treated ourselves. The acting is impeccable, the music uplifting, and the audience walks out greater for having seen the movie. I only hope the success of this film does not give others the green light in using a very sad part of history in a way that lessens the memory of those who suffered through it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film... but not an entirely perfect one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, I was told up front that the first full hour of the film, the first half, was all slapstick comedy and character development, and that the second half was more serious and important. I prepared myself mentally for the first half, but I was still surprised by how annoying the gags and jokes were. We're talking cake-in-face, fall-over, slip-on-banana humor. For one full hour. At the end of the first half of this film, I was thinking "this had better get better very soon..." And it did. Right then and there. From the very beginning of the second half, the serious mood enters. And it doesn't take long for even the most average minded viewer to realize that the first half of humor and character development was important. It was important for us to ease into a less tense mood, to make the important subject strike even harder, and for us to get to know the characters, to make us care more about what happens to them. I've just finished seeing it for the second time, and I've come to realize that this film is not entirely perfect, as I felt just after seeing it through first time. It does have its flaws, though there aren't many of them. The first half, and some parts of the second half, are heavy on humor, which some will mistake for making fun of the subject(which is almost a crime), or trying to make it seem less important. I don't believe this to be true, it's just a retelling with a more positive message; yes, people do horrible, inhumane things sometimes... but after all, there is beauty, too. The first half will also deter some viewers who will enjoy the second half much more. The plot is very good, though slightly unrealistic. The acting is pretty much all flawless, even in the child actors. The characters are well-written and interesting. The humor is more acceptable in the second part, because it's more toned down and not trying way too hard to get a quick laugh out of the audience. All in all, a great film which anyone and everyone should see at least once during their life... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll realize that, in the end, Life Is Beautiful. I recommend this to just about anyone, but I know that not everyone will enjoy it equally. A near-perfect film. Keep watching past the first half... you won't regret it. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelous tale about a likable Jewish protecting his son and wife from horrifying concentration camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wonderful fable plenty of amazing fantasy, lively comedy and sad tragedy . This is a poignant and moving fable about a sacrifice to save a son and a wife . It's an unforgettable story formed by two halves that proves imagination, family and love conquer all ; as Benigni's focus is on the love between daddy , mummy and son . The first part results to be an Italian comedy style , the second is horror along with humor . It concerns upon Guido (Roberto Benigni, a magnificent rubber-faced funny man), a Jewish man who has a wonderful romance with the help of his humour, but must use that same quality to protect his son in a Nazi death camp . He's a madcap romantic man and women wish him . But he falls in love with Dora (Benigni's real-life sweetie Nicoletta Braschi). Every day Guido dreams of marrying her , under Nicola Piovani score . When the Second World War spontaneously breaks out , he and his family is imprisoned at concentration camp . Guido is determined to save his lover and son (Cantarini) from dangers around them . His effort sometimes is pure fantasy , though with ruse he pull off more impetus to keep his son and accomplishes feats no man could realistically execute . Guido fabricates an elaborated game to convince his child that the whole ordeal is an endurance proof to be won with prizes forthcoming , as it turns out to be a special contest to win a tank.This is a story about love , war and sacrifice , well starred and directed by Roberto Benigni who develops a fire-line between comedy and tragedy . Inventive gags and wacky humor are splendidly proceeded . At first consideration , the theme of a feel-good holocaust comedy war was a non-sense . However , Benigni doesn't describe a holocaust film but rather a tale of endurance of family love . Benigni tirelessly maintains the humorous ingenuity, even as the horror war escalates. Actor and director Benigni shapes simultaneously haunting and hilarious comedy out of the tragedy of Nazi concentration camp . In a especially humorous scene , Guido translates a guard's barking at the inmates as furthers clarification of the rules of game . The picture is divided into two parts , the first half deals with an entertaining boy-meets-girl tale , a light-weight comedy in which Guido relentlessly pursues Dora ; the second half shifts and depicts the horrors of the concentration camps . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries as the Spanish Marisa Paredes , Lidia Alfonsi and Horst Buchhold as a Nazi doctor . The film displays an emotive musical score by Nicola Piovani, who deservedly had Oscar winner . Furthermore , it won Academy Award to Foreign film and of course to Benigni ; Roberto Benigni's Oscar for best actor marked only the second time that an actor had directed himself in an Academy Award winning performance , the other was Laurence Olivier for Hamlet . Colorful and glamorous cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli . Effective and appropriate production design by the veteran Danilo Donati . The motion picture was marvelously directed by Benigni. He's a good comedy director (Monster, Johnny Toothpick, Little devil) with some flop (Pinoccio) and usual actor for Jim Jarmusch (Coffee and cigarettes, Night of Earth, Down by law). Rating : Better than average . Well worth seeing .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, but uneven. For me the second half was better than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I eventually saw this film, I was not sure whether I was going to like it or not. While in general it is very highly regarded, there have been those who have said it is overrated or whatever. Just for the record, I did like the movie very much. It is uneven, and there were parts that didn't work as well as intended, but this is a brave and affectionate realisation of life during the Holocaust. I asked myself after watching Life is Beautiful, is it really overrated. Well, maybe a tad, but I can really see why people like this movie.So what didn't make this film perfect? Well, as I have stated at least twice already, it is uneven. And in my humble opinion, the second half was better than the first. I just want to clarify that I didn't hate the first half. Some of it is very funny, but some of the slapstick humour didn't work as well as it should, namely eggs breaking on people's heads. It also works very hard, to provide charm. That is perfectly acceptable, but because there was a lot of charm in the performances and the production values it felt slightly overdone. Though I will say that Benigni's tribute to comedy greats like Charlie Chaplin and Groucho Marx was inspired.The film changes tone to a more poignant, compelling and harrowing second half, that I think was much needed. While the character of Guido "amusingly" tries to convince his son Giosue that life in the concentration isn't so bad, the second half's tone has a lot of poignancy. Most notably Guido and Giosue trying to communicate to Dora over the loudspeaker, and the ending did have me in tears.That said, there are a lot of truly good things about Life is Beautiful. For one thing, it is sumptuously filmed. The costumes look amazing and the Italian landscapes look breathtaking. (If there is one place that I would love, love, LOVE to go to it is Italy, not only for the food but for the opera as well.) The story is an effective and affectionate one, about a Jewish man who falls in love with the help of his humour, but has to do the same to protect his son in the Nazi concentration camp. The quality of the script, I saw the Italian version with English subtitles, is thoroughly decent, and hits more than it misses.The performances are excellent in general. Roberto Benigni, one of Italy's favourite funny men, gives a admirable performance. He does overact at times in the first half but he appears a lot more subdued in the second. And I also thought he did a better job acting than he did directing. His direction once or twice in this film was a tad stodgy. Nicoletta Braschi is just stunning as Dora, she looked amazing in this movie and was solid in terms of acting. Giorgio Cantarini didn't always convince as Giosue though, there were times when he comes across as whiny and maybe I am being unfair but I have seen better child performances.All in all, beautiful to watch, and a nice story. It is very pleasant to watch with a compelling and poignant second half, but there are flaws that bring it down from what could have been outstanding to just a film worth watching. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brave movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read all the previous comments. It's amazing to see someone advocating this is one of the best movies ever and someone else saying this is a very bad and offending show. Very few moderate comments...Usually a movie so much debated is at least interesting. I believe this is really valuable, first of all because making such a blend of humour and drama isn't easy at all. No other filmmaker did something like "Life is beautiful" in the past: the Holocaust, humour and a lovely story in the same film. Probably this is one of the best movies ever for bravery and originality, yes.Do you want a harsh, historically correct view of the Holocaust? Please read the books written by survivors, like Primo Levi's "Se questo ? un uomo", and watch original footage filmed at the end of the war, for example by the Russians when they entered Auschwitz, if you absolutely need something visual too. Even "Schindler's list" doesn't show the worst of that tragedy, for I believe it's simply impossible to represent such an horror with a fiction work, with actors and special effects. "Life is beautiful" doesn't want to represent the Holocaust, and IMHO this is a Good Thing.BTW, I'm Italian and Benigni here is a superstar; you see him everywhere on TV. If you saw the Cannes ceremony you have a vague idea about what he's capable to do. I saw him live years ago and he's even completely different: much better!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shows a Lighter Edge To A Tragic Event In History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never thought the day would come when a movie centred during the Holocaust would be provided with humour. The Holocaust was anything but funny then and now as thousands of Europeans of Jewish faith were killed off mainly towards fear, paranoia, economical insecurity and just plain hatred. But once in a while towards sadness, we can open our hearts and try to survive the grimness with some humour to raise our spirit. And that is exactly what actor/director/writer Roberto Benigni succeeds in "Life is Beautiful". It's a refreshing break from the graphic and and disturbing images that has haunted the theatres past and present like Spielberg's "Schildler's List" or Polanski's "The Pianist" as we look to a more brighter side of the Holocaust mainly toward the humour of the leading protagonist, Guido Orefice (Benigni).When it first came out and it was listed as a comedy, I thought it was just too surreal to be true. I mean nothing funny ever happened in the Holocaust. And film adaptations have been quite demonstrative at that. In those troubled times, lives were lost, families were separated, people were cold, starving fear and doubt was on the minds of Europeans Jewish and non-Jewish. at the time. But Benigni showed his mastery in front and behind the camera that we can enjoy the goodness of life, even in times of uncertainty because we only live once and we must enjoy it while we can.Benigni was not the only person who made this film all the more worthwhile. Nicoletta Braschi turns in a wonderful performance as a Catholic girl who loves her husband regardless of what religion he practises. A grand portion of scenes demonstrates just how pointless racism is and the best example is set in the schoolroom scene.Concentration camps are one of the worst establishments anyone would ever dream of entering and yet in this movie we can enjoy a chuckle. In one scene, Guido persuades the soldiers as he defends his son as a ploy to prevent his son from further dire circumstances. While we laugh as he tries to weasel his way out from further punishment, we are still aware and concerned about the welfare of Guido and his young son and the dangers they are encountering.The fearful and depressing effects of the Holocaust is exhibited in brief moments of sad truths that weave into Guido's detailed fantasies. But you never see him fall victim to disparity. His wild imagination and his determination are the only weapons of protection he utilizes to keep his family and his son in tact. The remarkable story of love and tenderness is worthy enough for everyone to see. This movie should be cherished for a long time to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Didn't really think that much about what to expect of this movie and expected a sort of "happy happy comedy" where life's a dance on flowers. But a positive surprise the film appeared to have deeper tones, the movie is set in Italy right before and during WW2. The main-person is a jew and that causes bad things to happen. But in spite of everything that happens Guido keeps his spirit up to the last and shows a wonderful and humorous perspective of life. A must see!Notice how everything in the movie has a purpose. Every little thing that happens will serve a purpose later on in the movie. For example the weird habit of swapping hats with this other person at any possible occasion will serve its purpose later on in the film :) I liked this intelligent and highly entertaining way of bonding the story together. This and many many other things makes this film well worthwhile watching. Go see it and make up your own meaning!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is obvious from the first scenes that Guido played by Roberto Benigni is an over the top far fetched character. He uses his wits and lack of any thought of repercussion to get kicks out of the mundane aspects of life. Guido finds comedy his tool to gain anything he needs. He is the exaggerated personification of optimism never failing to find the best out of any situation. The first half of the film shows Guido win the love of Dora, a beautiful and engaged Italian woman. There is nothing realistic about his methods of gaining her attention. There are just perfectly played out coincidences that Guido takes advantage of. It is almost like an embellished story passed down through the years. Guido pulls one over the top antic after another and eventually runs off with Dora. It is pure fantasy.5 years later when the film picks up Guido and Dora have a little boy and are suddenly sent off to a Nazi death camp. This is where the film has received a large amount of praise and criticism. A Nazi death camp should not be taken lightly and I don't think it is in this movie. There are moments of over the top far-fetched humor by Benigni but they were not meant to gain laughs at the expense of the holocaust. It is simply Guido using the only thing he has at his disposal to protect his son. Sure he is cheerful and clownish to an unimaginable degree but that's what he needed to do to keep his son alive. Guido's uncle does die in the camp and so do many others. There is mention of children being taken to the showers to die and dead bodies are seen piled up. I don't think this film is a comedy at all. The "jokes" during the second half of the film are not funny to watch but painful to see a man desperately trying to stay strong in an unbearable circumstance. I'm not sure if the film lives up to all the hype to me but it is definitely effective. The performances are great all around and Benigni is convincing in both sections of the film. I don't believe it is disrespectful to the events of the holocaust although at most times obviously improbable. It is a film meant to celebrate the human spirit no matter what the situation is and it does that well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poignant , misunderstood masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a small handful of reviewers who are lambasting this film , crying phrases like "unrealistic and contrived" , "emotionally manipulative" and most risibly "an insult to the memory of the victims of the holocaust".Id like to address such interpretations.In the latter day audiences search for films bereft of cliché, derivativeness and lack of independence there seems to be a counterintuitive rationale that if a film cannot be explicated and stand up to analysis from every myriad aspect of possible critique, then it lacks worth or merit , taken as a piece of work in its own right.It should be suggested that the intent of the film is so clear,the aims of the film so evidently manifest, that to brand the film unrealistic and then carp on with minor details regarding obvious inconsistencies, is to not be able to see the film for what it very plainly proclaims itself to be.This film NEVER tries to be realistic in the modern sense of film critique, this film freely admits to being contrived, this film unashamedly focuses on the characters at the expense of portraying an historically accurate reality.For the whining reviewers to not see this, is either an example of disingenuous folly or plain hard-heartedness.The film is driven by ideals, of romance and of selflessness.This film clearly asks the watcher to suspend belief, to enter into its fantasy, to embrace the human emotion as elucidated through the characters.Not only is this film NOT an insult to anybody who has ever been persecuted (Jew,Chilean,African,Russian,Japanese,Chinese,Cambodian - the list of persecution goes on), rather it heightens empathy for such people in this plight ,through the use of poignancy.Its intent is NEVER to trivialise such.Yes the uniforms aren't dirty enough , yes Guido takes ridiculous risks,yes the likelihood that the German guards knew some Italian are apparent but the question is - given the context of the presentation - do those niggling details matter ? Surely the film is engaging the viewer on an emotive level,evoking empathy for the individual case,for the desperation that sees a father moved to unthinkable extremes in an attempt to prolong the life of his son.Thus - surely , Guido's actions should not and never were intended to be 'realistic' but rather he is - to our despairing eyes ,simply pathetic ie he is evoking pity.How any discerning fair minded person could honestly and objectively brand this film as disrespectful and hateful because of comedic elements, is missing the point by oceans.This film is about the individual circumstance and thus the slapstick and ingenious way we are drawn into knowing the characters and the way we are immersed in the burgeoning love story of the small boys' parents, necessitates the audience to empathise,to engage,to feel.The by-play between father and son is to look at innocence personified,the bitter sweet forgoing of self in a seemingly doomed essay at escaping the impending inevitable spiral into oblivion.I think Life is Beautiful is an important work that might demand a rethinking of priorities by hard hearted critiques , who may have to shed that veneer of bloody-minded nitpicking and, to wit, see the forest for the trees.Of course the film is flawed,what film attempting such a tight balancing act between comedy and poignancy isn't? But there is a certain state of mind and spirit that needs to be adopted to be receptive to its message and i fear perhaps that such vulnerability and innocence required seems too hard and bitter a pill for some.If only they dare taste - its sweetness and candour resonate persuasively,indelibly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benigni makes the film. I believe if it had in someone else's hands, it would probably not work, but there is something about this man's facial features. Somehow he connects with you, and yet he's so different from everyone else. Most of us can't conjure fairy tales and magical moments like his protagonist. What we can do is feel fear, love, loyalty, and a lot of the emotions that he sometimes shows and tries to disguise in order not to cause more pain.The story takes us through the separation period of an Italian man from his wife when the Nazis arrest him and his young boy. The father has to create a scenario to protect his young kid from the horrors that surround them. He tells them they are playing a game, and that if they do it right, they will win and see their wife/mom again. It is not so easy to carry out, and with creative gestures and, bewildering, funny lines, we laugh in the middle of this tragedy. Still, we are sad because it's all a fantasy, and the odds are that this will not end well.The most heartbreaking part is the ignorance that is part of many of these characters' lives. His "friends" appear to be unaware of what is going on. Normal lives continue in an isolated oasis, away from imminent death. Guido tries hard, almost succeeding, and we get to the bittersweet ending, something that will remind many of those doubted this premise was going to work, that this is after the way life works. It's full of surprises, and some of them are not beautiful.There are many winning elements in this film. At the top are the performances of the main characters. We have a lovely score that underscores the extremes that co exist in the same universe. We have the evils of World War II and the beauty of the love between the various members of the family. This is a film that must have been difficult to sell, produce, and realize, but it succeeds and delivers another perspective about that horrible period in history.</fullReview>

Roberto is shown as a charming playful fellow who likes to live in his own fairy tale. At the same time, he is an opportunistic man and knows how to take advantage of a situation.But what when all the odds are stake against him? Things he endear the most are doomed!Roberto finds himself in a concentration camp along with his son and wife. And here comes the attractive part of this entire film. Instead of revealing the harsh reality to his tender kid, he chooses to keep the kid in his fairy tale. Luck favors the brave one!Say it co-incidence or law of attraction, things turn out as he had promised to his son who gets a final ride on a large tank. But film ends in a melancholy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just have to add my own two cents in here about this amazing experience of a film.One: It was a fable and those who thought that it was an unrealistic approach to the horrors of Nazi Germany tend to tell me that they didn't know it was mean to be a fable. They missed where that was stated in the very first part of the film.Two: Some say film didn't deal with the profound evilness of the concentration camps? A number of people that I talked to didn't even remember the scene where Benigni and his sleeping son happened upon the hill of bodies through what was thought to be fog, which turned out to be smoke from the furnaces. Maybe without that scene, one could've made some argument that the film didn't deal with the inhumanity of it all. With that scene it made it all clear what it was all about.I could barely speak when the film was over.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my eighth grade English teacher showed us Life is Beautiful the Friday before school let out, I had never even heard of it, much less knew what it was about. Well, after having seen the first forty-five minutes of this movie, I was entranced. I quickly went home and rented it from the local video store.I finally got around to watching it Saturday night. It was then that I discovered the absolute beauty of the movie. I laughed throughout the first part, the sat entranced through the second, both intrigued and horrified at the horrors of the concentration camps. I sobbed my way through the last ten minutes, then rewound the movie, sat down, and hugged my bewildered dog and cried for another twenty minutes.Life is Beautiful is an unforgettable film. You quite literally go through every single emotion you are capable of. Roberto Benigni's acting, through comedic and dramatic moments, is spectacular.Watch this movie.

		<shortDescription>One of the warmest, love-filled films I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written for my high school's weekly new supplement my junior year. I saw the Italian masterpiece Life is Beautiful twice before Thanksgiving and after I saw it I recommended it to just about everyone who crossed my path. Unlike the last brilliant film I reviewed, Rushmore, this film should certainly be enjoyed by everyone, as it is as worldly a movie as you can get. To say it is about this Holocaust is a gross understatement, for put together with the rest of the story which focuses on love, life, and love of life it almost serves as a background. The first half of this very different film by virtuoso writer, director, star Roberto Benigni is complete comedy. It portrays the enamored main character, a life-loving Italian Jew named Guido, chasing after the woman of his dreams, Dora (Benigni's real-life wife, Nicoletta Braschi), who is about to be forced into an unhappy marriage. The comedy is so pure, even if you don't enjoy some of the slapstick you cannot help be taken in by the heart that is at it source. Eventually, through a series of hilarious coincidences, he wins Dora over, and together they have a son, Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini).  Throughout the first half of the film, the audience catches glimpses of the evil that lies below the thick layer of humor and warmth. It is World War II, and the Fascist regime is growing in Italy, and through a sign here and anti-Semitic comment there we get the picture of what is going on. On Joshua's fifth birthday, he and Guido are taken away to a concentration/work camp in Italy. Trying to save her family, Dora, who is part of a prominent Italian family and not to be touched by the Fascists, begs to be placed on the train and gets her wish, only to be separated to a special women's camp. Innocent Joshua, though, wants to know what is going on, and Guido explains to him that this is a big trip that he has planned for Joshua's birthday. The rest of the film shows the different ways in which Guido convinces his son that the camp is all a game, and if you score one thousand points (for such things as good behavior, being quiet during the day, etc.), you win a real tank. Though occasionally Joshua senses something wrong, he has so much faith and love for his father that he wouldn't dare doubt him.  Though the second half of this film may seem depressing and unhappy by what I write, you will still smile at the love, warmth, and amazing humor that Guido, in this most awful time, still maintains just for the sake of his son. In the first part of the film, the visuals are full of life, color, and beauty (in certain instances to an almost unreal extent), but in the second part, many of the colors are dull and lifeless to contrast the change in environment with the struggling brightness of Guido's hope and joy. The beautiful score written for this film (including Offenbach's Barcarolle) is the perfect compliment to the different moods that are portrayed throughout the movie. By the end of this film, you are uplifted instead of put down by the bittersweet joy and the true beauty of life which is so wonderfully portrayed by Benigni's characters and story. The acting is a flawless blend of humor and pathos, and the fact that the film itself flows so extremely smoothly between its two distinct parts alone shows what immense talent Benigni possesses.  Life is Beautiful is a film that should be seen by anyone who has the chance to go out and see a movie. It is a shame that I am only given so much room to write about it, but I wouldn't want to give any of the surprises away either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully-executed celebration of human spirit - no more, no less.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Life is Beautiful' is a rarity ? a simply conceived and executed story about the strength of the human spirit in adversity. It is rare because it manages to deliver a message without beating you about the head with it and getting caught up in its own mission. Neither does it sternly point a finger at the audience which many Hollywood `message' films seem to do these days. Rather, it shows how, even in the conditions of Jewish persecution during the Second World War, people can rise above themselves for the sake of their loved ones. End of message.The film is a delicate balance of humour and pathos, and, unlike many other reviewers, I didn't feel the concentration camps were treated with levity or belittled. The horror is there, but understated. This was how many war victims and sufferers of other atrocities throughout the ages have managed to turn aside the terrible spirit-crushing events they endured ? with a gag or a laugh.Roberto Begnini is brilliant, and inhabits his character totally as though born to the part. The romance between him and his `Principesse' is touchingly romantic, and Giorgio Cantarini is terrific as little Joshua.I found this film very satisfying and moving, mostly because it said what it had to without moralizing, making its impact all the more effective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One-line summary? Don't miss this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I put off seeing this "romance" because of a basically grumpy temperament. Now I will want to see IL POSTINO as well. Don't want to miss any dimensions of humanity made available through a great and deep comic personality.I'm an older person who first learned of the Nazi concentration camps through documentary footage from the Nuremburg trials shown in my Texas high school. How to ever recover from this knowledge, much less the actual experience? Well, to paraphrase Andre Gide, you don't get to the far shore without losing sight of the shore behind you.Roberto Begnini and his fine cast welcome us to the far shore. Here, the love and care for family and children is far more important than any personal pain, even one's own death. That the character Guido is capable of clowning for the hidden eyes of the child while being taken away by an armed soldier is a lesson in courage as great as in the great samurai films.The quiet and surprisingly strong character of Dora gives a third point of support to the power of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL. Her insistence on going with her family to the camp is humbling when you recognize her options and test your own ability to sacrifice any comfort or advantage. The love between these three -- the adoration of the father by the child, the care between the parents and love for their child -- reflects a transcendent reality which is played against brute power in the ongoing battle between Heaven and Hell.How can we endure such pain? Through comedy, through love . . .And please also credit for depth of situation shown to the gentle old uncle, the Nazi doctor going crazy, the Italian school director easily embracing Fascism as she might embrace any other new educational fad. Also must credit the patient horse and the kitten. In SCHINDLER'S LIST (black and white), a touch of color, a little red coat, (thank you Akira Kurosawa -- see HIGH AND LOW) made sharply poignant the loss of a child in the camp. Here, a live kitten looking for the child who cared for it is left with the pile of clothing of the dead children. Life gone, life remaining.Life IS beautiful . . . the movie is teaching us. Learn, the undercurrent of it whispers, and live well. I'm really grateful for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of a man (Guido) who moves to a small Italian town to work for his uncle. Along the way he meets a beautiful "principessa" who falls from the sky. He runs into his princess again in the town - he later finds that she works in the local school. He naturally falls for her and invents ways of surprising her - sometimes contrived and simple but funny and romantic nevertheless.He steals her away from her fiance, opens the bookshop he dreamed of and everything seems fine... until 3 months before the end of the 2nd world war - did I mention he was Jewish???He and his son are taken to a prison camp and that's where the movie changes style. Guido is now fighting to keep his son alive. He invents a game for his son that will keep him away from the horrors of the war.Although the horrors were not made obvious by Benigni (why would he when you and I know what happened in WWII) we could see the desperation in Guido to hide the reality from his son so he may survive. I get chills just thinking about it as I write. Subtle in its horror but effective as a tragi-comedy.For those who do not understand Italian there is a point near the end of the film where a "riddle" is asked of Guido which I believe was meant as a hint to stay off the trucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slapstick humor in a holocaust film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You betcha. But it's not as offensive as you think. In fact, it's not offensive at all. It's a powerful and moving film about the power of family and what one man will do when that family is threatened. The plot is as follows: after Germans attack Italy, Guido and his family are forced into a concentration camp. Guido spends most of the rest of the film desperately trying to convince his young son that the holocaust is nothing but a game- and that the child has to keep out of sight in order to win. He promises him that the winner will earn a full size tank- and the boy does get a tank at the end of the film, just not in the way he thinks he will. The first hour or so is pure slapstick/romantic comedy, and the second hour or so is moving and heartbreaking- with touches of humor to(I assume) keep the audience from becoming too depressed or disturbed. I was amazed at how it could dramatically shift from comedy to drama so quickly. Try to watch this film without crying. If you don't, even just a bit, there's something seriously wrong with you.</fullReview>

The story, the performances, the entire theme of a person performing his duties as a husband, as a father is very 'moving' and inspiring.This may be one of the best films ever made. I've never seen a movie with such a balance of hysterical comedy and serious drama. Roberto Benigni totally deserved his Oscars. People on this site have said such negative things about him and this film. Mr. Benigni had a lot of guts to make this film, and there's not another film like it. He handled both the comedy and drama aspects beautifully. I loved the beautiful cinematography, scenery, and the characters.This is one of those movies that have a lasting effect on you. After watching it, I found that it has less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the human feelings and the beautiful relationship of a father and his son. The holocaust provides the ultimate context, that brings and highlights the story and adds yet another deep dimension to the movie. No such piece of art has ever before combined laughter and tears of sadness in me before and that is the miracle of the movie. The realism of the movie is not its strong point, but then again it is not supposed to be; this helps in bringing the audiences to a state of mind away from reality, focusing on the feelings generated by forgetting about all external events and developments of the war. Despite that, the movie does not fail to point out an element of the nazi psychology demonstrated by the doctor who was obsessed with riddles. This portrayed the nazi 'state of mind' (if ever such an expression existed) as a sick mentally disturbed state. Life is really beautiful as you watch Guido's relentless efforts to make a lovely exciting experience of the concentration camp to his son. You get exhausted just watching him going through his painful day and yet you smile as he speaks to his son and makes him laugh. One can go on forever describing the creativity of this movie, but one will not be able to capture all its beauty in writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a wonderful story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this movie last week, and it really touched my heart. It was not about the Holocaust and how Jews were killed or tortured, but instead it was how love can keep the spirit alive to go through tough times. Roberto Benigni did a wonderful job playing the character of Guido. I was so impressed to see how nothing was impossible to Guido. His hyper personality got him in trouble all the time, but his spontaneous personality helped him to find quick solutions in a very intelligent way. Guido showed us how he devoted himself to his son, even though they were in a terrible situation. He used humor and jokes to protect his son from minimizing the horrible reality that him and his family were going through at the concentration camp. Even at the most bitter moment he sweetened everyone's and his son's life with a joke or a smile. It was really shocking to me that right before Guido was killed he made sure that his son was safe and he was still joking and smiling even though he knew that he was going to be killed. This movie was made so beautifully that I strongly recommend it to anyone to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theater and always remembered it as an amazing movie that was incredibly funny and inspirational. I saw it again today and was as moved and impressed more in every aspect. The casting is perfection. The story is perfection. The acting was perfection. I don't see how you could make a better movie. I laughed. I cried. I hated and I loved. This movie is quintessential Italian and it is true to the horror of the Nazi beliefs and the the horror of all dictatorial regimes. It shows courage in the face of unbelievable hate and it is passionate love story. It is a remarkable movie in every respect. So, was it true to the horrors of Nazi Germany? I have no idea. I am guessing not. The movie does not in any way make light or dismiss the Nazis or their fanatical hatred. In fact it is a central element of creating the tension for the movie and the protagonist. Frankly, I think every human being would be better by seeing this movie. Either you would just laugh and not get into any deeper meaning or you would be inspired to live your life more passionately with love for every human being.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sentimental and contrived, Benigni's well-intentioned Holocaust framed may only work as a children's fable. Inexplicably, it won a prize at the 1998 Cannes Festival. Audiences will be laughing hysterically while crying their eyes out. If this is a fantasy, it is probably a compensation we need when facing the reality of history. The film's highlight is one man's battle to keep the ugliness of the world from his innocent son, no matter how ugly the world might be, and in this case that means the death camps of the Nazis. I think you have to give this film credit just for having the guts to address a heavy subject like the Holocaust in the manner done here, which is predominately with a lighthearted tone. That's a big risk, but it mostly pays off here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Fantastic film where the story telling aspect is the most important element of this film, yes the acting is great and well shot, but ultimately the story is king. We are able to believe in true story telling again. The art is not lost, regardless of how anything is shot, it's all technical and it's another reason to debate something long enough. A Funny film that has many depths of value. Great acting within a surreal environment beautiful scenes that do leave you feeling so good and slightly teary eyed to. Highly recommend this film Life is Beautiful is a wonderful script. I can't recommend the story enough. one will not be disappointed with this film. A wonderful cinema experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"silly and fake title" you think ?? , I dare you to watch it and say anything other than "La vita ? bella". I adore the cinema because of this movie cause I had this idea after watching it "if movies can make people change and leave that impression on them so the cinema is the religion that unites human beings and I believe in cinema." Guido "Benigni" a Jewish man with his wife and son in a concentration camp is confronted with the worst conditions for a human being and believes that the life is beautiful. can he prove it ?? can the world prove the contrary ?? I will say what Roger Ebert said : "In the real death camps there would be no role for Guido. But Life Is Beautiful is not about Nazis and Fascists, but about the human spirit." and I'll say nothing else.please watch it and love the CINEMA!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful, inspiring story of love and hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no real idea of what I was about to watch when I put on "Life is Beautiful". I wasn't prepared for dubbing or the era of the movie. I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I came around to appreciate the storyline. Here was a man intent on maintaining his optimism, love of life and appreciation of all the good things he was surrounded by.The holocaust story was inevitable, as you saw the inference towards the Jews, but it was so secondary to the eternal quest for this man to keep his wife and child happy, safe a reassured in circumstances I could never imagine. It truly was a lovely, positive, wonderful story, and I would never imagine saying that about any film involving the Holocaust. Forgive my happy review amongst the terror of what occurred. The director, actors and all involved did an excellent job. Congratulations to you all, and thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a beautiful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie about the Holocaust must be undertaken with great care. Some may be offended by the humor in "Life is Beautiful", and say that the concentration camp is not realistic. But it is important to note that the voice-over narration at the very end tells us that the story is being told through the eyes of Joshua, the son. His father Guido was able to protect him from the true horrors of the camp, and that is why it is a sanitized, not realistic perspective of his early life. This movie is not primarily about the Holocaust, but rather about the human qualities that can make life beautiful. These include courage, opitmism, a sense of humor, perseverance and the ability to love sacrificially. One of the best films I have seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schopenhauer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I didn't remember the references to Schopenhauer, but now I've read said philosopher and was thinking about the point in using him in this movie. At first it seems like a mistake. After all, Schopenhauer is of the major philosophers, the most pessimistic. So it's strange to have him portrayed positively in such an optimistic movie. I think the movie is reinterpreting his philosophy from an optimistic perspective. Reinterpretation is a strong part of all classic works. For example, Virginia Woolfe has a crazy man interpret Shakespeare as being a misanthrope in 'Mrs. Dalloway.' Basically, Schopenhauer says that humans are conditioned by evolution to choose life over everything horrible that could happen, and that we have no choice but to obey. 'Life is Beautiful' takes this reality to be a positive. Really, it's an affirmation of the inherent goodness of life. So I think the Schopenhauer references work perfectly here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This little anecdote well describes the film.I hate crying. I never cry on principle. I wouldn't cry if my old neighbour was run over while crossing the road or my boss had a heart attack. If my next door shop ran out of my favourite sweets, or if Clinton declared World War III, I wouldn't cry.But I was in tears after watching Life is Beautiful. The only thing I could think of was how stupid I would look when the lights would be on. But when the lights went on, I saw a panorama of white tissues wiping off the tears of the desperate spectators. We were all crying like babies. Kids, daddies and grannies, they all seemed about to commit suicide.Life is Beautiful is a universal movie, able to move anybody's heart. And this is because it's a love-story between a father and his child, it's an emotional journey through the atrocities of the Holocaust, it's a ray of joy and hope that fights against human wickedness.The plot is basic: an Italian-Jewish family is deported to a labour camp during World War II. Here, all sorts of atrocities happen. The extraordinary thing about the film, that makes it different from Schindler's List, for instance, is that these atrocities never really affect the child. His father, played by director and Oscar winner Roberto Benigni, tries in every way to prevent his son from realizing the truth. He in fact tells him that the camp is like a big playground and that they both have to work hard to get points in order to win a big tank. The child, so deluded, can somehow bear the painful situation.The film is not a description of the Holocaust. Rather, it's the experience of the Holocaust seen through the eyes of a child who thinks it's all a game. The movie is not disrespectful towards Jews or the Holocaust, it is, on the contrary, all pervaded with sentiment and compassion. It's the tragedy of two human beings that are dying and still manage to keep their hopes and dreams alive.Life is Beautiful is a film that makes you cry as well as makes you smile. And laugh. The energy of the two protagonists coincides with their capacity to fight, to see a reason to live, a reason to laugh, to have a moment of carefree joy, despite the labour, despite the menace of death, despite the inevitability.Three Oscars won for Best Foreign Film, Best Actor and Best Original Score. Best film of the year and the best film I have seen in my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Begnigni ? Genio (Begnigni's a Genius)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On seeing this film, my first thought (after wiping the tears from my eyes) was "My god, he pulled it off." I can think of only one other director who's dealt with the Holocaust in a comedic film and done it with any depth, and his name was Chaplin -- and "The Great Dictator" was made before the horrors of the Final Solution were known to the world. Chaplin didn't have to deal with that baggage. Begnigni did, and did so brilliantly.The film begins as an earthy comedy as only the Italians can do and ends as a dark tragedy with a hopeful note -- and the transition from one to the other is seamless. In fact, the latter half of the film would not work without all the meticulous set-ups of the first half. That we get to meet Begnigni's character, see his world and hopes and dreams, makes it all only more poignant as they are threatened with destruction. On top of this, the first half of the film is reminiscent of "Amaracord" (one of my favorite films) in appearance -- possibly a result of it being set in the same period, possibly intentional. (Begnigni pulls off at least one homage to "The Bicycle Thief," among other films, during the first act and a half.)Anyway... I really debated with myself before seeing the film, thinking, "Hm. A comedy... about the Holocaust. Do I want to deal with that tonight?" I went, I saw, and the film conquered me. Fellini made me suspect that the Italians might be film geniuses... "La Vita ? Bella" made me realize they are film gods...See it. Now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider this is perhaps the best movie in any foreign language i have seen yet. Its plot is so gripping and inspiring you wont believe till the end. The performance by Italian actor Roberto benggini was so superb. The whole film is full of humorous jokes and moves. In reality he was trying to just try to divert the attention of his loved ones from the cruelties , desperation and sadness of life. The most impressive is the way he be fools his son that when they are caught in the web of Holocaust administered by Nazi Germans , he tells him and other folks that this is just a game , the won who scores most points in it will emerge as victorious and the prize is brand new tank. I loved the way really never let his son know what is going on in his surrounding and saves him from the pain , sadness and disappointment about the future. I think such films can motivate us very much about the way of living our lives. I recommend it highly to watch. If you are not moved by watching it then i am quite sorry about you but it will one day impress you one day if you watch it again at least. Master piece for ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fantastic film - a must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I consider this one of the finest films ever made. The acting is flawless and I find it hard to understand why people consider that the film somehow cheapens the horrors of the holocaust.For those who think its historically inaccurate, I agree, it undoubtedly is. There's probably nothing which could express the sheer terror of the holocaust. But I feel that criticisms like that are somewhat missing the point as this is not first and foremost a film about the holocaust, its instead a film about how love survives in an impossible situation - and how there can be hope in even the worst situations. Life really is beautiful as this film demonstrates.I think the fact that the film does not show the true horrors of the holocaust explicitly does not lessen its impact at all (although not explicit there are plenty of clues throughout the second part, such as the shower scene with the uncle).A must see film - highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie last night as it was listed as a favourite by my partner. I left the movie with a greater appreciation for the love a parent has for their child and the sense that under extreme duress sometimes its humour that drags you through to the other side. Yes it wasn't accurate, yes it was a caffeine free Holocaust Lite, but its not Schindler's List - nor a documentary. No-one with half a brain would expect that, yet here amongst all these reviews are people lambasting the movie for not being 100% factual. Last night I felt a greater empathy for what the Jews, Gypsies, Intellectuals, Political Dissidents, Blacks, Gays and all the others went through in the atrocities of Nazi Germany, but once again the belligerent attitude that accompanies any mention of The Holocaust has soured it. No-one is discounting any of the horror, but that wasn't what this movie is about. I would have thought that a movie embracing the triumph of human spirit over adversity would have been embraced by those that didn't agree with the less than factual nature of the portrayal of the camp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is a beautiful movie. In it, a young man who clowns through every problem meets and wins the woman of his dreams. They marry, have a son, and are ready to live happily ever after.But the man is Jewish and the Nazi persecution overtakes him. As the boy, then about six years old, and his father are being taken to a concentration camp, their mother and wife refuses to be left behind and insists on going with them. Once there, the couple are separated, and both must do hard labor. Children are rounded up and killed, but the father saves and hides the boy, whom he gets to cooperate by persuading him it's all a game.Toward the end of the film, the allies are about to liberate the camp, and those in charge are getting rid of the inmates. The father takes risks in trying to protect his son and find his wife. He's caught and shot, but the boy survives and rejoins his mother.The mixture of comedy and intense drama works because very skillful acting by all three principals conveys the depth and beauty of the relationships among man and wife, parents and son. Their love shines in darkness that cannot overcome it.Ideologues complain because this movie fails to meet their criteria. So much the worse for their criteria! I rate it a 9 out of the possible 10. It's one of the finest films I've ever seen, certainly better than most that have won acclaim since 1960.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While some may complain that Life is Beautiful does not portray death camps in the appropriate level of detail or realism, the simple fact is: Life is Beautiful is not intending to be a faultlessly accurate portrayal of concentration camps in World War II Germany. It could also be pointed out that very few (if not none) contemporary movies can even come close to fully portraying the horrors endured by Jewish, Polish, and Gypsy people in such camps.That said, the film itself needs to be addressed. Life is Beautiful follows one idealistic and offbeat Jewish man's life, love, and experiences when the Germans take he and his family. The central plotline is this man (played sensitively by Roberto Beninini, who also wrote and directed the movie) trying to keep his son alive and sane in the camp. In this way, the film sometimes reminded me of Hogan's Heroes, with a Jewish man in place of the American soldiers- with the Nazis being the butt of jokes and generally being outsmarted by Bennini.But to say this piece is a fairy tale or a comedy far from the truth, while it is true that the movie never really approaches the real horror of a concentration camp- that is not to say that it is a happy movie. It is feel good, I'll give it that, but you will cry during the movie. Perhaps it is the fairytale quality that makes such loss all the more powerful, and when you consider a lot of this movie is focused around a confused and naive child, it is actually powerfully done. By 'glossing over' the horrors (as a child undoubtedly could), the inevitability of loss is made so much more painful.This movie was, and still is, one of the finest movies I've had the pleasure of watching. The subtitles are a minor issue, but easily overlooked. Simply put, Life is Beautiful is one of the few emotionally driven movies to be acknowledged as real cinema in recent years.See if you liked: Big Fish, The Devil's Arithmetic, The Green Mile. Strengths: Has the viewer's emotions on a string, excellent music. Weaknesses: Lacks realism and subtitles can be distracting,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is Mostly Simplistic - (Minor Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life Is Beautiful - ReviewLIB is about Guido (Roberto Benigni) and how he deals with life. Set in Italy during World War II, the story follows Guido in two stages of his life. First, Guido meets then courts Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). In the second part, Guido along with Dora, now as his wife, and son Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini) become prisoners of war and sent to a concentration camp.Guido takes whatever life serves him and turns it around to make it funny. In one scene, he takes a horse that has been marked by vandals with derogatory remarks and changes the writing into artwork, masking the original words. He then uses the horse to help woo Dora. When Guido and his son Giosue end up together in a concentration camp, Guido turns the situation around by pretending the camp is part of a game he entered his son into. The many rules Guido invents include explanations about German soldiers, military uniforms, and camp personnel speaking only in German. There is a points system to rate the 'contestants' (fellow POWs), and the 'prize' is a tank. The youth buys off on the increasingly ridiculous lies that Guido is forced to tell to try and keep the truth that they are POWs from his son.The first part of the movie is comical but leaves viewers uninvolved. It does well to set up Guido as a joker with a kind heart, but ends up running a bit too long to accomplish only that.The second part of the movie brings us some important problems with Guido and Giosue's situation. Giosue is your average incredibly inquisitive child. He sees what's going on around him, as well as hearing rumors on death. The camp smells terrible and has a limited selection of food. Even at five years old, it's difficult to believe that Giosue would continue to follow his father's words about 'the game' in the face of the overwhelming and unavoidable reality of life in a concentration camp. Somehow, Guido's horror-stricken campmates find the energy to give the game a little push (or at least to not spoil it), which borders on the unbelievable. Somehow, Giosue is able to fit in with the German children without talking, and is able to reap some of the benefits of being on the side of the prison-keepers as opposed to the prisoners.In the end, we never learn of the consequences of Guido's lies. One hopes that Guido's deceit doesn't affect Giosue adversely, but dishonesty of such a magnitude (especially with children) rarely comes without repercussions. People generally have a feeling about when they are being deceived, and this causes changes in how they deal with and trust in people. While it might seem innocuous to fabricate such a tale to shield the youth from the reality of a concentration camp, it would be shortsighted to ignore the aftermath that will follow Giosue around for the rest of his life.In conclusion, I enjoyed the movie and would watch it again. The plot was a bit simplistic and the comedy only lightly entertaining, so I wouldn't expect much value from seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>war through the eyes of a clown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that somebody could make a comedy about World War II and Holocaust without being cynical or stupid. But Roberto Benigni managed to overwhelm with his mix of horrifying reality and unparalleled optimism. The movie gets directly to your senses from the very first moment and makes you laugh, cry, hate and hope simultaneously.I knew Benigni as a brilliant actor from, for instance, Jim Jarmush's Down by Law, but I didn't know he was such a talented director. To me, La Vita é bella is the best film ever that shows in a very subtle way how the war destroys people's lives, and at the same time proves that the life remains really beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>La Vita e Bella (Life is Beautiful) is without a doubt one of the most incredible movies I have ever seen, in any language! The trickery of Roberto Benigni's directing is his ability to make you laugh while you sit and watch horrified, and then manage to keep you from tears until the very end. At the time I first saw this film, I had yet to see anything nearly as satisfying, and it still stands as one of my favorite films now. I just need to remember to watch it with tissues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is simply brilliant. Casting aside all of the trappings of modern movie-making (special effects, brain-jarring sound, big name stars, bizarre plots and settings, language sex and big explosions) it produces instead a film which captivates audiences because of its simplicity, classy acting and the sheer beauty of its tale. In what may well be the hallmark of a great movie, opinions of LIB are markedly polarised - the number of '1' votes are about equal to the range of 2-6, strongly illustrating that it is difficult to be indifferent to this movie. This is a major difference between LIB and most of what Hollywood churns out where indifference is the only acceptable response. It saddens me that so many people have failed to recognise the charm of this film by choosing to take offence at the way in which the Holocaust was portrayed. I am not Jewish (or Romany, Eastern European, handicapped etc) and would not attempt to presume to tell any of these groups how to react to this portrayal but I can say that I was more moved, more hurt by man's inhumanity towards man, by LIB than I was by Schindler's List or any other Holocaust movie or doco. I, like many others, came out of this film wanting all my friends to go see it. The sub-titles in no way detract from the experience, in fact they are hardly noticeable after a little while. My vote 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not only about the Holocaust.It is about surviving in a hostile world, that goes past hostile into crazy, with only wit and humor as a weapon.It is about shielding the child you love more than life itself from realizing the unimaginable horrors surrounding it.It is about letting your child inside loose in "normal" life and protecting you children from hostility and harm in an "abnormal" life.It is about sacrificing oneself for the ones you love.Roberto Benigni made me laugh and cry at the same time. This film touched me in many ways. With endless optimism Guido takes on the task of living his own life in a hostile world to say the least. When in a concentration camp with his son he uses stories and games and smiles to keep the HOPE alive.We don't have to SEE the horror around them to FEEL it. The only time when horror is really shown, it is during a foggy surroundings and looks more like a painting. Knowing what is there is quite enough.This movie made me think about all the people who did not survive the Holocaust. Maybe, and hopefully, some of them had their Guido to help them keep their HOPE alive till the end.Bravo Roberto!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Just the fact that I am writing this review says A LOT about this movie. I have been going to movies religiously for as long as I can remember, and I have always seen films that I have considered "greatness", i.e.: Fargo, Saving Private Ryan. But this film reached a new plateau within my film criticism rankings. I am currently studying film in college, and I can't describe to you how this film has changed the way I will forever judge my own work in the future. This film has some sort of raw human touch, But much different from other "human touch" films, I didn't realize I was becoming emotionally involved with the characters. It just sort of got inside me like a virus and subconsciously helped me enjoy the movie.The only negative criticism I've read about this cinematic masterpiece is that from people who are angered by the fact that it looks lightly on the holocaust. It seems that these critics are upset because it doesn't show "true justice" on how the nazis tortured the jews. All I have to say to those critics is: Hey, everyone knows the nazis treated the jews like animals, we don't need another movie to remind us! If I had survived the holocaust I would MUCH rather see this movie than one that would bring all the horrible memories back.Also...if your thinking about not seeing this movie because of the subtitles DON'T WORRY. This is my first subtitled film and everyone told me before I went in that I wouldn't notice them after awhile. And I was like "yeah right, this is going to suck having to look at the bottom of the screen the whole time". But it's true!! I was bothered the first 5 minutes or so because I'm a slow reader and I was having trouble keeping up. But I soon got with the pace. As I was driving home from the theater I thought to myself "hey, that movie had subtitles".Well, as this is my first "review" of a film ever, I hope it wasn't too bad for everyone to read. .....anyway, go see "La Vita ? Bella" !!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best piece of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While writing the comment on this movie I was just wondering what kind of words I should use for the appraisal of this master piece. I am an Indian and I saw this movie in Hindi dubbing. But the language is not a matter of barrier for such piece of art to communicate the mass. The liveliness of Guido till the end of his life is really inspiring. And the depiction of scenario during 2nd world war is very realistic. The movie starts with fun, comedy along with his friend Feroccio and then his romance mix with fun with Dora. The scenario becomes darker when they are kept in jail but still Mr. Guido keeps the movie alive as well as his son from Nazis. The most touching part comes when Guido is taken by the soldiers to kill and he tries to make his son smile for the last time and his promise to his son for the tank is fulfilled when the US army comes. The movie is a comedy with a hidden tragedy. It's a story of a father, his love for his son and for his wife under the shadow of world and the activities of Nazi during the time. We should also thank Mr. Roberto Benigni for such a beautiful piece of art. The movie has a long lasting effect on the viewers who have to think about the movie and Mr. Guido, the character whom the movies run around. Life is always beautiful for such a person because he makes life beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, a brief summary of the film(without spoiling the plot): Roberto Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a Jewish man who moves to Arezzo with his brother. With the help of his humour, some daring and quite a lot of luck, he wins over a Nicoletta Braschi's character, a schoolteacher. Five years later, he and his son are taken to a concentration camp, but his wife successfully manages to persuade the Nazis to let her in too.La Vita ? Bella is on of those rare films that has the quality to make you laugh and to make you cry within its two hour runtime. Its starts as a romantic comedy(with some very funny gags) but ends as a wartime drama; a fact that may send viewers into confusion, but ,personally, I enjoyed it. The fact that it is in Italian didn't put me off at all.The calibre of the acting is superb, particularly that of Roberto Benigni in the lead role and that of the young child actor, Giorgio Cantarini.The music compliments the bittersweet tone of the film excellently, as does the contrasting vibrant cinematography at the start and then the dull grey concentration camp at the end.Overall, a stunning performance from Benigni not just as an actor but as a director and scriptwriter as well. I think that he thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar, and was unlucky to lose in the best director and best script categories. I have not seen Shakespeare in Love, the film which La Vita ? Bella lost to in the best picture category, but judging by the standard of this film, I'm not sure whether it deserved it or not.Having looked at some of the other reviews for this film, I have been shocked to see that many people don't even like it. For those who say it is not a true depiction of the nazi camp, then I say that they are right but this is not meant to be a film just about the harshness of the holocaust, but a film primarily about Roberto Benigni's relationship with his son. The humour I leave up to you, but I personally found it very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know little about the acting career of Roberto Benigni but I was told by a famous film tutor ( Who`s Jewish by the way ) that Benigni plays more or less the same character in every single film he appears in and I have no doubt this is true And after seeing his performance as Guido in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and seeing Benigni clamber over several rows of seats to accept the Oscar as best actor I can`t help thinking Benigni is unable to play ANY character that ISN`T Roberto Benigni This film is about the holocaust - The greatest example of mans inhumanity to man - and that`s why it`s undeservedly well regarded . The scenes in the concentration camp are touching sad and funny as Guido explains to his son Giosue that they`re actually taking part in a contest to win a tank , but it also means sitting through a whole lot of irritating dross featuring Guido wooing his Princess . In fact the whole first half of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL ( Written , directed , produced by and starring Roberto Benigni ) is an ordeal to sit through unless you`re a fan of Benigni . To be blunt if anyone deserved an Oscar it was Giorgio Cantarini as Best Supporting Actor as Giosue who gives perhaps the most memorable performance by a child actor I have ever seen To be even more blunt I`m getting fed up with both holocaust films and the way they`re over rewarded at film award ceremonies . If you want to know about the horrors and dangers facing Jews and wider human civilisation go and watch one of Pierre Rehov`s documentaries which are often held at Jewish cinema festivals where after the screenings security guards have to check under the seats to make sure no one has left a bomb for the next audience sitting , or access a website featuring a young self employed Jewish man called Nick Berg who went to Iraq to help with the reconstruction and where he was captured by Islamic terrorists who then brutally murder him by holding him on the ground and slowly hack his head off with a knife .Not praising LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL or indeed any holocaust movie is not anti semetism</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is beautiful, but man is not. I felt strange as I left the theater for this movie, I was impressed by the imagination that poignantly proved that love and the human spirit could conquer all, even during the worst of times. The trouble was that the worst of times was the Holocaust in an Italian concentration camp, and I kept thinking - this is terrible! As time goes on and the Holocaust becomes a thing of history, and as less survivors are alive to remember the travesty that mankind let occur, Benigni is being praised for making a film that DOES trivialize some very serious subject matter. History that is only half a century old. I think the film itself is a noble and creative effort, much like the characters in the film, but the cartoonish depiction of genocide and desperation did not sit well with me. The audience I was with laughed and cried on cue. They were manipulated. Just like the Nazi's were manipulated in Germany. I'm sure Benigni's intentions were noble, but noble intentions don't merit unconditional praise and Academy Awards. Maybe we should feel good for the child that was saved form the horror of his situation, and then maybe we should pity him for his ignorance. I'm not so sure, but I'm not laughing and crying on cue. I didn't hate this film, but I don't understand how one could love it.</fullReview>

This movie is on the same level of Patch Adams: cheesy, brainless and horrible.Everything in this film is weak: the script, the pacing, the cinematography, and especially the acting. Roberto Benigni winning an Oscar is the equivalent of Danielle Steel winning a Nobel Prize in literature. The only point of this movie is to make the viewer cry.If you are interested in a foreign film that shows how the relationship between an doomed father and an unwitting child should be played, watch the Russian film Burnt by the Sun.

		<fullReview>There are very few movies, no matter how bad, where I come away personally disliking all those involved. "Life is Beautiful" is one of those movies. Why because beneath the shiny, happy coating "Life is Beautiful" embodies a narcisstic and almost nihilistic view of the world; I say this because Begnini et al. are apparently willing to use genocide to infuse a poorly written, badly acted, and sloppily directed movie with dignity it doesn't deserve. And make no mistake this movie is all three. The drama is fake, the segments don't flow, the acting sophomoric, the history laughable, and the characters stereotypes at best. Begnini can do slapstick and there is a funny bit or two, but these add up to nothing and seem positively grotesque in light of what comes later. This movie is the most banal and manipulative sort of crowd pleaser, the sort that assumes the crowd is composed entirely of idiots, but because it nominally concerns the holocaust otherwise intelligent people are unwilling to call the movies cynical little game for what it is, fearing the -"What you didn't like 'Life is Beautiful?!' No don't say anything else you don't have a soul," or the more common, "Well go back to your Jerry Bruckheimer movies." Well in all honesty that's an insult to Mr. Bruckheimer. His movies may insult my intelligence, but never to the level this movie did. At the predictable and overdone ending I remember thinking, "I know what you want me to do movie, but there's no way I'm buying." Worse this movie is an insult to anyone who had to suffer because of the Nazis and their fascist allies. Watching this movie I'm reminded of how Salem, MA uses historical atrocity as a kitchy tourist draw (going so far as to put witches on broomsticks on the sides of police cars). Begnini uses the holocaust to draw in suckers in the same way. Group Mr. Begnini with the all those in the holocaust industry who are willing to use the worst atrocity of the 20th century to open wallets and flatter their inflated egos. Beyond being an insult to the victims of National Socialism this movie is terrible because it crowds out much better movies on the same subject. Everyone chalks in "Life is Beautiful" as their art movie of the month and ignores better movies on the holocaust like "The Ogre," "Invincible," or "Heimat."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful is an Italian film that released in 1998 in USA. It is the story of happy-go-lucky Jewish man named Guido who is married with a son. The story is set in World War II in Italy where the Fascist Party is in power. And during the course of the story, Guido and his son are taken to a concentration camp. What Guido does to keep his son safe forms the rest of the story. Roberto Benigni plays Guido, the loving doting father and husband to perfection. His performance makes it so easy for us to love his character and to cheer him on. His son in the movie, played by Giorgio Cantarini, is also exceptional. After watching this movie, I was moved by how much Guido works to make sure his son is fine. It made me appreciate a father's role in a family more. All in all, this is a film that no one should miss. I recommend that you watch it whenever you have the time and after watching this movie, I believe you will appreciate your fathers more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1939 Italy. Jewish Guido (Roberto Benigni) tries to open a bookstore but he continues to face hurdles with a smile. He falls for the lovely Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). She is engaged to an ambitious government official but she runs off with Guido. They get married and have a son named Joshua. The fascists would catch up to them but Guido would pretend the camp to be a giant game so that he can hide the truth from his son.Roberto Benigni is going for extremely broad comedy here which turns eventually. The movie is always a bit odd to have slapstick comedy while the audience knows perfectly well what is happening. It makes the movie unfunny. The movie is much more compelling as a heartfelt drama.</fullReview>

Now I understand why he was so excited, as I hadn't seen the film until now.Not knowing anything about the story, I thought the first half of the movie was wonderfully whimsical and creative, especially with the way Guido managed to manipulate outcomes in his quest to win Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). The writing for these sequences was genuinely inspired with priceless comic touches that warm the heart. The Prince wins his Princess and all is well in the world.I wasn't quite sure how to process events in the second half of the movie, knowing that such antics as displayed by Guido could certainly never have occurred in a Nazi concentration camp. But I kept coming back to an early statement Uncle Elisio (Giustino Dorano) made to Guido quoted in my summary line above. Perhaps the second half of the film is totally unrealistic, but it was necessary for the film makers to get away with this technique to make their case for finding and keeping hope in an impossible situation. Not only did Guido insure that his young son Joshua (Giorgio Canterini) would survive the ordeal, but actually flourish in a hostile environment until the war ended.If I had my preference, Guido would have survived the concentration camp as well since this is a fictional story. But perhaps it's better that some heartbreak was mingled with the joy of Joshua reuniting with his mother. The ending reinforces the idea that joy and sorrow both exist in the world for everyone in different degrees and at different times and that life is not a hopeless condition. Rather a journey to be lived to the fullest with freedom secure in one's own heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Is Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I laughed, I cried, and could not stop. Half love story- half-Holocaust drama- this is Roberto Benigni's masterpiece and he deserved all the recognition he got. An amazing experience of a film. I was especially taken with the sheer humanity of the story, and the way Benigni told it while not compromising his role as actor. There is a whimsy to the love story, and a dark humor to the drama. It's a sad but brave film about survival, humor, and the amazing power of love. It is an experience to behold, and to see again. There is a reason why Benigni was so excited to win, for he had a winning film, and while I may not understand Italian, I was taken with the romance of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dramatic comedy "Life is beautiful" is a very touching film. Roberto Benigni's extraordinary, thanks to its humor, the story during the second world war is not like no one would expect ... we would be much closer to a comedy. The German officers are often put in ridiculous situation, smiles a lot. This film is absolutely breathless we can not win every scene makes us want to know what happened, he will surprise us all the way. The life of this little boy is just amazing, thanks to his father. However, some are strong and scene reminds us the hell this period. We will not compare this film to "Schindler's List" or "For Those I Loved" but it's really about the same period, marking that it is essential not to forget. A film that absolutely must not miss ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most unforgettable/unmissable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie it was in my Italian class in 7th grade, didn't expect it to be that good. I actually remember all of my class shed tears which was surprising to me. I am now 18 and I still haven't forgotten about it. This movie is one of these unique movies that once you've seen it you will never forget. The loveliest thing about it, is that even though it is a tough story there is still surprisingly enough a very good sense humour.I suggest it to everyone, no matter what kind of tastes do you have when it comes to movies. This is definitely a must seen. But I do not believe I can ever re-watch this movie again, it is for me a very moving experience, that cannot be lived a second time.</fullReview>

This movie created my fascination for foreign films, but I have not yet encountered a film as perfect as this one. Yes, you have to read subtitles, but trust me it is worth it. This movie contains so much love that you have no other choice but to begin loving this movie as a response to the overwhelming emotions you'll have.

		<shortDescription>A comedic, solemn, tragic romance all in one film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did feel really sad after the movie, but I feel like they made too much of a comedy out of this, so it wasn't as impactful as it could've been. Benigni does a really good job in his character, and the whole film basically rides on his shoulders. The rest of the cast weren't that important though they did play necessary roles.The first half of the film, we see Guido cruising along and winning people over with his humour and wit ? which led me to believe that this film was something like a three idiots movie. However that was not the case, and maybe if they played down the comedic element just a bit, it would've been a lot more effective.During the second half, it was pretty heartbreaking to watch him interact with his son and being so cheerful while death and suffering surrounds them. But the Holocaust being a really serious topic, Guido felt just a bit too comfortable/ cheerful in the camp. I get that he was like that for the son, but if we just saw a little breakdown of his character or something like that, it would've added so much more depth to the film instead of his character being kind of two dimensional. Another thing is that he seems to move around freely and from my knowledge, that is not so easy in a concentration camp. Just a thought.Overall, this was a really great film with an emphasis on family, love and hope, and had great characters and actors to complement.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Foreign Language Movie I Have Ever, And Probably Will Ever See.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roberto Begnini's Italian masterpiece is won that brings out every emotion that you have deep within yourself to strong degrees. You laugh, cry, cheer, among other. He rightfully won the Academy Award for Best Foreign language movie and went crazy. That was an easy win. Later, he won for Best Actor. As astonishing as Begnini was, Edward Norton was still more worthy for the win. In some of my lists and reviews, I say Norton in American History X is the best acting performance in film history, so I knew Begnini would be inferior. I wasn't trying to be stubborn or biased. If Dustin Hoffman defeated Norton for Rain Man, I would disagree, but I would not mind either. Either way, Life Is Beautiful is a life changing movie with a marvellous story and top-notch acting.The first half of the flick is a romantic-comedy, leaning more toward the comedy portion. During World War II, Begnini plays comical waiter, Guido who's world of fun can get him out of sticky situations. He meets a school teacher named Dora whom he immediately falls for and tries to woo. She eventually gets out of the marriage with an arrogant millionaire she is forced to marry and sides with Guido. This first bit could be a movie all its own. But they did do a movie with almost this exact storyline at around the same time which was Titanic. Life Is Beautiful's bit is more funny and heartwarming. Some of the jokes that Guido does is a stroke of genius on Begnini's behalf. The second half picks up a few years after Dora runs off with Guido and we see them together with a son named Joshua and Guido owning the bookstore he wanted since the start. We also learn that he is Jewish. Guido and Joshua are taken to a concentration camp when Guido must think quickly on his feet on ways to protect his son from the horrors of the Holocaust they will face. He puts his knack for comedy to the test saying that they are contestants in a game where they must earn points and first prize is a tank, and he makes jokes every time Joshua sees or hears something ugly. What's really great about the jokes is that they are actually funny. I know that it is in the middle of a concentration camp, but still. Begnini had to water-down the Holocaust to make the movie believable and lasting. I think that history gurus may not be a fan of the Holocaust being so friendly in compared to how it really was. But this movie isn't about war, it is about courage, honour and the power of love. Guido is a very inspiring character that Begnini was born to play. As good as Norton was, Begnini also blew me away. He is a clown that will do anything to protect his family before himself. None of these themes and characters could have been presented better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best cinematic experience ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you still have not watched this movie it is a real pity. This Academy Award Winning flick is certainly one of the most engrossing, captivating gem of a movie. Benigni did everything in this film. He wrote, produced, directed and probably swept the floors at night. There is that much raw energy in this film.This is one of those movies that have a lasting effect on you. After watching it, I found that it has less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the human feelings and the beautiful relationship of a father and his son. The holocaust provides the ultimate context, that brings and highlights the story and adds yet another deep dimension to the movie. Life Is Beautiful manages to walk the extremely thin line between humor, fantasy, and tragedy. Sure, the film is clearly comedic, but nevertheless it manages to very effectively communicate the tremendous losses suffered in the Nazi concentration camps and has scenes at least as intense as any scene in Schindler's List.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."La vita ? bella" (1997) - (what a beautiful title) is the movie itself. It's fascinating in every meaning of this word. I first saw it when i was 13 years old, and i never forgot it. What beautiful piece of art. Like life itself, it's a beauty. Wonderfully acted, directed, paced it takes you to the place, involves you, shakes you to the core, inspires you and lets you go on the beautiful note - heroes can be found in the most unusual places, and true heroes goes unsung. On its core, "La vita ? bella" is a fairytale, but so captivating, so true, so beautifully told it will leave you with eyes wet. It delivers on every aspect. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and every single time it left me speechless. Overall, if you somehow haven't saw this movie, do your self a favor and experience it, that the only word that can be found that sums up this picture, like the life itself it takes no prisoners and after it will over, you feel yourself a little bit ... brighter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably Charming in a Depressing Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a long time, I put off watching this movie because I was tired of being depressed over the many tragic and dark WWII movies. A friend of mine popped in the movie without letting anyone know what it is, and I found myself immediately synced into the charming and uplifting movie. Yes, there is tragedy and death. Yes, there is a darker underlying tone to the movie. Yes, we are talking about the Holocaust and it is impossible to reprimand and ignore the atrocities committed during that time. However, if there is one Holocaust movie that successfully alters your mood in a positive way, this is it. I was shocked how well the story progresses in an uplifting manner even as the progression is paralleled with an equally dark, yet not overwhelming side of the story. If you have not dedicated the time for this movie, ignore any of the negative critics and reviews, this is a fantastic movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think its safe to say, that this movie is by far one of the best movies i have seen. I find the character Guido played by Roberto Benigni very lovable and interesting. The writers have done a good job in creating the plots for him to win Dora's heart. Especially in the latter half of the film, I was really moved from his attempts to keep his child smiling in the worst situations possible by turning everything into a game. This film gives us the important message that no matter how difficult life gets, there's always a choice of happiness, and laughing at the cruelties life throws at us. A must watch film, if you are the type looking for a comedy with a lot of meaning, this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roberto Benigni has covered all bases of life in this great film. From laughter, love, happiness, family, sorry, resilience and the power of positive thinking with a creative mind, we watch the story unfold. Throughout the movie the main character, Guido, steals your heart. He shows us the beauty and importance of laughter and love. He teaches us not to give up. He shows what belief in yourself can do when trying to get something you want and in facing difficult situations that are beyond our control. If you are watching the movie with subtitles you become so entrenched in the plot that you forget that you are reading them. This movie moves at a nice pace. Even though the plot changes dramatically the character stays true to his nature. It is no wonder that Benigni won the Academy Award for Best Actor and the film, Best Foreign Film.</fullReview>

This is a movie takes the lives of a Jewish Italian family that is sent to a concentration camp and turns this sad period of history in to an entertaining and heartfelt performance by all the actors. The flow of the movie is absolutely consuming and it has always been easy to be able to feel and share the feelings with the characters as they are living during this period of time of oppression of the Jewish community. This should be on everyone's list of movies that they have to watch. Although it is a foreign film, it is an easy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful Tragicomedy on the most inhuman act of 20th century, the Holocaust of Jews.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful Tragicomedy on the most inhuman act of 20th century, the Holocaust of Jews.How far can you go for your family is what the apt tag line will be for this film. From protecting the wife from inhuman creatures to protecting the innocence of his only son, Guido Orefice does it all for his family and even sacrifices his whole life for them.Roberto Benigni is affable as Guido, a wonderful human being who knows to take everything with a sense of humor. There are turbulent times, the world has changed for him, he is put in the most awful circumstances, even he is caught and will be executed. In all the places, all he does is smile. It's heartening to see a man go through dire circumstances with liveliness and smile. But that tragedy that is to come is fatal and that's where hearts melt for the audience. A happy family is shattered for no fault of their own. In the second world war, Jews were condemned as sinners and executed, it's on of the most insane things ever done, on this planet. Hitler will never be forgive for his sins for centuries. The story is simple, the portrayal is wonderful, the art direction is superb and the other aspects are right. The 2 hours are fun for the first half and heart rending in the second. But all is well in the end. This film is simply beautiful.Loved Roberto Benigni, his wife Nicoletta Braschi (she played Dora, the wife of Guido) and Giorgio Cantarini (he played the role of 5 year old Joshua, son of Guido). The other performances were wonderful too.There is not a frame or scene that's boring or out of place. This film deserves a 5/5. Humanity means something, see this to know that. It's all about bringing smiles to others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your life will surely become 'Beautiful' after watching this!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This award-winning romantic comedy set against the stark reality of the war torn Europe, manages to keep true to its name. Roberto Benigni, the versatile genius, directed, played the protagonist and also wrote the script for this movie. Like many other movies set in the World War II background, this movie also shows the cruelty and horrors of the Nazi concentration camps but at the same time brings in optimism, courage and shows how to find happiness even in the hardest times of life. The movie begins with a fine comic shade, with Guido &amp; his friend Ferrucio looking for a job. In search for it they reach to Guido's uncle who gives them a job in his hotel. In between all this there are several comic situations where Guido meets Dora when she falls 'out from the sky' and Guido introduces himself as a prince and calls her 'Principessa'. The movie continues with its many comic scenes intermingled along with the meetings of Dora with his 'Principessa' and thereafter their interactions with their child 'Giosue' in their everyday life.The brilliance of Benigni's direction &amp; acting can be seen in the next half of the movie where the couple along with their child are taken to a Nazi concentration camp. The movie then revolves along its spirit, 'Life is Beautiful', where Guido manages to shadow the brutality &amp; harshness of the camp from his son with the help of his wit &amp; garland of words.There are many movies which show the brutality of the Nazi concentration camps but this movie provides a fine lining between that harsh reality &amp; the optimism of life. The optimism of life far overshadows the cruelty of the Nazi camps &amp; gives the movie a sweet touch. To further add to this is the brilliant acting &amp; direction of Roberto Benigni. This movie will surely inspire to develop a positive outlook towards life!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Optimism, wits, and a bit of luck go a long way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is magnificent and remarkable. The first half shows us a funny part of Guido's story, already a highly witted person with no shortage of optimism, in getting by his life and reaching for his love Dora. The second half displays how Guido, now a father, shields his son from the grieve of a concentration camp, all while always incorporating his wits to get by things, his optimism and enthusiasm to get by with his son's curiosity, and having a fair share of luck that eventually saves his son's life. I rarely see such a movie that can turn its mood from the happy tone into one of a sad tone so drastically, yet the happiness is still there even in the sad moments. The background is of course the classic and usual set of World War II's Europe, but again the developed story takes us to see the war from a very touching angle. Of course there are pot holes and things that don't really make sense, But the story itself is so touching that it belittles the shortcomings. Benigni, Braschi, and even the little Cantarini act well and can make us us fell the mood of the movie and connect to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only thing that irks me about this film is that there are two different films in it. This could/should have been done seamlessly. The first act acts as a prologue to the main film. But what follows is an overwhelming and beautiful tale of emotions- tragic and comedy blended into one. Benigni, without making any political statement, gets closer to the situation and makes this fable an utmost believable one. I've never cried so much watching a film before, especially at the end scene which is a redemption and revelation, of sorts, both at the same time had me in tears and when I learned that there are no more scenes ahead, I was left wiping my tears for a really long time.

It's hard to categorize this film because it has aspects of comedy, drama, romance, adventure, and tolerance. It will forever stay with you once you watch it.

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Movie- Masterfully Done!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful is a cinematic gem! Exceptional acting, writing and cinematography make it a MUST SEE and one of the BEST movies of all time. I'm so surprised that some reviewers seem to have missed the entire point of the movie- that life with all it's glorious array of emotions- happiness, pain, suffering, joy and ultimately hope is indeed beautiful. The few detractors that feel the movie trivializes the holocaust must sadly be extremely cynical and hard-hearted to fail to understand it's message- that much like in Viktor Frankl's "Man's Search for Meaning- "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way." Choose to see this masterpiece and have your heart strings strummed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, this is a movie about the courage, freedom and love. moreover this is one of the those movies that take you to the real world.Comedy and drama are also perfectly find voice in the movie.the story, the characters and charming side of the movie also attracts you."Life Is Beautiful" is an crucial film, triumphant.It manages to entertain, educate. Roberto Benigni has taken pure horror and turned it into a love story between a woman and a man, between a father and his lovely son. As an actor, Benigni manages with his wise and simple performance to make us laugh in tragic situations.He was very realistic, natural, far from Hollywood style, only nice and beautiful cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joint-Best Movie I Have Ever Watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always say to my friends that the first movie they should watch is Schindler's List for anyone who understands the true meaning of it could never be a bad person. Today, I'd say that: friends, if you haven't watched Life is Beautiful, the next thing you should do is watch it as anyone who watches it will know the true beauty of life - that it is all on us to make our lives beautiful.This movie has shaken me like no other. My perspective about life has changed after watching this movie. This may not be a biographical movie, but the lessons this movie has given me is priceless. By the end of the movie, you will be both in tears of sadness and smiling in joy at the same time - such is the power of the movie.The movie is set during the World War II period surrounding a Jewish Italian man. This man, this character, will change the way you look at life. I never thought a serious War Drama movie could make one laugh, but because of the hilarious comedy scenes, this movie is it.Even in dire times, like in the labour camps during that time, this man - Guido - could keep his sense of humour and optimistic approach. Roberto Benigni played the role and also directed the movie. He was so, so good, I can not express in words - no-one can. I can't possibly fathom how he played such a difficult role with so much ease. A truly deserving Oscar.If you are going through a not-so-good period in life, then you have got to watch this movie - it will change your life forever. And if you are going through a period when you think life is beautiful, then you still got to watch this movie so that it will solidify your thoughts.This is the joint-greatest movie I have watched along with Schindler's List. This movie, like Schindler's List, is beyond rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time. It is absolutely awe-inspiring, emotional, funny, tragic. It was recommended to me by a friend who said it stayed with her long after it ended. I had the exact same experience after watching it. I've seen it several times, and it always has the same impact. The love of the husband and wife is very clear. And the "game" that the father creates to protect his son is ingenious. Of course, the main portion of the story is very sad, because you know what is going on and what they are enduring. The ending brings both tears of joy and accomplishment, but also tears of sadness. A bitter-sweet moment. The actors are excellent in this movie, especially Roberto Benigni - which is why he won an Oscar for his performance. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Holocaust has been always cited as one of the biggest examples of human tragedy as many lost their lives at the hands of the Nazis. Schindler's list takes the cake as the most true portrayal of the atrocity, yet this movie captures those horrors yet at the same time, gives people hope that some have survived. Roberto Benigni, the comic genius that he is, helps establish light in a dark time with his vivid imagination of a game to shield his son from such horrors (they do show dead bodies in one scene, but not as bad as Schindler's List). Even before the experience do we get a taste of Benigni's invention to create hysterical comedy, even in the most inappropriate of times. All in all a wonderful movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not at all about human evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who accused the movie of lack of realism missed the point. This masterpiece was not about Holocaust and its atrocities but rather this theme served as allegory for something so sadly rare that in order to show it the director had to use this controversial subject in a comedy. I am talking about something called "human spirit" although I don't like this phrase as it became slowly a cliché. I am Polish and had a few relatives who experienced concentration camps - some of them survived - one didn't. I also lived 100 km from Auschwitz which became sort of a destination for school field trips. On top of that - in schools we had an extensive course on camp literature and let me tell you that your typical Holocaust movie is not especially realistic either. The problem I have with those movies is that it shows always similar narrative: diabolical German guards (chosen from criminals), victims so sick and emaciated, and super obedient due to hunger, illness and extreme fear that you could not find the shred of humanity in them. Other people, outsiders, did not nothing because conveniently didn't know. Camps were super isolated so only a few could be blamed - that is typical narrative of movies which makes people feel good. After all: we are not so bad, it is just a few of us. As to camps: image of prisoners are totally inhuman which is probably the biggest injustice to those who suffered and died. But death, torture,hunger was just part of the camp experience, huge no doubt but not the whole truth about those places. There was camaraderie, help, compassion,medical attention done by prisoners doctors (some hanged for this),acts of incredible courage (Jan Karski, priest Kolbe)... And if you want to know how it really was like being there read Tadeusz Borowski's: "This way to the gas, Ladies and Gentelmen" or "Men's search for meaning" by Victor Frankl. Yes, it was abyss but people reacted differently. Many became a part of killing machine, many gave up any struggle for survival but few remained humans despite hell. There was even humor, nightly reading stories by some writers, teachers inmates without books, some sort of lectures, art performed with coal, games done with sticks or balls made of rags and yes - there were some attempts at saving small children although rarely successful. What I am trying to say that clichéd, tired image of big cruel guards, sheep like prisoners walking in mud,slowly,in perfect order towards death without any protest, piles of corpses really say nothing about Holocaust. It only desensitizes viewers and pose a threat that it will be forgotten by younger generation, or perhaps even repeated. Before extermination camps were built there was the whole decade of injustices, watched by the Western world with indifference , which started small but slowly precisely because of lack of reaction from the World, snowballed to gas chambers. If you don't believe it could happen now. Just listen to people with their stupid simplistic explanation to complex problems. I heard statement from so called decent people that in the light of recession and lack of jobs for born citizens all foreigners, including their children should be deported to their countries. Here you go. That is how it starts. And Roberto Benigni made movie so original, so different from other of this sort that said more about humans that all other films combined. combined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been bothered by subtitles as many people are. In fact, not understanding the language in a film causes me to pay more attention to details I might otherwise overlook. This film brought me to tears as a loving father tries his best to care for a young son while being held prisoner's in a concentration camp. The boy is too young to understand what's going on and his father does his best to convince his son they're on an adventure, playing a game. It's a tough game and at times you can see the father falter. This film is filled with pain and you'll hope and pray for the best possible outcome. I watched with disbelief as my heart pounded against my chest. It was a very emotional film, but there are plenty of times I had to smile. It's so well worth watching, I hope you give it a try. Even after all the madness, I was left repeating to myself.. Life IS Beautiful... because of people like this father, Guido.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing to love about Life is Beautiful is Guido. Roberto Benigni plays the most lovable and clever romantic to grace the silver screen. His character is spectacular, and the writing is phenomenal. Roberto Benigni is like that in real life, as one can see from his Oscar acceptance, as he received Best Actor and accepted on behalf of the film when it won Best Foreign Film. It is by far Benigni's best film, and will always be one of my all-time favorites. If you like an emotional drama-dy, you'll love Life is Beautiful. The music is glorious, the story unique, the writing oh-so quotable, and the feelings you'll have while watching are truly special. There's a reason this film is in the top 50 movies on IMDb. You need to see it. If you don't like subtitles, many copies are available dubbed in English (although the Italian is quite lovely). I highly encourage you to give this one a watch. Or several.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie can easily be called Italian Cinema's greatest gift to mankind. I disagree with those who claim that this movie underplays atrocities of Nazi Germany as I believe it was not intention of the maker to portray them. The whole point of the movie is to show that one may lose everything and live under the harshest conditions but he/she never loses the freedom to choose his/her behavior under those circumstances. I believe this movie is more of an appreciation of Jewish struggle and their "will to life" rather than a condemnation of actions of Nazis. Roberto Benigni's marvelous acting and direction makes a piece worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This moving had me in tears, but also made me smile. The little boy in the movie is so cute. The love that the father has for his son is indescribable. No matter how scared the father was, or how bad things got, he made sure his son was happy. Even when he knew he was going to die, he smiled at his son, and made him laugh. Absolutely full of love this movie is!He showed not one bit of fear in front of his son. I was in awe when I watched this movie. There is no way I could have been so strong for anyone like that. I can only imagine how frightened it must have been back then for those people, as things like this used to happen. Yet I doubt that many would have had the strength that this father had. So sad, yet so beautiful! I definitely want to see this movie again someday soon, even just to remind me about the most important things in life, like the people you love, and not the materialistic things in life, which aren't important. It's definitely a good movie to watch when your going through a rough time, like if you've just lost your job, or had your heart broken, or if your fighting with a friend or family member. It makes you feel grateful and appreciate your life, as things could be a lot worse. I know I was going through a rough time when I watched this movie. I felt so much better afterwards. I was just so grateful that I have a roof over my head, I wasn't in any danger, I have food to eat, a warm bed to sleep in, and other luxuries such as a TV, hot water and electricity, and clean clothes to where, just to name a few. It definitely made me realise that no matter how bad things get, other people have been through much worse, and would give anything to have the life that I have. Watching this movie also made me realise how much gratitude can make you happy. Like, feeling grateful, makes you feel happy. Much better than feeling hard done by, which makes you feel depressed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a reason "La vita ? bella" won 3 academy awards and many other awards. It is a timeless movie about the human spirit, hope and dreams.It's almost two movies combined in one; the first part is comedy and the second part is a romantic drama."La vita ? bella" does everything right: it mixes comedy with tragedy and drama. It is very easy to love the style and cinematography of this movie, it catches the horrors of the war and at the same time the warmth of the human spirit. The chemistry between Benigni and his real life wife Nicoletta Braschi is palpable.The whole is rounded off with a beautiful soundtrack by Nicola Piovani. It is a timeless, charming and emotional work of fiction. "La vita ? bella" makes a few important statements about the human condition In my opinion this is one of the best movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sensitive topics such as World War 2 are generally portrayed in their classical sense, where the life of various individuals in either Concentration Camps or battlefields are exposed. Not that there is anything wrong with this, but Life is Beautiful manages to tell the tale of two lovers and their family, and how the War will never dampen their spirits.With the Jewish people being primary targets in the Holocaust, this foreign film displays how true love cannot be broken by the evilest of atrocities, despite race or religion. Happiness is rather difficult to attain, especially for prisoners who are near death, but Life is Beautiful succeeds in demonstrating that a light of hope can shine a dark room. This movie deserves as much praise and accolades than any other. With great acting, starting from the stars to support, Life is Beautiful encompasses the attributes every great movie should. The emotional plot, filled with comical satire, is a cinema any move critic would enjoy. With Italian films being known for their romance and passion, Life is Beautiful should be remembered for being able to reproduce these same qualities in a setting where tomorrow is not always certain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During WWII, a Jewish couple and its young son are sent to a concentration camp. Benigni won an Oscar for his wonderful portrayal of an eternal optimist. The film effectively blends humor with the atrocities of war, eventually proving to be a touching story. It is not necessarily believable but the sheer force of Benigni's personality is enough to allow one to go along for the ride. Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife, plays his wife while little Cantarini does well as the five-year old son who Benigni tries to shield from the horrors of the concentration camp.

I think after Apocalypse now this has to be one of the most hard movies to make, Apocalypse now required an extremely large amount of resources in practical terms, however Life is Beautiful, is a movie that is very hard to present without hurting any sentiments which it manages perfectly, This is just top class cinema from the beginning, it's not slapstick or cheap comedy, it's humor in it's purest form, an ode to human emotions. The acting the presentation, the development of the characters is perfect, Roberto Benigini, plays an extremely hard character trying to balance his daily life in the concentration camp, while protecting his son's innocence by telling him that it's all a game, with the first prize being a REAL TANK,This movie could have gone wrong at so many places so easily, amazingly it never does, Roberto Benigini was walking on a very thin wire while making this film, but he does it to perfect, absolute perfection.Easily one of the best cinema in the past two decades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, I loved this motion picture to the fullest extent, especially for one that we would watch educationally in English class. The 1940's holocaust survival theme was truly interesting to watch, as it portrayed an accurate account of an average Jewish family's struggles at that time in history. Much can be related between this movie and the recent book our English class read earlier called "Maus" by Art Spiegelman. Both have the same elements of danger and survival amongst family members against the Nazi's. A key factor that also connects the two tales is the bond between father and son. In "Maus", the father named Vladek, who is a post P.O.W. is set by his son art to tell the story of the family, this in which Art then creates into an award winning graphic novel. Relatively, in the movie "Life is Beautiful" the main character named "Guido Orefice" must save his wife and son and himself from the Nazi gas chambers at one of the infamous death camps. His tale of survival is truly courageous and the end products are lessons learned and the proof that a father must do what needs to be done to save his family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a beautiful tale about love and family and the devastation of the Holocaust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful This funny movie tells the Holocaust in a different way. When a lovable and free spirited man (Guido) is traveling with his friend and runs into the love of his life (Dora), he feels the need to win her over. He bumps into the teacher at multiple places in town including at her school and is not afraid to make a fool out of himself to impress this woman. Finally when he wins her over, they get married and start a family. This family is broken up however when Guido and his charming son Joshua were taken by the Nazi people on Joshua's birthday. Dora follows her son and husband to the concentration camp where they were separated by men and woman and put to work. During the time at the camp, Guido convinced Joshua that they are playing a competitive game where if they score a certain amount of points, they can win a real tank. Guido also told him that he was in the lead but Joshua needed to stay hidden so he would not be taken to the gas chambers. Guido worked in the factories and was a waiter all to save his family. He would get on the loud speakers to announce to his beloved wife that they are safe and they miss her. In the end, the camp was being liquidated and Joshua had to stay hidden. Guido risked everything to see his love for one last time and was captured by the Nazis and was taken to a dark alley and was killed. Joshua came out of hiding and was found by an American Solder rolled up in a tank and Joshua got to ride in it. He got to ride in the tank and won his prize. He then was reunited with his mother and they lived happily ever after. It was the perfect ending to a very good movie.The director of this movie, Roberto Benigni, was also the leading actor in this film and he won Best Actor at the Oscars. He was also nominated to win best Director Award at the Oscars. The scenes in this movie were captivating and painted a good picture about what the Concentration Caps were like during this time period. The movie was mostly a gray color which represented the gloom and despair that the people felt. The same effect happened to be in the graphic novel, Maus, by Art Spiegelman. He used a black and white color to show the gloom of this horrific event in history and he too wrote about survival and family. This movie also won the awards of Best Foreign Language Film and Best Music/Original Score. The use of long shots and close ups intertwined, allowed for a great deal of plot setting and ability to see the emotions in the actors faces. The fact that the director did a shadow effect added a nice touch as well. The actors who were not as important in the scene were a darker shade and the more important ones were lighter, brighter, and happier. I saw this same effect in the book, Maus. This film was an all around charming and emotional film about the Holocaust. It is a beautiful tale about family and love. It is one of the best films regarding the Holocaust that I have seen. Hats off to Roberto Benigni!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Isa TeRonde: The insightful movie Life is Beautiful, is funny, romantic, and will bring tears to your eyes. The lead role Guido (Roberto Benigni) plays the role of a brave Italian man who after some work owns a Jewish bookstore. When Guido first arrives to Italy he falls quickly in love with an engaged woman named Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). Throughout Guido works hard to make the best of what he has, and truly shows that you can be happy with anything. The film is set in WW II, but none the less Guido has a positive attitude about even the worst imaginable circumstances. This is very similar to the book Maus, by Art Spiegelman, in the way that it takes place during the Holocaust. Vladek from Maus and Guido from Life is Beautiful, fight to keep those important people in their lives alive and put their loved ones as their first priority. These are both tragic stories, but can open the eyes of the ones reading or watching. Life is beautiful was an eye opening movie, with a beautiful twist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A middle aged Jewish man has no idea what is coming to his home front. A man by the name of Guido is a friendly, caring guy. Guido arrives in Tuscany with a friend of his and dreams of opening a bookshop. He later gets a job working as a waiter for his uncle at a hotel. As the days go by more and more fascist signals arrive. Even though fascism has clearly arrived he still ignores the signs and finds the love of his life, Dora. He marries her and has a child named, Giosue. Finally the dreadful day comes when their bookshop is vandalized and Guido and his son are taken away. Dora is frightened by this and begs to be taken to by the German radicals and the entire family is sent to a concentration camp. To ease his son, Guido, tells his son that they were taken to play a game and the winner that achieves 1000 points wins a tank. As days go by, young little Giosue's hope evaporates. It is up to Guido to save his family from being a part of the millions of other Jews that had died before them. The book Muse is very similar to this story. Both stories are based off the same time and both tell the story of a family that is captured and put into a concentration camp. Each story has its own way of explaining the struggles of being Jewish and living in Europe during World War two. Muse showed us how they were able to hide in small towns and how they had to run from town to town and in the movie Life is Beautiful it showed the sacrifice and how it was so hard to stay positive. Each story helped show the severity and cruelness of World War two on the Jewish world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Summary to this is written in the review below.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis: Life is Beautiful takes place in 1940's Italy, Roberto Benigni stars as Guido, a Jewish-Italian man, filled with joy. Guido mysteriously runs into the same women (Nicoletta Braschi as Dora), time and time again, before he falls in love with her and they eventually marry. They have one child named Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini). They live happily together until one day, their lives are flipped upside down when they are thrown into a Nazi prison, and they must fend for their lives.Review: Roberto Benigni was able to direct an incredible movie, and at the same time, play the main, award winning role. Guido started out as just a fun, crazy man. But once havoc struck, and his family was endangered, be became a protector, and was the key to his sons survival.Throughout the whole film, there was always a joyous mood, with the character Guido and his family. No matter what had been going on, even in dark times, he was able to bring joy into the room. This film did a great job at getting the point across about how terrible life was at these Nazi camps, but it did it without being too deep, and depressing.Overall, La vita ? Bella, was a very entertaining film, that was able to make one feel good, but at the same time, was able to get the point across, about how terrible Nazi Germany was.Critiques: The only critiques I have for this movie are that when Guido and his family got taken away to the Nazi camp it was very sudden, the film did not do a good job by setting the scene as 1940's Italy, with the Nazi invasions.The only other critique of mine, was the subtitles could be hard to follow at first, but after watching for just a couple minutes, you barely notice them, and are able to follow quite well.Connections: In my high school English class, we read the book Maus, by Art Spiegelman, and we were asked to compare the two stories. I feel that the stories are similar but at the same time they are complete opposites. Both of the stories at times had the same theme, for example when at the concentration camps, people are being killed left and right, there are themes of evil.The main difference, was how the stories showed presented the common theme to the audience. The story Maus, at times is very depressing, and sad, the book portrays it as how it really was, and it shows the true evil in the situation. However, Benigni's film, was able to get the same point across, and was able to show the same evil, but it did it all without turning into a sad depressing film, at all times there was a sense of joy in every scene, this may be the first movie I have seen, that has dealt with something that was so terrible, but was able to make the audience feel good while watching.</fullReview>

Like most students I expected the movie to be a boring, educational film that would not interest me at all. I, however, found myself pleasantly surprised after watching the film."Life is Beautiful" was a movie that, just like the popular comic book "Maus," was able to combine humor, drama, action, suspense, and romance into one captivating film. "Maus" used Nazi Germany, just like "Life is Beautiful," to show viewers how terrible the Nazi Holocaust really was. Both the movie and book also showcased the relationship between a father and a son to portray an intriguing story.The movie was uplifting and depressing at the same time, it provided all watchers to experience different emotions throughout the film. I thought the most important theme from the movie was hope. The main character Guido was able to convince his son that they were playing a game, a game that eventually led to his sons life, instead of telling him that they were in a concentration camp.All in all I think that everyone should watch this movie. It has elements that everyone can and will appreciate. The movie teaches viewers valuable lessons, while also balancing the emotions of joy and sadness. I would rate this film a 9 out of 10 my only complaint is that the movie is not in English, but even that adds another important element to the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "Life is Beautiful" is an Italian master piece directed and acted by Roberto Benigni. Even though most of the story was taken place in Germanys Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II, the story is played out in a more colorful and loving way, as a family tries to stay together during these crazy times. Roberto Benigni plays his character as if it was him personally, just wondrous; along with his real wife being his wife in the movie it adds a more personal touch. The boys acting in the movie is one of the best performances of a child actor in 90's era.This movie connects greatly to a graphic novel written by Art Spiegelman, Maus, and both main characters in the book/movie (Vldek and Guido) fatherly instincts kick in to do whatever it takes to protect their family. Another connection between Maus and Life is beautiful, is that they both take place during the holocaust and World War II. Both stories show a very accurate representation of what was going on during those times, and how hard it was for both of the families to survive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is so so Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is about a father's love for his wife and son in the day of the Holocaust. Writer/director Roberto Benigni stars as a character who tries to charm a beautiful teacher by always bumping in to her and making her feel special. But then Benigni, his wife and child are sent to a concentration camp. To protect his son's life he teaches him to hide from the guards during the day while Benigni goes out and builds a "Tank". To protect his from not getting scared, Benigni constructs an elaborate fantasy game that they are playing with all the other Jews in the camp to win the ultimate prize, a real tank. When times get hard and everyone is struggling Benigni never breaks character for the safety of his child. I recently read the book Maus and this movie made me think about the book. Maus and Life is Beautiful are similar because they both take part in the Holocaust and do what they can to get out safely getting back with their family. Both Maus and Life is Beautiful try to do what's best for their child putting their life on the line. If you want to see a movie that is a romantic comedy Life is Beautiful is a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Life is Beautiful directed by Roberto Benigni is a story about a joyful, Italian Jewish man named Guido who is played by Roberto Benigni who starts a family with a beautiful women named Dora who is played by Nicoletta Braschi and they have a son named Joshua who is played by Giorgio Cantarini. Then the family because a victim of the holocaust as Guido and Joshua get put on one train and Dora got put on another train. Although conditions at the camp were harsh Guido always tried to stay in a positive mood for his son and even convinces Joshua that the camp is a game where in the end if they win that he would get a real life tank. Roberto Benigni does a great job at making the movie light and humorous in some parts and heartbreaking and emotional in other parts to make this movie truly unpredictable and exciting.This movie also relates a lot to the story of Maus written by Art Spiegelman which is about a man named Vladek's journey during the Holocaust. Although the two stories are different they both have a theme of the importance of family. In Life is Beautiful Guido was always encouraging Joshua even though there was little to look forward to, and I think Guido being able to come back to his bunk after a brutal day of work and see Joshua's face also helped gets through day by day. Guido was even able to keep Dora's spirits up even though they were separated because in one of the scenes Guido played music out the window to comfort Dora and I believed it helped greatly. In the end Life is Beautiful and Maus are about the importance of a strong family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful I loved this movie, this film addresses a very stressful subject involving the holocaust, and after watching "Life is Beautiful" it made me realize that making a movie about the Holocaust is not an easy task at hand. I give Roberto Benigni all the credit for creating such a heart touching film. Life is Beautiful is about a man named Guido, who tries to hide his family from the holocaust, mostly his son Joshua. Once Guido and his son Joshua are sent to Auschwitz Guido tries his best to not let his son Joshua know that they're in a concentration camp. Guido tells his son that Auschwitz is a game and the first place winner wins a tank, because Guido doesn't want Joshua to know that both they're lives are in jeopardy. Most of the credit should obviously go to Benigni, for directing and acting such a good film. Roberto (Guido) made the movie in many ways; Guido simply made a scene funny when the situation was very serious, he made a scene whenever he had a line in the film. All props go where they're deserved which is to Roberto Benigni, because he won an Oscar for "Life is Beautiful". Also he won best actor, and best foreign film. This is incredible because it's very rare when a foreign actor wins best actor and best foreign film. Roberto's acceptance speech was memorable as well, because he was so happy and excited, that you could barely understand him because of his Italian accent. 'Life is Beautiful" can connect to the book "Maus" by: Art Speigleman, because "Maus" addresses the issue of the Holocaust. Maus is a book about the Holocaust from a survivor's tale. A theme in Maus that I found was Survival, because every day was a struggle to survive, from hiding from Germans to finding food. This connected to "Life is Beautiful" because every day was a struggle for Guido and his son Joshua. Both Joshua and Guido were living from day to day not knowing what the next day would bring, just like in Maus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the world goes dark, we can always find light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello, today I, Brandon, a student at PHS, will be reviewing the film Life is Beautiful, and connecting it to another similar story I read, Maus. To briefly recap the film, it is about a family who is taken away to a concentration/work camp from Italy during WWII by the Nazi's. The father, Guido, and the son, Joshua, are separated from their wife/mother, Dora, when they arrive. Guido doesn't want his son to be scared, so he makes him believe that it's all a game, and that they're trying to win a tank, a real tank. Joshua and Guido survive most of their stay at the camp, mostly because of Guido's intelligence and intellect. However, at the end of the movie, Guido hides Josh and tries to find Dora, but in doing so he's spotted by the Germans and shot.For being a film about such a somber time in history, it has so much light and happiness, which really made in enjoyable to watch. In addition, the film was riddled with humor throughout its duration. The thing I liked most about the film was the fact that it could retell such a sad story without bringing the viewer down, but rather uplift them, and show them that one can always make the best of their situation. Another very good lesson shown in the film was sacrifice. Guido sacrificed his life for his son, so that he could go on and live the rest of his life, instead of perishing at seven years old in a Nazi work camp. And Guido did so with a smile. That was another one of the very good qualities of the film; it managed to portray death in such a way that the viewer thought that the character, Guido, wasn't really gone, but just out of the picture. It shows us that Guido didn't "die," because he'll live on forever in his son. Our sacrifices make us who we are, and despite the fact that Guido was killed, the title of the film couldn't be truer; life is beautiful.Although the beginning of the film was a little slow at times and drawn out, I believe it was necessary, because it gave us a look at Guido's personality and who he really was. This is important because it makes the second half of the movie so much more enjoyable and understandable. If the film omitted much of the beginning, it would be harder to understand how Guido managed to get Joshua through the camp alive. Even so, the beginning of the film was still very humorous and enjoyable. Overall, the film was excellent, with a true portrayal of how beautiful life is, even at its darkest times. The ending of the film may be frustrating at first, because it doesn't give you a solid end, but once you analyze it, it fits perfectly with the story of life. Life doesn't have a definitive end, just as the film made clear. The film also touched me personally, and I enjoyed it very much. Mostly due to the emotional messages it sends and to the happiness it delivers its viewers.As for its connections to Maus, by Art Spiegelman, they both obviously share the same theme, being trapped by the Germans during WWII. Something notable is the way that two different mediums, graphic novel and film, both portray the characters being trapped. In Maus, this is done by depicting the German soldiers and guards much bigger and larger, physically, then the Jews. In addition, the Germans were cats and the Jews were mice. In Life is Beautiful, a similar technique can be found. One particular scene comes to mind, where three Germans march into Guido and Joshua's bunk house to explain the rules. Guido volunteers to translate the German into Italian, but he doesn't know how to speak German. While he is standing next to the German soldier translating, he looks so much smaller than the Nazi. The German is physically much bigger than Guido and the Germans also outnumbered Guido 3 to 1 in that particular scene. Other parallels that could be found are how the Jews had to hide their loved ones to survive, and the fact that true love was severed by the Nazis. Both Maus and Life is Beautiful are fantastic graphic novels and films, respectively. If you haven't read/watched both of them, I would strongly suggest doing so. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life Is Beautiful (1997) Directed by Roberto Benigni and Rod Dean Main characters: Roberto Benigni, Nicoletta Braschi, Giorgio Cantarini Genre: Comedy, Drama and RomanceThe movie takes place in the Italy of the 1930's and follows the life of Guido, a Jewish server. Along the movie Guido uses his humor to get the love of his future wife, and when his family is captured by the Nazis, he uses his humor to protect his child from knowing the ugly truth. The movie gives a first person perspective of how Jewish people were treated in these years. While providing a crude view of the things the Jewish suffered the main character Guido makes a game out of everything. This gives the movie a general theme of remaining hopeful even in the worst cases. For an English assignment in my high- school I recently had to read the novel Maus by Art Spiegelman. This novel compares with the movie by both giving a first person perspective of real Jewish people that survived the concentration camps. The difference between how Benigni (director of the movie) and Spiegelman approached the theme of the Jewish concentration camps made me appreciate even more the job done by Benigni in his movie. In Maus Spiegelman portrays suffering and harmful effects of the post holocaust. In the other hand Benigni uses humor to give a bright side to every bad thing that happens in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful is a comedic, tragic, drama filled movie that was actually directed and co-written by the magnificent Roberto Benigni who also stars in the movie as Guido, a hotel waiter. As the movie starts, Guido gets to a town and meets Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), a beautiful teacher, who he fell in love with at first sight. It is obvious to say that Dora has feelings for Guido, but is engaged to be married, so she can't act upon those feelings right away. That didn't stop Guido from trying his hardest to get Dora to fall in love with him. He soon succeeded and they fell in love. The two lovebirds got married and later had a son, Joshua (Georgio Cantarini). As the movie continues, all of the Jewish people in Guido's town, including Guido and his young son Joshua, get taken away on a train to a concentration camp. In the midst of trying with all his might to protect Joshua from knowing what is going on, he tells his beloved son that they are playing a game so he feels safe during that tragic time. While at the camp, Guido continues to do everything he can to prove to his son that they are in fact playing a game. Guido says that if they get the most points, Joshua will win a tank as the first place prize. The characters in this movie were more than excellent and each actor played their role to the fullest. This movie was intriguing and quite heartwarming in an interesting way. I was impressed.While watching Life Is Beautiful, I was reminded quite frequently of a book I read in British and World Literature class called Maus that is written by Art Spiegelman. In Maus, Art goes to his father and asks him about his experiences during the Holocaust. His father, Vladek, talks about everything he needed to do to survive and explains in great detail everything that he went through. It is very similar to Life Is Beautiful because the movie is also about someone's experiences during the Holocaust. In both Maus and Life Is Beautiful, trying to survive was an everyday thing. Art Spiegelman's father, Vladek, had to do many things in order live on to the next day and not end up like the rest who died in the camps. He made a hole in a coal cabinet to go down to a cellar to hide, went in a shoe tunnel that led to a bunker to hide, worked for different people and basically did what he had to do to stay alive just like in the movie where Guido did everything he could to make sure he and his son lived. Maus had a father and son relationship and so did Life Is Beautiful. In the movie, Guido went through great measures to protect his son by having him hide on the top bed in their cabin, hide in different places to ensure his safety, and to not speak to certain people. In Maus, Vladek protected his first son Richieu by sending him away with a character, Persis, to a safer place. Both the book and the movie had the sense of protecting loved ones and dealt with acts of survival.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roberto Benigni was always a beloved actor in his home land of Italy and recognized by many for his comedic films. However, one film really did him in to make him a well known actor around just more than Italy and into the whole world. Roberto Benigni directs and stars in the foreign film with subtitles Life is Beautiful and takes on the humorous, smart character of Guido. While this is really two films in one, his comedic actions really make you forget you're watching a film about the holocaust at all. A man from the country is moving into the city where he plans to open a new bookshop. On a stop along the way, he randomly encounters this beautiful woman by the name of Dora played by Nicoletta Braschi. She accidentally falls from a barn and right into his arms. Guido perplexed yet believing turns on the charm and falls into love at first sight and instantaneously calls her his princess. The two go their separate ways until yet another random bump into occurs instead this time Guido falls into his princess' arms in the city. His gut-wrenching humor along the way adds a predicament to Dora as she must stay faithful to her already fiancé. Although Guido might like to say the next few visits to his princess are random, they are not as his job as a waiter leads him onto the conclusion that Dora is a teacher. His daring personality and his ability to add suspense into the audience begins when he deceives Dora's school that he is the inspector. Once again the audience gets a kick out of the fact that Guido can always find Dora, and he turns on his silly side during the inspection where the school expects him to be serious and actually talk to the students about Italy. When put on the spot, Guido shows his true talent of improvisation. He speaks on and on about how great Italy is and walks around on tables going on and on about the most random and obvious facts about their country. As the real inspector shows up, Guido must make an urgent exit that leaves everyone with their jaws wide open and Dora's mouth in the shape of a smile. As the film progresses farther and farther, we learn that Dora's fiancé is not treating her right and boom there again does Guido pop out of nowhere and make things better in the pouring rain. Just by the way you see it you would go crazy with laughter. To end part one and really the movie could end happily and happily ever after, Guido takes his damsel in distress and saves her as they ride off into the sunset together. As five years pass, Guido and his princess have a son by the name of Joshua and are happily married and Guido finally has his dream job. The Nazi's are approaching war and signs hang from all over reading that Jews are no longer accepted. Only time would then sadly abrupt the family as they are taken by train to a concentration camp. What might at first sound like a very sad situation, Guido repeatedly tells his son that it is all a game and that they need to make the best of every situation. Probably the most hilarious comic relief of all where his improvisation comes back is the part where Guido really needs to sell that everything is a big game to his son so he knowingly lies that he speaks German. He had to repeat every word the officer said so everyone knew the rules in this horrid place. Guido changes all the German's word and translates them into funny rules in Italian. Joshua is impressed and carries on with the difficult rules of the fun game which has a final prize that Joshua can't walk away from. An old friend Doctor Lessing from Guido's waiter days appears at the camp as an authoritative figure. Just when twists and turns for mostly bad carry on, a glimpse of freedom is sought just around the corner. This is a must see foreign film and one that triumphed in 1997 as it won many awards. Roberto Benigni truly created a masterpiece that touches the heart and makes you want to laugh and cry all in one. It relates to the graphic novel Maus in several ways. Both Vladek from Maus and Guido from Life is Beautiful make the best of their lives in a really bad situation. Both instances they could have given up and dropped the anvil however they carried on as they only wanted to keep living. Between the techniques of angles and shots and placements, both stories share a lot of common ancestor while retelling the sad story of life in a concentration camp. As Benigni tried and succeeded in his feature film, he really balances the wonderfulness of comedy mixed with tragedy. To find out the ending of the film is a must, but be forewarned that the transition from part one to part two can be a lot to handle and ride the fine line of a sensitive subject. Tears will be bursting out of your eyes; tears of happiness and joy and tears of sadness will show. It was a film I enjoyed and one that I will forever remember and recommend to others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, BIG turn of events!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From one of Italy's most well-known filmmakers comes an unforgettable story about the ability of laughter to move the human heart and the power of the imagination to up lift the human spirit. Roberto Benigni, also the director, plays a character named Guido who always has a certain demeanor that brings a light, comical approach to everything. He falls in love with a girl named Dora, who he dubs as "Princess", and together they have a son, Joshua. On Joshua's birthday they embark on a journey that, for many Jews was the end of the line, but for Joshua and Guido it would become a game with a spectacular prize in the end. "Life is Beautiful" is similar to graphic novel, "Maus" by Art Spiegelman, in the sense that in father and son relationships, the father tries to protect the son from a negative event. In "Maus" Arty's dad takes certain measures to ensure that his son is not eligible to join the army, and in "Life is Beautiful" Guido flipped around the devastation of the Holocaust and turned into a simple game to prevent his son from believing that it is the end of the line. Overall, it is a film with a moving blend of cold terror and abundant hilarity. The film shows the love a father has for his son, and just what a father will go through to keep his son safe. "Life is Beautiful" is an excellent movie and should be seen by every one of all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a must see beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life Is Beautiful Roberto Benigni I never had much interest in seeing a foreign film before, but I'm glad this was my first. It's going to be hard to follow up on any other movie after seeing Life Is Beautiful. Roberto Benigni fairly showed the true colors of a man who only wants what is best for his family by developing a character that not only uses his humor and love in the hardest of times, but also protects the innocence of his son Joshua (Georgio Cantarini). I especially enjoyed the setting of the film and how it took place in a colorful Italy and moved to a heartbreaking Nazi camp. The use of colors did not go unnoticed, along with the costumes. The time that went into such stitches made the movie seem that much more realistic and emotional. Also, the use of long shots throughout the film really added to the scenery which was absolutely beautiful. This film reminds me a lot of the book Maus. A father looking out for his son to one day tell him the truth of what it was really like for the Jews during WWII. However, Maus had a more serious take on the war and the camps compared to Life Is Beautiful where Benigni tried to create a false reality to make it easier for him and Joshua which was distressing and lifting at the same time. Another mechanic that did not go unnoticed was the editing involved in the production of the film. The scenes had great flow to them and were always easy to follow making the plot more interesting and appealing to the audience. The same goes for Maus, a great story board led to a great tale of the Nazi camps and the survival of Vladek Spiegelman. I highly suggest seeing this film if you are the type of person who loves a good script and outstanding performances by a brilliant cast. Even if you're are someone who doesn't think they would be interested in a foreign film, you should definitely see Life Is Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is Beautiful- a great film (similar to "Maus")</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life is Beautiful", an Italian film called "La Vita e Bella" takes place during the Holocaust. This movie is directed by Roberto Benigni, starring Roberto Benigni himself as Guido; a humorous yet romantic Jewish character who instantly falls in love with school teacher, Dora played by Nicoletta Braschi. Guido wants to open a bookstore and while trying to do so makes enemies with the town clerk who we later find out is Doras fiancé. Through many accidental encounters with Dora and Guido she gets to know his loving and goofy personality while he tries to woo her. After yet another accidental encounter that happens to be her engagement party, she says to Guido "take me away" and he does just that.Years have passed, off-screen and we are introduced to Guido and Doras son, Joshua played by Georgio Cantarini. Guido and Joshua are then taken away on trains to go to a Jewish camp. When Dora finds out she follows and demands to be let on the train. Dora is at the same camp but separated from Joshua and Guido. Guido convinces Joshua that they are part of a game and the winner receives a real tank, his favorite toy. Through the rest of the movie he is trying to protect his son from the harsh death camp and get his family out of there.Roberto Benigni, as Guido was the perfect person for this role. He had very goofy personality as he does in real life and it fit perfectly for this part. Not only the acting was great though, also the technique used to show significance was very powerful. At the beginning of the movie it showed a foggy place, and it was foreshadowing the rest of the movie saying that it was going to be a sad movie with downfall of the characters. Another time that was significant was when they got on the train to go to the Jewish camp. It had the train leaving in a long shot showing that they didn't have control anymore of what was going to happen to them and they were out of reach of their fate. This movie did a perfect job combing a normal love life with the struggles of the Holocaust like many people had to live through. Benigni wrote the death of Guido perfectly as well. The viewers had grown to love this character and then he was shot and gone just like nothing had happened. Some may think they should of played the death out more of the main character, but by not playing the death of Guido portrayed what actually happened during that time better. Families and friends had grown to love one another and with a single gun shot that love and connection were gone.While reading "Maus" by Art Speigleman in English class I realized there were some similarities to this movie. The book "Maus" being about the Holocaust also obviously shares a similar theme, but there are more similarities besides that as well. In both "Maus" and "Life is Beautiful", there was a bond between father and son. These relationships were similar because the fathers were trying to protect there sons. In "Life is Beautiful" by pretending they were playing a game for a grand prize of a tank, and in "Maus" by not telling Artie about Anjas diary and what he had done with it. Also in both of these stories they shared a theme of survival, much like any Holocaust story has. During "Life is Beautiful" Guido the whole time was trying to stay strong and survive for his wife and son and he was trying to protect Joshua from the harsh death camp. He strived to protect and help his family survive, and it ended in his death. This is similar to the book "Maus" where the whole time Artie is trying all he can do to make Anja feel safe and protect her and the ones he loves from getting taken away to a camp.Both "Life is Beautiful" and "Maus" are great stories about the struggles of the Holocaust and how this event changed life forever. They were both awesome stories and I recommend watching "Life is Beautiful" and reading "Maus." Through the techniques used they will for sure send your emotions on a roller coaster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of Life is Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at the bright side of things is exactly what Roberto Benigni does in the Italian film, Life is Beautiful. As the director and lead actor, Benigni will have you crying with laughter throughout the movie with his comical actions and remarks. Produced in 1997, Life is Beautiful had the power to make a high school student enjoy an older film while feeling the wrath of how horrific the Holocaust was.This film has a series of important events that leads up to the end. In the beginning of the film, Benigni plays Guido, an Italian waiter who seems to know everyone. Guido is a light minded man who is always in the right place at the right time. All throughout the beginning, Guido runs into a young woman named Dora, who is played by Nicoletta Braschi. Guido has lots of interest in this young woman who he calls principessa and is always sweeping her off her feet. Eventually they end up falling in love and having a son that will have you saying, "aw," every time he is on the screen.When all seems to be going perfect, Guido and his son are taken away by the Nazi forces to a camp. His wife rushes to get to them and is also taken to the camp. This is where Benigni's comedic talents really shine. While in the camps, Guido and his son are separated from Dora and Guido decides to turn the sore reality of being at the camp into a game to keep his son safe and happy at the same time. He explains how the grand prize of the game is a real tank, which keeps his son wanting to stay in the game. While in the camp, Guido always finds a way to make his son be happy and believe that everything is going to be okay. To find out if Giosue wins grand prize and if Guido ever reunites with his wife again, you are just going to have to watch this magnificent film that may leave you with tears of joy and sadness.This movie truly is an inspiring story about someone who is put in a bad situation and does everything he can to make it seem like a normal situation, all for his cute little son. In a lot of ways the movie life is Beautiful is like the Holocaust comic, Maus, written by Art Spiegelman. The comic Maus, is a story about a father who had to go beyond measures to keep him and his wife safe during the Holocaust and how it affected him many years after. Both show the drastic levels that people had to go through in order to stay alive during the Holocaust. They also both use great viewing techniques such as the angle of the shot, up close shots to show certain emotions, and shading/darkness to enhance the importance within the stories. Both were well written stories, but the big difference between the two that makes Life is Beautiful more appealing is the comic relief that it provides to someone who is watching it.Although this film has some heartbreaking and jaw dropping scenes, it is a movie that will inspire you. It will having you crying with laughter, joy, and sadness throughout, which makes it one of my favorite movies from the 1990's.</fullReview>

Instead of telling his son Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini) what's going to happen during their time at the concentration camp, he makes up a game of it and tells his son that he is going to win a tank if they make it through the game.This film served as a good attention getter with its beautiful scenery and plots. Roberto used actors that had good intentions and that fit their character very well. Nicoletta Brashchi was an incredible "princess" that acted out her emotions pretty well, while Roberto Benigni and Giorgio Cantarini were both excellent and obviously content with Roberto and Rod's directing style and the movie's dramatic tone. The one actor that gave people suspension was Roberto Benigni. Throughout the movie, he acted as a comedian towards people and was laid back. It was a shock to watch him make a game out of the words that the Germans were saying and fight his way through the Holocaust for his family. He was a smart man who got out of deathly situations quickly. After a few scenes, however, we were surprised that he went through with letting the Germans kill him.Life is Beautiful relates to the book Maus because it took place during the Holocaust. Roberto made sacrifices to save his son and wife while in Maus, Vladek made sacrifices for his wife during the Holocaust. Vladek and Roberto have the same mental ability to get out of deathly situations quickly. While making underground tunnels under garbage cans, Vladek makes it safely out of getting caught by the Germans and their dogs. In Life is Beautiful, Roberto hides his son in a metal box and uses his "magic" to get the barking dog away from his son. Life is Beautiful is exciting, creative and romantic?and worth a few hours of your time to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie that adds a Unique Atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful tells the story of a humorous man named Guido who is a waiter in Italy during the 1930s. He quickly runs into the love of his life Dora and becomes enemies with her fiancé. While waiting at the hotel he becomes friends with a German doctor who shares riddles with Guido throughout their friendship. Fast forward 5 years later and Guido and Dora have been married and have a son Joshua. Eventually the Nazis come into play by rounding up the Jews including Guido and Joshua, but until this point in the movie there is hardly any sign that the holocaust is around the corner. Dora isn't forced to go, but instead chooses to board the train out of love and loyalty of her family. Throughout the rest of the movie Guido fools Joshua into thinking they are playing a game and the winner gets a real live tank for themselves. He does this to shelter him from the horrors around him and it makes for some very humorous and sweet moments that lighten up the mood during such a depressing time.Despite taking place during the holocaust, this movie for the most part has a lighter almost humorous atmosphere at times. This has a positive effect on the movie, but makes it seem a little fictional at times. Some of the things Guido does such as speaking into the loud speaker are funny, but seem a little to implausible considering the way the Jews were actually treated. I don't mind the change in atmosphere as it makes the movie stick out from most holocaust driven movies. In some ways this movie uses the same techniques as in the book I recently read called Maus, which tells of a man's journey through the holocaust in the form of a graphic novel. One in particular is when Joshua comes out of his hiding spot and everyone is gone it shows a form of isolation by a long shot of a desolate place except for Joshua who has nowhere to go. This technique is also used in the book Maus on page 125, frame 5 shows Vladek and Anja walking away from trouble and the author uses a long shot to show that they don't really have anywhere to go and are all alone. All in all I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an above average comedy that shows a less intense view of the holocaust.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is Beautiful Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A car with no brakes, mistaken identity, and a woman falling from a barn are all a part of the opening scene in the movie "Life is Beautiful". The main character, Guido (Roberto Benigni), has a very humorous side and serious side at the same time. The movie takes place in Italy in the late 1930's when Guido is working as a waiter for his uncle at his hotel.Guido starts off as driving with his friend and then they realize they have no breaks until they eventually stop at a house and barn. Then Guido is walking around while his friend fixes the car. Next thing he's walking by the barn and this girl, Dora, falls right into his arms. Guido then calls her "Princess" because he falls in love with her right then and there. When they get into town he has a trouble with Dora's fiancé who he did not know about at the time who threatens to kill him if he sees him again. Many times he runs into Dora all by mistake and she starts to feel a love connection for him. The first half of the whole movie is about them falling in love.The last half of the movie fast forwards to near the end of World War II when Guido, who is a Jew, and his son are forced to go into a Nazi concentration camp. In order to keep his son, Joshua, from being scared he makes him feel like the whole thing is a game. Since Joshua loves tanks, Guido tells him that the grand prize is a tank if they win.The movie is like the book Maus I: My Father Bleed History since it has to do with life before and during the holocaust. In the book Maus the main character was doing well with business until Germans came and forced them out of the business. There are also instances where signs were saying that no Jews were allowed to come into the store. Also the movie and book are related by having the main character or the character's family has some lucky breaks to keep them from getting killed.The movie overall is well written and Roberto Benigni did well as Guido. The first half of the movie may have been a little draw out but did not distract from making the movie good. It was also good for the movie to make the Holocaust not seem so bad with not much killing and Guido's humor on top of it. The movie helped show hope even during the worst times and to never give up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A touching movie.The first half of the movie definitely had some funny parts and was cleverly written. Also, the acting was funny and fitting for the main character.The second half of the movie gave an interesting different take on the holocaust. While not adequately showing the grotesqueness of the camps, I believe it did an innovative and touching way of showing how bad situations were and how far a man was willing to go to protect his son from knowing the horrific situation he is in.This part wasn't really that believable, but it was still touching. The end was fitting, as it was bittersweet instead of a a completely happy ending. In the end, it is shown that life is a gift and truly beautiful.</fullReview>

It is a rare muvy which depicts tragedy in the ink of comedy. Benigni is just masterpiece at his work both as an actor as well as director. Perhaps this muvy is somewhat neglected due to its foreign language though we appreciate the awards (oscar) it won. Its highly dramatic &amp; the escapes of the odd situations as done with the might of humor keeps one anticipating.

		<fullReview>The film is the best display of willpower. Many famous lines by people are visually depicted in it. The most important thing in life, to continue with what you are doing is to never lose HOPE. Hope is the soul of this film. It teaches you a very important thing. The story is about a jolly person who lives in a way that is sure to impress you. The second part deals with Jews Holocaust. It has been dealt with in a gentle manner, without making too much fun but still does not make you feel depressed all day.PROS:Whenever this film is again coming into my mind, the consistent talks and laughter of Roberto Benigni is sure to come. He owns every space in the film. The success of the film owes the most to his acting and then the direction. The story is simple but its representation is amazing. Soundtrack is good. It is neither too cold because of holocaust nor is too much comic. The acting by the supporting cast is satisfactory and they are mostly overshadowed by the performance of Roberto. Just after 15 minutes, you might get so much involved that you will lose track of time.CONS:The first half presents the comedy in a subtle manner. But for some scenes, I felt it to be too juvenile. But the second part of the film takes over at an appropriate time.MESSAGE: "Keep up your spirits at all times."VERDICT: "A recommended watch."</fullReview>

As an usually pessimistic guy, this movie influenced me tremendously. The music of Piovani was more than perfect. His music for this movie was kinda like what Morricones music was for Sergio-Leone-movies.I don't know if this is my favorite movie("Pulp Fiction" and "The Good,the Bad and the Ugly" are just too good), but its surely the movie I love the most.

		<fullReview>The people who are writing reviews claiming that this movie does not accurately represent the reality of the holocaust are completely missing the point, because the reality is, that isn't what this movie is trying to show.When the main character is part of the concentration camp, he knows that he can discard all of the plans he had for the future. We can clearly see that everyone else has no happiness in them whatsoever. But this man, when left with no life but inevitable suffering, decides to make the most out of it, and chooses the bonding between him and his son, waving away the stress, anger, and despair which everyone would feel in that situation.Therefore, the movie simply conveys this optimistic mentality, with the help of beautiful music and talented actors. You will most definitely feel your eyes tearing up while at the same time feeling pitiful laughter building up inside.This is definitely one of the most effective movies I have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1960 Billy Wilder wrote and directed The Apartment, a film that started off as satiric comedy, switched halfway through to drama yet finished happily. Imagine if Shirley MacLaine's suicide attempt had succeeded what kind of film The Apartment would have been; answer, something akin to Roberto Begnini's Life Is Beautiful, a film that starts off as a romantic comedy, segues to drama roughly half way, does have one tragic consequence yet ends happily when a mother and child are reunited. Even whilst watching some of the situations are improbable in the extreme - to take just one, the scene where the son wants to go home and the father says okay, let's go, we'll lose the tank but what the hey. He actually opens the door of the barracks and motions the boy to come forward whereas in reality the door would have been locked and guarded. This is the sort of thing you need to accept if you are to embrace this fine movie and you should embrace it, you really should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roberto Benigni wrote, directed, and is the lead character, Guido Orefice, a Jewish- Italian man in this black comedy which won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1997. It reminded me of Lena Wertmuller's Seven Beauties from 1975; though, in my opinion, not as good. Guido pursues Dora, a non-Jewish girl from a wealthy family who are not thrilled with her future husband. They have son, Giosue, and the family is put into a concentration camp on the boy's birthday, so Guido makes the experience into a game to protect his son from the horrors of the war. He tells him that if he hides from the guards and keeps quiet, he will earn points with the top prize being a tank.They continue in the ploy until the American troops arrive to liberate the camp. Benigni is likable and his real life wife, Nicoletta Braschi, is Dora, his on screen spouse, and they have wonderful chemistry together. Giorgio Cantarini as their son, completes an excellent casting decision. Sometimes funny, but also devastatingly sad, Benigni has made an unforgettable movie which is a modern classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bittersweet Holocaust Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most Holocaust movies that I have seen were very graphic, very tragic survival stories. Life Is Beautiful is a Holocaust story that has a little twist in it's story telling. It is a movie that seems to add a human drama or feeling while also focusing on the horrors within.First, understand that the story is fictional but the atrocities and crimes of the Holocaust are very real. It is the story of Guido, a middle class Italian Jew who meets a upper class Chistian woman named Dora in Tuscony Italy. Dora,a somewhat shy but well bred woman with a streak of stubbornness falls for the clownish charms of easy going, Guido. Even though Guido knows that he may never marry Dora due to his social and possibly Jewish status, he takes every ample opportunity to see her. Finally, despite the thought of being shunned by society and Dora's family, Guido and Dora run away together in grand style. They end up married and with a beautiful son named Joshua and a happy life. But alas, storm clouds keep following them in the form of Dora's scorned and rejected old suitor assisted by Dora's family and a society now fueled by World War II with hatred toward the Jews. Guido, his uncle, and little Joshua are sent to a Concentration camp followed by faithful, loyal Dora who commits herself to share their fate. Guido is concerned over his son's survival in the camp and devises a bizarre but unique plan. From then on each day, is a quest for survival for Guido and his family. Will they survive? One thing you notice in the film is the sheer beauty of the settings and surroundings. The countryside and town are absolutely picturesque and striking, the food,flowers, the richness of the hotel just show the viewer a life that full of beauty that we tend to take for granted. I think this is done to show the viewer the beauty that is witnessed in life. Each day is a lovely sunny day full of adventure until the ugliness of racial hatred, and jealousy can mar it, we should appreciate all things in life even the finer things.One other thing to note in the film for musical soundtrack buffs, is that the soundtrack from Life is Beautiful is one of the most beautifully written scores. I urge all soundtrack collectors to add it to their resumes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most emotional film I've ever viewed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life Is Beautiful is one of the best examples of the personal and subjective nature of film criticism. I find reviews to be most useful when they help prepare me to enjoy a film (or at least tell me how much I'll enjoy it), so I'll do that before analyzing and judging the film.Watch this when you're in the mood for tragicomedy. First spend some time thinking, and maybe reading, about the worst parts of the holocaust, but prepare yourself for a romanticized telling of it. Think back to the slapstick and "cute" comedies that made you happiest as a child (Saturday morning cartoons for most of us) and take some time to be nostalgic.If you're too jaded to spend two hours being sentimental or too snobbish to appreciate an unusual perspective of history, then do yourself a favor and forget about this film. Otherwise, get ready for a beautiful experience.---------- No film has ever impacted me as emotionally as Life Is Beautiful. I already give it 10/10 just for making me cry. From me, that response to a work of art is the highest and most elusive measure of artistic success. (This is one of the mere 5 films in existence that I give 10/10.) But it did more than that; I experienced something I had never felt in my life, regarding fiction or reality.I take the extent to which Life Is Beautiful offends critics obtusely obsessed with realistic treatment of the holocaust as a partial measure of its success. Benigni aptly leaves most of the victims' suffering to my imagination. As an intelligent viewer who doesn't need to be spoon-fed history (a fact that Benigni utilizes), I recognize cruel irony and jubilant defiance in Guido's whimsical humor. Allusion accomplishes more for me emotionally than explicit depiction because it prompts me to imagine horrors that the screen cannot convey. When Guido explains the game to Joshua, I feel internally destroyed precisely because said allusions make me feel like I "secretly" know what happens behind the scenes.Eschewing of suffering and graphic portrayal of it each have their place, and I highly respect the artist who can move me to suffer along with a fictional victim by depicting torture of the victim. Since they each have their own uses and appropriate settings, neither is necessary right or wrong; they just accomplish different emotions. In this case, Guido's defiance of his situation is a bold choice that achieves the best possible emotional result, which is my definition of artistic success.The cartoonish humor of the first part is entertaining and endearing. Having grown up on Saturday morning cartoons, I feel sentimentally nostalgic and childishly bubbly about its comedy. Above all, I care about the characters not because I feel intellectually obligated to empathize with them for being humans, but because I genuinely like them.A contrast exists between two elements of the film: the clear delineation between the unrelated plots of part 1 and of part 2, and the unbroken continuity of the film's joyful spirit and of Guido's character. It tells me that the human experience is a unified whole. Joy and suffering do not exist independently of each other; it is the same person throughout all the emotions. Guido's choice to respond the way he does makes him who he is. The juxtaposition of the contrast between situations with the comparison between respective stages in character development tell me who he is.Fundamentally, Life Is Beautiful gives me a sense of joy that I feel as my own, rather than happiness that feels fabricated. It connects with my own experience and uses brilliant irony to evoke in me the sting of regret and fear -- and then make me feel like I personally triumphed over tragedy.</fullReview>

I absolutely love how Roberto Benigni portrays his role, all the actors were well chosen and gave such a realistic depiction of the reality of those days. It really helps to understand the political and social situation they were living in those times. It is a beautiful mix of romance, joy, to some extent adventure, cruelty and sadness. From start to finish this film is full of surprises and keeps the audience intrigued. Personally i don't understand the negative comments, this is a 10/10.

		<fullReview>I kept hearing people complain that Benigni's 'Life is Beautiful' brought shame to the subject of the holocaust simply because it was a comedy and avoided the details. I think they are mislead. I think what Benigni is trying to do is present a story of a father and a son and what the father is willing to do to protect him.The story is really in two parts. In the first A Jewish-Italian waiter named Guido works in Italy and keeps running into the same woman who he has fallen in love with. At one point he sees her at a party and rescues her taking her away on horseback. Several years later they have married and had a son. Suddenly WWII breaks out and the three are sent to concentration camps and thus begins the second half.In the camp Guido tries to shield his son from the horror around him. His son Giosue never sees what is really going on because his father has led him to believe that it is all a game of hide and seek and that if he wins, he will get a tank as a prize. So the movie becomes a game of cat-and-mouse as Giosue tries to stay hidden while Guido tries to keep him convinced that there really is a contest going on.'Life is Beautiful' is a wonderful movie evoking memories of Chaplin's best work. Benigni is a talented comic actor and a very brave director. He conquers a tricky balance between a difficult subject and a light comedy. This is a high-wire act of a movie and he succeeds brilliantly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Humble Movie, with Great Story in it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite aspect of the movie is the idea or messages, and those are translated to the story, or screenplay. Some of the my favorite movies have a really good twist, or truly get into my heart. But "Life is Beautiful" has very different kind of story that I have experienced before. Very genuine, funny, unthinkable, and like what narrator said in the beginning of the movie,"This is a simple story... but not an easy one to tell." Full of wonder also sorrow. For this kind of movie, like "Grave of the Fireflies", has unique perspective, but not a sad movie. It is a funny- ironic movie. So let's start to dive in the movie.The movie point really starts for about an hour after the actual movie starts. And I call it "Intro". Yes, for me, what an awful time for just an intro, that actually has a very few consequences in the end of the movie. In the beginning, I don't feel very comfort with the cinematography. It's a 1997 movie, but the cinematography is very simple. The technical aspect maybe not very good, but as the intro begin, the very interesting character of Guido is get stronger. A very attractive protagonist, talkative, and smart. The very classic atmosphere of intro is nothing but nice. However, the intro is rather pointless, some of the people may think, a very long time for just the protagonist married with woman that he's always surprises. With one or two "Nazi-scene", this movie is unexpected for its next part. The "Main" part starts when Giosué Orefice plays tank. For this story transition, I admire it very much, a very extreme story, also ironic and iconic.The main part is still funny, with tremendous Benigni acting, and also Giorgio Cantarini as innocent young boy, Joshua, the son of protagonist. Yes, with the humor of his father, Joshua keep feeling happy in the most sinister place of the modern human history, the concentration camp. What an idea, Joshua thought the camp was a game because of his father. He always counted his point until 1,000 points, to get a prize, tank. Of course, it's all just a lie, a very kind lie. The main idea of the movie is revealed, it is the very opposite perspective of the reality. And why don't we use it like an innocent child, so that we can always be grateful. We can always think that "life is beautiful", with its very genuine paradigm. Indeed, very deep message of a very humble movie. I think everybody can feel so sad, in the same time also feel happy and gratitude while watching this movie.I know, as an adult, we usually swallow reality too fast and let ourselves depressed. But, sometimes let the problems be just a game or challenge. Don't take it seriously, let us enjoy our life. We see life, and feel it. By changing our perspective, and keep doing our job, we can always say the title of its movie. Yes, despite its amazing story, it also affects my own life. Remembering how Joshua can make it, and why I can't get through a problem. Although the intro is not so good, but the main part is really something to think about.At last, "Life is Beautiful" is the best of Benigni, and a great message of humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This film is beautiful too! "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're considering watching this, please do! Don't let the fact that its in Italian put you off! In summary, a perfect feel-good film about the strength of the human spirit that will soften the heart of any viewer and put a massive smile on their face in the process! The contrast between the innocent comedy and the atrocities going on in the background allows for even greater effect. The film is enhanced by fantastic performances from the three main actors/actresses, including the perfect depiction of innocence from the boy, and a perfect performance from Benigni. Alongside the plot which took me to a happy place for the full duration, the film has a beautiful soundtrack which further complements the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innocence and Courage!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Innocence and courage, sometimes that's what you need to get through some hard times, more importantly, get the one you love through, have a shoulder for them when they need it. It's about love and family.It's the story of a father who uses his humor and his son's innocence to help him get through the Jewish Holocaust. He makes his son believe that it is all part of a game and the winner wins a tank.The first half of the film is actually a rom-com set in the politically strained environment of Italy. Whereas, the second half is set in the concentration camp where Guido tries to protect his son.Critics argue that the film handles a delicate subject matter in a comedic and carefree manner and it might offend a group of people. But it should be understood that that is actually the purpose of the film. What the character of Guido does is present the whole concentration camp as a part of a game to his son, and the viewer. If the actual holocaust was show, it would defy the purpose of the film and take away its innocence. We have Schindler's List for people who want to witness the actual holocaust. This is a different film. It is supposed to depict family love at its best. The film is about optimism and hope.The film being comedic, which manages to bring a smile every now and then, is depressing all of the same. Not only Benigni delivers a superb performance, he has directed it just as well. Barring the occasional goofs by the supporting cast here and there, it's the story that ill stay for you for a long time. The film is perfectly blended with just the right score and beautiful use of "Belle nuit, ô nuit d'amour".Direction: Strong self direction, might be a little flawed at places but great nevertheless.Screenplay/Story: Extremely good. It handles the controversial and delicate subject matter with utmost ease and delicacy. Strong character development, creates a character that stays with you. Even better executed.Acting: A deserving Oscar for Roberto Benigni. Giorgio Cantarini had the innate innocence required for the character. Rest if the cast was fitting.Music: 'Perfection in simplicity' is the most fitting phrase to describe the subtle score by Nicola Piovani.All in all, a film that stays. A film that can effect you if not change you. A film to be enjoyed with the family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently noticed that I have scored a lot of films extremely high (on IMDb). The first time I had watched these films was many years ago. I thought out of respect to them films I should put finger to keyboard and comment.My comments are: Firstly if you watch this film and it's not a movie that will have a lasting effect on you, then maybe film is not your medium. I suggest this could be the most perfect balance of hysterical comedy and serious drama ever made in film.Secondly can any three words highlight a films content so strangely, Life if beautiful? The focus given to the strength of human nature in adversity but somehow delicately handling the Holocausts content.Thirdly, the film could stand alone on the acting. Roberto Benigni incredible, the doctor who loved puzzles, the wife's portrayal of pure good nature ? they could have all won awards.Laugh and cry in the same moments is something that special ? this film did it. As a farther in times of stress and panic - Guido is still a role model in the back of my mind years on. LIB Respect Paid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly marvelous movie. The work by Roberto Benigni is too good. The acting of the child outstanding. The realism of the movie is not its strong point, but then again it is not supposed to be; this helps in bringing the audiences to a state of mind away from reality, focusing on the feelings generated by forgetting about all external events and developments of the war. Despite that, the movie does not fail to point out an element of the Nazis psychology demonstrated by the doctor who was obsessed with riddles. Guido just turns every situation into a possibility. Being so blatant about his love. Comically funny. Attributes to a stand out performance.</fullReview>

It's really a wonderful story and everything fits together real nice. I very often find that films that are a bit over the top are drawing the audience away from the reality of a the story. While this story may at points be a bit questionable, it's the reasons we write movies and not based all films off of real life (as if this were the invention of lying). I don't not want to give anything away except the fact that this film is certainly one of those that'll make you cry and then say wow. I promise you won't be disappointed...unless you're a nazi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To See the Good Side of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'La Vite ? Belle' touches very deeply into the concept of meaning of life. It's a study about seeing the beautiful side of the things, doesn't matter the nature of that thing. It looks like a hard theme to put in film, because it's not that easy to convince the viewer to buy such theme. So director Roberto Benigni picked a very controversial and somewhat extreme subject to put this idea in: The Holocaust. Hardly someone would think in a good side of the Holocaust, and certainly it hasn't any. But we can only cheer and appreciate what Benigni tried to do. He dared a lot doing that.And Benigni seems to be really the star in all aspects of this film. His acting was very impressive, it reminded me a bit of the Jerry Lewis performances, but it obviously has much more serious tons than the latter. Being said, the entire cast did a very satisfying performance.The film score(and the soundtrack in general) is perhaps one of the most beautiful that i've heard in a film. Really impressive. And so are the beautiful takes of the city. The scene where it's raining at night and Vito is escorting his 'princess' to her home is a highlight.So, if you are planing to watch this film, do it. 8.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie which connects on all levels! Benigni's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title suggests,the movie beautifully portrays the struggle of Guido (Roberto Benigni) to protect his son Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini) in the WWII Italy. Roberto Benigni escalates his funny man stature to a different level with his romance in beginning with Dora (Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife) which makes you laugh your heart out and then he maintains this through out the movie even when his life is at stake to convince his son it's all right and they're playing a game which is very touching and almost makes you cry (And you do at the end). Technically, the film is very well scripted and directed by Benigni himself which garnered him an Oscar nomination for direction which was very well deserved as the sequences of romance and between Giosue and Dora came out very well and Benigni's makeover as a courageous father hellbent on protecting his son and using his sense of humor as a weapon to protect and comfort him is brilliant, it's no Schindler's list but it connects with the audience in it's unique tragicomcical script which leads you to believe there is a hope under those horrific circumstances, the movie is no satire but has a charade of comedy to underlying harsh reality which leaves the audience touched at the end.Overall one the best movies on holocaust and Robert Benigni's masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holocaust meets comedy and someone who can pull it off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Question: Is there any conceivable way at all to combine the holocaust with comedy and get laughs out of it? Well, not really I'd say, not without completely sacrificing the unspeakable horrors the concept of organized mass murder stands for. One shouldn't even try. If you look closer at Roberto Benigni's "Life is Beautiful" you will see that such an attempt isn't actually made either in this film. It's not about ridiculing Nazis, confronting them with their own absurdities or pretend to go along with their ideas to make the underlying idiocy apparent. This is just a means. Rather the film creates a parallel, carefree world alongside the horrific reality of the Nazis, which is upheld by the central character Guido (played by Benigni himself), a clown at heart. All this in order to keep up the illusion of a perfect world for his son Giosué in the face of impending doom. "Ah, the train ride was no good," the father admits to his son when they arrive at the concentration camp. "When we go back we take the bus. I'll tell them!" And when young Giosué wants to quit what Guido has convinced him to be just a game, his father is the first one to head out: "We're in the lead now, but well, we won't get the big prize then. Too bad." And suddenly Giosué reconsiders.Roberto Benigni undoubtedly is a brilliant comedian. He's unforgettable e.g. in Jim Jarmusch's "Night on Earth" as a crazy cab driver to name just one example, but unfortunately his talent is often wasted in various light comedies. Great opportunities arise rarely for comedians, but Benigni grabbed this one and put all his heart into it, as director and actor. Contrasting his slapstick humor with the stark, painful reality of the Nazi's final solution to the Jew problem is daring, risky and extremely difficult to pull off. Thanks, Roberto Benigni, for giving the impossible a try. Highest recommendations!</fullReview>

Before watching this movie, I would have never believed if someone said, slaughtering Jews can be pictured comically. Now I have to believe it. Roberto Benigni made it possible. He never touched the other side of emotion, the dark side.Good morning Princess! The relation begins here and ends up in marriage. With his humor and the ability to make everyone laugh, the marriage turns out to be a good one. They live happily together until the occupation of Italy by German forces. You could never sense the violence of Nazi in the pool of humor. The emotions between protagonist and his little kid elicit tender feelings. The climax is very touching.It's true! Mama! Mama!! We won! Yes, we won!!We won!! We won!!!This is the sacrifice my father made. This was his gift to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"When can I see Mama?"....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...."When the game's over." The year is 1939. Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni) is a cocky Italian waiter of Jewish descent, and is bent on winning the heart of Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), a beautiful schoolteacher. To do this he uses his talent for turning up in unexpected places and his witty humour and charm. The entire first part of the film is based along Guido winning over Dora and is played with a comedic feel. It isn't until the latter half where the film becomes truly beautiful.Five years on, Guido and Dora have Giosué (an adorable Giorgio Cantarini), their only son. Their life is peaceful but disturbance arrives when Nazis take away Guido, Giosué and Guido's softly spoken Jewish uncle, Eliseo (Giustino Durano). It is only with difficulty that Dora succeeds in convincing the Nazis to take her, too (even though she still ends up separated from Guido and Giosué). Desperate to shield his son's fragile young mind from the horrors of the Nazi camps, Guido creates a game for Giosué: you gather points for things like staying hidden and following orders. The first person to reach 1,000 points is the winner and receives his very own tank. Naturally, Giosué is happy to play along.However, the illusion becomes harder to maintain as the camp conditions worsen. Giosué's faith in his father sometimes wavers and Guido must be strong for the sake of his son.I'm not going to reveal what happens, but I will say that it will probably stir up a mixture of emotions.When I first heard about this film, I found it hard believe a "Holocaust comedy" could be believable or enjoyable. But this film displays a level of dignity and heart which strikes a chord with the viewer. The beautiful chemistry between the three leads is touching, especially that between Guido and Giosué.Benigni's acting strength comes not only from his comedy talents but also the powerful love he is able to show as an actor. Braschi also is wonderful as Dora. After her family is taken away, Dora says to the Nazi officer in a voice both frail and strong: "My husband and son are on that train. I want to get on that train. Did you hear me? I want to get on that train." Her gently unrelenting character lends a motherly side to the film But best of all is Cantarini as little Giosué. His wide eyes and expressive face give a different touch to film with a kind of brutal honesty. It is so, so hard to describe the way the film *feels* when he is on screen. You are seeing it from the perspective of both the father, the mother and the innocent and painfully unsuspecting child.Wonderful film---8/10</fullReview>

It is about heroism without action, but with words. A man falls in love with a woman and after some years they have a baby. Unfortunately at that time (1944) they are Jewish, and things turn out very bad. The story tells us that you can put fear away with humor.The acting is very good, and the cast is also very well put together. All actors perform great throughout the whole movie, especially the main character and the little boy.It's a very special film. One you can't find on the screen very often, maybe once a decade. Therefore I recommend it to everybody. Your day will be good after seeing this one, it's full of humor/suffering/sacrifice/happiness.My score 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Author Viktor E Frankl would have loved this film. His book "Man's Search for Meaning" (at least the second half of his book) came to life in Guido's character (Roberto Benigni). The film's segment in a concentration camp actualizes what Frankl attributes to his own survival in a Nazi concentration camp, i.e. his own choosing of the way that things affected him, rather than letting the Nazi's dictate that choice for him. What Guido (Roberto Benigni) did in the concentration camp is what Frankl would have have advised him to do and Guido did it very well. This strategy proved especially beneficial for his 5 year old son, Giorgio.The film is very upbeat and loving, especially in it's first hour which makes no mention of the holocaust or prison camps. Evenso, the uplifting spirit of Guido continues into the camp, with him continually finding ways to show his love there for his wife and son. He's always looking for ways to make things better, never giving into depression in what was clearly a depressing environment. He certainly made the best of a very bad situation.Frankl's memoir of survival (in the second half of his book) really came to life through Guido in a way that Frankl could never have imagined, but which was done very touchingly, none the less. Although Frankl's book is very serious material, I found it to be remarkably complemented by this film.</fullReview>

The acting is good the directing is great. I do not feel that the actor who plays the son gets enough credit--his lines are delivered so child like (not the disrespectful attitude of children in most movies). This movie is not a documentary. Therefore, those who pan it as treating the holocaust irreverently are watching the movie with different color glasses.

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the ten best movies I have ever watched. Life is Beautiful(La Vita e Bella) is an Italian film which is set in 1930's Arezzo,Tuscany which is in central Italy. Roberto Benigni's performance as the imaginative and humorous Guido Orefice is one of my favorite characters in film but Benigni is also good as he also directed and co-wrote the script for this film. This film won three Academy Awards which were Best Actor-Roberto Benigni, Best Foreign Film and Best Dramatic Music Score and was also nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture,Best Director-Roberto Benigni, Film Editing and Best Original Screenplay which it would win three out of the seven. This is one of my ten favorite movies of all time which I usually compare with The Truman Show as it starts out comedic but quickly takes a dramatic turn. Even thought this film is in Italian,this is still a film that cannot be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Life is beautiful",is a film about that brief period of Nazi rule in Italy due to which many ordinary Jewish people had to endure enormous hardships.Although it is a film about Nazism,it is quite different from other films of the Nazi film genre like Schindler's list.It is more of a film about comic romance,laughter,optimism and how to keep one's sanity intact when one finds oneself in a difficult close to death kind of situation. This film ran into trouble as many leading filmmakers protested against what they called "making mockery of a serious issue like holocaust".According to Godard it is hard to believe that life could have been beautiful for anyone in a concentration camp.Life is beautiful is divided into 3 parts:carefree life,period of hardships and a harmless game with a kid.Roberto Benigni and his wife excel in all these parts.It is the star kid Giorgio Cantarini who shines in the last part.In a way,it can be said that the film succeeds because of his innocent behavior with which he carries himself through his entire stay with his father.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful film full of great wit and extreme confidence of happiness. This movie moves one in and out of happiness to a point where one might be confused weather to laugh or cry. This story of a man who goes to great lengths to see the love of his world, to go to great lengths just to make contact and see the people he cares about simply smile. All falling on top of a death that shocks something inside that tears don't begin to roll when you would expect them to but eventually have their way with you when you see this little boy's face light up over something he does not even understand and then the ever so powerful reuniting of the family brings a wonderful climax of emotion. One is only left to think about how their life has been effected by such a powerful personality and their life that follows. I loved the film and it is one that can be seen over and over again. Love it every time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching in a way never experienced before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being an avid movie watcher for some time I have become aware of many films that try to portray 'love', with a vast majority falling way short. However, what you have here is a movie of such invention, passion and true spirit that it is almost inconceivable that one man could be the genius behind it all.The start reminded me more of a Peewee Herman film (for those who are familiar) than anything else, with comical humour almost over used. But as this film develops it becomes something so special that I will remember it always. To portray such a simple story so effectively requires genius, which Guido has in abundance. I don't need to say anything in particular about the film as you must watch it, but be rest assured that it will leave you touched in a way that is very rarely achieved in cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much to say about 'Life is Beautiful' other than the fact that it is certainly worthy of seeing. The film is at once hilariously funny and immensely sad. Set against the backdrop of the Holocaust, Benigni's character falls in love. What ensues is a series of comedic events, all in spite of the blunt truth of World War II. Benigni was certainly worthy of his Oscar, and this film was certainly worthy of its own Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. It's an inspiring, clever way to depict the events of the Holocaust, without feeling overly cynical or insulting. That in itself was quite a triumph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instant Classic (Possible Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film that is an instant classic and pure genius. It is a rare feat to turn the holocaust into a comedy and not lessen the horror. This is not another just another holocaust movie to help us remember. Shindler's List is the defining movie for its genre, but rather this movie takes for granted that you already know about the holocaust from school, movies, or elsewhere. For example, what else would give you that pit in your stomach feeling when you see Guido's uncle sent to a different line after the train ride. This is not exactly a film about the holocaust per se, but it is a film about a triumph over the holocaust. Yes, Guido dies, but Giosue survives. Guido's sacrifice was a triumph. It is a rare mixture of happiness and tragedy, all in the correct amounts. It is a film that will leave you speechless, save to say "Life is beautiful."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is Beautiful: A Modern Tragedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful is an inspired tale about the strength of love and the human spirit. It has been called a modern masterpiece. It is also one of the most powerful tragedies of modern time. Its death toll exceeds Macbeth, its beautiful blend of pathos and comedy mirrors King Lear, the death of the protagonist echoes Romeo and Juliet and the final feeling of catharsis is equal to that of Hamlet. Guido (Roberto Benigni) - a charismatic yet gauche waiter who's gifted with a vivid imagination and a seductive sense of humour - has won the heart of the woman he loves and created a beautiful life for his young family. However, that life is subsequently threatened by the German Nazism of World War II and Guido must depend on those very same strengths to save his beloved wife and son from an inconceivable fate. In 1999 Life is Beautiful won three academy awards: Best Actor - Roberto Benigni, Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Dramatic Score. Honoured with this staggering level of critical acclaim, Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful is a completely unique motion picture that will elevate your spirits and captivate your heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are those who criticize Benigni's effort, because it lacks the gruesome horror that was portrayed in Schindler's List (another of my personal favorites). Granted, the holocaust was not to be taken lightly. However, for this film to work, Benigni is faced with many challenges of contradiction. After all, isn't that what this film is all about?This is not a film about the holocaust. This is a love story, for a man and the love for his wife and a man for the love of his son. It is a film about what we are willing to do for love. The holocaust simply provides the most strenuous setting for this to be displayed.I only wish the Academy had the guts to name this as the best film of 1997. I don't know 1 person who thought Shakespeare in love was a better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inaccurate fantasy that brings you closer to real life than anything else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you're taught about the Holocaust in school, it's impossible to comprehend the scale of the tragedy. When the teacher writes `six million' on the blackboard it's hard to see past the number. What we weren't taught was that the Holocaust wasn't about numbers, it was about people. Six million people like your mum and your dad, six million of your friends, six million people who had mums and dads and friends of their own. Life is Beautiful gives us the intimacy that the numbers can't translate, and for the first time, it becomes more than words in a textbook talking dryly about the unimaginable.The first half of the movie lets us see the lives of the three lead characters, before showing us how easily they can be destroyed. Writer/director Roberto Benigni is immensely charming in the lead role, and it's sad to see him sucked into the predictability of Hollywood. They loved him in the movie, they laughed at the Oscars, but they'll only ever see him as a novelty item. Don't expect any lead roles in mainstream American cinema any time soon. The chemistry between Benigni and real-life wife Nicoletta Braschi holds the movie together, and their son is so adorable that the audience will fight over who loves him the most. This domestic bliss and light comedy is surrounded by a growing sense of danger, and the appearance of Nazi officers becomes more frequent as the film reaches its midway point.In this atmosphere, there is a wonderful scene where Benigni is waiting at a table in a restaurant. The guests are talking about a maths problem introduced into German textbooks, which is soaked in anti-Semitic propaganda. Their lack of concern and interest makes a powerful point with great subtlety: that the Third Reich wasn't just one man. Before the seizure of power, the Nazi party had been immensely popular, and Germany's history of anti-Semitism had begun long before Adolf Hitler rose to prominence.The second half of the movie is where its genius becomes more obvious, but where its historical accuracy becomes more obviously flawed. Guido (Benigni) and his family are taken to a concentration camp, and the only way he can explain the situation to his son is that it's a surprise for his birthday. He then turns it into a game, explaining that if they get the most points they will win a tank as first prize. This made me consider something that hadn't ever crossed my mind. How did they explain it to the children? It's impossible even for adults to truly understand the Nazi years, so how can they begin to explain such evil to children?Their concentration camp is bizarrely relaxed and spacious, and Benigni is allowed to walk around fairly freely. This is where most of the criticism comes from; that it trivialises the experience. But while it doesn't show the full horror, it shows it on a level that the audience can understand. That Guido retains his imagination and humour has also been criticised, but it's too easy to see every prisoner as a broken spirit. This shows that resistance can be in the mind, and that it is no less powerful for being hidden.This movie embraces the idea of history from below, that by looking at the experiences of `real people' you can understand the nature of real life within history. The Nazi years weren't just about torture and book burnings; when the books were seized and burned, how did it affect the reading habits of the German population? Did they read less often, or read only the books that were left? This idea is the key to Life is Beautiful, and you can forgive it its inaccuracies for giving us a personal experience that can then be generalised.The ending is truly heartbreaking, and finally `six million' makes sense. Guido, his wife, and their son, were just three people, but we now understand that there were six million more just like them, who were all braver than we will ever need to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly beautiful fable, no more, no less.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful is the first movie in years to make me cry, and the first ever that I freely admit. In addition to it's powerful story, there are hardly any artistic flaws to be found. Benigni's slapstick feels like homage to others, but his personal charisma (and sheer cuteness) inject it with new life. The cinematography is excellent, the site gags all work, and even the youngest member of the primary cast was a believable actor. The story itself? There are no words for how powerful, even life changing it is. Pulling you in all directions at once, crushing beauty with atrocity and then injecting joy into the most despairing of conditions, the film manages to raise so many genuine emotions and leave viewers haunted with it's message.And yet, there are legitimate questions raised by it's detractors, who often feel as if the merit of the story is lost by presenting what could be viewed as a too sanitized version of the Holocaust. As is said in the beginning of the film, the story is a fable, and I view it much as I did the play _The Crucible_. In _Crucible_, many details of the events in Salem were changed, many to make the tale easier for modern audiences to understand and accept, without being so shocked that more subtle intent is lost. Though it makes it less respectable as history retold, it does not take away from the powerful moral to be gained. Similarly, in leaving the true horrors of the concentration camps to our imaginations, Life is Beautiful allows us to become involved more strongly with the moral tale and subtle feelings invoked by individual characters and events without bludgeoning us with sheer horror and revulsion. Holocaust history does demand the most respect of any historic tragedy, and perhaps too much is assumed of the audience's knowledge, but by focusing on a single idealized story this film can influence the heart in ways that the incomprehensible magnitude and surreal horror of the Holocaust often cannot when presented as numbers in a textbook or even the anonymous agony on newsreel. Personally, I found it to evoke greater revulsion towards the relatively smaller losses and understated horrors then many other likeminded films do towards more accurate portrayals of great atrocity.While not a perfect film, Life is Beautiful is easily one of the best and most powerful ever made when viewed in the proper light, and above all else, its moral shines as a important reminder of how precious- not to mention beautiful, life is.</fullReview>

"Life is Beautiful" reminds me also the old American "pastry-films" (like the tv series "The Three Stooges") in which things happen because they happen and don`t have to be explained.

		<fullReview>Doesn't it feel good to be treated by European cinema with delicacies like this? What an absolute pleasure such films fill your soul with, it feels so nice not to have been cheated by producers who promise heavenly films and deliver nonsense.Benigni is not new in cinema and filming, having directed and written before (e.g. Il Piccolo diavolo (1988) aka The Little Devil (1988)), but it is mainly his comedy he is known of, his characters being utterly silly (on purpose ?) but always satirical and extreme, outspoken and laughable, as well as lovable. Just recall the taxi-driver in Rome in Jim Jarmusch's Night on Earth (1991) or The Little Devil (1988) himself.Yet Benigni never managed to overcome the superficial comedy, the lighthearted one, which was keeping him in the general entertainer level, a kind of clown for the masses. In this rhapsody to life though he steps far ahead, he becomes the advocate of happiness, simplicity, love. He radiates his Italian/Mediterranean spirit of loudly spoken, open-hearted, joyful mood, even in his miserable times he has his own unique way to deliver an open smile.Benigni chose to work on a tough subject, the holocaust, but his intention is not to present his version of the subject, produce another Schindler's List. The holocaust is only his vehicle to express his anti-racist, anti-fascist ideas and bind them up in an all-loving manifesto on enjoying life no matter how it comes. His story starts when his character Guido tries the urbanised way of living in a late 1930's Italian town affected by the rise in popularity of the fascist ideas. Guido remains unaffected by the dark signs and worries not, always finding a way to make things seem funny, satirising every aspect of a strict and collapsing state and public life. He falls in love with the school teacher Dora (Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real life wife, who has worked with him in almost all his other films), whose heart he wins through a series of hilarious incidents. The camera meets them again after a few years, married and with a son. They get sent to a concentration camp, but Guido will find again a way to make things seem glad to his little boy's eyes.It's pointless for me to go through the nominations and awards the film has earned (and is going to earn !!!), look at the imdb's website for this. Still, it is the audience which gives the credits to the film, and it was a nice feeling for me to see so content faces when the lights turned on in the theatre I saw the film. Some might accuse Benigni of dealing with a sorrowing matter in a light way. But if you ask me, unlike Spielberg and other directors who narrated stories about the holocaust, Benigni succeeded exorcising it without putting even a single brutality on celluloid, merely telling his audience that life is what you experience and every single one of us has a different perception of reality. If you go to the cinema once a year, this is certainly the film to see this year! Simply UNMISSABLE! It deserves a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

Benigni has described "Life is Beautiful" as an homage to Chaplin's film, which he has seen many times.In fact, the number on his prison camp uniform is the same number on Chaplin's uniform in "Dictator."I was charmed the first time I saw this movie, and knew of course it was a masterpiece, but on second viewing the film had much more power. I took my mother, who loved it, and now want to see it again. A lot of little details can go by if you're not careful. See it again if you have a chance.Benigni's generous love and affection have such power. I truly feel sorry for the poor louts who think it is a "comic treatment" of the Holocaust, or that it uses the Holocaust as a "backdrop" for comedy. This is simply not the case.I rearranged the letters in "Life is Beautiful" to create the following ironic anagram: "Lie a bit, if useful."</fullReview>

The look at the Holocaust horror was respectful, and the first half was very funny, though I had to take some time to get to like Benigni, because the memory I had of him was of the terrible and unfunny Son of the Pink Panther, but once I got used to him I discovered his abilities as a comedian.The film is OK, it's a little film, both funny and touching. I thought the ending was not good, and Benigni is not much of a director. A good little film, but what's the fuss all about? Score: 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best film I have seen in a long time. Don't be put off by anything you have heard, or because you think "it's impossible to laugh at the Holocaust"... This film asserts the power of love, life, and humour in the face of unimaginable adversity. It's *not* a realistic film, but it's a real tragedy - narrated in comic mode. It's gentle, amusing, and touching. Folk were weeping at the end, and I nearly was myself. I went unwillingly to see it (because I *hated* Benigni's The Monster), but I'll see it again soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether tomorrow you have an important job interview, are getting married, or are attending the birth of your child, cancel them all and watch this film. (Your wife will almost certainly understand.) Rarely if ever has a film poured out such bittersweet poignancy, such depth of emotion, such an ability to pull at the heartstrings. Utterly enchanting, Life Is Beautiful captures the triumph of one man's will over disaster. It is by turns comic, by turns tragic, with a resilience which inspires faith in humankind. Foreign films are, of course, normally rubbish. But this one bucks the trend in such spectacular fashion as to reclassify the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and Moving!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life Is Beautiful" is not a holocaust movie, although it has some striking scenes that show the precariousness of the camps, it's a movie about how far a person would go to save his own son.The first half of the movie looks like it's made by Chaplin, it's incredibly funny, and shows how brainy the main character is (Watching his plans to "surprisingly" meet Dora are priceless). And it's also a love story, and not a bad one. It's hard to find directors that are competent in doing comedy and drama very well, usually they make a good drama, but not so good comedy, or the contrary, but Benigni deserves to be compared to Chaplin in this one, he made me laugh and cry, and there was almost no break between these two emotions.The second half is more about the father/son relationship. What that man went through to protect his son is one of the most beautiful stories i've ever seeing. But all those sad moments merged between funny ones. Benigni's performance is amazingly funny and moving, but what really surprised me about the acting was Giorgio Cantarini as Giosué, I'm not saying he was better than Benigni, but for a kid to make such a big difference in the cast of a movie is rare to see.Verdict: Funny and moving, this is a masterpiece as good , if not better, than Chaplin's "The Great Dictator".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Light-Hearted Holocaust Comedy The World Needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life Is Beautiful is Roberto Benigni's simple and unpretentious comic masterpiece about the Holocaust. It's also one of the most wonderfully manipulative movies ever made, one that lulls the viewer into a sense of security and joy before introducing him to a terrifying story about altruism and the price of love.The movie contains in fact two stories: one follows the lovable Guido falling in love with Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), a schoolteacher, and using his humour and imagination to win her heart. The first thirty minutes of the movie are a lovely homage to classic cinema, in the way it sets up countless gags that are later pulled off with whimsical and hilarious results, and with perfect timing. There's a lot of physical humor in the movie that reminds one of the old silent comedies.After the viewer has fallen in love with Guidio and become intoxicated with Guido's love for Dora, the movie turns a darker turn and details how Guido and his young son are sent to a concentration camp. For Guido is a Jewish, as the movie stated from the start. It seems an insignificant detail at first but it changes Guido's life forever.In the camp Guido, using his endless imagination, convinces his son that they were sent to a fun camp where they have to earn points working and performing special tasks to win a tank in the end. Guido loves his son so much he wants to spare him the truth about the world's horrors.This movie has been much criticised for trivialising the Holocaust, I claim I couldn't care less about. Art is not beholden to matters of good taste. In fact, as Rabelais, the father of the modern novel, has shown us, art is full of vulgarity, blasphemy and humour. Why should cinema be any different? This movie is pure invention, a ridiculously simple version of the relationships between prisoners and between prisoners and guards. But in its fiction it's closer to novels, which always start from invention too, and by being invention it manages to speak about themes that transcend a mere account of Holocaust reality. What this movie has to say about father/son love, the price of altruism, and the power of imagination is the stuff of high art.Roberto Benigni is excellent in all the roles he had in this movie: as an actor (he much deserved his Oscar), as a director, and especially as a screenwriter, whose ability to invent gags and comic situations was remarkable. He only didn't provide the music; that was accomplished by Nicola Piovani, who also deserved his Oscar. Like all manipulative filmmakers, music is 90% the manipulation, and Piovani provides all the upbeat and dreamy and melancholy themes that make Life is Beautiful a heartbreaking experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been many movies made on holocaust issues, Schindler's List and The Pianist being some of the best holocaust movies ever made. And Life is Beautiful is a highly deserving addition to this list.Roberto Benigni who acted, co-wrote as well as directed this masterpiece does full justice to the role of Guido Orefice. He is so subtle in his performance, so funny yet being so serious at the same time.He always will be remembered for this role.Dora, played by his real life wife, Nicoletta Braschi did full justice to this role and the chemistry between the lead actors was nothing short of outstanding.The rest of the cast contribute significantly with Joshua, played by Giorgio Cantarini standing out among them. The background score is simple yet terrific and truly deserved its Academy Award.This one was genuinely loved and embraced by one and all, resulting in 3 Academy Awards and many numerous other awards. All in all, a movie that truly deserves all the laurels and recognition it is getting. This is one of those movies where you are definitely going to get moist-eyed and also obtain an experience of a lifetime. Please don't miss this one. Life is really short and of course very BEAUTIFUL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, the movie is divided in two parts, the first is a little silly (when R. Begnini meets Dora), some non - sense situations, but since he and Dora have a son, what happens next it's really really good, it's impossible not involving with the plot since that moment. The performance of the R.Begnini and the child can't be better. Dora is great too, except for the situation of the car when R.Begnini surprises her in her boyfriend's car, her expression is very poor, except for that, her performance is excellent. The character of R. Begnini is a smart man who does everything for the people he loves. If the first part were shorter (20 minutes less), it would be a 10/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming Holocaust comedy drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never thought I'd type the words 'Holocaust comedy drama', but there it is. The strength of Roberto Benigni's brisk, slapstick autovehicle is that it leaves no room for dwelling on the mawkish - except for one brief but horribly memorable sequence in the mists of what might or might not be a terrible nightmare.At the outset one would be forgiven for thinking that Benigni is trying too hard. His happy-go-lucky aspirant bookstore owner Guido wins the girl from under the noses of parochial Facists with endless physical comedy and chat. The wearing charm turns into the essence of survival come the second half of the film. I think that the almost surreal madness of the first half serves to normalise the second.For all that Guido is not only decoy for his son in the face of the horror of a concentration camp, he is also something of a decoy for the rest of the audience. My favourite performance is that of Joshua, played by Giorgio Cantarini, only five years old during production. Sensational. With the exception of Giustino Durano as Guido's sanguine uncle Eliseo, none of the acting comes even vaguely close to these two. In the end, a super matinée that celebrates the good guys for once. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is as beautiful as life according to the title. Undoubtedly, it will have added to my overall appreciation and understanding that I am Italian and did not need to see this subtitled, but even so, I am frankly staggered to find that so many people were outraged by this sweet, tender little gem of a film, one (the one who finally convinced me to write this) even going so far as to brand it fascist propaganda.La Vita E' Bella is anything but fascist. It if were, it would condone Nazism, which it never does - nor does it belittle its crimes, and the sufferings of thousands of innocents during WWII.What it does is tell the story, heart-warming and -wrenching at the same time, of a man who so dearly loves his son that he will not have him tainted by the horrors of the concentration camp, and thus does every thing he can think of to make the little boy believe that the corpses around him are just pretending, just taking part in a complex game where people only look like they get shot and hurt.Why would Benigni, I wonder, go to such pains to invent a whole new reality for his child, if he did not fully comprehend and condemn the terrible events as they really happened? Calling this revisionism is just plain silly; the film is not trying to re-write history. It is simply showing how, through the force of fatherly love, an innocent may be taught to smile, and hope, and never to despair. If that's not a message worthy of the big screen I don't know what is.If you haven't watched this film, please approach it without prejudice. Approach it not as a slanderous lie, but as the story of how imagination may save a human soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beauty in Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can you possibly tell the audience, that your main characters go to concentration camps and still show them, perceiving it as a game? That might only be possible if you go a long way and illustrate what a person is capable of doing such a crazy thing. And this is exactly what Benigni does. Everything Guido does in the seemingly comedic first half of the film, prepares us for how he is going to explain the situation to his son, in the second half. The Schopenhauer-magic trick, the wit to act as somebody, who you aren't under extreme danger, only for the one you love, first his wife, then his son. All this is part of a touching story, which does not need any greasy effects, but tells us about love. In addition to that Guido is so impossibly witty, like when towards the end, he breaks from the camp and tells his friend, Bartholomeu, to meet in Vareggia and open up a steel business. Although the tragedy already being inevitable at this point, I cried tears from laughing. When Roberto Benigni jumps around screaming, full of life, it looks easy, typically Italian. I'm convinced it is not, for it must have been hard work. How hard is it to tell a sad story in a funny way? To find anything funny, regarding the background of the setting, the holocaust. Beningi achieved it and consequently was awarded the Oscar. Never have I agreed more with the academy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry, but a little overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie definitely has its moments but overall it is not more than a small charming melodrama which is worth watching but nothing too special.The hyperactive humor of Benigni reminded me of Louis de Funes which I find almost(!) unbearable. The contrast between the horrors of the concentration camp and Guido's effort to pretend it's all a funny game to keep his little son from the truth is quite a bit out of balance. This movie does not do justice to the demise of the prisoners in those camps. I'm sure it was not Benignis intention to show torture, violence and death as Schindler's List but in my opinion this subject does not leave room for extenuation for the sake of a friggin' movie. Overall this film tends to be quite naive (especially at the end)which, again, I think is intentional. Nevertheless, I don't like that at all. With all due respect for Benigni, his craft and talent and his father (who was held captive in Bergen-Belsen) this is playing with fire - in a moral sense. The romantic aspects are very naive too but also quite cute and funny - maybe just because of that naivety.Additionally I'm starting to get uncomfortable with the fact that even modern movies seem to be unable to shake the habit of showing German WW2 soldiers as nothing but fat and/or creepy squallers. But there have been movies far more worse then this one. So it's just a small bellyacher.It's a good movie. Charming and funny but with quite a few weaknesses. It surely would have been better to work on that superficial "la dolce vita" atmosphere. The Academy Award is justified but only because of the lack of competition.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps some spoilers contained herein:Steven Spielberg should take notes. See, if you're going to make a film about the Holocaust, do so with some originality. I don't care to watch self-indulgent, exploitive, voyeurism, Oskar Schindler and the Temple of Doom, Oskar Schindler, the Extra-Terrestrial, the Holocaust in all its made-for-Hollywood, tear-jerking glory. Just make a sweet, little comedy that captures more drama, more real, human feeling, and more uplifting goodness amid horror than Spielberg in all his overblown ineptness ever could.Okay, I'm going to leave Spielberg alone now. It's just that, in retrospect, I realize I didn't bash Schindler's List enough when I reviewed it on this site.Charlie Chaplin understood the power of comedy to make a social or existential point. I was surprised to learn that Roberto Benigni does as well. Assume that your audience is aware of the collective human embarrassment that was the Holocaust...and don't show it. Just put us in that historical context and mock it with the story of a man who, even in the gravest of circumstances, acknowledges the beauty of existence, of the woman he loves, and of the son he brought into this God-forsaken planet. Life is Beautiful is not an ironic title- it is, absolutely, the fundamental transient human truth that permeates every second of celluloid it took to make the movie. The film culminates with the reunion of mother and son, the son yelling joyously, "abbiamo vinto (we won)!", referring to the game he believes he has won, the game his father spent every second of his internment convincing his son they were playing. His mother, with tears in her eyes, gives her tearful agreement, "Si, abbiamo vinto." I am a pretty hard person who's become more so as a result of two and a half decades of socialized masculinization, but I burst into tears every time I watch that scene. What it means to have won is for you to feel, not for Benigni to say.In fact, Benigni does not explicitly say much. Life is Beautiful begins with a narrator whose identity is later revealed stating, "Quest'e' una storia simplice (this is a simple story)." And on the surface, it is a simple story as Benigni tells it. The understated profundity of its message, however, is not simple. It is a rejoicing, and it an act of defiance. Life is beautiful, in spite of what we collectively do to ruin it. This is film is to be seen again and again.</fullReview>

This motion picture is so amazingly crafted and assembled, that when following the story you become a part of the time. This has done more for telling the truth about the period then many other movies. It is just beautiful how that though is just a side story to the main plot, but then in the end completely throws you over and wakes you up.

		<fullReview>On the Valentine Day I had decided firmly to watch this movie and I realized that nothing could prepare me for what I was about to experience even though I knew beforehand that this Roberto Benigni's magnificent creation which was held high by the critics was nominated for the Best Picture along with the much expected and truly great Saving Private Ryan.(The fact that neither of them won as the Best Picture is as disappointing as the fact that Denzel Washington didn't win the Best Leading Actor at the 72nd Academy Awards.Also Raging Bull should have undoubtedly won at 53rd Academy Awards as the Best Picture along with the Best Director.But then this are my PERSONAL opinions and are hinted at NO ONE in particular.) As far this movie is concerned Roberto Benigni has done a great job as the director and as well as an actor. This is the movie where we find out that under circumstance of crisis an ordinary being like Orifice can get transformed into a Godly being in order to protect his loved ones.(Here, the wife and the son.) Its in this movie that one learns the importance of will power.(Remember the 'hat-exchange' scene? Or the 'dog near the box' scene? Or the scene in which a real,true tank arrives which the son considers to be his first prize?) This is the movie where one learns that its us who should be in control of our emotions and not vice versa.(Remember the scene where Orifice is carried away for execution? Watch his facial expressions and the way he walks in order to mask his sadness and fear in front of his son.) Its in this movie that one learns the great principle of OPTIMISM.(Remember all the scenes where Orifice keeps telling his son that they are playing a game where they have to score bonus marks and if he expresses even his desire for food(hunger) there will be substraction of marks?They were actually suffering extreme conditions in the concentration camp for being a Jew.) Even though I usually don't prefer to give ranks to my Personal choice of 25 Movies of All Time, this is an exception and this movie gets the Rank One. Even ahead of Crimson Tide(1995),Terminator 2:Judgment Day(1991),Se7en(1995), Kramer Vs Kramer(1979)and Usual Suspects,The(1995).Truly the Best.(had won the golden statuette for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously not everyone will find this to be a great film with a most unique perspective of the most horrendous times of the 20th century. However Roberto Benigni did not create this film for the box office. He told a story of about the power of the human spirit. This work will stand by itself as one of the great film perspectives, which reveals the power of the human spirit over the evil and terror. I'm happy to see so many people who wrote reviews here did in fact find this to be a great work of our time. I saw this film on the big screen in its first release and again on home video and cable. It's just as powerful in all formats. For those who love great stories this film is a must see. This is one of those few films that actually deserve the '10' rating.

It doesn't work as a comedy: first of all because Benigni is just annoying (yeah, I used to love some of his movies once too. Now I find it annoying) and secondly because we get the point of "presenting the holocaust to your son as a game" and there's no need to drag it for another hour. However, the movie doesn't work as a drama/educational either: It just doesn't seem to take any of the situations seriously and it doesn't show the horrors of the holocaust. In particular, I don't get the entire first half of the movie - it doesn't have to do with the rest of the movie at all.I didn't really find the movie offensive, just... a waste of a filmmaker's time and effort. It's funny that Benigni chose the prison camp uniform to have the same number as Charles Chaplin's uniform in "The Great Dictator (1940)", as I wanted to give Chaplin's "The Great Dictator (1940)" as the example of how to make a masterpiece, dealing with the same subject - while making a comedy. Yeah, it's not easy to make a comedy about the holocaust, especially if you want to make a point and have some serious under-layers. In comparison to "The Great Dictator", I would say that "Life Is Beautiful" is quite offensive - making fun of the situation instead of letting the viewer feel the horror and seriousness of it.Let me give you a simple example from "The Great Dictator" to make my point: - "How many were going to strike?" - "Three thousand of them." - "Have them all shot. I don't want dissatisfied workers."This is one of my favorite bits. It's so funny, yet Chaplin didn't put it just for the joke - he put it there to show how cruel the Dictator is and REALLY teach about the situation and conditions. Benigni does just the opposite: He makes stuff up just for the sake of being funny - I couldn't find any value in his jokes or in the script in general.To sum it all up, Chaplin entertains the viewers while at the same time letting them feel and understand the horror. Benigni completely detaches the viewers from the situation and his entire purpose is to make them laugh. Comparing Benigni to Chaplin is like comparison DreamWorks to Pixar.I honestly don't understand how this movie got so many praises.2/10 Horrible. Go watch "The Great Dictator" to learn how to handle this subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an entirely effective movie, that still is a good watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having heard nothing but positive about this movie, I must admit that I was slightly disappointed by the movie. The movie is not the effective and emotional involving concentration camp movie it promised to be, which is due to some poor choices of storytelling and its approach. But of course nevertheless this movie is way better than the just average movie regarding the subject and the movie still manages to be effective on most of its fronts, just not on the most important ones.The main problem with the movie is that it can be divided into two separate parts. In the first part of the movie 'life is wonderful' and everything is perfect and the story is told almost fairytale like, with a dreamy like love-story and lots of slapstick-comedy in it. It's just too perfect and happy all, which really doesn't make the movie believable. Yes, I of course realize that this was done on purpose to make the contrast of the second halve of the movie that is set in a concentration camp all the more bigger. It's almost like; no matter what we are going to show in the second halve, it's always going to look worse and more horrible compared to the 'happy' perfect-life first part of the movie. It felt like a really cheap way to steer the viewer's emotions. And let's face it, nothing really bad actually ever happens in the second halve For example; correct me if I'm wrong but we never get to see anyone get killed on screen. And all of the prisoners could walk around freely it seemed and the way the story was told made it seems as if they were in the camp for only two days or so. We never get to see any of the WW II cruelty which occurred in these sort of concentrations camp at the time of the war, with the exception of two or three sequences, which just isn't quite good and effective enough for such a sort of movie that tries to get the viewers emotional involved with the characters and events that occur in this movie. Also the fact that the mother was on the other side of the concentration camp gets highly underused and underdeveloped. They could had really made the movie more effective and emotional with this plot element.Also the comedy of the movie was far too slapstick like for a movie with such an heavy subject. It for me was the reason why I enjoyed watching the movie but yet just never got emotionally involved with it. Roberto Benigni is a clown, not an actor! But yet he won an Oscar for his role in this movie. Sorry, can't say I'm really a fan of him. Too much jumping around and shouting and not enough structured acted out humor, though he shows he's a competent director with this movie. Despite taking some not so effective approaches, the movie is still well structured and directed.It's rather cute that Bengini and his wife Nicoletta Braschi always appear together in movies but I'm sorry to say that Nicoletta Braschi just isn't the greatest actress around,, to put it mildly. It's also always dangerous to have a young kid play one of the other main characters of the movie. Giorgio Cantarini does an effective job with looking cute and Innocent at all but he also looked a bit too much to the things going on behind the camera's during sequences, as if he wasn't focused enough on the actual filming process. This was getting a bit disturbing after a while, especially in some of the sequences toward the end of the movie, which are the most heavy moments of the movie. I admire the approach the story picks when the movie gets set in a concentration camp, when the father is coming up with all kinds of things to make his young son believe they are in some sort of holiday camp, instead of a concentration camp. Truth gets mixed up with fiction in the movie, which provides the movie with some good moments. It's perhaps the best and most interesting idea of the movie, which certainly helps to make this movie an unique one. The movie is really good looking, which is of course mostly due to the Italian settings of the movie but the movie also does a good job at re-capturing the '40's period, in terms of costumes, sets and props. The movie is most definitely not a cheap-looking one, which perhaps is the case with most other European productions, especially the ones regarding the same subject and time period.The movie was one of the big surprises of 1997 and was also nominated for 7 Oscar's, also including the ones for best movie, best directing and best screenplay. The movie eventually took home 3 statues for actor in a leading role, best foreign language movie and best music.I was overall slightly disappointed by the movie but my expectations for it were perhaps a bit too high.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I already commented, but I've been thinking more...As far as I'm concerned, true hope is knowing the truth and knowing that things can get better. What I saw the father offering his child in this movie was not hope, but denial and delusion. It might work for small things, like "Aw, how cute, that rabbit fell asleep on the shoulder of the road". But this was ridiculous to me.And the lie was even too lame to make sense... like even a little kid would believe that all those people were being starved and beaten and worse, all because they wanted to win a tank???OH, yeah, I forgot - we didn't see anyone getting starved or beaten.

		<fullReview>I had to fast forward many times while watching this movie. It is packed with the worst Hollywood stereotypes (including its soundtrack) and generally belongs to the same category as the numerous "Titanics" that try (and succeed) to impress their sentimental audience. No wonder it won its Academy Awards. No wonder it had such a huge success among the folks that generally don't watch foreign language movies. I'm not a big fan of Benigni. Although he was good in Jarmusch's movies, he's no Chaplin. A couple of scenes in Life is Beautiful are funny though, and for this only reason I give it 3 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slight and forgettable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful made no noticeable impression on me. There were some well-rendered moments, but on the whole I found it to be a shabby movie. It's a hell of a lot better than most movies that get made, but that isn't really saying much.Begnini certainly has some kind of endearing quality about him, but it's not enough to carry a movie, especially one so slightly composed and predictably directed. Indeed, that was the glossiest concentration camp I've ever seen onscreen, but aside from all of that, the part that seems to have most of an effect on the people I've talked to about this flick -- the story and characters -- were not enough of a presence to make any kind of stamp on my mind. This movie relies entirely too much on the work of other movies and on the memory of its audience. If you don't have the camp from Schindler's List or a lifetime of history lessons in mind while watching this flick, you'd have no idea what Roberto is hiding from the boy. There is that pile of bodies and that offscreen shooting, but they inspire nothing. They have no visceral power. That shot of the piled bodies only gets something across because it's expected in a Holocaust movie, not because it is a powerful image. You know what it is because Amon Goeth set fire to such a thing in Schindler's List. Taken by itself, the movie doesn't stand up insofar as it doesn't directly relate its characters to any real atrocity. It relies too heavily on the predjudices of the audience to carry its message across. I tried watching it from the perspective of a child, and I suppose it would have been a little better from a child's POV, but the thing is, a child doesn't have the knowledge of what Begnini is going out of his way not to show. It's a harmless movie that defangs its subject matter while standing up for something that is easy to stand up for. Thinking about this movie afterwards, I went from merely annoyed to just plain mad. What annoyed me about it was how the subsidiary characters were such cardboard mock-ups of human beings. The German doctor who really only cares about solving riddles, the brother that phones his lines in and then disappears, the good wife who shows up at the camp so Roberto can play that record for her, the other prisoners, and all the others that escape me at the moment, are merely foils for Roberto's pranks or the movie's message. This movie is accoladed in the way it is because it says that the Holocaust is bad. And these accolades come despite the shabbiness of its construction. Schindler's List says essentially the same thing, but that movie achieves greatness because of the sheer power of its imagery, the indelible humanity of its characters (on both sides), and the personal conviction behind it. Begnini remade an old Jerry Lewis movie. I went in looking for a great movie because I was told by many people that it was great, but that is not what I saw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams Where Are You?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really two movies: the first an awful slapstick comedy, the second an insulting fantasy.In the first half we are treated to Roberto Begnini (whatever) doing a really bad Italian Robin Williams impression. Boring us with poor comic timing, annoying screen presence, and thoroughly obnoxious rapid-fire dialog that just grates on one's nerves. His clown-like appearance only emphasizing how unfunny he really is. At this point I was ready to turn it off. But lo and behold, the movie then totally shifts into some sort of Italian Hogan's Heros (not to be confused with Stalag 17).We are treated to the mystifying insistence of the wife, apparently a non-Jew, demanding going to the concentration camp where her husband and son are being taken. Guido, the main character, mugs and clowns unmolested all around the camp, which is oddly squeaky clean. He manages to caper about, while semi-hiding his small son, and only has to carry an endless supply of obviously fake anvils from point A to point B.This is not a concentration camp, not a work camp, it's more a summer camp. Everyone plays hard, but stays clean and reasonably well fed. This is a bad movie. Because its funny parts are not funny, its gritty parts are not gritty, and it demands no emotional connection to its poorly acted characters.Oscar? Puleeze!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfunny, offensive and generally bad film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my view this is an awful film. Cliché ridden, woeful acting, idiotic storyline. Does anybody honestly believe that this otherwise smart kid would continue to believe the stupid story about the point gathering game ? Did we lose something in the subtitles ?This is a totally unfunny comedy (unless one thinks that falling on the floor or getting an egg squashed on one's head is absolutely hilarious. I used to but I haven't for more years than I care to count.)In my view, associating slapstick (and bad slapstick at that) with something as tragic as the holocaust borders on blasphemy. I felt sick in seeing this giggling buffoon prancing around trying to get a laugh in a concentration camp decor.Throughout the presentation, I couldn't make up my mind whether that main actor reminded me more of Jerry Lewis at his worst or of one of the three Stooges, except that the latter comedians did at times succeed in making people of their era laugh. They did not always take for granted that laughter being contagious, all one has to do is giggle intermittently and the laughs will follow.And no, the short scene depicting the bodies does NOT make up for the general lack of sensitivity displayed in the other 99.999% of this movie. In fact, this scene seems totally out of place in the storyline, as if the actor had mistakenly walked off the set. ...As if the ballet dancer had stepped on your toe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can see why it was a success, but it wasn't that good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I said, this film can easily pass as one of the most emotional and thought-provoking stories in modern cinema. Its big success worldwide, mostly in the U.S., spells out the mainstream ingredients for a successful film. It is quite simple really how this clown-like parody of WWII got to earn so much money: relationships between people, and relying upon one another.. These two sentences may sound simple and over-profound, even too usual and melodramatic for some tastes, but believe me, they are the everlasting secrets of how to make a movie sell. Movies that have to do with companionship, love, friendship, helping one another, make money.Movies that have to do with loners, death, and the impossibility of love, do not make money.Think about a rather recent example. Why do you think the academy and the audiences preferred the even "Million Dollar Baby" to the spectacular "Aviator"? Simple. "Million Dollar Baby" was about friendship, love, companionship and sacrifice. The "Aviator" was about a recluse, the lonely life of a psychotic millionaire, a film about ONE person. If you really think about it, the most successful films of all time are the kind of soapy melodramas whose superficial sentimentality hypnotizes the minds of the mainstream viewer. It's not about action and happy endings, a rather falsely perceived Hollywood notion about a successful film, but rather a movie that deals with bonding and friendship. Would "Lord of the Rings" have made so much money if it hadn't been about the FELLOWSHIP of people/creatures?? Not really. It's almost impossible to imagine how a film that is not about bonding can be successful. The retention of the illusion of film can only be achieved if the viewer can idolize the sacred value of love. Be it amorous or otherwise. And this is it. This is why movies like "Shawshank Redemtion" and "Titanic" will always sell more than "8 1/2" and "Andrei Roublev". They are more collectivist whereas the other two are more individualist. Once such notions as family, love and friendship are celebrated on screen, the viewer seems to like it better. And it is obvious, isn't it?? No matter how good a film is (meaning the story, the acting, the direction, the music) it will always sell if it focuses on the triumph of human bonding.In this case, "La Vita e Bella" was successful because of that. It was a film about the love and sacrifice of a father for his son. Period. That's all one has to hear to like this film. Its extremely bad aspects are immediately ignored. No one seems to care that this film was an insult to those who suffered during WWII. No one notices how unrealistic Begnini's portrayal of the clown was, how much of an immature parody of human emotions and historical truths the film was. Behind the silly laughter and the pretentious theme lies a true mockery of WWII, and nobody seems to care about it..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dramatic Turnaround Makes It Unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this in a movie theater when it came out, and I discovered later it didn't remotely compare to watching it on DVD. The latter is a far better experience.It's spectacularly filmed, one of the better looking movies you will see on DVD: sharp as a tack and gorgeous, something a big screen kind of makes fuzzy. I found that more attractive than the story, even if it is a good one and one that you never forget.Few films have changed gears as dramatically as this one. The first half is a slapstick comedy-romance featuring the goofy Roberto Benigni, a hyperactive Italian who successfully woos a woman he accidentally meets one day. About 35 percent of this part in the film is clever and funny and the rest, kind of stupid....but not annoying. The only aspect that grows tiresome is Benigni's motormouth, which is always going and is just too much to bear after awhile. The guy wears you out, listening to him!The second half of the story jumps ahead to about 5-7 years later when Benigni and his girlfriend are now wed and have a little boy. Being Jewish, the man and his boy are then taken away from his little town to a concentration camp by the Nazis. The wife voluntarily goes, just to be with the other two. The rest of the movie shows how the father protects his son by pretending it's all a game. The second half, of course, is what most of us remember best and is very inspiring, a haunting tale with a few scenes that stay in your memory.On DVD you have the option of Italian with English subtitles or a dubbed version. Since the visuals are so good and the dubbing is expertly done, I would recommend that. It's a cliché but, this is an "unforgettable story."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Begnini is no Chaplin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no subject in the world sacred or horrific enough that it cannot be dramatized for cinema. Holocaust, because it occurred so recently, is deemed an unfilmable taboo by many. Some of the people I know, refused to see Benigni's controversial film out of sheer principle. I resisted seeing it as well, but not because of the nature of its topic. Everything can be approached from many different angles, and in this case, Comedy has the most risk in striking wrong notes with the viewers. At times, Comedy ,particularly in the guise of social satire, can expose truth and even present it in a bold, provocative manner. But a Holocaust comedy? Of course, life in the concentration camp can provide plenty of material for life-affirming sentimentality, but as presented in "Life is Beautiful" it is obviously FALSE. This is simply milking a historical event of great importance to modern humanity, for the purpose of luring an unsophisticated audience to admire one's work. Benigni without a doubt makes a talented comic, and the first half of the film, when his big-mouthed character mocks Italian fascism, IS funny, precisely because it's satire. As soon as he and his on-screen son are shipped off to the camp, the object of ridicule becomes less clear. What we get is a soft toned, PG-rated, annoyingly unrealistic treatment of unspeakably brutal conditions, where death and disease prevailed. In a fantasy or a science fiction setting, the duo's exploits could have worked, but to anyone who is aware of history, they would seem implausible. It's surely a noble effort to protect one's child from the terrifying reality by pretending that the whole setting is a game, but unfortunately, had it been a real camp, both father and son would have perished within a week of their ordeal: the later would die of starvation, the former be shot on sight for excessive talking or better yet, silenced by his irritated fellow prisoners. Chaplin, whom the director is often compared to, in The Great Dictator, never even tried to exploit the "Final Solution"; wisely, he stuck to Hitler and his henchmen. Besides, Chaplin was most brilliant at silent comedy. Benigni, on the other hand, just can't seem to shut up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite its unusual approach (it's a holocaust comedy) this is at heart a fatally self-conscious, shamelessly lowest-common-denominator film with the subtlety of a brick to the head. When he isn't straining to act 'lovable' (actually coming off as obnoxious), Benigni keeps busy pushing every easy emotional button he can think of. But why should we care? His romance is never made believable, and the horror of the holocaust is never made real, because the way he edgelessly films it, we might as well be watching a film set in a medium-security prison. (The movie numbers a grand total of one effective dramatic moment, which is Benigni's artfully handled last scene.)The lowest point in recent Academy Awards history is when Roberto Benigni won best actor for this film (he was up against Nick Nolte, Ian McKellen, Edward Norton and Tom Hanks, all in career-best performances, for god's sake!).If you feel such a strong need to be manipulated that you don't care that the guy doing the manipulating is a shallow egotist, then this movie will suit you just fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How far will Benigni go for a few laughs and tears? Very, VERY far. Here, after all, is a film which portrays concentration camps as loosely structured playgrounds, Nazis as inept buffoons, and its hero as a lovable trickster, able to come and go as he pleases. It's "Hogan's Heroes" with a violin ending. But let's be fair. It's not the historical inaccuracies alone which make this movie such a shining example of cinematic bull****. Credit must also be given to its shameless sentimentality, bad jokes, shoddy plot, and the flagrant narcissism of its "creators".And to my fellow reviewers who maintain that this is not a film about the Holocaust but rather the importance of familial love, I should like to say two things: One, you're confusing the film's theme with its subject, and two, if Benigni didn't want to make a movie about the Holocaust then perhaps he shouldn't have SITUATED HIS STORY IN A NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMP!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life IS beautiful, but I prefer to take the "Train of Life"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I rented this movie, about 2 years ago, I thought I was going to love it. It already had an Oscar and the ratings on IMDb were very high, so could it not be great? It was a BIG disappointment! I thought `Life Is Beautiful' lacked consistency most of all. It this movie was a Holocaust fairy tale (!?) for everyone to enjoy, it should have ended with the nazis and prisoners dancing and kissing each other, because `love conquers all'. If it was a comedy, I should have laughed more than twice. And if it was realistic, it would have ended sooner and tragically. Fortunately, my family didn't experience the Holocaust, but I have read enough about it and seen enough pictures, that I can never understand how you cannot be offended by this movie. I think a lot of people don't realize how wrong it is to trivialize the Holocaust, because it doesn't seem real to them. Can anybody even imagine a comedy about 9/11? I didn't think so. Maybe 50 years from now, when it doesn't seem so real and tragic.Last week, I watched `Train Of Life', an European co-production about the inhabitants of a small Jewish village in Central Europe who organize a fake deportation train so that they can escape the Nazis and flee to Palestine. The subject seems as unrealistic as LIB's, but the very surprising ending makes the movie brilliant! I absolutely loved `Train Of Life', the story, the acting, the music, the humor, everything about it!I wanted to learn more about Radu Mihaileanu, the Romanian director (a Jew himself) and found an article from "Le Nouveau Cinema" (feb.1999), entitled "Inferno Train". According to "Le Nouveau Cinema", director Radu Mihaileanu, who also wrote the script for "Train Of Life" wanted Roberto Benigni for the role of Shlomo, "the village foul". He sent the script to Benigni in 1996, but was refused politely. Strangely enough, less than a year later, Benigni was directing his own Holocaust comedy movie! Having trouble with finding financing for his movie in France (because of the delicate subject), Mihaileanu started filming a year later. This delay was more than enough for Benigni and his `La Vita E Bella'. His movie was out in theaters in Italy, during Christmas, while `Train Of Life' was still in editing. Because of the scandal surrounding the 2 movies, Gilles Jacob, the person in charge with the selections for Cannes, refused both. After Miramax bought the rights for `Life Is Beautiful' for 7 million dollars, the movie was finally selected for Cannes! In spite of everything, `Train Of Life' was nominated and won awards (about 9) all over the world. It even won the Audience Award at `Sundance' (tie with `Run Lola Run'). I recommend `Train Of Life' to everybody!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happens when Charlie Chaplin meets Woody Allen? A question better left for Roberto Benigni to answer, The brilliant Italian who is the winner of "Best Actor" Oscar award, starred, co-wrote AND directed this masterpiece was definitely the right man in the right place.This Oscar winner for "best foreign language film" in 1997 is set in Italy in the 1930s follows the story of Guido (Roberto Benigni), and Italian Jewish waiter who works in his uncle's hotel. Guido, an eccentric comic who seems to find humor in the darkest of times meets the beautiful school teacher Dora (Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real life wife) and he instantly falls in love with her and finds himself starting a subtle rivalry with her Fascist fiancé.The first act of the movie can be classified as pure romantic comedy, and can actually be considered an entire movie on its own, a rather good one actually, between Guido's humorous relationship with Dr.Lessing- the German doctor who becomes a regular at the hotel because of Guido and their mutual love for riddles and brain pickers- his adventures around town with his friend Ferrucio, and his unforgettable night with Dora ending up with him indirectly confessing his love for her not knowing she was engaged, this first act was so perfectly set up so that we don't realize the bitter truth until very late in the act, the fact that Guido is in fact, Jewish.The second act is what could be the model answer of the question in the first line of this article, was indeed Chaplin meets Allen,the tears of a clown, when Guido, his uncle and his son Joshua (Georgio Cantareni) are taken to a concentration camp where the loving father sets up a scheme to convince his son that what's happening here is nothing but a game that is made for his own entertainment.Benigni hits a nerve with his touching story, breaking all the rules and brings us tragedy disguised in comedy, reminding us that what may look as political affairs, all go back to the same roots, basic human ingenuity."Life is beautiful" is not a political movie, it's not the summer's hit romantic comedy and it definitely isn't the action blockbuster you'll wait in line to watch, it's human spirit in form of delicate, light hearted comedy, Benigni did not make a comedy out of the Holocaust, Benigni created life out of death, and made the entire world stand in awe in the process.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From slapstick comedy to drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie recently and I had high expectations, due to the fact that I had heard that this movie is one of the best ever made. So, naturally I expected to see a dark drama focusing on the Nazis' cruelty. But instead I was watching for a big part of the movie ,the first part, a comedy which was basically slapstick which I found obnoxious. Highly unrealistic scenarios and cringey dialogues. But at the second part of the movie things changed. Although it had still comedic elements it started to feel like a drama. The ending was also heartbreaking. This movie made me feel like I was in a concentration camp myself, and the main death was extremely sad. Although the movie was generally unrealistic (in the second part the father and son had way too much liberties in the camp, and the kid definitely would have been spotted in real life), and the main death totally could have been averted, it was one of the few movies which made me to such extent disgusted with the Nazis' crimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Italian film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guido is Italian Jewish and gets married with Dora. Some years after, they have a child, Giosu? and they live happily. But the war starts and they/Re send to the Holocaust.This film genre is comedy and romance. And this film describes the Holocaust but not heavy story because it includes elements of comedy. This film is told by Giosu? after the war and he pays great respect to his father.Through the film, Guido seems selfish but very nice. He never gives up his hope to live with his family. So he always thinks his child, Giosu? and his wife, Dora. One of my favorite scenes is that Guido and Giosu? go to an announce room and scream "Principessa!" through a speaker. This scene is very cute and heartwarming. Also Giosu? is very cute. Giorgio Cantarini plays very natural and innocent.This is a fiction movie but maybe similar story; Jewish were forced to labour or massacred was happen in the Holocaust. I can't stop crying when think about that after watching. I think it is Oscar-worthy film and this is the best Italian film.</fullReview>

This film shows loving and humorous elements that I have not seen before. Even when it looks most like the darkest, manages this film to give me a deep thought of relief.This movie deserves a big round of applause for the creativity and humor. even such a somber event as World War II often says, we can still find love and imaginationmy conclusion.

		<fullReview>This is the most beautiful movie I have ever watched. The plot is great, the scenes are great, the little fella is wonderful. It is giving the sad thing with some jokes in it. This is the best thing about this movie. It is the story of how a father struggles to save his son's life, how he gave up his life for that. The mother of course while she can have everything, she just pushed them off and go after her husband and her son. Isn't this true love or what? It is such a great story to tell, so touchy. The last scene is the worst part of the movie but still it cannot shadow the beauty of it. Everybody should watch this one or wait must watch this one. Not just for enjoy of course to learn the love, loyalty and some of history. 10 out of 10 well deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Italian films I know</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This tragicomedy film is about the efforts of a Jewish Italian, Guido, to deal with anti-Semitism and the persecution of the Jews without his son was aware of the cruel reality in which they live. Directed and written by Roberto Benigni, who also plays the lead role, also has the participation of Nicoletta Braschi and Giorgio Cantarini.We all know the barbarism that was the Holocaust. This film addresses this issue and how the Italian Jews were involved in the process. The script is good and addresses a serious topic in an unpretentious and elegant way, using an intelligent and deeply human form of comedy to touch the audience. The characters are moving, particularly Guido and his son. Benigni shone with a performance at the highest level. The soundtrack, signed by Nicola Piovani, was excellent, maybe one of the best soundtracks of that decade. The film received three Oscars (Best Foreign Movie, Best Leading Actor and Best Soundtrack) and conquered the critics and the public in Europe and U.S. This is a touching and poignant film, which shows the human need to survive to the worsts disasters and always have at heart the living flame of hope. Undoubtedly, its one of the most beautiful and relevant films of the contemporary Italian cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely Life-Changing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although 'life-changing' may sound a little too dramatic, I actually do feel that this film made such a remarkable, deep impression on me, that it must have changed my life, at least in some way. It is certainly amongst the few films (and books) that have managed to alter the way I think about life. I truly cannot recommend this film enough, to anyone, from anywhere. Not only is it a wonderful resource for learning about the Holocaust and World War II, especially for those who perhaps are less aware of Italy's role during the war, but it manages to almost unintentionally, and very simply, teach the viewer about this. The Holocaust, of course, is a crucial part of the setting for this extraordinary story about someone who, on many counts, is just an ordinary man. However, feelings we are left with by the end of the film are not especially due to having watched a 'Holocaust Film', as it were. Our thoughts do not so much focus on the horrors of the Second World War, as on how incredible this man was in the extent to which he loved his family. By using universally understandable humor, and in a fantastic, unique way, bringing a light atmosphere to the subject of the Holocaust (whilst not once understating the sheer evils that occurred, may I add), the film, very cleverly, enables us, as the viewer, to understand the experience in the same way as his son does.Whether you speak Italian or not, is irrelevant. This film will leave a great impression on your heart, whatever language you speak.</fullReview>

He is a clumsy, haphazard but ultimately optimistic and well-meaning man. He is deeply dedicated to his family and community. When he and his son are sent to a concentration camp, he invents story after story to protect his son from the truth of their situation.

		<fullReview>Usually I don't write reviews but this movie was so Beautiful I couldn't resist the urge to write about it.Movies based on (World) War and Holocaust and Humanity like "Schindler's List", "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas" and "The Book Thief" always evoke strongest emotions in me but because it's a foreign language movie I was avoiding it. Today as I stared watching this (with subtitles), in no time I forgot that fact.Holocaust is just the backdrop but the movie is actually about father-son relationship, love and hope. Looking at the first half and guessing by the name I was waiting for the perfect happy ending, then Guido died and I just refused to believe that.At the last scene when Giosue finally got his First Prize his expression made my heart feel happy and then knowing that his father Guido is dead my heart was sunk deep in the ocean of sadness. At the last shot when Giosue was explaining to his mother Dora how he won the prize and is going take it to home, my heart melted and I stared crying Like a child or as If I lost someone close to me.For the first time I feel the real power of cinema, it touched the right chords. The right mix of humor, romance, drama, history and tragedy made this a real classic. It reminded me that it is not always about happy endings but indeed Life Is Beautiful...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is set before and during the German occupation of Italy in WWII. The dialogue is in Italian. It's a little Jem of a film ,beautifully shot with a heart wrenching plot. The movie takes you from the peaceful simple life of pre-war Italy to the horrors of life in a concentration camp. In the start of the film we meet the central character , a simple Italian man whom is trying to win the heart of a girl he meets. I felt the treatment of this stage of the movie was given a comedic , slapstick treatment by the director which was helped by the rapid Italian dialogue. This comedic treatment seems a little out of place as you watch it , but you realise it's purpose later in the movie when the mood turns somber . The Italian man wins the girl and they marry and have a little boy. We learn through the film that the family are Jewish and when the Germans occupy Italy the family are sent to a concentration camp. It is from this point on that the movie becomes a true masterpiece . The lengths the father goes to to protect his son from the horrific situation they are in is simultaneously heart warming and torturous . The dark oppressive atmosphere of the camp and the stark reality of imminent death of the family is forever present as they struggle to survive. A total roller coaster of emotions , I love it. 10/10</fullReview>

But once I started getting into the latter half of the film, I was already loving this film.This film had a lot of laughs for a movie about the Holocaust, and for the reason so, I began to grow a connection with this film. I was laughing a lot watching it. Making a comedy about the Second World War is some Tom Cruise s**t. It's Risky Business. You need to know what's sensitive and what's not. But director Roberto Benigni knew what he was doing filming Life is Beautiful.And once the credits started rolling, I already knew this movie was my favorite foreign WWII film by far. Life is Beautiful is surely a beautiful film. It deserves a 10/10 out of me. If you're ever in the mood for an enjoyable, lovable film with relatable characters you can connect to, watch Life is Beautiful. Because Life is Beautiful is beautiful.</fullReview>

I could go on and on about the hardships of war and family, antisemitism, human intrigue within and or of a perfect society, or the zeitgeist within Nazi Germany... but I won't. *spoiler* I would like to talk about a man who under the guise of playful exuberation, concocts a complicated game with a point system to try and distract his young son into believing that the occupation of Italy by Nazi Germany is a game that everyone is in on... sure the kid doesn't always go along with his father, and at times he even sees this "game" as a bit much, but the grand 1st place prize of a shiny new tank is too much to sway him.

		<shortDescription>Touching but a little over the top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen quite a few touching foreign films before and this one falls just a little short, not because of the storyline, (which I do agree with some reviewers that it is slightly unrealistic, but hey, that's what a movie is for, a bit of escapism), but because the acting for Roberto Benigni is so over the top that it takes you out of the movie in some scenes. Worse is the main actress, whose acting is so wooden it is painful to watch sometimes. There seems very little differentiation between sadness and happiness on her face. I think the best actor in there is their son, the little boy, he is a total natural. For me at least, he steals the show in every scene. The script is well written and there are a lot of double-take wit and sarcasm in there and some laugh out loud scenes. It is a good movie to watch when you are in the mood for something warm and slow, and not action style, on a cold winter's night, relaxing on the couch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just upgraded this up to seven from 6, might even go a little higher. The reason for this is, I did struggle through the first half of the film, although I did enjoy the humour and actually laughed out loud at some of it, I didn't like the actor when I first watched it. I'm so glad I did continue, strangely I can't get some images of it out of my mind, but had felt underwhelmed when it finished.It is a weird subject to try make a comedy out of it, but underneath it does show how much any person would do for their own.Not sure if it's a SPOILER. But Near the end when he does his little march, just so his son keeps thinking it's a game, really touched me, thinking how many kids have had to suffer like that in reality. Not many films stick in my mind a week or so after seeing it. this one does and not really sure way, strange very strange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Jewish man (Roberto Benigni) has a wonderful romance with the help of his humor, but must use that same quality to protect his son (Giorgio Cantarini) in a Nazi death camp.Roger Ebert wrote, "At Cannes, it offended some left-wing critics with its use of humor in connection with the Holocaust. What may be most offensive to both wings is its sidestepping of politics in favor of simple human ingenuity. The film finds the right notes to negotiate its delicate subject matter." Indeed, this is he most striking thing about this film (from its opening mocking the arm-outstretched salute), just how much it refuses to take anything seriously.In that respect, it is a response to "Schindler's List", even if not intended to be. Sometimes in the face of evil, you just have to laugh, and Benigni takes that approach.</fullReview>

My main problem was that I had trouble suspending my disbelief throughout. I felt like I was viewing actors on a film set most of the time and not a concentration camp. Also, I had a hard time with the somewhat jovial tone throughout the character's time at the concentration camp. I know this was due to the father's incredible strength and care for his son, but it just did not sit well with me. Also, even though the father died at the end, I felt like they got lucky way too many times. I was also surprisingly emotionally unaffected when the father was killed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you first watch this you wonder what being Jewish has to do with anything. The film never says he is Jewish but supposedly he is. The star Guido is humorous and the things he does are very funny. Guido and his friend go to Italy. His uncle gets him a job as a waiter. Guido meets a teacher he falls in love with right away. He ends up marrying her and having a son named Joshua. There are many slapstick comedy type scenes that go 50 minutes into the film which do not prepare you for the serious part of the story to come.Guido is picked up by the Nazis with his son and put on a train. Guido also sees his wife with the women prisoners. Guido does not want to scare his son. He tells his son it is a game they planned for his birthday. They are all taken to a concentration camp.I thought the film was funny but I am critical of them portraying something funny that is not funny. This was done to fool young Joshua and not scare him because this all happened on his birthday. Joshua is a smart kid. I do not believe this "game" would stop him from noticing how evil the soldiers were and how bad they treated the people. I felt the plot was too unbelievable to believe.The more I see the way people were treated during the war especially the Jews it breaks my heart. Our life is good and we don't see the results of the past wars. There should be more documentaries on the present wars, our soldiers, their injuries and the trials they have to go through.

		<fullReview>The Italian movie Life is Beautiful, directed by Roberto Benigni, was very surprising. The main character Guido, played by the director, was a free spirited happy guy who helped his son, Joshua, and wife, Dora, throughout the holocaust. Without Guido the movie would have a completely different feel. Life is Beautiful gave a totally different look on how to portray the holocaust. Most holocaust movies are really tragic and depressing. Benigni put a different spin on how things are usually done by making a game out of it and he did a very good job.Although I felt the movie was a bit annoying at times, it was really enjoyable. Typically, I am not a fan of foreign movies but I liked watching this movie. I was able to feel everything they were feeling even though I did not know what they were saying.In Life is Beautiful, Guido was a lot similar to the main character Vladek in the book Maus, by Art Spiegelman. Both the characters were very optimistic and knew they could make it through this horrible time. It might have been different ways but they still believed they could overcome such a tragedy. Guido made a game out of the holocaust while Vladek kept his head up and always found ways to overcome things. Also both Vladek and Guido had connections that were able to help them. Vladek had his cousin and many others while Guido had his uncle and the physician.Overall, the movie was very good. The ending was both tragic and happy which kept me thinking in the end. Roberto Benigni truly made the movie and I suggest putting this movie on your "need to watch" list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Life is Beautiful" Review Life is Beautiful was a story about a family and their troubles of World War II. Its main character Guido played by Roberto Benigni sheltered his son while at one of the camps where Jewish people were kept during the Holocaust. This is very touchy subject and you don't see many movies like this talking about at all. There are some elements that remind me of another story about survivors of the Holocaust the book is called Maus.Maus was a story of a son asking his father what it was like during the Holocaust. Some scenes remind a lot of the story. They might not be exactly the same but two Dads trying to keep their sons alive as well as their family. Roberto Benigni character does a great job showing us how life is there for all of us and how that we need to make our children feel safe. Throughout the movie he gives his son courage by playing a game through the time they were captured to the time where the tanks of the allied forces rolled in. It was a story of how a kid and his dad fought through the rough times of the holocaust. This was a great movie, and I recommend to anyone, but also not just because it was a good movie but because there is a great lesson to learn from Roberto Benigni and his movie that he not only stared in but also directed the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful is a drama/comedy that follows the life of Guido (Roberto Benigni), Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) and the life that they live before and during the holocaust. It was filmed in 1997 and it is spoken completely in Italian. I watched it later with English subtitles. The first part of the film is dominated by Guido trying to make a relationship with Dora work out as she is a wealthy woman in upper class Italy. Guido, on the other hand, is just a waiter. Guido goes through countless stunts in order to try and make Dora fall in love with him, and then finally does get her attention. Eventually they do get married and have a son, Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini). Later on, they are moved off to a concentration camp where the family is split up by gender. Guido does a good job of convincing Joshua that it is actually a contest to win a tank. The movie then follows the events that follow them throughout the holocaust. Overall, the movie was entertaining throughout. From start to finish the movie keeps the watcher smiling because of Guido's quick sense of humor and ability to think on his feet. It was an unexpected change to the norm with a happier movie about the Holocaust and how it impacts an individual family. Life is Beautiful is definitely a movie worth watching for either the casual moviegoer or a serious movie buff. And if you don't take my word for it, listen to</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is BeautifulThere are many stories from the holocaust that have been produced into a movie and many have been successful but few have captured the attention and the emotions of the audience like "Life is Beautiful" by Roberto Benigni. The story of A Jewish waiter named Guido takes place in Italy where he is waiting tables and living the life of a normal bachelor of the time. One day he stumbles upon a beautiful young lady who instantly captures his attraction, her name, Dora(Nicoletta Braschi) or otherwise referred to as princess throughout the movie. The key to remember is the time period this story takes place in. In the 1940's the Nazi's were rounding up all Jews and taking them to concentration camps all over. After Guido and Dora settle down and have their first and only child Joshua, the war begins to affect them in ways it never had before. On Joshua's birthday, they are taken by the Nazi's and sent to a concentration camp. Now, this is where things begin to sound a lot like the graphic novel by Art Spiegelman, Maus. In the story by Spiegelman, Vladeks father did everything possible to keep him out of the war and Guido did everything to keep Joshua out of harm's way. The similarity between the two fathers is their instincts as parents to protect their child. They both knew that they had wanted a better life for their kids and did everything possible to make that happen. While there were many other ways that these two stories connected to each other, there were a few twists in either side that prevented them from being the biggest connection points unlike this, which is clearly and easily relatable to both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful (1997) Cast: Roberto Benigni, Nicoletta Braschi, Giogio Cantarini Director: Roberto Benigni Review: Roberto Benigni directs and stars in the Italian film, Life is Beautiful (La Vita e Bella). This film gives viewers an uplifting and heart-warming comedy-drama film that tells a story about a Jewish man named Guido, whom falls in love with a woman named Dora. They have what it seems to be a wonderful life, especially when their son Giosue is born. Guido's sense of humor brings the audience the smiles and laughter while Giosue will bring you to awe. Guido and his son are sent to a Concentration Camp, while Dora demands to be put on the train along with them. Guido uses his positivity and imagination to help his son through the Nazi- Concentration Camp by acting as though it's a game, and whoever gets out wins the prize of a tank, which happens to be Giosue's favorite. Although the plot of the story doesn't catch the overall seriousness of the Holocaust, it brings the viewers a story of a family who is forced to live through the experience. This film relates to the comic book, Maus by Art Spiegelman, because it's a story about how a family has to deal with living in abnormal and even disgusting conditions of the Holocaust. In Maus, Vladek and Anja fall in love and go through the Holocaust together, fighting different battles each day, such as losing their son, which is alike to Life is Beautiful where Guido and Dora fall in love and go through the Holocaust together, yet not everyone makes it through either. Overall these are both wonderful stories that will bring you to tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is Tragically Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I watched the foreign film Life is Beautiful, it gave me a sense of thought on an authors intuition for their story in other words what it brings to the audience. It is a turning of events when a man falls in love, has a beautiful child, wife, and house is forced to go to a German work camp. You can depict your own conclusions from here.As I was watching the movie realization struck me that it had a comedic edge to it. Hopefully some will ask themselves; why is the author trying to portray "funny" in the holocaust? I came to one conclusion; the author is trying to depict a sense of relief. No one else could pull off the part but Roberto Benigni. An innocent wife could be no better co-played by Nicoletta Braschi. The intenseness of these two characters really plays a part in the plot line. As I said earlier, Guidio (Roberto Benigni) has everything going for him. On a random day the Germans deploy every Jew onto a train and headed to the work camps. Through this you will see events and outcomes to see if Guido can save his family. The trait I mentioned in the second paragraph about the movie having a sense of "relief". To take such a powerful terrible thing like the holocaust and make something beautiful out of it is extremely extraordinary. In the graphic novel, Maus by Art Spiegelman, every living thing is an animal. The Jews being mice and German's being cats. This will make people more knowledgeable about the tragedies of work camps in Germany. Finally the twist turning end will come out of nowhere. This specific event blew and flipped my mind in the duration of a second. This particular thing made the movie personally. I love watching Roberto in action and look forward to watching more of his works. Overall, this was a beautiful story about a tragic event that inspired this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful (1997)Cast: Roberto Benigni, Nicoletta Braschi, Giorgio CantariniDirector: Roberto BenigniReview: Life is Beautiful is a movie, not only about the Holocaust, but also of the beautiful relationship between a father and son, and the love that is shared between a married couple. I recently read the graphic novel Maus and found similarities within them. In the movie, Benigni, or Guido has a son, Joshua that he would give anything to be with and keep safe. When they get taken to a concentration camp, Guido makes a game of it and has a point system that entails all of the rules that Joshua must follow in order to stay alive and receive points, to ultimately win the grand prize. In the novel Maus, there is also a strong bond between father and son that grows as the story progresses. In the end of both pieces of literature, the father and son don't end on good terms, but ultimately, end up happy. All in all, the movie was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who is into historic literature and/or foreign films. The movie was nominated for several academy awards, including Roberto Benigni winning "Best Actor". Both pieces of literature also portray the horrific and pernicious conditions of the Holocaust and how love alone can get you through almost anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This violently divided critics, some of whom saw it as a masterpiece of humanity, and others who saw it as trivializing the holocaust. I'm with those in the middle. There's a lot that's enjoyable and touching in the film, but also a certain amount that's too cute for the circumstances, or that screws up the story logic. I like the basic idea that Benigni tries to protect his child's innocence by convincing him that the concentration camp they're in is some kind of psychotic summer camp. And when the convention works it's very powerful. But when it gets hard to believe (as when the Nazi's fail to discover the boy over a long period of time) it takes a lot of the power out of it's punch. Still, some of the comic moments in the film's first half are gems, and while the dark 2nd half doesn't all work, it certainly gets points for trying. A film that's complex and confusing enough that I will re-see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As we get closer to movie #4,000, I find myself trying to see movies that ? let's face it ? are classics and that I have never gotten around to seeing. Many of these movies are foreign films, but that's a "problem" I can easily get past. (Hello, subtitles!) There's no excuse for not seeing them, not now.Life Is Beautiful (1997, ****) is one of those films. The movie has Oscar written all over it, and in fact it won three (Best Actor, Best Foreign Film, Best Original Score). It was released nearly 20 years ago, so it's no longer new but not quite old enough (in my mind) to qualify as an old movie.So now I've finally watched it. What a glorious film! What a flawless film, too, from the acting to the cinematography to the terrific plot ? including the subtle shift, about halfway through, from broad comedy to dark comedy with a tinge of sadness. You don't see that sort of mix often with movies that have a Holocaust theme. Oh, did I give something away? No, I did not.Here's the synopsis. Roberto Benigni plays a Jewish-Italian librarian in 1930s Italy. Guido is a fun-loving cut-up with impeccable comic timing, and it's with his quick wit and that timing that he woos and wins over a noble lass named Dora, played by Benigni's real-life wife, Nicoletta Braschi. That's generally the first half of the movie, with Guido's antics providing some hilarious entertainment. The man rescues his lady with a green horse! But, you see, Guido is Jewish, and did I mention this was 1930s Italy? The Nazis are around, and Guido, Dora, and their young son Joshua are rounded up and taken to a concentration camp. Dora is immediately separated from her son and husband. Guido and Joshua are taken to some stark, ugly barracks. Guido knows perfectly well what's going on, but he desperately wants to prevent Joshua from knowing the awful truth of their predicament. So he tells the boy that everyone ? the other prisoners, the guards, his mom ? are part of an elaborate game. The winner gets to take home a tank! The rules include not asking for one's mommy, not crying, and not saying you're hungry.Elaborate isn't the word for it, frankly. The other prisoners play along, too. Guido's love for his son is so powerful that he refuses to let the lad lose hope, even when other children insist that the guards turn people like Joshua into soap and buttons. Guido's indomitable spirit saves Joshua.Benigni is amazing and justifiably won an Oscar for this movie. Remember him famously walking over seats to get to the stage at the Academy Awards? His outsized personality commands Life Is Beautiful, imploring us to find serenity, compassion, and love in even the most impossible places. Truly a triumphant film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Original Score:4/4, Movie: **** (4/5), Quality: *****(5/5)Hmm, wow. Where do I start?I do not like comedies, and it is not because I do not have a sense of humor, but because I hated explicit comments, black humor, or making fun of serious issues. Therefore, it is why I do not usually watch comedy movies. This one really is a comedy movie, but not just any comedy; it is something that really works upon any level. Every scene of storytelling in the film is simple but fitted with words in Italian that will impress even the English speaking audience who is reading the subtitles. I was among that audience who has seen this movie, obviously. However, hardly have I seen such a film that utilizes comedy to express its themes and simultaneously entertain and impress the audiences at the same time. With a funny, brilliant, and humorous script and a one of a kind performance from Roberto Benigni, a chemistry results in a solution that is truly one of a kind that only appears in this one movie itself.Beginning with Benigni's performance, I shall express my opinions about the film. Well, what about it? Benigni acts with such grace and humor that I shall say that he brought both character and feelings to his on screen character. Who uses humor and wit to guide him through his life. When Guido (Benigni's on screen Character) moves to Italy, he works there as a waiter. Then he meets "The Princess", who is not really a princess but the first time that Guido meets Dora(Played by Benigni's real life wife), the woman that he immediately falls in love with and every time they meet (often in "coincidences" set up by Guido) he addresses her as "Princess". However, she is engaged to another man, but during their wedding day, she chose to leave that man and live with Guido. And they are married and soon have a son named Joshua.World War II came and the family is then sent to a Nazi concentration camp. There, we see Guido setting out, with his humor and words at his side, to shield his son from the horrors of the holocaust. The words spoken by Guido's now grown up son will have you thinking about the harsh reality of war, and how much a father has given for his family.Oh, man. I laughed so much at so many points of the movie, it was literally impossible to resist Guido's sense of humor and wit. Best of all is that most of the humor is not inappropriate or insulting, but in ways that is universally connectible. The themes that are conveyed in the film, presented with humor, are crystal clear and cannot be polished any further.No other verdict upon its quality but a perfect score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recommendations to watch this movie came often during my years in Italy, and when I finally sat down to watch it I was able to enjoy it in its original language. Afterwards I showed parts of this movie to my kids in English and certain scenes, like a wonderful waiter moment, lost some of their charm. I only showed parts because the movie has dark moments as it brushes heavily against the darkness that was world war two. The main character is lovable and charming and the story of his family's survival through world war two is heart warming and heart wrenching. The story itself works very well and the acting works as well, where hamminess is actually a deliberate character trait, made even more evident by some obvious switches to seriousness as needed - this is especially effective in maintaining the audiences understanding of the seriousness of the situation and helps the viewer to appreciate and love the characters involved. This is a movie worth watching and enjoying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judging by Holocaust movies I've seen it's extremely difficult to recreate concentration-camp life. The best I've seen in that respect is PLAYING FOR TIME which showed, inter alia, the effects of malnutrition &amp; brutality. SCHINDLER'S LIST gets "E" for Effort but doesn't come close to verisimilitude. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is pure bullshit! You didn't get to volunteer to go to a concentration camp like the wife did. She would have been arrested and maybe deported later but the Germans were meticulous about record-keeping and had to account for every deportee. The idea that a little kid could be kept secret in a barracks is beyond ludicrous. The guards would launch inspections at all hours, usually the wee hours, and would dump all the bedding in the process. Violations of camp rules were punished with torture and death. This movie is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who knows anything about the camps. It amounts to a feel-good vision of the Holocaust! The only people who love this movie must know less than nothing about life in the camps!</fullReview>

Although in the beginning i was a little lost by the dialogue, its not that hard to pick it up quickly. Its a story that teaches those about the values of patience, love and even humour even during the hardest of times. Its basically life lessons with extreme circumstances, like when Dora still got on the train to join her family where most people would have turned their backs on them just to save their own skins. Challenging perceptions of prejudice and calling for tolerance for those who we may not like for we are all human and equal. whether some want to admit it or not.

The best part of the movie is the positivity that it portrays even though the plot is set in such tough times. The story flows smoothly from one part to another, each scene building the context for what is to come. The primary premise of the story is how a street smart young man walks through life's difficulties with his intelligence and wit. And his biggest challenge is a Nazi concentration camp!! The acting by each and every member of the cast is phenomenal. A special mention for the little boy Joshua! He touches a cord in your heart with his pretty eyes and beautiful smile. This movie teaches us a very important lesson too. Life can be tough sometimes but finding the beauty in those tough times is in our hands and indeed that is what makes life truly beautiful. The protagonist is able to help his family immensely because of this positive attitude and never say die spirit. All in all, this movie is a must watch.

		<shortDescription>Missed the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually I'm not sure where the mark was exactly? was this a comedy? A drama? Half and half? I wanted to like it, expected to like it, but really, really didn't.To the folks who have been calling this "Hogan's Heroes"? it really isn't that either. "Hogan's Heroes" knew exactly what it was: a silly, impossible sit-com. It was never presented as or intended to be taken as something theoretically possible, while "Life is Beautiful" seems to be doing just that. But the reason I didn't like this movie isn't because I found the subject matter offensive. It simply wasn't very good. (Just for the record, I like "Hogan's Heroes".) For starters, I caught myself saying out loud (fortunately I was in my own living room), on several occasions, "Boy, are you annoying" directed at the star, Roberto Begnini. I'm a Rowan Atkinson fan, and I've read some pretty scathing reviews on his performances written by people he doesn't appeal to? I think that's exactly how I feel about Begnini. I find him profoundly annoying and not in the least bit funny. The first half of the film was a real chore to sit through. But I can be pretty sure I'll never forget the Italian word for "princess", since he hollers it every two and a half minutes, so I guess I learned something.As for the second half: completely and utterly unbelievable. No way. The concept was an interesting one, but it would never work: the child would need an IQ in the single digits to believe the "contest" story spouted by Begnini's character. Are we viewers to believe that all those men in the barracks with them are not too overworked, starved, and terrified to be perfectly happy to play this "game" along with Guido and his son? And at the end when the sentry takes Guido off to be shot, giving him the opportunity to do his Italian Mr. Bean impression one more time in front of his son? why take him anywhere? Why not just shoot him on the spot? Neatness didn't count at that point; the Allies were at the gates, the Germans were fleeing, and there would have been no point in taking Guido to an out-of-the-way alcove to shoot him. In fact, it's likely he would have been ignored as the soldier ran for his own life. But that would have made for a non-Oscar ending, I suppose.Seriously overrated film with a seriously overrated star. Thankfully it was free on streaming.</fullReview>

Absolutely brilliant. Benigni is great - constantly loud, but that's with the character. Very absorbing performance. Giorgio Cantarini's talent progressed along with the film, but his face was very captivating. Braschi didn't have a lot of emotion to give, but that may have been the character. But very good anyway. The best thing about this was the writing - genuinely fantastic. The progression was great, the speeches brilliant, the comedy acute and well timed in the narrative.GREAT film.

		<fullReview>I read a lot of negative reviews about this movie before I actually watched it, and thus when I finally got a chance to watch it, my expectations were not very high. And perhaps that worked in my favor. "Life is Beautiful" surely is not a "must see" movie; but at the same time, it's an enjoyable one. As far as my subjective opinions are concerned, I found the first half of the movie unnecessarily long. However, the major drawback of the overall movie (in my opinion) is that it's sort of Unicorn: neither purely a comedy nor any kind of a serious movie. Many of the situations depicted in this movie are not even within shooting distance of reality. Now, I'm willing to enjoy a comedy movie as one; but when one watches a movie that deals with a serious issue and historical facts, one expects the bare minimum reality in it. A couple of German speaking guys, a heap of bones, and couple of Magen David symbols cannot add authenticity to a movie that deals with the Holocaust. But that does not mean all is wrong with the movie. In my opinion, the depiction of the father-son relationship is one of the major plus points of this movie, and so is the portrayal of human spirit that cannot be crushed under any situation. Another plus point is that it's devoid of all those scenes in such a movie that leaves one depressed for the rest of the week (Schindler's List is a case in point).Finally, I won't recommend it to someone who really wants to see a movie that seriously deals with the history and reality of holocaust; but, at the same time, it's a good, clean and enjoyable movie. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be a small understatement to say that Life is Beautiful has been misunderstood. I've read an abysmal amount of imdb user comments that make me squint my eyes and shake my head from side to side. Roberto Benigni didn't strive to be truthful. Mussolini allowed no French opera under his reign, yet Life is Beautiful has French opera. There were no labour camps in the mountains, yet Benigni set his in a remote valley, surrounded by mountains. Benigni didn't show us horror, because that wasn't his purpose. The name of the film is Life is Beautiful. If he made it hyper-realistic and relentlessly depressing, as some people seem to think he should of, then he wouldn't have named it Life is Beautiful. Benigni received the blessing of many prominent Jewish groups. He had no intention of making light of the Holocaust. He just wanted to tell a story about love, parenthood, and beauty. Which is the most you can ask for. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a "good" holocaust film, it doesn't show the true horror of it, and I'm not talking specifically about the Jewish holocaust, but any one of the many that stroke humanity. It doesn't show the animosity, cruelty, cold blooded design of a mass murder and so far. Can you really grasp the idea of treating humans as waste? As items you dispose and recycle to soap and buttons? Can you imagine such a hunger that makes you dumb and ferocious as a hungry rat?This movie introduces holocaust as a bad time you just need to duck through and survive with a little humor and imagination. So this point was lost, and better presented in a movie such as Schindler's List.The one gained point is about the fragility of our freedom and control over our lives. It's impossible to imagine a situation where I would no longer be in charge of my everyday life and free to move and do whatever I wish to. Remember this on occasions, when you gaily stride down the sidewalk in nice summer days. Appreciate your freedom and your well being, it's not obvious for many people in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the touching story of an Italian Jew who falls in love with a beautiful woman. They had a son and lived happily, until Nazis invaded Italy. The Italian Jew, Guido, and his son were taken away. Guido's wife, Dora, couldn't stay behind, so she hopped on the train even though she wasn't Jewish. Benigni did a magnificent job in this movie and was a good combination of comedy and drama. It's also the story of how Guido's love saved his son and his wife. This movie is magnificent even without English. If you have any comments for me, please e-mail me at tylerripen@yahoo.com.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heh, I realize this movie is years old, but I just got a chance to see it for the first time and it's so cool! I saw the non-dubbed version--in other words, they spoke Italian with the subtitles. I've heard there's a version dubbed in English but I think that would take away a lot of the story.This story seems to be in two parts. The first is the story of a man, Guido, a Jewish-Italian bookkeeper in the 1930's, and his efforts to get his "Princess", Dora, to love him. He's wild, wacky, and will do anything to get her to go on a date with him. This truly shows Guido's love for life and his natural exuberance. You can't help but like him!After he marries his Princess, they have a son, Joshua, and Italy becomes occupied by the Germans. Guido and Joshua are taken to a concentration camp and Dora follows voluntarily. The children will be killed, so Guido has to convince his young son that it's all a game and keep him hidden.I won't give away the ending of the film, but it's happy and sad at the same time. This film really touched me. It was amazingly exuberant in some places and tragic in others, and the character of Guido always brought humor to the most bleak of scenes. I can see why it won an Academy Award. Watching it in Italian with English subtitles didn't take away from it at all; in fact, it added to the dimension of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard a lot about this film and I must confess that when I arrived at the cinema I was uncertain of what I would think of it. At the end I was marvelled. It had been a very pleasant evening! I think all the people that were there came out smiling! This film really makes us feel happy and with very positive attitude towards life. Roberto Benigni has showed us, in the most original way there is, that even the worst part of life always have a happy side, and that with should in every moment there is try to find to happy side and seize it! It is a key for happiness. The sacrifice a father made for is son, made the son live the best way he could in a Nazi concentration camp, and gave the father an undeniable sense of accomplishment in the way to he never stopped making all the efforts to make is son happier. He found a sense to life that he persuade and that made him live. This film is a real lesson. Even if it is a utopian view of life, I think it is far better than a tragic view of life. A Tragic view of life may be realist but that doesn't give us any advantage and the power of imagination can make us travel to much interesting places. I recommend this film to anybody who wants to appreciate all the parts of life and, like the roman poet Horace wrote, "seize the day" (Carpe diem)!</fullReview>

There have been many great movies over the years but this is indeed special,very special.Such a strong message is expressed in such a beautiful way, this is the speciality of this movie . Even the title of this movie is so appropriate, not only for this movie but for life in general.Life is filled with so many uncertainties, one moment there is happiness, and immediately after that one is overpowered with grief, sorrow and troubles.But inspite of all this vagaries LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL. This is the central idea of this film and there is no better way to portray this than that shown by Roberto Benigni. This is arguably one of the greatest movies of all times. A Great period story coupled with mind boggling performances, excellent direction editing etc make it a movie that leaves an indellible impression on the viewer's mind. Roberto Benigni and others involved in this film should be very proud of it.It would indeed be very difficult to make a movie better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The triumph of the human spirit!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that some people are calling this movie tasteless and disrespectful towards the unimaginably terrible events that happened during the Holocaust. People think that events such as these shouldn't be "made fun of" by making a comedy out of it.But to all those that see this movie that way, I think that you should understand the underlying message that this movie gives. It shows us that in the face of certain danger and despair, the human spirit can be stronger. It is humanity vs. inhumanity and many people simply don't believe that it is possible for a man to remain strong and unbroken whenever he faces certain peril such as Begnini's character managed to do. The love for his son will always be stronger than the Nazi's rifles and he managed to tastefully remain light-hearted even though it was obvious that deep down, he was very very fearful about the uncertainty of the fate of his family.The reason that I say that it is tasteful is because of the excellent character development that went into the first half of the movie where you see Begnini's character try to court Dora. Without this first half, then I would have to agree that it would be missing a very important element. However, we can see that Guido Orifice was a man who always believed for the remainder of his life, that no matter what evil may happen to befall on him, life IS beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Until this movie, it was virtually impossible to imagine a comedy about the concentration camps, or the Jewish experience under Nazism. A group of major comedians has tried(Jerry Lewis, and more recently, Robin Williams), but all come a cropper. Benigni succeeds, in part by focussing the comedy on the heartbreaking task of a father trying to save his son by dissembling about the whole experience. What makes the comedy work is the constantly haunting pain, and what makes the pain more severe is the effort, and success, of the comedy.</fullReview>

We may think we've seen all the holocaust films we need to see, but this one is oh, so different. As a parent, this film has become an inspiration for me.

		<shortDescription>Humor, deception and pathos in one neat package.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Add Roberto Benigni's name to the list of cinema triple threats: those who can write, direct and act -- all in one movie! And do it well, too!In "La Vita ? bella" (USA: "Life Is Beautiful"), he has made a classic. Initially, Guido (Benigni), an Italian Jew, is a happy-go-lucky fellow whose silly antics are constantly rubbing those who know him the wrong way. Then he meets Dora (Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife) and while Guido's happy demeanor never lets down, he's now becoming more of a man of responsibility. Eventually, Guido and Dora have a son, Giosué (Giorgio Cantarini), and it is now that Guido's blue-sky philosophy of life is severely tested by the World War II clouds that have enveloped all of Europe.The crux of this movie is how possibly can Guido, the happiest Italian Jew, help his family survive the Nazis and The Holocaust? It's a daunting proposition, at best, and we don't know 'til the end of the movie how -- or even if -- he's going to manage to pull it off.Benigni, here, has taken a most original story idea, mixed in equal parts of humor and tragedy, added a strong dose of deception (perhaps the movie's most important plot element), thus producing a work of art that is seldom equalled on the screen. And in this case, when we talk of humor and the Nazis in the same context, we're not talking "Hogan's Heroes," folks!Without telling you how Benigni did it, there is one scene in this movie when Giosué, the son, puts in his first appearance as a five-year-old. The scene is done in a matter of seconds and it is done flawlessly, seamlessly and with a type of artistry that is rarely seen in motion pictures.And that's what "La Vita ? bella" is, too: the artistry of motion picture-making at its very best. A heart-wrencher and a cheerer-upper, all rolled into one.</fullReview>

This is not to underplay the importanceof his more dramatic work in the film, as both are stunning. It israther that I wish to say that this is true comedy, blending bothgenres into an incredibly complex achievement. In this astonishingly emotional tale, we the audience are introducedto Guido, a character that at once seems fresh and close to home. Freshbecause we have rarely seen such energy before, because we have neverseen acting quite like this before. Close to home, because we can allidentify with him to some degree, because He is 100% human. Theinflections in Benigni's voice, the look in his eyes, the lines on hisface, the way he moves-I hate to make comparisons, but, if BusterKeaton and Charlie Chaplin were combined, you would probably end upwith something like this-it all adds up to one of the most finelywrought performances you are ever likely to encounter. This engaging tale is full of such passion that at time it isoverwhelming. If you have ever doubted that a story can transcendlanguage barriers, than this film should be priority viewing. Thecharacters and their performers come alive with such vision that attimes you may feel yourself drawn into the film to such a degree thatyou cannot help but to cry. Many people complained that the film made fun of a tragic event. Isay that it hardly did that. Rather, it is a monument which attests tomans ability to face any obstacle, and overcome it, even if bad thingshappen have happened to good people. That in the end, we should allremember how precious our lives really are, and that life is indeedbeautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are movies that entertain you and there are movies that touch you. This one, Life is Beautiful, does both. Roberto Benigni's character is charming from the start, but over the course of the movie - especially once he and his family are imprisoned - you learn that he's more than just a goofy romantic. His humor is his defense mechanism, shielding not only himself from the horrors around him, but his child as well. This movie will strike a chord in people who don't even normally appreciate foreign films or romances, and for those who do - it's a fantastic ride with a devastating conclusion.

		<fullReview>After watching this movie I cannot think other of Roberto Benigni than genius. He took a different approach to Holocaust and say through his movie that we shouldn't hate the Nazis. Indeed if we are to do anything with them, we should pity them. They were born and raised without love, and they lost a great many opportunity to learn from other races of this world. Guido doesn't want his boy to grow up like them. He wants him to be a loving human being.Another thing that struck me when I'm watching this movie is that Benigni loves his wife very much, he wouldn't cast any other actress as the female lead. He always does that in every movie he directed. I think it just shows that he can't fall in love with another woman than Nicoletta Braschi, even though he lives in Italy where the women are, in my opinion, exceptionally beautiful.

Guido (Roberto Benigni) is a guy who came to a big town to open a bookstore. There he met a beautiful teacher named Dora (played by Benigni's real wife, Nicoletta Braschi), and, after "stealing" her heart from her fiance and a funny romance, married her. On their son's fifth birthday, they had to go to a concentration camp. But Guido didn't want his son to be sad, so he kept the kid's spirit high and made him believe that life is really beautiful.

The direction is quite ordinary , the actors including the performance of Benigni (who also directs) is sometimes almost absurd . Frankly the direction and performances fall often into clichés . But there are many good ideas , some funny and original gags , the whole idea of a man who lies to his son that the concentration camp is just a game and that if they make enough points they will win a prize is worth to see.But this film a masterpiece ? Americans , you make me laugh out loud : you ignore all the year long everything that's not coming from the U.S. , and sometimes , maybe just for a little change once in a while, you idolize something from another country which, in this case , don't have nothing very special . Despite all I said , its still be a pretty good movie , even if many times we ask ourself : is he trying to make us laugh ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is really one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It just changed my entire perspective on the second world war. Its so personal that you can't deny it is real. The acting is hardly acting you feel like you are back in 1940. It is so worth watching and is honestly the movie that I have seen that has the least flaws and plot flaws. Really this Puts Hollywood so far behind its not funny. I now love Italian film even more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are plenty of films that show the true graphic horrors of the holocaust - this is not one of those and, in my opinion, there is a place for a production that comes at the issue from a different angle. Anything that promotes knowledge and prompts questions about the holocaust, and through a lack of violent scenes can be shown to young children must be a good thing. Don't watch this film for historical accuracy, nor is it light entertainment, but it is compelling and the humour makes it all the more human.</fullReview>

Anyway La Vita e bella is a masterpeice that thoroughly deserved it's Oscar.

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful is based on an intriguing idea. The problem is that somewhere in the transition from brainstorm to actual movie the whole thing seems to have lost all sense of direction. Is Roberto Benigni trying to make a statement? Raise some questions? Or is it all an excuse for another overdone "oh I'm so cute and funny" performance? Sadly, I suspect it's mostly the latter. Has anyone noticed he won't deal with this movie seriously but rather resort to chair hopping, "I love you"s and other spectacles? Benigni's refusal to really discuss this movie and some of its more disturbing aspects bothers me. In fact, the whole movie bothers me. It could - and should - have been SO much better. Saved (barely) by its clever idea, the sweet kid, and the scene with the tank at the end, this is really not great cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a very difficult time motivating myself to watch Life is Beautiful. After making myself see the foreign films "Insomnia" and "Run Lola Run," I was less than enthused to watch another subtitled movie. Well, "Life" is 100-times the movie "Run Lola Run" is, and it is infinitely better than "Insomnia." After twenty minutes, Benigni had me sucked in. If for nothing else, you MUST see this movie for the most hilarious scene I have seen in a movie in quite some time. When Benigni translates the German officers commands into the rules for the "game" he creates for his young son, Benigni vaults from Best Actor to Legendary Actor, and the film itself attains the worthy classification as "Classic." DON'T BE SCARED BY THE SUBTITLES! Trust me, Life is Beautiful is the perfect blend of humor, romance, and drama. Truly a film that will be viewed for decades by film students.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Minor spoilers ahead)Well, obviously if it weren't for the fuss I wouldn't go see this movie, heck if it weren't for the fuss it would probably never have been released out of Italy. But, I can understand what the fuss was about. I have not yet seen a comedy about such a serious subject, most directors would never dare make a comedy about the Holocaust. But Roberto Benigni did, and it was... beautiful. It was beautiful because while it does take place in the Holocaust, that is not the focus of the film. I wouldn't categorize it as a War movie, because it simply isn't. It is a unique story about a father who tells his son that the Holocaust is simply one big game, that it is supposed to be fun, and he succeeds in doing so. The first half is funny, it is about a Jewish man trying to conquer the heart of a Non-Jewish woman. The second half is the drama part, which has comedic bits as well, such as one of my favorite scenes, when Guido (Benigni) is translating the German officer's commands to his son, making them sound like rules for a game.Roberto Benigni gives a wonderful and unforgettable performance. The actors playing his son and wife (who is his wife in reality) do great jobs as well. I can definitely understand why it won the Oscar for best foreign film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't too sure about renting this movie. I delayed picking it up primarily because it is a foreign film. I've always felt that the critics were kinder to foreign movies for whatever reason. This is one instance where the critics gave worthy praise.The spirit of the movie is alive with Chaplin-eque magic. Almost a combination of "The Great Dictator" and "The Kid" (Charlie Chaplin's NOT the Bruce Willis movie). The lighthearted set up during the first half of the movie is needed to further the plot in the second half of the movie. The humor is over-the-top, but thankfully, the drama isn't. The film maker could have decided to be very heavy handed and force the audience to cry. He did not. I commend him for completely braking away from traditional movie formulas.It wasn't necessary to shove the pain and suffering of the holocaust down our throats. Many other film makers have already done that. We know it was horrible. The entire point of the movie was to show courage in an unusual way not to showcase barbarism. This whole film had a freshness about it and yet it seemed a throwback to the golden age of movies.Probably one of the best movies in the 1990s due largely to its unique approach of frightening times.</fullReview>

The looks and gestures of the nazis will hit us all hard as we cringe even in this comedy film. We all know the ins and outs of those monsters. But do we realize that even in the concentration camps, people who valued charity more than anything, died living their last days exemplifying such a virtue? Is our society so beyond this realization? Would you be able to do the same for your child? Or are we so enveloped in self-satisfaction, that we miss the very premise of this film?

		<fullReview>Before I saw "Life is Beautiful", I had never before cried over a movie. That changed as soon as the credits began to roll. My friend and I looked at each other slack-jawed, and tears welled up in both of our eyes. Roberto Begnini was perfect and definitely deserved his Best Actor Oscar. All I can say is that "Shakespeare in Love" must have been pretty darn good if it beat this film in Best Picture.**Spoilers ahead! Read only if you want to know more about the movie's plot.This movie took me by surprise, as the first half of it was nothing like the second. It began as an immensely clever comedy about an Jewish waiter's everyday life in the 1930's . This went on for about twenty minutes. Then, it turned into a romance in which just about every word from those first twenty minutes came back to the viewer for a great joke. This went on for about thirty minutes. Time passes, and the waiter is married to his sweetheart and has a young son. It isn't long, however, before the Third Reich comes for him and his family and puts them in a concentration camp. The rest of the movie is wonderful, but in a different way. It is about Begnini protecting his son's innocence from the horrors of the concentration camp. It still has some funny parts - Begnini's translation of the rules of the camp when they first arrive was fantastic - but is mostly very serious, as you would expect a Nazi movie to be. The last shot of Begnini was beautiful, perhaps the most beautiful of the movie. I know you'll agree when you see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful is the greatest foreign film of all time. With a comical and very dramatic story line, Roberto Benigni creates a masterpiece that words cannot describe. Fuffilling and magical, Life is Beautiful takes on a story about a family who's lives are going to change because of the Holocaust.Instead of describing the story, I'll talk about the highlights of the film. Roberto Benigni's performance made me cry. He is such a fine actor, even though I could only understand very little of what he was saying (IT IS IN SUBTITLES, BUT THE ITALIAN VERSION IS BETTER.) I'm glad he won the Academy Award. The score by Nicola Piovanni is beautiful, easy to listen to, not overpowering - subtle. The script, in the beginning is hilarious with Guido's comic ways and the things he does. As the story progresses, it becomes a great drama, with so many emotions flowing through the story, that you can't hold back any tears.Life is Beautiful is magnificent. 10/10 A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mother watched 20 minutes of this movie, decided that Roberto Benigni's character was "too stupid for life", and then turned it off. I have come to the conclusion that my mother is insane. "Life is Beautiful" has become my second favorite movie of all time. I don't quite understand how one could not love it. The movie does focus more on its message than being 100% historically accurate. But you have to remember that "Life is Beautiful" is only a MOVIE. It does recognize that concentration camps were truly horrifying places, but the movie is more about one man's ability to overcome for the sake of his little boy. I don't cry easily, but the end of this movie had me sobbing. On the one hand the most adorable little boy on the planet had been reunited with his mother, but on the other hand Guido (a man who just really appreciated life to its fullest extent) had been killed. What really got me was the line that started something like, "this was the sacrifice that my father made for me." Never has a movie flooded me with such intense yet conflicting emotions. "Life is Beautiful" is wonderful and I recommend that everybody see it!!!</fullReview>

Though, as some may point out, there may have been some factual errors in the film, the message of it was clearly, and beautifully conveyed. If one wanted to see facts, a documentary would have been more suitable. However, *Life is Beautiful* is simply one's story. One should appreciate this film for (and judge other films based on) the story or message being conveyed, and how well it was done so. I appreciate this film for its positive message, and optimistic outlook on life... It is often difficult to see the beauty of life when such terrible things exist around it, but Roberto Benigni made the beauty shine through in this film, reminding us of what we already know, but often forget, ?ife i§ ßeautifu?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, too many people seem to think that the only way to portray the Holocaust is with a somber and depressing depiction. While there's nothing wrong with that approach, Benigni's story is a far more compelling one.Everyone knows about the Holocaust and its horrors. Another extremely graphic movie showing that isn't going to strike people's hearts. All such a movie would have gotten would be comparisons to Schindler's List. Instead, this film gets around that by doing something far more amazing than Schindler's List. It convincingly shows one of the most impossible things I've heard of - it puts humor into the Holocaust. You'd think such a connection would be ludicrous. Without seeing the movie, I would probably think so too.Forget that, see the movie. This movie is perfect. Benigni plays a father who is able to turn the holocaust for his young son into a "game." Beningi, through a host of wonderfully funny events is able to hide his son from the horrors from the holocaust. Impossible some people say? Yes, I'm sure it would not have happened in the real holocaust, but that shouldn't become an issue once you've seen the movie, because that's not the point. The point is to appreciate the strength of love that a father can have for his child and the extraordinary lengths he would go to in even the darkest moments in order for his child to have a better life. See this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Roberto Benigni at the Oscars before viewing the film, I expected it to be simply a hilarious comedy with lovable characters. As it turns out, it is that, but it is also so much more. The story is told through the perspective of someone who has so much zest of life and love for life. And through his perspective, the audience is given a glimpse that we too, may live our lives through our own filtered lenses and only pick out those things that would make life worthwhile.As some wise person said (I forget which) "you can either live your life as if nothing is special, or you can live your life as if everything is a miracle. Roberto's character is the best testament of that. He makes his own reality. The holocaust background serves to emphasis the strength of optimism and love and hope, that they can conquer even horrors of humanity. I personally think that the "unrealistic" depiction of the Holocaust is an asset to the film, since the holocaust is seeing through Roberto's eyes, his romantic view of the world is what the audience experiences. And through that, we understand how high the human spirit can soar above all things, how hope and laughter survives against even death, and how beautiful life truly is. I will never forget the way Roberto calls Dora "Principesa" (sp?), that one little word contains soooo much of what is good in life - compassion, optimism, hope, humor, and of course, love. If you need a movie that can uplift you or even help you see through the craziness of the world around, see this one. It's a beauty!!!</fullReview>

I bought this video and before she took my money, the store keeper said "you know this is subtitled don't you?" as if subtitles somehow make the film less enjoyable. It is a shame that the average American/British filmgoer is not interested in watching foreign films, because they miss out on some real gems, and the films in turn do not get the money or the success they deserve.This film was inspiring, yet also realistic.

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful is really two movies in one. The first half, which takes place in pre-WWII Italy, involves the comical wooing and winning by Guido (Roberto Benigni) of his wife Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). The second half takes place during WWII (about 5 years later) during the persecution of the Jews by the Germans.In pre-war Italy life is beautiful as Guido becomes a waiter in his uncle's hotel and keeps running into (literally) a charming school teacher named Dora. He finally wins their heart and they marry. Benigni could have made a charming movie ending it here. But cut to a few years later, it is now WWII and they have a 5 year old son. Guido and his family, being Jewish, are soon rounded up by the Germans and sent to a concentration camp. There, the picture takes on a more serious tone as Guido tries to protect his son, with humour and imagination, from the horrors of the camp.Writer, director, actor Benigni has created a cinematic masterpiece - in any language. He is able to perfectly blend humour, pathos and tragedy in telling his story. His characters are believable and synpathetic. It was also nice to see Horst Buchholtz (as a German doctor) again after so many years.This movie, in my humble opinion, should have been given the Best Picture Oscar over the inferior Shakespeare in Love. It's so good that if you watch it in Italian with sub-titles, you won't even notice the sub-titles, you'll become so engrossed with the story. A bona fide tear jerker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it isn't the most realistic look at the holocaust, "Life is Beautiful" excellently shows us that the victims of Nazi genocide weren't just that: they were more than victims. Other films that deal with the subject usually just depict people after the horrible events of Nazism are taking effect. And when we read about the death camps in history books, all we see are numbers of the dead. This film concentrates on the personalities and lives of a family who would eventually fall victim to Nazi persecution.The first half of the film is a charming love story. It is partially a clever satire on fascism, but doesn't wallow in terror, fear, and thuggery. Instead it concentrates on Guido's (Roberto Benigni) romantic pursuit of Dora. We wish the best for them, but learn that this is not possible with the start of the second half.What we see of the holocaust from that point on isn't the most graphic or brutal depiction of what happened, and that is why this movie has been criticized. It does however, make you fear for Guido and his family, and we empathize with him throughout his ordeal. A scene where he thanks the SS man who shoves him onto a train in front of his son disturbingly captures the humiliation that a situation like this would result in.That Guido is making it seem like it is all a game to his son makes a great, haunting story, one that his son will think of forever. LIB is a very engrossing movie with a lot of heart. A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really fine film. As the father of an 8 month old baby I identified clearly with the desire to protect a child from all that is harmful and unpleasant. This film is no tear-jerker but it can touch emotions on a number of different levels; parents see a father struggling to keep sane for the sake of his son, some non-parents see a clown and struggle to comprehend the lengths parents might go to to make a child laugh.The first half is comic genius ( even if it isn't wholly original ) in the second half the comedy turns to black humour, expect to be a little shocked even though nothing distasteful is graphically presented. If this film doesn't touch you then perhaps you've lost something from your life, those of us who enjoy the littlest things in life may make better viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The humor of this movie is not making fun of the horror of the war. I would say that is completely on the other side. This movie made for me this horror even worse were the love of a father is stronger than soldiers, than war, than anything else. This movie is just sooo wonderful the way it mixes sadness and humor. The way it makes you laugh and the way it made me cry like a little kid at the end like I never did in a holocaust movie (Schindler list of Saving private Ryan, were Spielberg made a good representation of the war).The only thing I didn't like about this movie is when at the end Roberto plays about the sadness that people feels to put in the movie an American guy. It looked just like he was looking for the Oscars or something. When all the people is crying they put an American over there and Sofia Loren screamed Roberto!!! and Life is beautiful sounded a couple times more, once by Helen Hunt giving it to BEST ACTOR. At least I have to recognized I liked better than Shakespeare in love! Is much better than that one!Well at least he was funnier than Almodobar this year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film made with love and understanding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts with a very funny and touching love story between Nicoletta Braschi and Roberto Benigni, who plays his role with a passion that humour that Chaplin would have been proud of, and a heart that Chaplin only approached in The Kid (1921).From here the film moves on to Benigni and his son being put into a concentration camp, and his attempts to hide the truth from his son.The film deals honestly with the Holocaust, without any graphic detail, an example that many Hollywood movies would do well to follow. However, this is not a film about the Holocaust, it is a film about the human spirit, what it can perpetrate, and the horrors it can endure.But this film has one quality that lifts it above most Hollywood movies; it is made with one thing that Hollywood rarely uses. It is made with love.</fullReview>

I could say that about so many films. Life is Beautiful is different because it's theme is so moving. Self-sacrifice is something our culture seems to have forgotten. Roberto Benigni is able to portray Guido as a figure we don't just enjoy we want to become like Guido. He represents all that is right with the world. The ability to put others first. That is the theme that makes Life is Beautiful not only a masterpiece, but a moving one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many opinions have been written concerning this film. This is but one. It's hard to imagine that so many aspects of life could be put into a single film. I guess it's just the way we've by and large become used to single-thread storytelling in American cinema, that a film of layers is seen to hold so much more. This is one of those films. Truly a masterwork, by any standard. By the way, if you've decided for your own sake to get the dubbed-English version ("so's yuh don't haff to do all dat reeding") - you're only robbing yourself - the distributors are going to make their money off it either way, and one aspect of the film's true beauty is the melodic language that runs through the whole film (I myself don't understand any Italian, but it's like a song to hear the actors roll off their vibrant dialogue). See this film. See it repeatedly. Let its wonders sink into your soul. Discover how beautifully bittersweet storytelling can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was truly excellent. I've heard some say that it didn't depict reality like that is something negative. Yes, I've seen "Schindler's List" and although it was a good movie, I didn't like it because I hate to watch people get tortured and killed. I can't take it. Watching life is beautiful wasn't easy to watch either. There is only so much reality I want to see. I don't think that the characters in the movie made concentration camps look "easy" either. Children and elderly people getting gassed in a big room doesn't look "easy" and neither does being separated from your family and being forced to work all day long fearing for you life. None of that looks "easy." I think that "Tea With Mussolini" and "Life Is Beautiful" are very similar. The thing that I liked about "Tea With Mussolini" is that there was no concentration camps and the main Jewish character Elsa (Cher) escaped back to America. That was what I found to be beautiful. I know that wasn't reality and very few Jews escaped, but you want to see movies about the Elsa's of the world who did get away. : )</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now, you have to mention "Benigni" in a row with Chaplin and the Marx Brothers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once, I thought about Roberto Benigni to be a clown, now I know him as a comedian. Comedian, that doesn't mean, an actor, who plays funny roles, but a film-maker, who developed his own style of comic - like in the old days: In importance for movie history to compare with Charles Chaplin (and with the "Great Dictator" ), with the Marx Brothers in his sense of humour. Remember the absurdity of the hat exchange! It's the variousity of ideas and running gags, that makes it to one of the best comedies ever. The box, in which Josue is hiding to take refuge from the bath, reappears at the end when it saves from the Nazi troops, Maria's key becomes the key to a woman's heart, the tank is the ambiguous symbol for childhood dreams and warfare fright. The naivity and purity of the message is heart-healing, not ony concerning the horrors of war and concentration camps, but also concerning social and emotional boundaries that love-foolish attitudes commonly may have. It's one of the most beautiful romantic movies ever, too... As to the discussion about jewish fate vs. comedy: The first half of the film is refreshing and a flower of comedy. It seems as if Benigni said at this point, laughing at the audience: Now I show you, of what I'm really able, my comedy can't stop at nothing, because it's not only a nice film, but a mode of living. And he succeeds in a triumphal way: Not a single scene that touches uncomfortable, despite of the severe affairs... I have a new cinema hero.</fullReview>

To those who seemingly missed the violence: I think as adults we all well know what happened to the people in the showers, the elderly, the very young and those who had "doctors appointments" during the holocaust , it was not necessary to see it , it was felt. By leaving those scenes out my 11 year old son was able to watch this movie and love it too. He asked a lot of questions and actually desired the knowledge of the events that took place. I sincerely believe that it was made perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life Is Beautiful is the rarest of films, literally making you laugh one minute and cry the next. Having said that, this is not a "downer" of a movie, but inspiring like no movie ever made. Don't be afraid to see it because it is a foreign film and involves the Holocaust; you'll be missing an experience that will stay with you forever.I have the DVD version and watched it three times in 24 hours. I am NOT particularly sentimental I don't get choked up easily but this film drew me in and still hasn't let go.The folks who trash this movie because it dares to place humor and the Holocaust in the same picture have allowed their bitterness and grief to block their understanding of the message of Life Is Beautiful, and I pity them for what they have lost and have missed.The movie is not perfect. The first half involves the courtship of the main characters and drags a bit at times. Sometimes the humor is a little too broad for American tastes. It does set up the second half very well though, and the second half is as good as film-making gets. I would agree with other posters that while the two halves are extremely different, the constant is the attitude and love for his family of Roberto Benigni's character.You will find yourself replaying every scene in your mind for a long time. Go rent it, buy it, whatever - just see it.</fullReview>

The second half is when they get to the concentration camp and the father tries to hide the horrible slaughter to his son by pretending it's just a big game. What some people don't understand is that the movie is not about the hollocaust, the hollocaust is just used as a background. "La vita ? bella" is about overcoming obstacles in life, it's about sacrifice and love... Roberto Benigni may not be the best actor of all, i mean he's just a comic, and he always acts the same, but he was believable in this film. It's funny to see how so many people rated this movie.

		<fullReview>Please, let's clear up a few things. I respect people's opinions - if they don't like a movie, fine. However, the message of this movie is completely twisted by some people, and quite frankly that's unjustifiable. Basically, you can some up the theme of the movie in one word: Hope.Nobody involved with this movie is trying to "desecrate" the memory of the Holocaust victims, nor are they saying, "let's all laugh at the Holocaust because it was funny ha ha ha." The Holocaust was one of the worst events in human history, but this movie is not about the Holocaust. The character of Guido (the marvellous Roberto Benigni) has to be strong and survive for his son,; therefore the movie concerns hope and looking ahead to the future. The concentration camps provide a backdrop for this topic and basically state that, even in a place where human atrocities take place, people have not lost all faith or hope. As a result, it lets us think about our own attitude towards life.This movie was a lot of things - a tragedy, comedy, a tale of love and even of friendship. The uplifting characters, as well as the beautiful cinematography and the theme of love for your fellow man show us that life is indeed beautiful</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very few movies capture the spirit of the absurd so natural to the theatre. This one does so, and brilliantly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read many criticisms of the comedic elements of this movie. For anyone who has weathered a production of George Tabori's "Cannibals" where the absurd and the horrific merge into an indelible image, the dissonances of "Life is Beautiful" would be mild indeed. Live theatre is forgiven more of what it attempts than movies usually are.What allows "Life is Beautiful" to succeed is precisely the dissonance of the comedy with what we know to be the horrors of the Holocaust. The premise of this movie would strain credulity beyond breaking if it were meant to be taken as reality.War and genocide constitute an absurd intrusion into the fabric of life . The mind rejects them even as they are happening. (Vicims of lesser violence also know this to be true.) The gentle conceit of "Life is Beautiful" is to translate this horror into what a child's mind can comprehend. Joshua is hearing the truth about what is happening to others in the camp -- clearly these horrors are to absurd to be real, and this is what Guido persuades the little boy to believe.Now let us be adults here: war is horror and death is horrible -- but can we face these things undiluted? By forcing us to accept the absurd version of things, the game Guido convinces Joshua they all are playing, we can glimpse the horror behind the game, and so perhaps comprehend it more fully. Can any real image of genocide be more frightening than the pile of corpses that looms out of the mist as Guido wanders through the camp?This is not cheap. It's not facile. And it's not silly. It is no less serious than that other absurdist treatise on war "Catch 22.""Life is Beautiful" will be remembered for many things over the years. But it may be neglected for one of its most lasting attributes -- it is an absurdist classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful is a beautiful film that transcends the ugly part of our recent history it derives its story from. Funnily enough, it doesn't tell the story of Jews, Nazis, Italians, Germans, or anyone else. It merely, yet overwhelmingly, reaffirms the beauty of parental love and kindness that is inherit in decent people, regardless of race, religion or hate. The Europeans have the knack of eliminating gushing sentimentality from their narratives while at the same time evoking emotional responses from audiences which are genuine and involving. I marvel at the skill of European film-makers and their capacity to operate successfully outside the hype of the 'blockbuster' mentality sweeping the world year-in, year-out. On comparatively low budgets, they produce stories about real people, not shrines to manufactured actors whose personal lives seem to add box office dollars to flimsy scripts based upon contrived plots.Good on you Roberto Benigni, for an absolutely wonderful acting talent which doesn't depend upon a seedy, well-publicised lifestyle to bolster the sheer brilliance of your performances.</fullReview>

It is singularly the most heart-warming movie about an ugly time in International history. It's not a movie for the very young, it's not a movie for those who cannot appreciate the strength that comes with true love, and it's not a movie for those who hails the same philosophy that Hitler spouted. It IS a movie for anyone who wants to see how beautiful life can be, even during the bleakest of times, and it IS a movie for anyone who wants to see a superb film which, in my opinion, should have won the best picture Oscar instead of that other film....what was it called....oh yes, "Shakespeare in Love."

		<shortDescription>Very good movie but no masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie these weekend shown in Italian with English subtitles. I'm still trying to decide whether it was worth the several Oscars it won. The storyline is simple. Guido,Dora and their young son Joshua are sent to a concentration camp because they are jewish. Guido tries to make light of what is a very horrific, nightmarish situation by heavily improvising to his young son by using humor that it is all just a game. The young boy that played the son was brilliant in the role-he is VERY talented. I didn't think the harsh reality of the camp was built up enough in this movie. If they would have put more detail into the horrible reality of the camp it would have made the movie better. Overall it was good and enjoyable. I give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pssst. Guess what? It's not supposed to be realistic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised no one else has pointed out how "Life is Beautiful" compares to "Titanic." (Okay, I haven't read all the reviews, but...) In both cases we have the proper woman who is supposed to marry the very proper man. Instead she falls for a vagabond; someone who is far from "proper" but someone who definitely knows how to enjoy life. And in both cases the story is told against the backdrop of disaster."Life is Beautiful," however, is a fantasy. No, it could never really have happened. Yes, the Holocaust was far more horrible than this movie shows. But guess what? It's not supposed to be realistic! We already know how horrible the Holocaust was. That is not what this movie is about.Instead, this movie is about a father's love for his son, and how that father will do anything under any circumstance to protect that son.So Roberto Benigni, I say "Bravisimo!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers - if you have not seen the movie do not read this comment.I was just going to read the comments here and not add my own but after seeing how many people trashed this movie I have to say a few words. Don't read this if you have not seen it because I must discuss key plot elements (including the ending) to make my point. It seem those who criticize it for too much slapstick, not enough humour, not enough seriousness about the Holocaust, did not allow its simplicity to move them. Have they never known true love, have they never read any other fables where good triumphs over evil? If you are determined to be cynical and if you believe there is no hope then of course you would find this movie irritating.Now my story. I didn't even care to see this because from reviews I read when it came out it seemed like a standard tale with nothing original or worthwhile. I was completely uninterested.I happened to rent it for my daughter and was doing other things so missed the first half hour or so. Then I went to watch it without expecting anything. I sat down as critical and bored as you can be, but within minutes I was drawn into the story - even having missed the whole introduction. It was such a perfectly told story of a man's character that watching it in reverse did not ruin it.I was in tears 4 or 5 times, as well as laughing out loud at least once. This almost never happens in a movie, as I am not easily fooled, always knowing "it's only a movie." What was the difference?Unlike most movies it didn't have miles of boring, useless footage just put in to look pretty or set a mood. Every frame was vital to the story. If you want to quibble and say Schindler's List was superior, here's why it's not: Most of my friends refused to see Schindler's List because they "didn't want to be depressed," not to mention that its length was daunting. So it's the greatest movie that was never watched by those who would have liked it if they didn't have preconceived notions that a story about the holocaust is "unbearable" to watch.Life is Beautiful, in contrast, is a touching love story that only incidentally takes place during the holocaust and can be seen by those who are afraid to see scenes of death. Everyone is quite familiar with available films about its horrors; we have the Diary of Anne Frank, for one. The big difference is that you are left with horrific despair at the end of that. There is no hope, only bleakness. If we want bleakness there are plenty of documentaries and movies to watch already.Here is a film where the protaganist dies, and yet we can say good triumphed at the end. Yes, it is fiction but so is all of Shakespeare and his stories are considered meaningful representations of universal human behaviour. In the case of Life is Beautiful, we are struck by how much we wish more people were like the clown Roberto Benigni, so that life would not be quite so plodding and deadly.The whole family would have died if not for the father's insistence on acting in his normal loving and unpredictable manner during the nightmare situation. He laid down his life for his son, recklessly putting himself in harm's way many times - it was inevitable he would be killed one way or another. Only in this way could the greater good take place - that his wife and son's lives would be spared. He had no guarantee, but all he could do was step out and let his beliefs be manifest. He is the archetypal holy fool, the idiot who shows up evil to be what it is - pompus stuff, but ridiculous and without a chance in a world where there are good people.The incongruity of his clownish mistranslation of the German orders; the child's recalcitrant hatred of showers saving him from death even before his father was aware that a shower meant death; the boldness of using loudspeakers and music to reach his wife's ears in the camp to bring her hope - all these touches made the Nazi's domination what we now know it was - not a real and universal victory, only a temporary bullying that would soon end when the Americans came in their tank, bringing the story full circle in the child's innocent eyes.As for a beautiful, small story perfectly told, what could compare to a game his father created to keep him from knowledge of human evil - where the child wins in the end - even though he later will learn he lost his father. As narrated by the child when he is grown, it is a love story of his father's sacrifice - it is a model of two people who fell in love, who lived purely, and who passed on their purity of spirit to their child.Those who call it a standard screwball comedy in the beginning fail to notice the darkening shadow of anti-semitism and the decision the non-Jewish woman makes when she hears her fiancee spouting evil, in contrast to the Jewish clown who has been pursuing her in his whimsical way. It couldn't be further from the standard Hollywood epic. A heroine played by Paltrow or Diaz would not have got on that train to be with her loved ones. The Italian passion for love and family ties gives us spoiled, jaded westerners (of which I am representative) something deep to ponder. What would we do?Great movies have moral decisions. That is why blockbusters like Austin Powers and Blair Witch Project will never be called great. They are fun for young people to watch, but add nothing to one's intellectual or spiritual growth.A great movie draws you into the story and makes you forget it's only a movie. You don't care if there are errors in continuity, you don't care about the settings. In Hollywood movies that's all you can think of - gosh, look at the setting, must have cost a lot to make. This was a LITTLE movie. Like Cinema Paradiso, which one of the other reviewers here mentioned. But I disagree that it was greater than Life is Beautiful. It did not contain as many perfect elements.A great movie has many perfect elements, and even if the story is an ancient one it never seems trite. Everything fits together. The movie would not have been complete without the doctor who was obsessed with riddles, without the child accidentally saying thank you in Italian, and the way his father solved that crisis instantly, as well as a dozen other surprises which alternately create suspense and relief.There was no need to show the young couple getting married and having a child. The editing was done only to show what was needed to advance the story. The rest is easialy understood. There is no saccharine concentration on sentimentality at the expense of reality. There is no throwing out of happiness to show the desolation of life's hardship.I say this movie is as great as Citizen Kane. It is told sparingly, it is moving, it is gripping, it doesn't try too hard, it isn't phoney, it transcends criticism, it stands alone as a perfect gem - the fimmaker is not going to be dismayed if everyone doesn't love it. He knew what he wanted to do and did it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very moving comi-drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a world where such movies as "There's Something About Mary", "Austin Powers", "South Park" and other ridiculous filth pass as good comedy, Roberto Benigni has brought hope to lovers of great comedy. Benigni resurrects the classical comic styles of Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, and Charlie Chaplin in La Vita e Bella, a very touching drama about a newfound family on the verge of being destroyed by the Holocaust and the good humor of the father which keeps their hope alive.This film is a very refreshing watch for lovers of good cinema. Rare is the film that can give its viewers such a dichotomy of emotions so successfully. La Vita e Bella is truly funny and truly tragic.As many have said, I think the 1st part of the film (the courtship of 'Princepesa') should have been a little shorter to allow more time to be focused on the intriguing relationship between father and son in the prison camp during the second half. However, that takes little, if any, from Benigni's near-perfect masterpiece.A definite ***** (out of 5). Watch this film as soon as you get 105 minutes of free time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Life is Beautiful is the most romantic movie ever made. The love Guido (Benigni) displays for his wife and son is boundless. Even in the Concentration Camp, when we know they are in danger, he only thinks about reassuring them. By the end you really believe that life IS beautiful.There is no need to show any graphic killing as (and this is one of the great things about it) Benigni assumes the audience is intelligent enough to be aware of the horror of the Holocaust. This film just gets better every time I see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first half of the movie, I felt like I was watching a comedy from the 30's or 40's. We get to see a little slapstick, and a lot of warm, lovable characters. Interesting how Benigni can change the tone of the film so quickly, yet with so much subtlety. I've heard this movie criticized for its depiction of concentration camp life, but COME ON! The father's need to protect his child from his surroundings was truly touching. I loved the little boy. It seems that Hollywood is always casting fairly obnoxious child characters. This kid was so sweet, just looking at his face was worth the price of admission. A movie obviously done with respect and affection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpretentious, simple and quite truly beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start this comment, I must admit I was a bit dismayed at the negative feedback this movie has received. Many criticize it's lack of respect of history, others it's inane plot and others, the lack of action (=boring).First off, this movie is all but boring. The first half of this film is a beautiful romantic comedy. I must admit however, not everyone has to like the hectic manners of Roberto Benigni. He is definitely, how can I put this, un-Hollywoodian, simple, unpretentious and captivating. His reaction at the Oscars was not a performance aimed to impress the world on how classy he was. He looked genuinely happy and it looked pure.The romance that develops between Benigni's character and Dora (Braschi) is delightful. Benigni's comic talents are showcased here. People who find his comedy childish are all in their rights. However, I appreciate this humour much more than the crude and crassy jokes coming out of many mainstream Hollywood movies. Some may have forgotten how it was being a child, when some simple things were actually funny.Now, on to the more sensitive half of the movie, the concentration camp. Here, Benigni's character makes his son Giosue, believe that he is playing a game to win a tank. This movie is not a recreation of the Holocaust and does not claim to be. It is not a Schindler's List were, honestly, the goal was to shock the viewers with the simple truth, same goes for Saving Private Ryan. I am not saying that the latter movies are bad, they are excellent movies, I am simply saying that their goals were not the same! They were meant to be methodical recreations of what really happened in those truly sad moments of human history. Life is Beautiful is really about the love of a man for his wife and his son. You must remember that the film is actually the tale of the young boy's (Giosue) memories, so it is very obvious that he may not have seen all the atrocities of the concentration camp. I felt that the movie in no way alleviates the seriousness of those events. Those who saw it as a simple parody of the Nazi occupation seem to have totally missed the point of the movie. Benigni is not laughing at the concentration camps but is trying to show how a loving father struggles to protect the simple mental health of his son by making him believe that he was playing a game. If Benigni didn't think seriously of the Holocaust, why would the whole second part of this movie revolve around how he can protect his son's mental health, what would there be to protect him from?For people who look for cheesy predictable sticky endings to bad romantic love stories and those who think that movies without guns and slick leading gentlemen or sexy ladies are boring, this movie is not for you. However, for the people who are open minded enough to see past the fanatical political correctness of most mainstream films, they will find in "Life is Beautiful" a truly beautiful, simple yet stunning, unpretentious film, where the auteur tries to let the viewer into a world where the events of the Holocaust are given their rightful place, but where the first and foremost subject is love. Bravo.</fullReview>

But after seeing it, in it's original (subtitled) version I must say it was even better than Saving Private Ryan as by far one of the best films of the year, and of past memories. It's often hilarious, often sweet, sometimes tragic, but always beautiful. This is a must see for just about anyone. This is a film that you can call an "instant classic."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>La Vita e Bella is not a movie about the Holocaust. It is about a father and how far he goes to protect his son's innocence from the most horrible evil the world has ever seen. The movie can be split into two halves. The first showcases Benigni's extraordinary comic ability. Here we recognise that this man is a clown; a characteristic that is used to shield his son from the horrors of life in the concentration camp. His love of the human spirit enriches Brachi who falls for him. They have a son.The second half of the movie is what seperates it from a fabulously entertaining film into a moving and life-affirming one. Benigni informs his son that he has brought him to the concentration camp so that he can win a tank; a real life tank. The boy is suitably impressed. The way that Benigni keeps the charade going is both sweet and funny. The child's collapsing innocence is kept alive by his father's ingenious tricks.Roberto Benigni gives the most perfect performance ever in this film. As director he knows when to be funny and when to be serious. Though it is a recent performance I think that his performance will be hard to match. His little son is the most innocent looking child you will ever see and his happy face gives hope among all the tired and hungry in the camp. The music complements each scene perfectly. On listening to the soundtrack again, my mind conjures up images from the film. This shows the power of the score.La Vita e Bella was the first foreign language film I saw. I don't think Hollywood could ever create such a masterpiece. No doubt a Hollywood version would allow sentimentality to creep in but Benigni doesn't. I have seen Il Postino since and Massimo Troisi's performance complemented another impressive film. That film was good but I don't think any film can match La Vita e Bella's majesty.</fullReview>

I am sorry if i offend, but i don't like Star Wars, I don't like Rocky, I don't like unnecessary expensive special effects or bloody car crashes. I love stories about human beings and their emotions and real life. This movie, this piece of art is the epitome of the beauty of humanity. If you love movies, please see this movie. If you doubt the sincerity of the film industry, please see this movie. Don't be turned off by the subtitles or the subject of the Holocaust. Because this movie is not about death or destruction or hate. This movie is about love and about what makes life worth living. As much as you will cry and as sad as you will be, this movie will change your life forever. At a moment when I was doubting my dream of being a film-maker, this film reminded me why i dreamt it in the first place. This film reminded me that for every thousand Stallone movie that is a waste of time and money, there is a diamond in the rough that is priceless and timeless in it's message and effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of Roberto Benigni since the marvelous Rome sequence in Jarmusch's "Night on Earth", I must say that this is the film where he truly graduates to the level of auteur. His simple, understated direction and outrageous comic presence merge perfectly into a film that is never downbeat, despite its grim subject matter.Although I haven't hit on the correct answer as to why three of the five nominees for the Academy's best picture award were stories of World War II, I feel this film easily outdistances the other two. While "Thin Red Line" was a little too cold in its pursuit of technical perfection (but just a little), and Spielberg's "epic" floundered in hideous nationalism and bad writing, this is the only film of the three to really confront a recognizable human cost to the catastrophe. Not a bad moment in the film, not an unmoved eye in the theater.Oh, just one more thing....there is also a marvelous, classic, lilting score by Nicola Piovani - one of the best I've heard in a film in years!

		<shortDescription>Fantastic movie, Guido sees through fascists and defeats them with humour and humanity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this marvellous movie, the main character Guido uses his marvellous humanity, vitality and humour to first of all win his wife from underneath the nose of a fascist roboton in local Government and then to enable his son to survive the Nazi camps. Your first thoughts when you come out of this movie (and you walk down the road from the camp with the survivors and the liberating American soldiers) is that the Nazis were b****rds and thank God the allies won the war. The Nazis were the perpetrators of the greatest crime in the history of humanity. Words like Auschwitz and Dachau will retain a power to haunt and disturb millennia hence. But Guido shows that they will never win because they, like the doctor in the story, lack humanity. In the camp the son only ever half believes Guido about his extravagant game to win a tank but like all kids he loves to play and enjoys the game. The Guido character would have known the facists from of old, growing up with Mussolini in Italy but he also knew from of old how to defeat them - by being everything they were not. This is a great movie and by contrasting humanity with inhumanity puts the crimes of the Nazis and facists in starker relief then ever before but also shows us that a spirit of love and hope will always triumph come what may.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>La Vita E Bella E Bella</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm quite dismayed to see so many negative comments about _La Vita E Bella._ Is it indeed a trivialization of one of mankind's most grievous mistakes? No, no. One thing that typifies most religions, certainly Judaism, is a feeling of hope. I am not a Jew, but you do not have to be in order to see that. Since I am not a Jew, it may be said that I can not feel what Jews do about what happened, and I do not entirely, but I certainly feel pain whenever I think about the things that went on in that era. How painful to be pulled from those you love (or to have them pulled away from you) only to be systematically executed by someone with whom you have no quarrel. That should give us pause indeed. However, _La Vita E Bella_ does not mire itself in the feelings of dread and sorrow that are central in such films, masterpieces though they are, as _Schindler's List_. Instead, the film is about hope. Look up, not down. Do not try to see where you have been, but where you can go. Such are the messages of the film, and they are truly very beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant piece of motion picture art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see a lot of movies and not many can be described as art. Well, this one definately qualifies. The story of a man's love for his wife and son has so many facets that a 1000 words would not be enough to describe it. I thought the acting of Cantarini was excellent. This young man was casted to a very high standard of performance. I could compare it to Anna Paquinn in The Piano, only better. The story could indeed be compared to Schindler's List in that one gets to see the picture from the victims' side, without the war being the centre of the plot. I felt that the lesson to be learned here was that one can rise above one's life situation and problems. You saw how heavy those steel things were that Guido had to carry and how tired he was. But, for the sake of his child, he stayed positive and focussed on calming the child. Guido gave the ultimate sacrifice of love, namely his life to his family. This scene must be one of the most intence I have ever experienced. One wishes he would come out from behind that wall and laugh in your face and tell you like Jim Carrey would that it is only a joke, but he doesn't. He shows us that life is beautiful indeed, if one strives to make it beautiful and be willing to share that beauty with people around us.Some artists left us opera's and concerto's, some great paintings, some telephones and aircrafts, and Roberto Begnini left us Life is beautiful. What a gift.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece. One of the top films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The effectiveness of this tale is how the emotion hits you out of nowhere, instead of having it tug at your pantsleg throughout the entire film as some do. Whereas Schindler's List is a masterpiece and a gorgeous film in its raw power and gritty realism, Life is Beautiful works in how it deals with emotions on a much more personal level. The story of a father trying to shelter his son from all of the misery around him is brilliant and touching, and does NOT give the feeling that Benigni is "making light" of the Holocaust. It is what any parent would want, and at the same time it also works a double function brilliantly: it shelters the audience from the horror that we know is going on outside of what we see. We don't see the effects of that horror until the films sense of building tension climaxes in the final moments, and the protagonist is taken away from his son and shot. The "aftermath" scene is beautifully understated, and truly heart-wrenching, and all I could think was "please let him get his tank." And when the tank rolls around the corner, I began to weep. The final line "This is the story of how my father saved my life," was so simple, understated, and beautiful. Not only is life beautiful, but so is this film. It is irritating how so many these days try and compare films when they happen to share subject matter. When "1941" came out, no one complained and said that it was 'making light' of WWII, and tried to compare it to "The Longest Day." Come on people. (not that I am saying "1941" and "Life is Beautiful" share a similar tone at all!) Anyways...a brilliant brilliant film. The scene where he puts on the record player is just lovely.

		<shortDescription>the greatest adventure in the most important period of the world's history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first of all, we have to applaud to benigni, for bringing the true and painful story of the jewish people, during WW2. in that sense, benigni have missed the real atmosphere in a real concentration camp. well, no movie will ever succeed in bringing us the true feeling in those camps, not even 'schindler's list'. the reason is simple - we just wouldn't believe that occurences like that have realy happend in europe of the 20th century and because we like happy ends in the movies that we go to.in his one man show, 'la vita e bella', benigni succeeds in other things, as he manages to bring us a sad story with great humour. as he manages to explain to a 5 y/o boy about the dreadful events in those days.this is a two part movie. the first one is brighter, as it tells guido's story. his life are happy, colourfull, with a lot of fun, laughs and romance. the second part is darker as it tells guido's adventures in the con. camp. he looks tired, sad and frustrated, with the only hope of seeing his beloved wife again and saving the boy's mentality with a stupid game that he invented.the game is what's keeping guido alive at his period in the camp. he starts making new rules for his son every day and by that he keeps his motivation to survive.the perfect music in each of the two equally timed parts, is changing from happy tunes in the first to sad and slow in the other.dr. lessing symbolizes the irrational change that Hitler opposed on the German people. throughout the film he admires guido's charector and inteligence. he even saves his life in one point of the movie, but it was only to ask guido a riddle that he couldn't manage to resolve. the riddles are also symbols applied on the nazis mechanic charrector, and there are lots of more symbols benigni's giving along the story.the names have been also picked smartly. for example 'guido', who stands for jewish and 'josue', who satnds for the son who replaces his father (like joshua have replaced moses in the bible). it seems like every part in the story and in the making of the film was picked very carefully (even the boy's blonde hair to show us that jewish people are not so different) by benigi, especially in the perfect end, when it all comes together like in a perfect harmony.the people who left the movie theater in tel aviv, where all crying in all 10 times that i saw it. some have cried because of the moving, wonderfull story and some because of the remembrance of their period in the nazi concentration and death camps all over europe.THANK YOU benigni for making the film, and THANK YOU for making it so good. this is a "must see" movie for everyone. BRAVO!!!</fullReview>

As Will Shakespeare wrote: "If music be the food of love....." The love of the father for his son, in spite of the horrendous situation, to give him HOPE. The actual 'making' of the tank - the prize for gaining points.The evocative memories of the zany classroom scene, and the 'translation' in the barracks! The TRUST of Giosue in his Dad - one will NEVER forget his 'It's true!' As St Irenaeus, in the 2nd Century said, 'The glory of God is man fully alive' - so it was with Guido, Dora, and Giosue. Thank you Roberto! 5 stars for this profound film.</fullReview>

Without diluting the horror of a nazi concentration camp the movie showed the humorous side of and individual and how it helps him endure the sufferings heaped upon him. It is in essence a story of a goofy man who gets by life with nothing more than a sense of humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie - A must-see for everyone!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out on the experience of a lifetime! This film captures a truly beautiful spirit and presents a sample of the powerful effect a loving man and father can have on those around him, even under the most horrifying circumstances. What a wonderful world this would be if more people could be like Guido! This masterpiece combines a charming love story with a very serious and touching story of a father's efforts to protect his young son from the horrors of the Holocaust. Bittersweet humor is carefully sprinkled throughout the film to make it possible to watch and smile through tears as you witness a very touching and tragic portrayal of one family's experiences.For those who have reviewed the film here with distaste and shock over what you think the film is saying about Jews and the Holocaust - Get Over It! Guido is never presented as the model Jew or even the practicing Jew, but rather an extra-ordinary man who approaches all aspects of his life (from as small as a rain storm to as huge as the Holocaust) with the most incredible attitude and interest in actively making life beautiful! Guido should remind us that the Nazis captured all Jews because of how they were born, not whether they were practicing or not. (Some may be aware that people who where not Jewish were also killed and tortured during the Holocaust for trying to help Jews or for being considered gypsies or mentally/ physically unwell.) Benigni has simply presented a different approach to telling of the horrors of the Holocaust. Never does he imply that this is a documentary or completely factual. He does create powerful scenes that will make your heart stop (Guido lost in the camp finds a tower of bodies hidden only by fog) and cause your soul to ache (Guido's wife realizes that she is separating the clothing of the dead and frantically searches fearing to find her own sons clothes). Don't miss the message by too critical and defensive!This film was undoubtedly the best film of 1999, unfortunately, the Academy Awards judges could not bring themselves to award a Foreign film with the Best Picture award and chose instead to give the award to the second best film - Shakespeare in Love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an amazing movie and can't believe the controversy. It wasn't intended to be a documentary on the holocaust and think too many of the negative comments completely look through the point of the movie. I personally don't view it as a comedy but a drama about a funny and very powerful human being who wound up at one of the camps. In order for the movie to work at it's fullest, it did slide a little in terms of how accurately it depicted a concentration camp but the slide did not, by any means, give the wrong impression of the overall seriousness of the holocaust. Consider the fact that practically all the positive comments made on this movie mention how the viewers cried at the end. It would take a pretty soulless individual to walk out of the theater laughing hysterically.Character development was awesome. The first part of the movie was all about absorbing the viewer into the genuine and strong nature of the characters and the tight bond they had between themselves. By the time they make it into the concentration camp, your heart completely sinks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about this movie, I, like many other people, was somewhat concerned. A comedy about the Holocaust? Isn't that somehow tasteless? But I decided that I couldn't judge the film without seeing it myself. This is the single most incredible movie I have ever seen in my life. I laughed; I cried. (Pardon the cliche.) All of my fellow theatre-goers remained seated at the end, pretending to read the Italian credits as they dried their eyes. The reason this film is so wonderful is because it is a comedy and it takes place in a concentration camp, but it is not a comedy about the Holocaust. It's about life and about love. And it manages to leave you believing that life is indeed beautiful. I read that some genius dubbed the film into English. See it in Italian. The language adds to the beauty of the film. I suppose some lazy Americans don't want to read the subtitles. Do it anyway. It may still be good in English, but in Italian, it's perfect.</fullReview>

This is the SWEETEST film I have ever seen. I haven't cried at a movie in about five years, but this film turned me into a blubbering mass of goo. I understand the arguments about the unrealistic concentration camp settings, and they make me want to vomit. For me, this film was about letting go of cynicism and hatred and anger, and seeing the love that one man is capable of, and the arbitrariness of hatred. The very most you can hope for from a film is to find something in the work that helps you to understand and connect with a few in the range of emotions that encompass what it means to be human. Don't put down this film for being "unrealistic". It is a beautiful beautiful BEAUTIFUL STORY, and the suspension of disbelief that it asks from the viewer is a VERY small price to pay in exchange for the eloquence of its message.</fullReview>

However, I'm glad I decided to play 'high brow' for once and see what I had been hearing about from critics.Life is Beautiful was amazing. It made me laugh, and almost cry (hey, i'm a guy with appearances to maintain). For Benigni to flawlessly weave comedy and tragedy was no easy task, but he pulled it off.I know there's some people that think it was wrong of him to try and joke about the holocaust, but they just need to wake up and stop being so close-minded. In no way did Roberto Benigni trivialize Hitler's evil deeds. He was just trying to show how far a father is willing to go for the son he loves.</fullReview>

Benigni's chaplin style creates moments of intense humour which in a flash of lightning transform into drama. In his attempt to disguise the sheer horror of the prison camps, Guido captures our heart by convincing his young son that the whole thing is only a game. I am still haunted by the distant sound of Giosue' laughing.Equally haunting is the score by Nicola Piovani. I could not hold tears from my eyes at the final moments of the movie.

		<fullReview>This is the kind of film that, once you finish it, you're afraid that, because it's subtitled, not many people will see it due to the seemingly inherent laziness of the general viewing public. It's disturbing, because I left this film wanting to tell everyone I knew to go see it immediately. Fortunately, credit was given where it was due in this case, and the film got the sort of exposure that no other foreign film has gotten in my memory (I'm 28.) This is not the best film I've ever seen- that honor is still held by The Godfather. It's not the best foreign film I've ever seen- that would be Kurosawa's "Ran". It's not even the best Italian film I've ever seen- I still hold up Fellini's "La Dolce Vita". But it is, without a doubt, a great film. Begnini has a gift for comedic pathos that was previously the sole possession of the late, great Charlie Chaplin. People who profess a problem with the "realism" of the concentration camp need only take two things into account- 1.- Have they ever even seen pictures of newsreels of any camps in Italy? I know I haven't- they were always the Polish ones. 2.- The realistic, accurate depiction of concentration camp life is not the point of this film- if that's what you're after, try "Holocaust", "Sophie's Choice", or "Escape From Sobibor" to name only a few. In this case, the story's the thing- a man who so loved his son, and wanted him to feel safe, is able to convince him that the whole situation in the camp is a game. Take the realistic depiction of the camps and the realistic depiction of the settings with a grain of salt and you'll enjoy the film a whole lot more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fable, according to Webster, is "a legendary story of supernatural happenings" ... "intended to enforce a useful truth". This movie certainly has both of these elements and is now on my list of favorite films and is destined to become a classic.I do not think Benigni used the Holocaust 'as a convenient backdrop' as someone suggested he may have. To me, he used the century's most horrific crime against humanity as a way of demonstrating just how far a father will go to protect his son's life and his childhood innocence... in the face of total desperation. The game playing between father and son was Guido's only hope of keeping his beloved son hidden and quiet. It took a loving father's quick wit to devise such a ridiculous, yet effective, plan of tomfoolery ... his only weapon to combat such unthinkable human tragedy. Let's face it ... fighting back against the Nazi regime would have meant certain death to him and his son (however, this would not have stopped Hollywood from choosing this plotline ... and I'm sure it would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger).Another point ...Benigni treats the holocaust portion of the film with the utmost care and respect. The comedy and the game playing took place between a father and his son, as a matter of survival.I also interpreted Guido's love of his son, as an expression, and natural extension, of the love that he had for his wife ... his 'Principessa', whom he adored. He did what he had to do to save 'her' son and maybe his own sanity and he did it the only way he knew - making his child laugh and play a game. After all, this horror couldn't be real, could it? It must be a game! And in the end, we find that Guido triumphs. Can you remember the joy in the very last scene of the film? Guido actually does accomplish the supernatural.God bless foreign films.</fullReview>

This was absolutely the best film of 1998. It was my choice to win the Best Picture award at that ceremony that I have lost all faith in. I wasn't too much of a foreign-film fan, but after seeing "Life Is Beautiful" and "Central Station", that has changed.

		<shortDescription>Remember the Theater of the Absurd?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roberto Benigni's celebrated affirmation of the human spirit owes a little to "Rhinoceros," Ionesco's absurdist play from the Sixties. There's the same attempt to reduce the worse horror in human history to the absurd. Perhaps this is a way of comprehending something monstrous beyond comprehension. Benigni was criticized in some circles for trivializing the Holocaust, but that is not what he did. He sought to rise above it. I don't know whether he or Ionesco were really successful. On the other hand has anybody--any religion, philosophy or great artist--ever solved the problem of evil in this world?There's something of Charlie Chaplin in Benigni's irrepressible hero, and in the camera work look for the influence of Orson Wells in light and shadow. The strange splashes of color on such places as the concentration camps walls reminded me curiously of Jacque Demy's "Umbrellas of Cherbourg," a wondrous French operetta from the Sixties (starring Catherine Deneuve, music by Michel Legrand).The movie drags a little at times and we miss a lot of Benigni's mugging as our eyes chase after the subtitles, but the central idea, that with our attitudes we create the world, and that life can be beautiful even in the midst of tragedy, is uplifting, if hard to believe.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

I also wanted to see if the happy manic energy that Roberto displayed at the Oscars was apparent in his work. I feel that Roberto Benigni was absolutely charming, disarming, beguiling, supremely inventive and hugely compassionate in his desire to win the heart of his loved one and then to shield his child from the horrors of the holocaust by game playing. I believe that the use of humour in the holocaust setting was extremely well done. Everyone should have some one like Roberto Benigni to shield them by caring enough to divert their attention through humour and unconditional love from the never ending harsh realities that beset the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To All Who Read:I saw "La Vita E Bella" (known to us Americans better as "Life is Beautiful") two weeks ago. I still have not been able to get it out of my mind. "Life is Beautiful" is why we go to movies. It makes us think, it entertains us, and it stays with us long after we've left the theater.Roberto Benigni wrote, directed, and starred in this gem of a film. He has a joy of performing that I haven't seen in any actor since James Cagney and the plot and dialogue moves along in a Chaplin-like fashion. I believe that Benigni will be the Chaplin for the 21st century, and I, for one, will greet him with open arms."Life is Beautiful" is one of the best films of the year and also one of the best films that I've ever seen. It's a true masterpiece. Once in a while there's a film that sort of fills a void for me after I see it and makes me wonder how I went along with life before this movie.

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful has got to be the best film I've ever seen (and trust me, I have seen many!). It combines a love story, tragedy, comedy all into one and few films do that. This deserved to win best picture. Roberto Benigni was amazing and Giusue was adorable!!! Overall, the movie was amazing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is obviously much different than a film produced in the United States. I thought the sub-titles were going to be a problem, but I didn't mind. Much better than a bad voice over in my opinion.As far as the movie itself, it is truly a masterpiece. Much better than all the other films nominated for best pick (it is in a tie with Pvt. Ryan in my opinion).The main character Guido, shields his son from the horrors of a concentration camp by making it all seem like a game. Sad and funny at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie blew me away. It was the most incredibly tragic and at the same time, gloriously happy thing I have seen in a theater in a LONG time. Roberto Benigni was amazing, the directing was wonderful, many of the gags were entertaining (The egg thing at the beginning), and the story was on the whole wonderful. I have no problems with this movie. Other people, however, did. One common criticism was that it was historically inaccurate. Tell me, honestly, did it really need to be totally precise? We didn't need to know what atrocities were committed for this movie to work, we just needed to know that it was a living hell. Another criticism is the idea that it "promotes lying to your children." I do not believe that a child that small could handle the ideas that 1) He or she will be almost certainly killed, and 2) That death will be very brutal. But this is a movie review, not a philosophy forum. In short, this movie, like Life itself, is beautiful. A true must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bravo Roberto, This film reaches new heights in cinematic expression. Benigni's unique ability to reach out to the audience's hearts and minds through the talents of his writing, directing and acting is what makes this film the masterpiece it is. The other lead characters too, deserve high praise for their own invaluable contributions. It is not often that a director is able to combine elements of comedy and drama into a workable storyline. It is even rarer for this storyline to be able to convey emotion to the audience as well as involving the audience in the emotion of the film. This is a film that I will definitely pay to see again. This is cinema at its best.ps - My favourite scene is the Tank scene at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely does a film make you laugh loudly and cry. La Vita e Bella did that for me. ROBERTO! is fantastic as Guido, and is well supported by the rest of the cast. The script is excellent, with a great mix of slapstick and good humour. This film reinforces the fact that foreign language films have a hell of a lot to offer the English-speaking world. La Vita e Bella is definitely in my top five, and easily the best tragicomedy ever made. 10/10 for the best movie of the 1990s!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silence...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this film I was struck with silence. A rarity for me. It was, as some of the other reviewers said not an accurate depiction of the holocaust. But then it was never intended to be that, it was, as we were informed in the opening scenes a fable, a yarn. A conjuring of the imagination, and my what a wondrous conjuring. You cannot mistake this for reality. Benigni has ensured that we are not in any way decieved by the intent of the film. The sets are exactly that. Stage sets for one of the most touching tragi-comedies, I have ever had the pleasure to witness. Benigni was superb as the passionate and imaginative Guido who despite all odds captured the heart of his love Dora and shielded his young son from unimaginable atrocities. The humour was fantastic in its innocence. But what made this film truly shocking was the way Guido seems strained to make light of the horrors of his situation at times and yet he does it anyway so as to protect an innocent from horror. So why does Benigni use such a thing as the holocaust as a backdrop to a comedy? Because it works, if any of you have ever read Joseph Heller's 'Catch 22' then you will know what I mean. The way comedy and tragedy are juxtaposed to give a sense of bewilderment. Whereby the viewer or reader genuinely doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. A prime example of this is when he speaks to Dr Lessing and is under the impression that the Doctor is intent on helping him and his family out of the concentration camp. Instead he is given a quiz! I could deconstruct this film and analyse its merits and its failings, but that's not what the film is for. It is a transcendental experience. Something which can never truly be quantified or catalogued. You must allow this film to consume you and walk away feeling that there is some hope in this cacophony of madness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'La Vita E Bella' was the most touching story of love and the power of the individual in quite a long time. In my opinion it was the best movie of the year. It had everything that the other films nominated for Best Picture had and so much more. It was the touching yet cool love story of 'Shakespeare In Love', it was the power-of-the-individual saga of 'Elizabeth', and the touching yet realistic take on World War II of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'The Thin Red Line.' Roberto Benigni was the maestro of one of the true greats of all time which only adds to his resume as one of the funniest people in the world. 'La Vita E Bella' was a truly beautiful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was amazed--and appalled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never have I left a movie theater as disappointed and disgusted as I was with "Life is Beautiful." Benigni's film is only mildly funny at its best and terribly offensive at its worst.Numerous reviews have compared Benigni to Chaplin, a grave disservice to Chaplin's memory. Benigni's pratfalls can be seen coming a mile away; at one point he even falls over a chair while carrying a loaded tray of food. How original!Worse, Benigni never, never stops talking. His rapid-fire delivery is funny for about 10 minutes, then it's simply annoying.After about an hour of this somewhat amusing comedy, Benigni and his family get carted off to a concentration camp and the film becomes an exercise in amazingly bad taste. Gee, that place is remarkably clean and safe for a concentration camp. Benigni doesn't have to worry about being shot when he casually walks out the door at one point, these German soldiers are so stupid that a little boy can evade them just by hiding on the top of a bunk bed and ducking anytime someone comes in.Benigni complains constantly when forced to do hard labor-- oh, those Nazis were so mean, weren't they, making him carry all those anvils? But look how they took that Jewish guy off to the infirmary and stitched up his arm when he got hurt. I guess all those stories about how troublesome Jews were dragged to one side and shot weren't true.In short, Benigni presents a camp with almost no horror, or horror extremely white-washed. We never see him deal with the fact that his father was gassed, along with many others he probably knew. He gets on the PA system to send a message to his wife at one point, a blatantly manipulative scene that is clearly meant to get the audience teary. Would anyone do that in real life, risking both his own life and that of his son? Ditto for the playing classical music so his wife can hear it nonsense.And the end, oh the end--I nearly screamed in anger and frustration--you can practically hear Benigni saying, "now, that wasn't so bad, was it?" as the inmates walk away from the camp. A concentration camp's a breeze if you just grin and never stop talking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A small film with large feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who knows the past films of Roberto Benigni, knows that they in most cases are very funny, but no deep pieces. They were in Italy genuine Blockbuster, but outside of this country unknown. Not with "Life is Beautiful". This film comes the realism of the life infinitely near. The first half of the film is a beautiful, romantic and funny dear story in the Benigni style with happy end. Here the world still is correct, although in the background already the antisemitism of the early 30's broad-makes itself. Now the leading characters are suddenly torn from their luck and deported into a concentration camp. The true badness of fascism shows up, and the laughter remains being to one in the neck. The scenes, as the father for its son arranges the whole fright of the concentration camp as play and never let him doubt that the life is beautiful, are unbelievable touching. "Life is Beautiful" lets the whole spectrum of human feelings beautiful revive.Mille grazie, Roberto! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prepare yourself for an uplifting, heartbreaking experience! Roberto Benigni is priceless as an Italian Jew who uses humor to protect his young son from the evils of the Holocaust. Yes, the movie is a comedy, and the opening scenes are deceptively light-hearted. But as the story unfolds, the film makes startling use of humor to increase its emotional impact, rather than to shy away from the dark issues it addresses. The depictions of the concentration camps are not graphic -- this isn't "Schindler's List" -- but the film can still be painful to watch at times. The clever script also provides plenty of laughs, and the emotions which the film evokes never seem to be weakened by the presence of subtitles! In a world that produces films like this, you'll leave the theatre agreeing, "Life is Beautiful"!</fullReview>

Roberto Benigni has made a beautiful, funny, charming, entertaining, sad, and heartbreaking movie about a father who'll overlook his own sorrow and fear to save his son from the knowledge that they are most likely going to be killed. The movie starts off as pure comedy, but after an hour or so it has developed to the most amazing mix of comedy and drama that I have ever seen. Sometimes I didn't know if I should laugh or cry, so I did both -- at once.So, life *is* beautiful -- as is this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so astonishingly misbegotten it took my breath away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie although I had a strong sense beforehand that it was drastically misguided, after seeing it, I realized that it was far worse than I could have imagined. Roberto Benigni in his benighted way, probably thinks what he did here was heroic, I can excuse poor judgement and taste in an artist, but for the life of me, I cannot fathom how anything so misbegotten could be so popular and somewhat critically acclaimed. Certainly, there are true stories of incredible bravery, fortitude and even humor in the face of such unrelenting evil, but these are true stories (like the escape from Sobibor). Benigni, however, creates, out of whole cloth, as far as I can tell, a fairy tale which uses the Holocaust as background. He creates a character and situations that could simply not exist under such conditions and are not even remotely related to anyone or anything in the history of the holocaust. To further compound the problem, he constructs Aushwitz-lite in which the latter half of the movie takes place. A place with gas chambers, unrelenting, (but Chaplin-esque) hard labor, and with such seemingly lax security that Benigni's character can commandeer the camp's PA system, and effectively hide his son. Further, the inmates, who in reality, were starved and worked to death never appeared more than "bushed." These fictional liberties, to my mind, are unforgiveable. The Holocaust is always foreground, and there is no "lite" available. The germans simply killed you, unrelentingly, for any reason whatsoever. Further, one of the worst aspects of arrival at a death camp like Aushwitz was the sudden separation (culling) of the children from the parents, husbands from wives. This activity, never overlooked, immediately told the prisoners they had passed from the land of the living into hell. Somehow this little fact was passed over by Benigni. He simply keeps his son with him. Indeed, none of the playful little camp activities portrayed could have ever existed for even a milli-second. Benigni's story could have taken place in any particular bad situation, why set it in a concentration camp. Perhaps my reaction seems humorless, but really, the humor here is strained and out of place. What was he thinking? Evil triumphed, millions were dispatched in the most monstrous of conditions. Nothing can modify this, the pure fact of its occurrence makes interpretation, let alone heart warming entertainment an impossibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie early on the evening of the Oscars, and I came home and did something I haven't done in years. I stayed up all the way to the end of that always overdrawn show to see if this movie would win. Perhaps this movie is a fable, but it is one with something better than a moral at the end. Benigni provides us all with a wonderful example of how man, in the face of the greatest challenges can still look out at others and do his or her best to brighten their world, especially the world of children, to help them laugh and have a better day. I don't watch movies with sub-titles all that often, but it made no difference (after the first ten minutes which were needed to adapt). In fact, I cannot imagine another voice replacing that of Benigni's, which so perfectly radiates his warmth and enthusiasm for life. Go see this movie; then go see it again. I did.</fullReview>

This movie about World War II is this year's best picture. Never before have I been touched by a movie in such a tremendous way. What makes it so incredibly sad is the fact, that you have been laughing, living and experiencing beautiful things with the main character. He becomes a perfect figure to identify yourself with. That's why it is a lot more sad and touching to feel his pain. Roberto Benigni's character always tries to see everything from a positive way for him and his son, even though he isn't always well up. But he lets us be happy that we aren't in his situation and he lets us know that life is beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if my italian in the summary is correct, but those two words pretty much sums up my impression of La Vita é Bella. Those are the words that Roberto Benignis character in the movie uses to conquer the heart of the adorable Dora and they mean "good morning princess".Those words are the foundation for the whole movie because what this movie is really about is something like: "enjoy your life and make other people happy". And Roberto Benigni really means it - he lives by it as far as I can see.I agree with him and that is probably why I liked this movie. There are some truly magical moments in this movie as well as there are funny moments - after all it is a Roberto Benigni movie. But above all you will find a lot of honesty, purity and innocence in the movie. Benigni wants to tell you that "Life is beautiful no matter what".Some of the commentators find that you should not make fun of Holocaust. To those people: get a grip. If you cannot find the tragedy in this movie you won't be able to find an elephant in a phone booth.Rating: 9 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider Life is Beautiful one of the most well made films I have ever had the privilege to see. I loved how Benigni made the first part of the film so light-hearted and charming. It made you care about the characters and allowed us to get to know Guido and Dora outside of the drama and tragedy of the second part of the story. I am shocked that anyone could feel this film somehow makes light of the Holocaust. Never once did the I feel any of the humor detracted from the true horror of the camp. Joshua may have been fooled but the audience is well aware that what is happening to this family is not a game and that any of them could be killed at any moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is film is fantastic. When I left I was so emotionally charged. I didn't know if I was happy or sad. The film is so funny, so sad, and so beautiful all at once. The beginning of this movie has some truly amazing comedic sequences. Things that were funny earlier suddenly all come together to make this magically funny sequences between Roberto Benigni and Nicoletta Braschi. The movie then gets more serious, but still has the comedic elements; so your laughing and near crying all at the same time. The acting and direction is also fantastic. This movie is definitely a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roberto Benigni gives a wondrous, touching, tragicomic performance that netted him the first Academy Award for Best Actor ever awarded to a foreign-language performance.While the movie delivers several uproariously funny burlesque moments early on, as Guido (Benigni) meets and falls in love with Nicoletta Braschi, it's real strength is in the second half, which is set in a concentration camp. Benigni creates an inventive and elaborate game of make-believe designed to shield his son from the camp's horrors; in doing so, he also shields the audience from the worst of it.I take the point to be that while governments do evil things to people, those people are generally pretty resourceful and resilient, and generally find ways to make pretty good lives for themselves regardless. Most WWII movies relentlessly show the nightmarish side to the Holocaust while neglecting the resourcefulness of the victims in carrying on with their lives, a la DIARY OF ANNE FRANK.Benigni's imperviousness toward real human suffering is a questionable tactic; I would have thought that a lot of people would have found his gags tasteless. But if you realize that the humour is simply a device to lift the tension, then you will see it's real genius - it's statement that life can be beautiful no matter what the situation or the backdrop, that government can never take away from the human spirit.The movie is genuinely touching, and will you make cry and laugh with equal vigor. I felt it should have won for Best Picture, and I'm certain that it will be remembered for much longer than SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About 2 years ago, I contemplated on how one could express a dramatic situation by using extreme comic elements. The key is that the comedic element has to enhance the dramatic feeling and not draw attention away from it. I have not been able to work this into any writing of mine, because it's fairly difficult. Amazingly, this movie pulls it off. It deserves a "10" just for that.That being said, I wanted to comment on the people who gave this movie bad marks because it didn't cover the Holocaust seriously. What these people don't understand is that this film is not about the holocaust; it is about a relationship or, in the broader sense, about humanity. It doesn't matter whether it is set in the Holocaust, the Inquisition, or in Roman times. Having it set in this century in Italy clearly has a purpose. It makes it easier for us to relate and the movie is in Italian. Also, if it really wanted to cover the Holocaust, wouldn't it be set in Germany or Poland. Frankly, this movie moved me much more than "Schindler's List.""La Vita e bella" is the most original work I've seen since "Babe" proved that children's stories can be Oscar material.Peace and Luck!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How anyone can miss the horror of this death camp as it is portrayed in Life is Beautiful is beyond me. Others have said that it wasn't a true portrayal, etc. Of course not, that's because we see most of the camp through the eyes of a child. When the child is not present, or is unaware, we see calousness, death and labor. When the child is present- we see the camp as Guido is desperately trying to paint it for his child. For the smarter half, it doesn't have to be shown in all its bloody horror.For those who feel this story doesn't hit reality on the head- Bingo, you hit the nail on the head. That some can't see that the movie's skew of reality was the whole point, proves that many will never understand when a film pushes the boundaries of clichéd and predictable film making.In a world of "spell it out for me" movies, this is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie a few weeks ago before the Oscars. I heard all the hype about it and I've seen Roberto Benigni on various talk shows here in the US so I knew him to be as energetic and verbose as they come. So naturally I walked into the theater expecting to laugh my socks off!What I got instead was maybe only two or three roaringly funny moments while the rest of the humor fell short (like many of Whoopie Goldberg's many failed attempts at humor at the Oscars). However, it is not primarily the humor that makes this movie great...it's the message and the heart.This is the kind of movie that makes you wonder whether or not you should be laughing at any of the jokes because it's set in a brutal Nazi concentration camp. You spend the first few moments writhing uncomfortably in the theater as Benigni whips out joke after joke once they reach the camp. Then you can't help but suddenly burst out laughing at his mock translation of the German soldier. (the funniest moment in the film!)It's a scene that lifts the tension and makes the viewer realize that the whole point of the movie is not to make light of the situation, but to try and mask the situation through humor. The movie is so touching when you realize that all his efforts, all his energy, and all his thoughts went into protecting his son. Through the days of hard labour, he always comes back to his son wildly happy and full of anticipation that they will someday win their "prize".While I somewhat doubt that his son, who seemed very intelligent at the beginning of the movie, would fall for the charade for so long, I think the premise of the movie is very touching and effective. "Life is Beautiful" is an appropriately named because it illustrates to everyone that life can be beautiful no matter what the situation or the backdrop. Horrifying moments and situations can take away certain aspects of life, but it can never take away from the human spirit. This is one of the many points to this film and while I did not laugh as much as I thought I would, I walked away from the movie theater with a smile on my face and a joyous outlook on life.Congratulations to Roberto Benigni to making such a fine film. I felt it deserved every award it has garnered and I even dare say it should have won for Best Picture. I enjoyed it far more than Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Shakespeare in Love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A should-be Oscar winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I walked into a movie theatre to see this film, I had no idea what it was about. I merely thought that it would be a love story, and not being a Hollywood film, it already had bonus points. Though the characters in this movie aren't what would be considered to be typically likable, the director, Roberto Benigni, has transformed this simple story into a heart-wrenching tale of the injustice that people suffered in the second world war. However, unlike other films about this time period, Benigni captures the emotions of one small non-practising Jewish family and how the holocaust affects them. The actors' portrayals of the Orefice family allows us, the audience, to experience the misfortunes and general perils that came from concentration camps. Other films and books have led us through these horrors, but this film managed to make the audience feel a genuine pain, allowing us to actually almost smell the burning bodies, taste the watery broth that was called soup, sense the fear of being found in that hole in the last crucial moments. Benigni's direction of this remarkable film should be recognised and applauded, as it is a most phenomenal movie that should win at least an Oscar for Best Film, but as long as they are held in America, we may only hope. This film is, without a doubt, a triumph that will be remembered by movie-goers for years to come, and certainly not without reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, a brilliant essay on the nature of evil. But not in its dark, mysterious side - rather this is a movie steeped in optimism. A sunny view of life emerges in the guise in one man's personality, in his happy outlook on life as he starts out on a journey of discovery. We know little of his background and upbringing - other than he has an uncle, likes life and people - and falls madly in love with a beautiful woman. He is also a master in understanding others. He can be outrageous but always is endearing. He gets through life by his wits and unrelenting energy. He rises to another level of being through apparently simple pleasures - food, solving riddles, making friends, making fun, making others happy. And he finds his ultimate happiness in love of his small son, his wife and of life itself ... this is a deeply layered movie. The plot meanders but is riveting - it has apparently unrelated parts - which are all connected in their brillance - a small episode with a key reveals the smartness of the intertwining story ... there are several genres operating in parallel - comedy, tragedy, action, drama - the story develops through forceful actions, opportunity, fate, unknown forces, luck ... and yes, it is in a foreign language - two in fact... Italian and German... and also human.The story is simple on the surface - full of depth throughout. There are scenes so memorable that I will surely remain with the viewer for a lifetime. This is one fantastic movie. And it is truly beautiful - it is a story of true love, sacrifice and unselfish conduct. There are some scenes so funny and humorous that to know that this story is about the terrible events of the Holocaust makes not a wit of difference. Indeed it is a commentary and fresh viewpoint on surviving hatred.And who is responsible for this great movie? It is the star, director and writer of this movie - Robert Begnini. For him, human nature is elastic - and good does truimph over evil - not by happenstance - but because of love and ruthless reactionary counterforces... to survive life is to be smart, lucky, well-intentioned, witty and with goals. This is not a movie of good and evil. This is a movie about true love - of family, friends and life itself. Begnini has produced and delivered a masterpiece.</fullReview>

The humor in the movie is not offensive, and while the first part is hilarious, the second part causes you to perhaps smile... you do not break out in laughter. Now, I don't see how something like "Saving Private Ryan" can even be compared to this... "Life Is Beautiful" is superior by far! Watch this movie, you will NOT regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An un-even but charming mess...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't figure out the fascination with this highly overrated film. The first hour is delightful, then we are asked to believe some quite outlandish behavior in the concentration camps. Would "Guido" really risk his life to play a song on the PA system? It doesn't make sense to take this risk, in light of his efforts to save his son (which also fall short of believability.) I often am able to suspend my logic in favor of a romantic choice by a character. It is, after all, the movies. But is doesn't even work on that level, since so much time is dedicated to his single vision: save the boy from death or reality! There is no fear of the camp or even death in the film. So, Benigni's character's actions don't have a base in reality. Thus, we cannot feel compassion for the moment, even if we understand that we should feel it. It's the fault of the script and the director, who don't recognize that most of the audience would like the lead to be BOTH smart and charming, to be BOTH brave and funny, to be BOTH egocentric and understanding of others. Benigni's character comes off as a silly goof who doesn't see the poignancy of his own dilemma...so the movie-goer may miss it as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>La vita e bella is a great film and I gave it a nine. After reading several other comments I'd like to add the following:The aspect I liked most in the film is that Guido and his son played this game in the concentration camp.As an Austrian I have learned a lot at school about the history of WW2. Obviously this also included the concentration camps. The existence of these camps - or better the idea of mass production-killing-farms - had become an accepted fact. For some reason I did not think anymore about how crazy and absurd these concentration camps actually were.When I first saw Guido and his child playing their game in the camp I thought that that was an absurd idea. Only later did I realise that their game was actually a lot less crazy than the reality.I have become aware again how incredible it was what Hitler and lots of helping hands had tried to do. There has never been a more crazy and devilish game invented.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Does One Cope with such horrors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching La Vita e Bella (Life is Beautiful) I began to ask myself, how did parents explain a situation like this to children. How does one explain a deathcamp to someone of that age. I felt that the backdrop of a holocaust death camp was indeed appropriate. The laughter during the second half of the film was extremely sobering. There was a sense of extreme sadness because I knew what in reality was going on. There is a sense of suspense that tugs at my soul as I wondered how he would escape the confines of a death camp. Benigni's timing was brilliant in the first half, the whole way he sets up situations that later pay off in intense laughter was brilliant. But all of the laughter was just like a means of coping with a complex situation. I don't see how anyone who lived through the holocaust could be offended by this movie. I'm sure that many faced the same problems that the characters felt. Humor is a very powerful coping mechanism. Another movie where humor helps alleviate the atrocities of a serious situation (i.e.- Cold War) was the Late Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. Serious events don't always have to be taken in a droll serious moment. I've had personal experiences with tragedy at which humor was a very good help, making light of a bad situation is always something to strive to be able to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who have critcized "Life is Beautiful" for "making light" of the holocaust have missed the whole point of the film. The film was not intended to be a documentary of sorts about what horrors that were inflicted in concentration camps. The movie is about love and making the ultimate sacrifice for that love.The "game" that Guido convinces his son about isn't intended to deceive the child. Though he was lying, he was doing it to protect his son's innocence at such a tender age. How else could you explain to a child, without absolutely traumatizing him, the horror and inhumanity of intense hatred? How would you tell a child that he will probably die simply because of his race? We have to see this movie through the eyes of a loving father who will not let hate rob he and his son of their inner joy, no matter what the circumstances are. In that respect they truly won by not letting their will be broken and their hopes be dashed.Many of the people who dislike "Life is Beautiful" laud "Schindler's List" because it is a more serious film. Yes, "Schindler's List" was an excellent film but its focus was mostly on the violence of the holocaust. Just because Roberto Benigni didn't show people getting shot in mass quantities every 15-20 minutes, for 3 hours, doesn't make it any less effective in relating the experiecnce of the camps. I was very disturbed by the murders and violence in "Schindler's List" but I was actually moved by it only a few times. Eventually the people became nameless casualties that just piled up. You didn't know their stories and you could only guess their feelings.To me, the main element that made "Life is Beautiful" so excellent is that it takes the focus off of the violence and gives us the emotions of the characters. I got to know Guido, Dora, and Joshua. I truly felt the emotions pouring out of their performances.Many if us have gotten so used to everything being shown to us and spelled out in films that we've started to leave our brains behind. The horror and violence is only implied, but you should be able to use your head and read between the lines.No, the movie is not based around the lightest period in history. But Benigni managed to show us that laughter can indeed be the best medicine, if only temporary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would normally run a mile in the opposite direction when faced with the prospect of concentration camp drama - but a concentration camp comedy? I'm sure many will take the same line. But opening reviews rank this as a must-see. So. Must see. The first point to note is that it takes the best part of an hour before we realise that Roberto Benigni is playing a Jew, which is a reasonable point and makes for happy viewing. This isn't a north European ghetto. This is a beautiful Tuscan mountainside village and Charlie Chaplin is centre stage. But then the storm troopers arrive. And the chronology is irritatingly wrong. And the camp is surreal, but in an inappropriately comic fashion. I felt for Giorgio Cantarini and thought about the lies my father told.</fullReview>

I had a smile on my face throughout almost every minute, sometimes laughing out loud, often holding back tears. The sense of love is overwhelming, the comedy all the more remarkable given the subject matter, which has all the more power for the relatively few direct references to it. (I'm thinking especially of the scene where Guido emerges from fog, talking about how dreamlike it is, to be confronted with a sight which really brings home how nightmarish his condition really is) I really hope that on Oscar night, Benigni will be saying 'Abbiamo vinto!', because this film deserves it more than any of the other nominees that I've seen. Don't hesitate! Go and see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think many of the people who have frowned on Life Is Beautiful have interpetated this movie the wrong way. Life Is Beautiful is NOT about the Holocaust. It is about the love and sacrafice of a father for his son. Being Jewish, I was NOT offended as many of the others said they were. In fact, I think Life Is Beautiful is one of the most amazing, beautiful movies of all time. I have seen it twice, and will see it many more times to come. I love this movie, and hope it wins best picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some of Us Are Missing the Point....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film! It made me laugh, the ending shocked me a bit, and it made me think. I gave it a TEN.Some of the other users that have left negative comments seem to be missing the point. Roberto Benigni loves Charlie Chaplin, and knows everything about him. You'd be a fool to go into this movie thinking that you're not going to see things like eggs dropping on heads, people crashing into each other, clothing being ripped, Guido falling over a chair, etc. It's a little sappy, a touch of cheesy, but that's the way he wants it.As for the comments like, "How could a smart young boy believe this game?": it's a movie. A story. You all suspend your disbelief and watch the BS that happens in action and horror movies, so, why not give a sweet story like this a chance?You're right to say that children and other folks should read in books about the actual horrors of the Holocaust. This movie is not supposed to be an "educational film". Your kids go to school for that. You go into it knowing that it's a "tragicomedy". If you send your kids to a movie nowadays in order to really teach them something, you've got problems.Overall, I'm sorry that so many have become movie cynics. There aren't many fresh movies out there anymore- too many remakes and movie versions of TV shows. "La Vita e Bella" is a true original and deserves our (the U.S.) attention!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the few movies I have ever went to "cold"; not knowing anything about the plot. All I knew was that it was nominated for Best Picture, was an Italian film, and took place during WWII. I detest romantic comedies, but the storytelling won me over. Having a "comedy" take place in a concentration camp was confusing, until the story wound its way around to the point where you saw the method to the madness. The bittersweet ending was perfect. An American film maker would have everyone walking happily into the sunset. A wonderful film, but I still think it will come in 2nd at the Oscars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, well, my opinion about this movie is that it is brilliant, an instant classic, superb filmmaking......a masterpiece. There are no words that can express exactly the way I felt when I was watching the movie and that stil remain inside of me. Benigni has come up with one of the greatest tragicomedies of all time. There's no movie I have ever seen that could make you laugh and cry at the same time. Not a false move in the whole picture, nor a poor dialogue. The acting is superb and the direction is great. Don't listen to the criticism about how the holocaust was lightened in this movie. I do not agree with that, but feel exactly the opposite. After watching this movie you "really" get the idea that the war was awful and I don't think anyone could come out of the cinema laughing. We are all moved by this time and a new perspective of life has just been opened. Arguably, the best movie of the year worldwide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of the year, but it won't win much - and that's ok</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having read all of the comments here, I don't want to seem redundant with my praise. Having rated it a ten myself, I must say that I heartily agree with all the superlatives mentioned by so many others...and yet, all of it taken together still doesn't seem to do justice to the film. For me, the comparison to Chaplin is right on the money, this film stands right next to `City Lights' for its `laugh out loud' comedy, and its `hurts so bad', but joyous, tears. The final frames of both films are absolutely devastating, although for far different reasons. And both films are the product of each one's singular vision, which is what makes `La Vita e Bella' such a refreshing change from the `by the numbers', focus group driven style of contemporary American films - like you can imagine some Hollywood bigwigs getting behind a storyline like this! (What! No special effects! No sex! No violence! No Cursing! No teen appeal! No old TV sitcom rip offs! - you get the idea. I doubt that this film's whole budget could have kept the `Titanic' crew on set for more than a day.) In my humble opinion, this is by far the best picture of the year, but I doubt that it will win much more than token `Oscars', which is as it should be. The Academy Awards are Hollywood's self congratulatory party, and this understated, haunting, lyrical, and profoundly moving gem stands in opposition to all of Hollywood's recent excesses. As for me, I'll take `Life is Beautiful' over a dozen `Titanic's' any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thankfully, La Vita e Bella, a film I hadn't heard much about, came to Oklahoma City. If it hadn't, I might not have seen one of the best movies of all time. It is not only dramatic and humorous at all the right parts, but it is the most emotional movie of the year. Roberto Benigni has made a masterpiece. Is there another movie like this? ever? No. Has anyone else played a character like Roberto Benigni has in this movie? ever? No. Does Benigni care? No. He knew it was a controversial subject matter and he knew that he would receive static from people who don't understand it and therefore criticize it. But that doesn't matter to people who care more about making great movies than what people will think of them. This movie proves that even in the darkest of mankind, life is beautiful. Roberto Benigni has made a great movie that is battling Good Will Hunting and Schindler's List to be my all time favorite movie. Roberto Benigni is a rare and gifted filmmaker and I hope that he will have all opportunity to make future movies. If you have not yet seen this movie, I urge you to see it as soon as possible. This is a 10+!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every now and then we're treated to a special, warm, challenging film which seems to take us into new territory. Seems to because surely the best art, the best movies, the best stories draw from universal human concerns, basic deep needs; from deeds that seem to be superhuman but are natural extensions of what normal people can achieve through love.We respond strongly to these stories because they are innately understandable; extensions of what is there within all of us - if we are brave or clever enough.Life Is Beautiful has already made its mark as a special movie. It's the first foreign language, subtitled film to be nominated for Best Film at the Academy awards. It has touched the heart of those who have seen it.It has also antagonised some because they feel it makes fun of the holocaust and others because they feel it makes fun of the Nazis, and that's an indication of how close to the bone this film cuts.Even though it's centered around the horror of the Jewish holocaust it's still very funny, especially in its first third and then, incredibly, it ends on a life affirming note, struggling triumphantly out of the depths of tragedy. This is done partly by the softening of a particularly terrible event, but life wouldn't be beautiful in this movie without this concession. If humour is the best medicine then this story is proof.Roberto Benigni, who also directed and co-wrote this movie, gives a virtuoso performance as Guido, the Jewish Dad of a young boy called Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini) who's taken with him to a Nazi concentration camp.All of this would be overwhelmingly depressing if it wasn't for the sheer vitality, humour and love of life Guido shows. Benigni is a natural clown. His character is the sort of person who would wake every morning, even in a concentration camp, with the affirmation that Life Is Beautiful.The first third of Life Is Beautiful is riotously funny as Guido wins the heart of his chosen woman. We're introduced to a man who is irrepressibly sunny and pretty zany. He's a trickster and an annoying diversion for those who are more staid. There's barely a hint of the dark underbelly of the film to follow.There have been some very notable films set in pre war Europe. Europa Europa and Cabaret spring to mind, films where blameless people try to live normal lives in the face of curdling stink of racism which begins to sway normality towards the savage.We are presented with stark reminders in these sorts of movies of what can go wrong when society allows madness to be institutionalized.Life Is Beautiful moves far beyond the horrors of the worst we can offer to our fellow citizens. The very best we can present to our children and each other is the chance to live and above all a love of life. Roberto Begnini gives us a character whose love of humour and sheer vivacity could colour the worst excesses of mankind with warmth. It's a wonderful example.That Life Is Beautiful could manage to pump us out of misery and fright into the joy of survival is a terrific achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LA VITA E BELLA DESERVES TO WIN BEST PICTURE OSCAR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La Vita e Bella is an extraordinary film. Not many films can make you laugh as much as you cry - but this certainly is one of them. Roberto Benigni (the Robin Williams of Italian cinema) is wonderful in the lead role and has done a fantastic job with the directing and script, too. His real life wife, Nicoletta Braschi, is great as his wife who, although she herself is not Jewish, demands to be taken to the camp with him. Credit must also go to little Giorgio Cantarini who is brilliant as Giosue (Joshua), Benigni's son, who he tries to shield from the horrors of the holocaust. The film starts in typical slapstick Benigni fashion in 1939 Italy as Guido and his friend Ferruccio go to Arezzo, a Tuscan town. On the way, Guido meets Dora, a schoolteacher, and falls for her. Once they arrive in town, Guido and Dora meet again on a number of occasions, each time Guido surprises Dora - his "principessa". Although Dora is engaged to another man, he still fights for her and eventually wins her over in a memorable scene which uses so many set pieces that have been set up in the previous 30 minutes. The film continues 5 years later and now Guido and Dora are married and have a little boy called Giosue. This is where the film begins to get a little dark as Giudo, Giosue and Dora are taken to a concentration camp and the men and women are seperated. Guido pretends to Giosue that it is all a game and that they must obtain 1000 points to win the prize of a real tank. Schindler's List was a very powerful film and had very graphic scenes portraying the holocaust. Benigni does not show as many graphic scenes but you can still feel the pain and suffering. La Vita e Bella should win the Oscar for Best Picture - but unfortunately I don't think it will as Hollywood is bound to overlook the most powerful, funny and emotional film of all the nominees.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Benigni amazed the whole world with this movie, a proof that his work is finally being recognized. He began just like Charles Chaplin, making small movies that had no other purposes than fun. Now he started do grow - just like Chaplin - and make movies about serious subjects without losing the funny aspects. We have to remember that by the time The Great dictator was released, nobody thought that someone could make a comedy out a serious subject like Hitler - quite the same thing that happened with Benigni's La Vita é Bella. The movie is excellent, it's funny and serious at the same time. This movie is capable of touching (and makes us think about the human race) just like the "serious" dramas about second war, like Schindler's List , for example. Benigni is really the best comediant of the world nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sympathize with those who were offended by Benigni's use of the Holocaust as a backdrop to this film. For anyone who lost a relative or loved one in the true-life tragedy, this film could easily appear to blaspheme the hardships they had to endure. For that reason, I do not recommend this film for anyone with strong personal attachments to the Holocaust. The very nature of the film dictates such a warning.But it is not that Benigni fails to show the proper respect. Those who believe he portrays the event as something less terrific than it was must have had their eyes closed when he walks through the fog straight into a towering pile of neatly-stacked human corpses. The sight of it all, along with the sheer look of terror in Benigni's eyes? as if straight out of Dante's Inferno? that scene alone affirms the terrible realities of the Holocaust.I will not enter into any other areas of this film, because most, if not all, of what I feel has already been voiced here. It is, simply, a masterpiece. In one film, Benigni has outshone all of Hollywood, and once again renewed my faith in the power of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**** out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, I was a little uncertain about whether or not I wanted to see this film. I'd heard it was terrific, but I didn't know if I liked the idea of reading a movie. I had watched bits and pieces of foreign films on television, but I had never actually gone to see one in the theater. I'm glad I did. The subtitles were nowhere near as big a distraction as I feared; in fact, I completely forgot that they weren't speaking English approximately ten minutes into the film. I don't know if that is a testament to this particular movie, or if it's simply a matter of my overestimating the difficulty of watching one. Either way, no matter what language it was in, this was a terrific film.Written by, directed by, and starring Robert Benigni, Life Is Beautiful tells the story of a man with an incredible sense of humor, and how he uses this humor to overcome the horrors of the Holocaust.The first half of the movie is actually providing one of the longest introductions to a character that I have seen, showing backstory as to how the lead character, Guido, met his wife, and got her to fall in love with him through his humor. After this incredibly long, yet very funny setup, the movie flashes forward to the birthday of their young son, Joshua.It so happens that this is the day he and his son are forced to go to a concentration camp. Using creativity and humor, Guido manages to convince his son that the entire thing (the concentration camp) is a game he arranged for his birthday, and this is the focus of the rest of the film; the challenge of convincing Joshua that the atrocities he sees around him are all in fun, and that everybody is having a great time. There are times when Joshua starts to doubt that it's a game, or just wants to quit, and go home, but Guido is always able to convince him otherwise.The best scene in the movie involves Guido translating the rules of the concentration camp into the rules of the game for his son. It's absolutely hilarious. Which is something I never thought I'd say in a review for a movie dealing with the Holocaust.Not only does Benigi manage to find humor in the topic, he is able to create memorable and interesting characters as supporting players in the action. Of particular note is the character of a concentration camp doctor who used to be Guido's friend, and had a penchant for riddles (which were actually pretty good).All in all, this is a very surprising film. The same premise could have been made into a terrible movie, but Benigni didn't downplay the seriousness of the subject; he just shows it from a different point of view. Guido is an incredibly likeable character, and the efforts he goes to, in order to hide the truth from his son, are extraordinary to watch. Whatever doubts anyone may have about seeing this film, simply because it is foreign, put these doubts aside and see it. You'll be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i'm not one to dig many movies, so my word is bond here :). this was an *excellent* film--without giving too much away i would say that the cinematography is beautiful, the store is even more beautiful...i was not sure at the first 10 minutes if i would really get into the humour of the film (and the subtitles bugged me the first 5 minutes since i've never seen a subtitled flick on the big screen before), but after about 30 minutes, i was captivated by Guido's character, his life, energy and love for his family, and at the very end i just burst out in tears...i didn't realize how affected i was. i came in not knowing what to expect at all, and believe i came out of the film changed in some way.10/10--despite the PG-13 rating (not entirely sure why) i would HIGHLY recommend it for anyone in their pre-teens to 100s.p.s. little joshua was *adorable*.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anyone know if there's a shut-off valve for the tear ducts?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday, and just the thought of it still brings tears to my eyes. Having seen all of the Best Picture nominees this year, part of me wishes dearly that this would win, even though it's probably going to be either "Saving Private Ryan" or "Shakespeare in Love". I reached both extremes with this movie -- laughing until the tears rolled down my cheeks and sitting in my car afterwards crying hysterically for a half an hour -- and no other movie has ever done that for me.Yes, it takes the Holocaust and sets into it a clown making a game of it for a child, but what's a life like that without a little hope? Those of you who dislike this movie... I can understand why. But let me ask what you would do in the same situation. It's your child, and you have to explain it to him. Do you tell him that it's all a game, to keep his spirits up? Or do you tell him the truth, and watch him curl up with fear and wither away? I'll bet that without the hope, humor, and love that this movie portrays, the Jews in Europe during that time would not have been able to live after the war ended... those that survived it, that is. I know that everything was not as wonderful -- if you want to call it that -- as it was shown in the movie, but I'd like to think that there were a few parents who tried to shield their children from the horrors of that war at the same time that they attempted to save their lives. Roberto Benigni will always bring a strange, warm sense of emotion welling up in me every time I see this movie. His performance -- as well as that of the child actor playing his son -- are two of the best of the year, and if anyone should defeat Tom Hanks in the Best Actor category, it should be Roberto Benigni.Not everything in World War II was "Schindler's List". Sometimes, I'll bet there were a few scattered moments when life was beautiful.</fullReview>

With that said, La Vita E Bella is a beautiful film - and Roberto Benigni is a beautiful human being. A rare individual, a rare talent, there is something sweetly divine about his film, and the essence of love that permeates through man made horrors. We all have free will, some use it to express dignity, love and freedom. And that is what Roberto Benigni does - in the darkest of hell he is a ray of light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a shame that the simple minds of our culture are only able to see true art for its surface value alone. The film is meant to be a sardonic look at how absurd the Nazi party and the infamous Holocaust really was. If you do not know how horrible the Holocaust was previous to seeing this film, then obviously your ignorance is unwelcome at such artistic fare.Roberto Bernigni was trying to show how truly wonderful life was before the holocaust and how it should be just as wonderful in our present everyday life. While in the prison camps he stressed the true salvation of love and family, and how the strength of that love can help you get through the most horrible of life's challenges.The fact that the Holocaust was a mad-man's dream of killing people based on their religion, culture, and aesthetic appearance, itself is ludicrous. And Roberto Benigni does a beautiful job of showing just how absurd the Nazis were. The idea that no one knew his son was not German until he spoke, is one indication of how we are really all alike. And this point is underlined when Roberto Benigni's character teaches all of the German children to say "Grazi," meaning that it makes no difference what you are, but who you are as an individual.It saddens me to see so many disenchanted viewers. Perhaps, the full value of the movie was missed and the message was not revealed to your closed eyes and heart. Mayhaps it is just as well that there will no doubt be a sequel to Dumb &amp; Dumber for all of the rest to enjoy. However, the ones who want to delve deeper into the intricacies of life and what it has to offer should not miss the oppportunity to take in Benigni's Masterpiece.</fullReview>

And when he was faced with a situation that was beyond his control, where it was not easy to be lighthearted, he found the ability to be so, at the risk of everything, all for his little son. What the viewer sees is one of the finest and most poignant portrayals of human courage that I have encountered yet on the screen. I give it the highest recommendation possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful is NOT supposed to be an intense dramatization of the holocaust. If you want that, go rent Schindlers List. The movie was brilliant in that the audience was subject to what the child most likely saw (during the second half...), not what was actually going on. You have to remember that the father did everything in his power to shield the horror and reality of the camp from the eyes of his son. The plot would not make any sense if we saw the gory details. We all know what happened. If I had to vomit in the washroom after seeing this movie (like I did DURING Schindlers List), the movie would not be remembered for its beauty, but its horror. (Not implying that Schindler's List wasn't beautiful, just not in the same way). The point of this is that if you are offended by the "trivialization" of the holocaust, try looking into the movie for its real message of hope and personal triumph.Next time, skip the critics section of the paper for your very own original thought of the moment. You might be surprised what you find.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST Reason to Endure Subtitles Since "Cinema Paradiso"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of foreign films. I guess it has something to do with the subtitles--do we read them or watch the action? All that eye-flipping between the words and the actors tires me after a while.But every so often, a movie comes around that makes it all worthwhile. "Life Is Beautiful" is just such a picture.Begnini, he of the rubber face, exaggerated gait, and fall-down demeanor, is brilliant here, wearing the three hats of writer/director/star. And his wife, as Dora, is simply gorgeous--the type of woman you would, indeed, rescue from a stuffy engagement party riding a green horse!The subtle swap between this movie's romantic/comedic first half and its more grim second is masterful. The scenes of Guido wooing Dora are cinematic magic--watch Guido use a set of predetermined occurrences convince Dora that even the heavens believe he's right for her. Brilliant!And the concentration camp sequences are magical as well. What parent--having those resources at hand--wouldn't go to the same lengths to protect a little one? The scene in which Giuido "translates" for a German officer, for example, works because the ruse is born of his desparation. Using the only tools at his disposal, he concocts his fanciful tale. Yes, it's hilarious, but it's heartbreaking as well.Sure, the remainder of the movie stretches believability a bit, but considering the life-affirming purpose behind this stretch, I found it all worthwhile.Also, reviews here (and elsewhere) have slammed this movie for being a Polyanna-ish examination of the holocaust. Not in my book. No happy ending here. Joyous, yes, but not exactly cheery!"Life is Beautiful" marks the first time in a long time that I didn't complain over the prospect of reading subtitles. It also represents the first time in a long time I cried copiously in a movie theater.Seek it out. Laugh. And cry. For life is, truly, beautiful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent film about love during the Holocaust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roberto Benigni is known in his native Italy as a comedic star. My guess is that he occupies in Italy the position that Jim Carey occupies here. This is the first of his movies I've seen, and the first half showcases his comedic skills quite well. But this film, written and directed by Benigni, is not a simple comedy.Guido (Benigni) and his friend Feruccio (Sergio Bini Bustric) move to the city, where Guido hopes to open a bookshop. Meanwhile he becomes a waiter in the hotel where his uncle is the headwaiter. On the way to the city he meets Dora (played by the luminous Nicoletta Braschi), his Princess s he calls her, and he continues to accidentally run into her (literally). Although she is expected to marry another, she is romanced and charmed by Guido, and they run off together. They have a son, Joshua, and Guido finally opens a tiny bookshop. Creeping into this charming and funny romance are some stormclouds: anti-semitic slogans appear on walls, some stores refuse entrance to Jews, and graffiti appears on the bookshop doors.Suddenly, Guido and Joshua are herded into a concentration camp. Not entirely understanding where they are being taken, Dora demands to accompany them on the train. While on the way to the concentration camp, Guido creates a fabulous lie for his son. The trip and camp, he lies, are part of an elaborate game for Joshua's birthday. The prize is a brand new tank (a real one, not a toy) and the activities of the camp are parts of the game.This is a powerful film, more powerful I think than "Schindler's List." Here we are suddenly confronted with the life lost by Guido and his family. In "Schindler's List," we never see the lives of the interred. While we see their terror, we never see them as anything but prisoners. Here, the confinement is thrown into such stark contrast with the light, funny, loving, and charming life that preceded it. Once the confinement begins, the colors of the entire film change. In the first half, even a dark rainstorm seems luminous, imbued with it's own palette of grays, mauves, and purples. Italy seems to be enjoying an eternal spring full of sunlight, and bright primary colors, yellows, greens, and blues. In the camp, the entire film becomes washed out, muted and pale. The palette shifts to browns, grays, and blacks.What does not change is Guido's determination to protect his son, Joshua. The game becomes hide-n-seek with Joshua remaining hidden long after all of the other children have been gassed. He keeps up the charade, and we are torn. On the one hand it is impossible not to admire Guido's attempts to protect Joshua. On the other hand, we hold our breaths waiting for the moment in which the lies are blown away by the winds of reality. A number of such moments arise, and we wonder if Guido can weather them.Guido's love for his wife and child, and his never ending efforts to protect them with every resource (however limited) at his disposal, cannot help but move the viewer. His internment does not change his fundamental approach to life, no matter the circumstances. It does not change his belief in himself, in his ability to improvise, to create his own luck. Joshua is the narrator of the film, but it is Guido's movie. To see such doggedness, courage, and stamina linked to the buffoonish smile and antic movements of a Bernigni makes Guido a wonderful character.In the opening scenes, the movie is presented as a fable. Critics who lament that the camp is not violent, that Guido has too much freedom, should bear this in mind. They should also bear in mind that the film is narrated by Joshua, not Guido, and Joshua has seen little of the camp, spending most of the time hidden in a barracks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie! A Must See!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not know what to expect before I went to see this film.I have now seen it twice. I found this film to be a funny and touching love story. The courtship of Guido and Dora was hilarious. The story really takes off when you see Doras' commitment to Guido and her son by getting on the train. Once in the camp, Guidos' devotion to ensuring his son never became truly aware of the situation was amazing. I walked out of the theater with total respect for the attitude Guido showed throughout the movie, whether it was ignoring prevailing racial attitudes or being in a concentration camp. This man carried on and showed the ones loved, that "life is beautiful". That is the gift his son spoke of at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is possibly the most moving and beautiful film I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little bit hesitant about a movie dubbed a "Holocaust comedy" but "La vita e bella" turned out to be one of the loveliest movies I've ever seen. The light and joy of the first half of the movie just made what came next all the more tragic. I thought the little boy who played Josue was brilliant -- in a a league with the child actors in "Kolya" and "Burnt by the Sun" in terms of being believable and childlike without being cutesy. Benigni has always been a favorite of mine, but I never realized the depth and brilliance of the man until I saw this film. It's truly a beautiful film -- I'm moved to tears of laughter (when I think of the scene where Guido lectures a class of schoolchildren on the alleged superiority of the "Italian race") and to tears of sorrow at the fate of Guido and his family -- and I almost never cry in movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't remember the last movie that moved me in the way this film did. Even today, several weeks later, I can hear Offenbach's Baccarole sing out across the camp creating indescribable beauty amidst the greatest ugliness this world has known. The simplicity of the script, of the direction, and of the cinematography should be a lesson to all aspiring filmmakers on how to let the story dominate rather than the storyteller. Robert Benigni, thank you for a delightful film. And, to the rest of the world, Bongiorno principasa.</fullReview>

Guido chooses to see life as being beautiful, and that's how it occurs for him and his family. Many of the other characters do not see life this way and suffer because of it.

		<fullReview>Here is a film that really deserves a nomination as Best Foreign Film (like last year's The Thief) and also deserves to win (which The Thief did not) . Who but Roberto Benigni (who brought us the mayhem of Gianni Stecchino and that incredible cigarette-in-the- pants scene in Il Mostro) could write a scene about "explaining" the rules of a concentration camp to his son such that it was incredibly funny? After having used German for 30 years, but having studied Italian only this past fall, I found it amazing that I understood the Italian in this film better than the German. I was very, very impressed with the script and the performances in this film and highly recommend it to everyone. I agree that this is what film making should be!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw it. Didn't knock me out. Think the piece ramps up nicely UNTIL arrival at the camp, at which point the momentum falters.-Cute Kid Gimmick (everybody knows the drill) is not enough to carry as much "weight" as it winds up supporting.-Nice Benigni visual/juxta sequences BEFORE he is deported; not as interesting after, save the German-Italian translation bit.-The cinematic/content integrated interiors become disconnected without significant purpose in the second part.-Romantic thread starts nice...but really doesn't resonate (again, all after the deportation)Not a waste, but also NOT the home-run I expected.Wait, one more thing-the camp was not particularly threatening. He tells The Kid a tall-tale, but there is no perspective chosen at all. Tell it from The Kid's POV so we can see it with innocence while imagining the horror the tall-tale is covering up, OR show the brutal limits of the father's reality AND the scenes in which he reshapes it for The Kid. Instead we get middle-of-the-road CLOWNERY with no reference point to make the story really ring.Call me...The Script Doctor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing the beauty in life can be such a difficult process for the human being that has been destroyed by his/her environment. The pain and anguish of living blinds our site, and we go on pretending to live, missing the beauty before us.This film is truly a life changer. A man imprisoned in a death camp (holocaust) presents this world to his son as a war game. His son never knows the truth about this horrifying world he now lives in, and he never sees the death before him. He only sees the beauty and playfulness of the war games so vividly described by his loving father. At the end, the boy has won the game...he has survived, yet survival was never an issue in his mind.Magnificent.....I applaud the director and his team for this brilliant piece of film.GC</fullReview>

This film, full to the brim with wit and satire shows the beauty of life and the horror that is war. As the film goes on, you go from laughter to tears, amazement to horror. This simple tale of an Italian-Jewish family caught in the horror of the holocaust is centred around the relationship between a man and his wife and son. The script is full of great lines which make you laugh when you'd rather cry. In all it's a tale of hope and of love and the thwarted desire to live a simple life.

		<fullReview>This movie verges on the edge of being a miracle. You spend almost 2 hours laughing your head off, only to realize when you reach the exit that you have just seen a tragedy. But, it is a tragedy in the finest and cathartic sense. Roberto Benigni has stepped beyond the bounds of a mere entertainer and has joined the realm of giants like Chaplin and Keaton. Never playing too heavily on the pathos of the concentration camp victim, he creates a story of two of its survivors that has a joy that only a genius could perceive. "Life is Beautiful" is beautiful in a way that defies all former logic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The day the clown cried?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize I'm in the minority here, but I strongly feel this film trivializes the holocaust. First of all, Benigni is annoying as hell. The film starts out okay, but halfway through the viewer is treated to a slew of historical inaccuracies: when the trains got to the camps, the children were immediately separated from the adults and exterminated, there was simply no way that a child wouldn't be discovered in the barracks. And the women had their hair shaved off, the film apparently couldn't find extras who wouldn't shave their hair, so they put unrealistic bandanas on their heads. The camp itself doesn't even look realistic, and there is no way that the prisoners had that much freedom to walk around. I actually felt sorry for the extras in the barracks, because Begnini talked so loudly and thought he was the only one who had problems, I expected them to tell him to shut up because they were suffering too.It's puzzling why this film is rated so highly. I actually fast-forwarded through the last thirty minutes because I couldn't stand watching it any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absaloute work of art! Loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so unlike any other normal Holocaust film, it adds a sense of humour to the otherwise depressing subject,The film is based around a hard working Jewish man called Guido who falls in love with a German woman, Dora, they later have a son Joshua(English version) who is around five years old. Their happy and peaceful life in Italy is soon interrupted when they are taken from their home to a Nazi concentration camp, when Dora finds this out she demands to get on the train with them even though she is not Jewish. Guido throughout the film tells his son that the whole situation is a game and that the first person to get to 1000 points will be the winner and will receive a real life size tank as the prize, this stops Joshua from being scared for a while but when all the other children disappear Joshua doesn't understand why. meanwhile Guido is trying to contact Dora in anyway possible, to let her know that he is thinking of her and that they are safe. Guido is constantly trying to cover up the harsh reality of the camp but even he cannot deny the horrors he sees. A scene in particular that I found great was when Guido has finished working as a waiter for the night and is carrying Joshua back to their cabin when he sees a massive pile of bodies, the scene is shot using mist and fog to represent how people knew what was going on but chose to ignore it, the film contains many scenes such as these ones that make you think about the true message they are trying to show.Roberto Benigni has done a fantastic job on this film, he has focused it on the individuals rather than the situation or the camp they were in. It makes you come to love the characters as individuals not just a mass race like how the Nazi's saw them, that is one of the main reasons this film is so emotional and effective. many things in this film are played down that aren't in others such as the appalling conditions and endless amounts of miserable and depressed looking people(even though that was how they were probably feeling), it shows the life of three ordinary and lovely people trying to make the most out of a horrible situation, which is why I find the film so endearing. Even the deaths are played down, I feel this is because to them it was just another person dead, it had no significance, it was just 1 in 6 million, I found this to be totally unique to the film, I would recommend EVERYONE to watch this film because not only is it a brilliant film but it gives us hope that even in the worst of situations there is always a way around it. By the end you will be just as in love with the characters as I was! Absaloutley amazing film, i will be watching this one again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When sometimes, it's worth risking losing life not to lose the very faith in life ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life is Beautiful" divide opinions in the most extreme ways, either you love or hate it. It's famous or infamous for having depicted the 'Holocaust' from the perspective of a father who wants to get the Nazi atrocities off the sight of his five-year old son, Josue. Guido would pretend that everything is a game, and Nazis only rhyme with baddies which Josue must hide from and follow his Dad's instructions to win the 1000-point prize: a real tank.We live the horror of the concentration camp from both Guido and Josue's point of view in a bittersweet duality of death and life, sorrow and smile, survival and fun. It's certainly the gutsiest screenplay ever written for the parallel it traced between one of the most horrifying historical events and its translation as a game. And I can't understand why many people fail to ignore the point of Guido's actions. I love what Ebert said about the film: if Guido had weapons, he would have shot the enemy, if he had an Army, he would have wipe the Nazis out ? but all he had is what his Ancestors called in Latin, 'Vis Comica' (comical force). The film divides and is divided in two parts. The first is set during Italy's fascist days where we meet in a sunny and joyful ambiance a modern clown named Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni), a character that immediately touches your heart, a man with a communicative appetite for life and laughs: the epitomes of his personal philosophy wonderfully conveyed by Nicola Piovani's score. The delightful lightness of life resonates like Nino Rota's music from Fellini's neo-realistic period. The whole film carries many references to Italian cinema's heritage, the sight of Guido and Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) romantically riding the bike reminds of Rizzi and his wife in the "Bicycle Thief" -when the bicycle meant new hopes for the Family- and like De Sica's masterpiece, the film's second part focuses on a poignant father-and-son relationship."La Vita e Bella": even the title is a sort of emphasis on "La Dolce Vita", as if sweet was too feeble a word to describe the inner value of life. Indeed, it takes some real genius to embrace life with such a never-ending optimism, Guido is the perfect antidote against the venomous effect of desperation and he's so convincing that he manages to seduce the beautiful Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), promised to marry a Fascist civil servant... until Guido comes and takes her away like a Charming Prince. The whole first act has the feeling of a fairy tale where we discover Guido, his uncle Eliseo and his German Doctor friend with whom he likes to play riddles. The film begins with a comedic triumph that consecrates Benigni as a modern Chaplin, with the foreshadowing of coming tears when we learn that Guido is Jewish.The change of mood from the second act is so abrupt that it accentuates the feeling of discomfort. Cinematically speaking, "Schindler's List"' is a superior film but we expect a movie with dark and unbearable scenes, we're like mentally prepared. In "Life is Beautiful", it catches us off-guard: after so many laughs, there is a long dramatic transition that even Guido's admirable nerves can't hide. We all know what would happen to Uncle Eliseo when he goes to the 'shower', and the moment when he prevents the Nazi woman officer from falling creates a tragically ironic situation. In the Camp's women section, a little gray cat goes around a pile of women's clothes lying on the floor while he was held earlier by a little girl on the trunk that send the Jews to the train station ...That part is difficult to watch and we're almost glad when laughs are back, when Guido translates the instructions barked by a fat Nazi officer: pure comedic genius! We prefer to see the horror from Josue's view not as a denial, but as a ferocious attachment to the idea of no matter the adversity we face and hardship we endure, while there's life, there's hope; and Josue is the incarnation of this hope for Guido. And when Guido meets the German doctor and tries to seek his help in the Camp, the Doctor's answer leaves Guido shocked and appalled. His face of disbelief is the proof, that Guido is not acting as a clown, all his smiles, games and plays are for Josue.It's all about Josue indeed, and it's certainly with him in mind that Dora, though a gentile, sacrificed her freedom for the camp. In of these ironical twists, Guido would lose his life by trying to find Dora, and knowing his son is watching him, he walks in a comical way before being shot off-screen, off Josue's sight, the gunshots were one of the most disturbing sounds I've ever heard in a film. The day after, Josue would finally win the tank and find his mother; his scream of joy in his Dora's arm is not just the triumph of Guido's sacrifice, but the triumph of hope. And God how I cried in that scene ? Why do some clever users seem eager to shortcut their emotional reactions in the name of cold rationalism? I'm less questioning their intelligence than their ability to think beyond their intelligence. After all, when the same side says "Not another movie about the Holocaust!' and "The movie trivializes (or sugarcoats) the Holocaust", maybe we should consider that the greatness of Roberto Benigni's Oscar-winning film relies somewhere between these two interpretations. To challenge Guido's legendary optimism and faith in life, "Life is Beautiful" needed one hell of a tragedy."A picture with a smile-and perhaps, a tear." said a too modest Chaplin about his masterpiece "The Kid". And after watching "Life is Beautiful", no matter how many smiles, how many laughs and how many tears Roberto Benigni expected me to experience? I know I lost track.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you believe in hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1939, Arezzo, Italy. Carefree Jewish-Italian Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni) has come to the town with intention of opening a bookstore. But meanwhile, he is working as a waiter at the hotel restaurant where his Uncle Eliseo (Giustino Durano) is the maître d'. Not only that, he met and fell in love almost immediately at the female schoolteacher Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) whom he calls 'princess'.And that is despite Dora is being engaged to another man, but whom she did not like at all. Guido began popping up at unexpected timing in order to woo her. On the day of Dora's engagement which happened to be taking place at the hotel restaurant where Guido was working, he managed to whisk her away in a green horse. They managed to live happily for five years at the house of Guido's uncle, having a son along the way in Giosué. All these while the Second World War was already taking place.But on the day of Giosué's fifth birthday, the Germans came and took away Guido and Giosué, just when the family was preparing for Giosué's birthday party. Wanting to be with her family, Dora (a non-Jew) insisted that she would be taken as well. But she would be housed at the women's side of the camp.Pretending that he knows German when a German officer requires a translator, Guido claimed that they are playing a game and they have to collect points in order to win the prize which is a real tank. Guido did that in order to protect his son from the real reason why they are being sent to the concentration camp.At the camp, Guido tried to build up hope for his son Giosué but his own days were beginning to be numbered. Realising his plight, he had Giosué hiding in a junction box, telling him that everyone is actually looking for him. And that is while he tries to free his wife Dora from the camp and giving his own life away at the same time.The day after, the Americans entered the seemingly deserted camp just as Giosué emerges. Hitching a ride on the tank from the American solider, Giosué soon spotted his mother and they were being reunited.It may be a fictional story set in a real-life scenario amidst the backdrop of a war, but the fact that the father would go all lengths to try telling his son that it is all a game and he will get his prize if he collects the points required to win a tank, it is very admirable considering of the situation the family is in. It is actually very heart-warming, with award-winning actor Giustino Durano who plays Guido reminding us why, life is beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best foreign film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most magical movie I've seen for a long time. Visually stunning and beautifully written and acted throughout. The subject matter doesn't make it sound like a lovely film but it genuinely is. You can feel the love this guy has for his wife and son from the minute we're introduced to them. His humour and happiness provide the strength they all need during what must have been an horrific period in their lives and history. Despite the horrors all around them, the subject is handled in a way that doesn't shock or detract from the story, which is ultimately about the strength of love, and the refusal to be broken by negative forces. It is a truly inspirational film and a lesson in storytelling and film- making. I urge you to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poignant movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This a beautiful movie. Why? Because it is well acted, well filmed, well written and well done. It's serious without being pretentious. It tells a story. It's about courage, loyalty, caring, and family. Horst Buchholz is wonderful. His performance as the doctor was powerful. What a great actor! Also, the movie avoids becoming an expose on the horrors of the concentration camp and instead manages to stick to the story about the family. Instead of moralizing on the injustices and ill-treatment suffered by the hero, the movie presents a story of sacrifice and spirit which remains strong even in the most dire of circumstances. The movie offers a glimpse of the concentration camp from a little boy's perspective. For the little boy, who is too young to understand the true nature, purpose and implications of the concentration camp, the camp is just a bad place. It's only years later that he truly appreciates what the camp was about and how his father's bravery saved his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beauty of Foreign Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bravo! Once more, we see that certain magical quality of foreign films that make all American counterparts pale in comparison. When you look at the unimaginably great talent of directors like RobertoBenigni, Guillermo Del Toro, Juan Antonia Baytona, etc., you see the majesty of their particular foreign language. In "Life Is Beautiful", or as it is originally titled, "La Vita es Bella", for example, you see the pain of a father and husband as he is taken by Nazi forces and forced to witness the horrors of the Holocaust with those that mean the most for him. I also frown upon those who refuse to watch a film only because it's not in English. I know a lot of people who miss out on such wonderful movies as this for this sole reason. For this film, the only one that has ever made me cry, once again, Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A masterpiece of film making from Benigni, this film throws you into a false sense of security in the first half, we are reminded of Italy's family orientated culture and benigni's character comes to life with true comic value and lighthearted antics that keep the viewer engaged, i laughed out loud at many points in the first half. This film is a comedy mixed with romance and love of family, with a large dollop of tragedy on the side. We are shown the deep pain of a family being torn apart by war and the German ideals. We are shown how a father tries to cope with his family coming to a concentration camp to be murdered by the Germans. Instead of begging or crying we see benigni's character filled with hope and optimism where most would fall deep into depression, he turns the situation into a game for his son and shields him from the cold reality as the bodies pile up outside. Tension creeps into the film in the latter stages as the son is constantly hiding from the Germans. I found this film and its dramatic ending captivating, a real treat . Interesting for those who enjoy the history of war films, but also enjoyable for all other film lovers as it is a heart warming and sometimes comical tale of how hope and love can conquer all evil. A truly remarkable film, well deserved of being in the IMDb top 250. A real beauty of a film, not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all this movie is wonderful. Funny, dramatic and enthralling. the main reason this movie is criticized is that, in people's opinion, it turns concentration camps into "playgrounds" or "tries to turn the holocaust into a joke". this opinion is completely ridiculous. The main reason for this complaint is because our main character, Guido, attempts to make the concentration camp into a game for his son Giosue. This in no way is offensive, it shows the love for his child that he has as he tries to make this hell they are in bearable for him. in one of the final scenes, as Guido is led off with a gun to his back and he know his son sees him, he does a silly walk. why? to be rude? no. to be offensive? no! to distract is son from the gun, to protect him from the horrors surrounding him. As a Jewish American with relatives who died in the holocaust i don't find this movie in the least offensive and love its original view.Another complaint i have seen is that "if this movie was made in America, it would have been much more criticized for being offensive." and that "they made the Nazis look like buffoons". i have one answer for this: Hogans Heroes. An American TV show that has an 8/10 (while Life is beautiful has an 8.4) rating on IMDb that was and is loved by many. the Nazis SPEAK English around American POWS. ya, this movie sure made the Nazis look dumb (sarcasm).All in all, i loved this movie. I would recommend it for anyone, but be prepared to laugh, smile and cry in Life is Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life Is Beautiful is an Italian movie and it won 3 Academy Awards: for Best Actor, for Original Music Score and for Best Foreign Language Film. This movie was filmed in 1997 by Roberto Benigni. The story of the movie is about a father's love to his son at the concentration camp. One day, Guido meet a woman who will be his wife, then they fall in love. However, they can't marry because he is a Jewish person. Eventually, they elope, then a boy baby is born. They spend very good days, but suddenly they are committed at the concentration camp by Nazis. His son feel sad and scare because he can't stay with his mother. Therefore, Guido tell him " This is the game. If you cried, you would lose points and if you are good boy, you would get points. Finally, if you got 1000 points, you could go back home by a real tank." It is the start of the life at the concentration camp. This movie makes me sad, but I can feel love of family. Sometimes the film makes me laugh because the director is an actor and comedian. I don't like the point that a lot of people die. However, I think you have to know about this miserable occurrence. Roberto Benigni depicted comical scenes, so maybe you feel time is early.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great humor makes a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was almost 10 years ago that I watched this movie for the first time. Since then it has been one of my favorite movies. It deals with various things like love, family, relationships, and the Holocaust. However, what I love the most of this movie is the 'humor'. I believe it plays a core role making all the stories more radiant and impressive in this movie.This movie, set in late 1930s Italy, is roughly divided into two parts. The first part is focused on love and a happy family. A Jewish guy, Guido (Roberto Benigni) is a man of a brilliant sense of humor and has a talent to make people happy. He happens to meet a beautiful woman, Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) and soon falls in love with and gets married to her. They soon have a lovely son, named Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini). Guido, as a husband and father, always makes his family laugh, so they lead a happy life. The second part of this movie is about a miserable life in a Nazi Concentration Camp. Guido's family are sent to a place where it is extremely difficult to find any hope. However, Guido, a born witty person and devoted father, tries to make his son believe the life of this place just a "hide and seek game" in order not to let him know the devastating reality. Guido's humor reaches its peak when Guido is being dragged to be killed by a German soldier while his son is watching him. He gives his son a wink and walks away pretending he is performing one of the missions of the game not being killed, which makes this movie touching and impressive. This scene shows mixed feelings: love, sorrow, sacrifice, and devotion and these feelings are maximized by Guido's witty wink.Although it could be "a simple story" like the narrator says, it is also a great one because it shows that good humor makes things different and has a power to overcome all difficulties. I was deeply moved by this movie. If you feel life is unfair and not on your side, I strongly recommend you to see this movie and get wisdom from Guido.</fullReview>

Just see Roberto Benigni receive his Oscar as the best male performer 1997...

		<fullReview>This movie has a different treatment which you hardly find in a movie these days, from the starting itself this movie gives a feel of early 80s movies though this came out in 97. The 1st half of the movie has its own type of humor, old European style, sure it is coming from the novel, which is set around World War 2. The movie takes a sharp turn as soon as the couple gets married. In the 2nd half you can feel the contrast, which has been very well done. Sorrow takes place of laughs but innocence stays throughout especially in the character of the kid. The sensible side of a father comes to the front, who earlier in the movie was more of a clown. A father tries to keep his son under an illusion so he does not feel bad about where he is. That kids' experience is a lesson for life, that life can be beautiful no matter what circumstances you are in. Hence a beautiful movie and believing it, your life can also be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful (Vita ? Bella, La )-Filmed by Roberto BeningiA film bagged with 52 major awards including 3 Oscars what's so special in it! That too a Non-Hollywood film??..this curiosity made me choose this film in the middle zone of a sleepless night.As film progress I came to know that how the inferences of the jury become an unanimous one. Let me tell, the story explores the power of laughter to lift the human spirit even in the face of extreme tragedy .No such piece of art has ever before combined laughter and tears of sadness in me before, and that is the miracle of the movie. Thanks to Roberto Beningi(director, main actor and co-writer), who makes me realize that Life is truly Beautiful and that we should be thankful for all that we have through his entirely different and spectacular piece of work . Beningi initially accesses the emotions of his audience through simple comedy and a serious second half. A markable plot in front of me regarding the genocide of Jews before watching this film was the diary of Annie Frank. The story begins in 1939 Italy, where a simple guy who bothers about nothing Jew Guido (Beningi) and his poet friend Ferrucio (Sergio Bini Bustic) have dreams of owning their own bookstore,; . he is continuing the life as a waiter in his Uncle's hotel .Benigni's character is introduced with Dora(Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife) whom he calls "Princess" following some fast pure comedy tricks, including a school inspecting incident in Dora's school and speaks about racial superiority in front of students and teachers. Guido falls hardly in love with Dora; daughter of a wealthy family Though Dora is engaged to a fascist official, the approach and attitude of Guido wins Dora's heart Guido's approach retrieves her from being the wife of that Fascist official. Through a sequence of dramatic incidents Guido marries Dora. All of the action is so neatly contrived that the film essentially ends when it's over, and then begins again after a few years In 1945, which is the second half of the movieA lovely and charming household atmosphere, Yes Guido's house Now Guido and Dora have a young son; 5 year old Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini) who is bright, loved, and doesn't like to take baths. Guido is now running a book shop everything doing well and fine but things are shattered soon. Nazis take Guido, with little Giosue and his old uncle (Giustino Durano) to an unidentified concentration camp... Though Dora was not picked up for deportation, she chooses to be with her family. When the train unloads at a camp, Guido and Joshua are separated from Dora. Even here, Guido tries to hide the truth from his son. But the truth is plain to the audience - you cry, because you know what is really happening and yet smile through your tears at the stressful effort Guido is making to hide his own fears and tears to make his son charmIt is at this camp that Guido wants protect his son from the nightmare of the place, for that he convinces Joshua by telling that they are here to play a game. The game consists of 1,000 points and the winner gets a real military tank. The rules are made up as time goes on. At one point of time Joshua tells that he is feeling hungry and wants to take food, Guido convinces Joshua telling that taking food in this time may cut short our points and fades our aim of winning the military tank. Hunger was nothing in front of Joshua's urge to win the tank. Guido manages to transform Joshua or deal into what seems like a vacation the only one that is fooled is Joshua, not the audience or Guido. The jokes still come, but the laughs are hardDora is in a separate building and spending the days by reminiscing the sweet past things. Guido used to play a song for his wife while doing the servant life in the camp It was like that; music was their ONLY language then.Guido is a man just trying to cope--to survive, and to protect the life of his son. He has a huge heart, and one not easily crushed by the cruelty around him. The ending part will surly wet your eyes the smile he offered to his son that is quite haunting for some days after watching this film while he got captured by the Nazi officer and Guido knew that he is going to be killed?.. Second world war got ended and the prisoners got free from the camps the very next day to the death of Guido. At last Joshua finds his mother Dora and the film is concluded with the narration of Joshua that "this is the sacrifice my father made and this is my gift(mother) to home" Roberto Beningi has taken pure horror and turned it into a love story between a man and a woman, between a father and his son. As an actor, Beningi manages with his wise and simple performance to make us laugh in tragic situations, If you saw this movie then you came to know why he holds the best actor award of 1998 It's a demonstration of the power of cinema, it's art just like, dreams without limitations... It's a motion picture about love, not a documentary about the Nazis... It delivers a powerful message that despite everything?life is truly beautifulOnly nice and beautiful cinema...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful is far too weak a word to describe this monumentally lovely film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guido (Roberto Benigni) lives in pre-World War II Italy. A poor man from the country, he and a friend are going to a metropolitan area to improve their financial situation. On the way to the city, Guido catches a beautiful maiden, Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) when she falls from the second floor of a barn, due to rampaging bees. Each of them looks at the other fondly. Once in town, Guido gets a job as a waiter but, on the way to the restaurant, he loses control of his bike and, once again, smacks into Dora and ends up with his arms around her. This time, he has the courage to ask her a few questions. She is a teacher for the community and, alas, she is engaged. Yet, Guido is not deterred. He arranges to meet Dora at the opera and "borrows" a car to take her for a ride. Dora falls hard for Guido but her parents have other plans. Nevertheless, Guido secures her hand in marriage. Flash forward several years. Now, the much-in-love couple run a bookstore and have a young son, Joshua, adding to their great happiness. But, the world is in turmoil, with the rise of Hitler and Mussolini. Since Guido is Jewish, he is eventually captured, with Joshua, and sent to a concentration camp, with gentile Dora voluntarily going along to support her husband and son. Knowing that his son is about to witness and endure unspeakable horror, Guido tells the little boy that they are entering a contest. Whoever can "play the camp game" correctly will win a tank. But, in truth, how will the trio survive this situation? Dear viewer, beautiful is far too weak a word to describe this lovely, lovely film. The first half is extremely funny and light, with the Oscar-winning Benigni giving one of the all-time great comedic performances for the screen. Just watch him inpersonate a health inspector at Dora's school or convince a man to order a dinner already rejected by another restaurant patron and you will be smiling so wide, your face will almost break in two. Braschi is pretty and talented, too, as the object of Guido's affections and the rest of the cast is absolutely superb, also, from the young boy playing Joshua to the Nazi camp guards. The scenery is likewise lovely, in the first half, while the setting for the second half is an appropriately horrific concentration camp. The costumes, screenplay, direction, production qualities and, especially, the Oscar winning score by Nicola Piovani are beyond reproach. Yes, the story takes a sad and serious turn but, believe it or not, the humor never stops, even in the face of extreme evil. Naturally, the film has received criticism for the tale's implausibilities. But, it is undeserved, as the movie is a far too beautiful and touching piece of fiction to worry about the "what ifs". In summation, if you somehow missed out on a showing of this film, remember "life is beautiful" but, it is also short. Do not hesitate another hour before committing yourself to watching one of the most uplifting, humorous, and indeed, beautiful films ever created.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I perfectly understand why this movie is so beloved, valued and considered a cult movie by its huge legion of fans. But this user in particular has an opinion which is a little different.I don't think that this movie is all that " bag of fried potatoes". I have a big problem with this movie: I absolutely love its first half because its first half is so full of life, joy, happiness, colorful imagination, creativity and slapstick humor, like a fable. Unfortunately, the second half completely ruins this movie for me. The second half is nothing but war, too much concentration on the killing fields. It ends up becoming (another!) Holocaust movie, which turns the movie exhausting for me. Too bad, because this movie had all the potential to be a foreign masterpiece and an extraordinary fable. "Il signore" Roberto Benigni lost the chance of what could have been the movie of his career and the cinema masterpiece of Italy.The first half, like I said, is absolutely hilarious. Humor is its strong point, not only by the genius Roberto Benigni in the role of Guido Orefice, but also by Sergio Bini Bustric as Guido's friend, Ferruccio. They both make this movie and many others. The quotes are also great (such as «Buon giorno, principessa!»), the jokes are a real scream (all of them especially the one with the eggs), etc...I didn't like this as much as most people did, but I agree that this movie is memorable and unforgettable in many ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst I can understand why some people may feel offended by the way the holocaust is portrayed in this film, I feel that they miss the point completely. This is no Schindler's List, it is a story about one man's unending ability to maintain an uplifting and positive outlook on life no matter what. Guido does everything in his power to shield his son from the true horror of what is happening around them, so therefore we (the audience) do not see the full horrors of the Nazi camp either. We see life through Guido's eyes. We see life through his son's eyes. Life is Beautiful no matter what - and that is the point. This is not a factual representation of the atrocities of war, it is a film about hope, about love, about one man's dedication to his family above all else. The fact that it uses the holocaust as a backdrop is not really important, although I can understand why some people see it differently. If you have children, you will understand it straight away. It is without doubt one of the best films I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film and like some of the previous comments cannot understand how people who hate it missed the whole point of it. I know it may at times make the concentration camp seem as though it was easier than it actually was. However, I, having seen the film, and enjoyed it, am under no illusions that the war or the holocaust was fun. I know it was horrific and so do most people. The film's focus was not supposed to be a depiction of the war or it's atrocities, but of how a father coped with the situation and how the strength of his love for his wife and child enabled him to try and make the awful ordeal all the more bearable for them. It is plain and simple a love story, and that is how it should be viewed. Maybe some things would have been impossible, but it is as I said before, a story, and as such should be given the benefit of poetic justice. The humor in the first half is sweet and subtly sets the scene for the events in the second half. While the second half is bittersweet, but still humorous, and gives us hope that love is always a wonderful thing.</fullReview>

If you are going to watch one movie in your whole life, this is it! If you love movies like I do, this is why!I saw this movie when it first opened, my Mother called me and begged me to see this movie immediately. I knew not what is was about. Like a good son, I obeyed my mom. It starts off Benigni wooing his wife to be, Nicoletta Braschi, with all the slapstick of a Chaplin flick. They get married and have the CUTEST little boy, played by Giorgio Cantarini. (Oh That Face!!!) Life is beautiful until those Nazi's come. The movie does a 180 degree turn and your mesmerized for the next 75 minutes. You will roar with laughter and cry like a baby. I never thought I would truly have one favorite movie of all time. Before this movie, I'd say Beckett (with O'Toole and Burton), GodFather, Amadeus, etc. Then this flick comes along.I still can't believe Benigni wrote, directed, and starred in this movie. Unbelievable achievement. He's my hero!And speaking of hero's, all the movies, all the Arnold Schwarzenegger's , Bruce Willis', Stalones, etc etc etc and this little ugly skinny Italian is one of the greatest heroine's in Cinema history!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exceptional Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life is Beautiful" is an immensely emotive film, and I can understand that some people will not be comfortable viewing what may be considered, lighthearted dialogue, set in the context of the holocaust.The film begins with a slapstick comic theme, which I considered slightly overpowering. However, as the film develops, the humour is essential. Steven Spielberg said that he made "Schindlers List" as if it were being viewed through a tiny hole, any larger and it would have been too much for the audience. In my opinion, Benigni uses the humour to a similar effect. However the humour is not the main theme.Love is the main theme. Love of your family, and especially for the fatherly love of a small innocent boy caught up in this terrible tragedy. The compassion I felt for Guido's son was almost overpowering, yet this was contrasted by moments of subtle humour. I would never have thought that I would laugh out load whilst viewing a concentrating camp scene, yet the comedy worked despite my attempts to hold my laughter back. To some, this may appear wrong, yet the humour is very powerful. It shines through the horror to show hope through the innocence and beauty of a young child.Some of the film is implausible, but this should not be a reason to deny its brilliance. It taps into the emotions, especially in the latter stages of the film, which left me emotionally drained. "Life is Beautiful" allows us to appreciate our humanity; I cannot give this film higher praise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely have I ever watched a movie that touched my heart so much... this review might be a spoiler, but I must say this: I sobbed--literally, sobbed, uncontrollably at the end of this movie. It was the most excellent, moving, wonderful film I have ever had the privilege of seeing. Life is Beautiful is beautiful. No doubt about it. It will open your eyes, and make you livid with rage at Hitler and his minions. It will also capture a place in your heart--you will never think of a Holocaust survivor the same again. I have a profound appreciation for those brave souls who lived through that horror--and for their legacy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie moved me to tears I don't write or do message boards but this is the exception.If you want to understand the heights to which love can go. Then watch this movie.I would not credit the Nazi's for any part of this movie.This movie is about Courage, Family &amp; Love.The film takes a little time to get going but be patient it is well worth the wait.Roberto Benigni performance as Guido Orefice is amazing. I wonder in amazement how an individual can see beyond their own distressing plight and do what Guido does, the elaboration &amp; conviction of his game is phenomenal, all so that his only child would place such trust in him &amp; and HIS Game.I have watched this movie 7 times - it still leaves me dumb founded.wow</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a man. Normally never cry. I didn't even cry when my parents divorced. I kept back the tears at deaths and funerals of friends and relatives. But at the end of this movie I cried my eyes out. For me it was all about parental love and the will to protect your children from the evil of adults. Best movie ever made. I realize that many people will find Roberto Begnini extremely annoying, the storyline ridiculous and the filming typically chaotic Italian style, but I don't care. Neither do I understand the comments about it being unethical of doing 'comedy' in a concentration camp. It is not a movie about that. It is about the beauty of unconditional, parental love and therefore everybody must see it. Like I said, the best movie ever, ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A feat as difficult as compiling an experience surrounding the holocaust that is both humorous &amp; uplifting AND dark &amp; terrifying is not one that many artists could accomplish with any degree of success. Benigni, however, perfects it. His comedic talents have long been recognized, but the ability to work them into such a dramatic scenario was doubted by many. Ah, the feeling of proving doubters wrong...The sweet notion of parental love and protection from worldly horrors at an age where innocence is so precious is woven throughout this story of survival and lack thereof during a time when religious &amp; racial brands marked so many for doom. How Benigni manages to bring us through this emotional roller coaster without our minds jumping track is beyond me. Alas, his talents are beyond dissection and should be, instead, celebrated. Watch this film.La Vita e bella is, in fact, bellisima.-Tony in Jimmy Stewart Land (Indiana, PA)</fullReview>

The way that Guido tries to hide the hard cruel facts of war and prison camps for hes son, even up to the very last and when Guido knows he's about to be shot, is.... don't know how to say it, it takes your breath away. A father loving he's son so much that he would go trough all that trouble for him, what else could you want?Sure there a few minor points, some things that aren't completely correct, but who cares.I rated this movie 10, and only because 11 isn't an option.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Italy. Late thirties. Guido Orefice, a Jew, decides to leave the country to make it big in the city. On his way to the city, he meets Dora, an angel litterally fallen from the sky, and immediately falls for her. Once settled in the city, he will meet her again by accident, when he almost runs her down with his bicycle. After the first two fortuitous encounters, Guido will give Lady Luck a nudge and provoke other meetings, until Dora finally falls for him. They will get married and have an only child, Giosué.On the day of Giosué's fifth birthday, the Nazis take Guido and his son to a concentration camp. As they are about to be taken away, Dora, who is not Jewish, demands to be put on the train also.As soon as he realises what is happening, Guido puts on a happy face and invents a game to protect Giosué from the horror of the concentration camp. His goal: keep his son alive and in good spirits while trying to let his wife know that both of them are still alive.I was mesmerized my this movie. It has a flow that is unusual. Standard story-telling tends to put THE pivoting moment of the story during the first quarter of the movie. In Life Is Beautiful, the pivoting moment occurs closer to the halfway mark.There also is a definite before/after feel to the movie. The first half of the movie is very upbeat, lively and comical. The second half is more demure, without being depressing.The performance of the actors is excellent. Roberto Benigni's acting is a bit over the top at times, but he always remains credible. His wife, Nicoletta Braschi, plays Dora and the chemistry between them is palpable. Young Giosué is not as good, but at that age, we can let it slide.I especially enjoyed the role of Dr. Lessing, a person completely obsessed with riddles. A telling moment of the movie shows Dr. Lessing's complete obliviousness to the situation faced by the prisoners in the camp. It is very revealing of the state of mind of members of the dominating force in a war. On a smaller scale, it also shows that we humans tend to focus a bit too much on our own little problems, while ignoring the predicament of countless others less fortunate.Some have said that this movie is an insult to the memory of all the Jews that died in WWII. I wonder why. Is it because there is humour in the movie? It wouldn't be the first time that war-era comedy has been put on the screen (MASH, Hogan's Heroes). Is it because one man is trying to trivialize the situation for his son? I think it's amazing that a father was able to forget about himself completely, in order to keep a smile on his son's face.Is it because the movie is not depressing enough? In most movies about concentration camps that I've seen, there is a heavy emphasis on the plight of the people. The general atmosphere is usually extremely depressing. In "Life Is Beautiful" we are spared the gloominess of it all. Instead, focus is turned to the heroics of the father and the innocence and awe of his young son.This movie touches you because of the love and attachment that is evident between Guido, Dora and Giosué. It touches you because of the improbable explanations Guido can invent, to keep his son in the dark. It touches you because it shows, once again, that no matter what the odds are, if a person really wants to achieve a goal and is ready to face the challenges on his way towards that goal, he or she can always pull through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A humorous, romantic, and passionate film at its best on a grand scale!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few movies that have been made that is not an action flick or a special effects film. Sometimes, filmmakers need to make some descent films that aren't so action-packed or have a bad storyline like a slasher flick. The film is both humorous and sad. The only problem with the film was some of the corny parts of showing the holocaust unrealistically and some of the sets were like a B movie. Otherwise it was a great picture.I really enjoy the character Guido from his unusual taste of humor. I liked the romance between him and the attractive Dora, and the passion he shows by making his own life a sacrifice for his son's. I think the best part in the entire movie was the ending when the son gets the chance to a ride on an army tank, following the embrace of mother and son. I am glad this film won three academy awards, including Best Actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable Performance From a Child, Especially</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 45 minutes of the film was filled with high energy comedy in the European,Italian fashion. Many times it crossed into slapstick humor. But all is taken well,in setting up the main characters for the second part of the movie, and substantiates the way it ended. The movie is not perfect. Roberto Benigni's rapid fire diaglog is annoying at times. Nicoletta Braschi as Roberto's wife wasn't given much to do. Her most effective scene was when she demanded to board the train for Nazi concentration camp to join her husband. Meanwhile, young Giorgio Cantarini as Benigni's son was perfectly adorable and believable. He acted and thought as a young child who loved and obeyed his father would, and was the key figure in the end. Some question remained unanswered. When the friendly Nazi doctor called to give Benigni "very important" message, we were unexpectedly given something else, totally incongruent to the story. Some people would also object to the light-touch handling of the holocaust,but not every movie having the holocaust as background has to be grim and stupefying. Life is Beautiful gave another interpretation of it, and we have to examine this horrific event in different artistic presentations to understand the totality of what happened.S.Q.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite film of all times. It demonstrates the power of love even under the most devastating of circumstances; the lengths to which a parent will go to protect his child from an overwhelming truth and the imagination it takes to carry this off. It is absolutely hilarious in parts and incredibly sad in others. The first half and second half are beautifully balanced. The acting is superb, and the music very evocative, haunting and jaunty as well. After it was over I was silent for a long time just feeling the experience and thinking about what I had just witnessed. It brings home the depth (and breadth) of the holocaust by focusing on its effects on one family. I lost over twenty members of my mother's family including my grandparents. I think this film is a fitting memorial to them</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of having taken the world by storm with this tale of a father who tries to hide the horrors of the holocaust to his son, there is a serious flaw that affects the tone and the overall sensation of the movie to more demanding viewers: after all, is this movie a comedy or a drama? Because Benigni doesn't seem to grasp an overall tone and the structure ends up being erratic, with some great laughs and some serious dramatic moments, and some moments in between that don't allow the viewer to know if they will laugh or not. But don't let my review cast a shadow over this movie, since its idea is genius, and one of those projects only Roberto Benigni would grasp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1999, I had a first date with a boy who had that day seen this movie. Having finally seen it, I'm mortified that I might have expected him to discuss anything else that night. Based on the most recent reviews here, it's obvious that this movie is no less susceptible to the law of diminishing returns as any other. Many expected brilliance and report the film's flaws.At the risk of perpetuating this syndrome, I'll give my honest opinion. I put off watching it until a bottomless Netflix account rendered me defenseless. I reluctantly sat down to watch it, expecting a movie as predictably foreign and bleak (Think Himmel über Berlin, Der (1987)) as a Kevin Costner movie is moralistic and bland.By the end, I was honestly contemplating how lesser filmmakers sleep at night. I'm no expert; I only know what I feel. And how rare it is to be surprised. Vita ? bella, La (1997) will surprise you, with both its brilliant in-jokes and its unparallelled (not a hyperbole) sadness.Jen -- Still Honest-to-God-insusceptible to glurge.

It takes a tragic allusion (for uneducated people, an allusion is something that refrences something the reader, or viewer, should already know) and it uses it for a man to have a purpose. Thats all Guido has in life is purpose, and he loves it. At first, his purpose is his love. at the end, its his son, his child, the one who he will live through for eternity. and he wins. He may die, but still lives in his child. from the start, he did not once care about his own well being, but his childs. From the point where he is caught by the spotlight, and does the "Soldier Walk" in front of his childs sight, he is saying "I've won, My child lives" and the fact that his child has NO IDEA of the horror that is going on, is what makes you explode into tears at the end. If you're going to rip on a movie like this, i have some advice, GET OUT OF YOUR FRIGGIN BASEMENT, MEET SOME REAL PEOPLE, AND UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN SPIRIT...

		<fullReview>This film is a beautiful thing.Okay, perhaps that's cheating. I don't really like responding to people who carp at "Life is Beautiful", mainly because I don't see how they could fail to have the required reactions. How could anyone not find Guido charming? Yes, he's a pathological confabulator, but that's the point. This is the story of someone whose way of life consists of enchanting the world around him with white lies (most of them are white) and manipulative genius. He tries to continue living in the same way as the civilised world around him collapses; arguably, he succeeds, but he ends up paying a heavy price. How could anyone not like this fable?And how could anyone not find both halves of the film - particularly the first, of course - funny? It's the kind of humour where it doesn't matter if you laugh or not; either way, you can still enjoy the wit, and marvel at Guido's folkloric cleverness. And on subsequent viewings it becomes more and more clear how the two halves set each other off perfectly. Toccata and fugue. ...I understand the viewpoint of those who think that Benigni shouldn't have made a comedy about the Holocaust. I can see how Holocaust survivors (and perhaps those close to them) might be genuinely offended. But this doesn't make "Life is Beautiful" a bad film; it simply means, at most, that making it was an impolitic act. I've heard interviews with Holocaust survivors who thought "Schindler's List" was a similarly impolitic act. (And note that "Schindler's List", however good it may be, is clearly inferior as a work of art.) If anything is wrong, it's the act of using the Holocaust as part of the subject matter of ANY work of art. Benigni's particular way of handling the subject is as good as any other, provided he succeeds, which he does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Good as Everyone Says</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea behind LA VITA E BELLA - "Life is Beautiful" - is a good one: when put into a Nazi deathcamp, a father tries to shield his son from the horrors of the reality by telling the boy it's all a game, a competition to play well and win the big prize at the end. But the delivery of the story fails only because Benigni also shields THE AUDIENCE from the horrors of the deathcamp. Perhaps Benigni thought our foreknowledge of the camps would play as a sufficiently horrific canvas on which Benigni can, then, paint his contrasting light story. But it doesn't work that way. Not for this viewer, anyway. The movie needed to play up the contrast of the evil element to allow the sweet story to shine more brightly than it did. While one is grateful that Benigni didn't show more graphic detail, one can't help imagine the movie's increased effectiveness if the scenes in the camp without the boy were more strongly constructed with suspenseful elements of threat, inhumanity, distress and hopelessness. This would have made the optimistic scenes with the boy all the more poignant.Signore Benigni clearly has great vivacity and elan for life, as he has demonstrated at the Oscars ceremony (climbing over the chairs) and in other movies, which I'm sure makes him a great guy to know personally. But his personal joie de vivre seems to have undermined him from showing the full dark contrast needed here. I was more moved by Benigni's Oscar acceptance speech than by this movie for which he won.</fullReview>

From all spectrums of the response scale, the film provokes some deep emotions, pro and con. It reminds me that pretty much all things are relative, and that we do indeed create our own experience of the world. The work or subject remains the same; the human perceptions fluctuate. What may appear to be absolutes, when considered from different perspectives, may turn out to be relatives as well. It's all part of the wonderful, intriguing mystery, and we can revel in its uniqueness. We can also celebrate the gift of diversity, which makes life constantly stimulating.</fullReview>

I happen to believe that if you're going to set a movie in the midst of one of the most terrible parts of history, you want to have something say and to do it very carefully. This movie fails in this, I feel. The message of the movie is very trite: "The human spirit can triumph over any adversity" might be a good summary. Rather than being uplifting, though, I found the implausible caperings of Guido and the credulity of his son to be ghoulish and disturbing in a way I doubt was intended by the filmmakers. I'm afraid I can't go along with the premise that the horror of Auschwitz could be covered up with some clever lies and a silly walk.However, I must stress that the movie is artfully made and contains some memorable scenes. The mountain of corpses in the mist was almost as creepy as Guido's final conversation with his friend, the good Doktor Lessing.La Vite e Bella is certainly worth a look; it is, however, neither profound nor historically valuable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a world post-Holocaust, post-Schindler's List (1993), it takes naked ambition to attempt a film of this vision, let alone naked talent in succeeding in that.In many ways the film is not about, what after all constitutes only half the running time or so, the horror of the holocaust (it leaves that to our schooling). It is rather about the capacity of a man to court and wed his "Princess", to raise their son, and to fill the lives of his loved ones with continual joy, in spite of the evil which oppresses them from without, and even to his death.Terrifyingly sentimental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have much to say about this film. I did not respond to it as others have, but I don't want to criticize it.Instead, I'd like to urge everyone who was moved by this film to rent The Bicycle Thief, an Italian movie from 1948. Although the story is about the hardships of postwar life, the heart of the movie is the relationship between a father and son, and I must say that it is the most powerful and touching of all father-son relationships that I have ever seen on screen. I am not alone in thinking so.So, if you were moved by the father and son in Life is Beautiful, I implore you to give The Bicycle Thief a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never Before Has A Film's Title Summed Up Its Message So Well...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life really is beautiful and so is this magnificent film from Italy's version of Charlie Chaplin, Roberto Benigni. Writer, producer, director, and star (along with Best Actor honors) Roberto has finally crossed over to mainstream America after so many years of making foreign filmgoers laugh. The first half of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is an exercise in lightening-quick humor set during the onset of WWII. There is barely an indication of the horror that is to come. Some subtle hints are dropped here and there. "Guido", played by Benigni, is half-Italian, half-Jewish and is a waiter. A bunch of wonderfully chance meetings between Guido and "Dora" (played by Nicoletta Braschi) are incredibly romantic and well-done. Dora is Guido's PRINCESS and is the light of his suddenly new life.LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL does not step wrong, but if you are looking for complete accuracy regarding the Holocaust, this is not where to look. The sheer elegance and comic magic with which the movie is told leaves the brutal elements of the Holocaust to our imagination. This is not to say there are NO direct references to it. We do see a pile of corpses and tons of screaming Nazis, but we really do not need to see them. Benigni reveals the horrors of the time through his relationship with his son, "Giosue" (played perfectly by young Giorgio Cantarini). Not only does Benigni hide the atrocities from us, but also his son, who thinks it is all a game. What else can you tell a young boy to keep his spirits up?Even during the camp sequences, Benigni is able to present funny things right in the middle of the biggest tragedy of the 20th Century. He mimicks Germans, he relays messages his own way (great scene), and tries to win that tank for his son. It is poignant and hilarious at the same time. Anyone who questions Benigni's performance without first seeing it should watch for the brilliant way he plays his character while NOT in the presence of his son. He just wants to hide it all from him, but when with the other prisoners, he is just as clueless, overworked, and distraught as the rest of them. This is important in pulling this miracle of a picture off. Who would have expected the Holocaust and biting, sometimes satirical humor to blend into a perfect film? The first half alone would've been good enough for me. It is gorgeous-looking and warm. The subtitles will not bother non-foreign film fans (Just have a quick eye). In fact, you could see it without the translation and take away the same feeling in my opinion. Benigni is telling us not to take life for granted and that the ultimate sacrifice may be necessary to keep life beautiful. See this film no matter what.RATING: 10 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film was charming and quite well done. It was entertaining and made me laugh, but was also tender when appropriate. I do have couple of complaints, though. The father's incessant cheerfulness and insistence on sticking to his "it's all a game" approach with his son began to grate on me. I was not convinced that this was a concentration camp: the conditions weren't nearly harsh enough. What disturbed me the most was that what ultimately happens to the father was needless, but seemed included for emotional effect. Overall, what was a very enjoyable movie was muddied for me by the backdrop of a fantasy view of the Holocaust.</fullReview>

To view the holocaust as a comedy even if it were to protect his child from the truth is insulting and disingenious.

		<fullReview>I did not bring any tissues, because I am rarely affected by movie dramas but I could have used a few today. This movie got to me!Yes, it was noisy and a little overwhelming at first, and the subtitles is not something an American viewer is comfortable with.The slapstick of the early part of the film underscores the life loving, light hearted spirit of Guido (the main character) - and almost leads the viewer to perceive the film as merely a light romantic comedy, Italian style. But the black clouds of the Holocaust descend rapidly and the comedy stops dead in its tracks. However, Guido's spirited optimism remains intact.. His desperate and ingenious attempts to shield, no matter the risk, his young son from the horrors surrounding them succeed brilliantly. An risks he takes. The scene where the German guard recites the camp rules to the prisoners is absolutely brilliant, contrasting the reality - a huge, coarse looking guard barking out rules with fantasy - as Guido "translates" rules of the "game". The film is a triumph of love over hate. The tank is ours. We won.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, this all takes place during the reign of the Nazis who imprison these lovable characters. To hide the ugly reality from little Joshua, his father Guido makes the Jewish prison camp out to be a game, thus saving the kid from future therapy costs. For all its flaws in the story department of believability, this film still manages to suck you in, after all it is a fable. I'm sure Fedrico Fellini would have been proud of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film may give you a very wrong impression about history and the human cruelty of a concentration or extermination camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a tragical comedy, a sensitive film with a few brilliant actors, an interesting atmosphere and a story which can touch everyone who sees this movie, even if there are still some more intense movies about the concentration camps and the World Wars.Why did I just give a 5 star vote and not about 8 points? I would like to explain you. I'm a person who is very interested in history, who is studying in history, I'm German and I have already visited a concentration camp and I know people who were implicated in this whole story during the Nazi regime. The life in the concentration camps was like hell or even heavier than this and anyone can imagine how life has been in there. If you walk through the walls of such a camps and take a look at the photos of the piles of skinny bodies and you turn around and realise that you stay on the same ground were the most horrible genocide ever had taken place, you just want to cry or scream or whatever. And I think that this movie doesn't show the reality, gives strangers a very wrong impression of what could have been these concentration camps. It's showing the camps as if there were just a few Jewish guys living in a very small room and doing some forced work under the guidance of some military guys. The film doesn't show that those people were extremely abused, had so much hunger and pain and such a lack of place and medical help that they were all rather dead than alive, that they were treated as you would not even treat the ugliest animal. A child would have never survived this hell and would have never had the chance to believe the positive lies of his father. The movie is a nice story, but historically wrong, not realistic, not sensitive and heavy enough to let its viewers take a look at a situation within a concentration camp. Some people may think after watching that movie that, after all, the situation wasn't that bad in such a camp and that there was still optimism, positive feelings and that a little boy would have survived in such a place. Sadly, this isn't true. And I think it is very critical to show the past circumstences to concerned people who have lived this hell or also to those who doesn't know much about it in such a way that the movie does even if this is for some artistic reasons.That's why I wasn't very happy about this whole movie, its success and its excellent reputation, but rather upset about such an interpretation of history. And though the acting is great and touching, I can't give more than a five stars rating. Believe me, visiting such a camp may touch you way more than this movie... If you'd like to see a movie about the whole situation in a more realistic way, go for "The pianist", that's "hard" stuff...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>many have criticized this movie of its "unbelievability" and "unacceptable" use of humor in telling a tale set in a Holocaust setting.but, as the beginning lets us know...it is a fable. and it is a beautiful one at that.like all good fables, it has the classic characters: the peasant, the poet, the princess, the wise man, the villain, and the child. like all good fables, it is filled with both joy and sadness. Benigni's concept of making a comedy about the Holocaust was a daring and interesting avenue to explore the courage and hope of the inhabitants of the Nazi concentration camps, one not explored in other excellent Holocaust films like Schindler's List or the Pianist.everything about this movie is great: the acting, the storytelling, cinematography, musical score. the first half is such a great setup for the second half, and the ending...makes me cry just to THINK about it.i love movies as literature and entertainment, but this is one of the few films i have ever seen that actually CHANGED my life after i had seen it. it really made me better appreciate the little joys and subtle beauties of life.if you go into this film expecting a dark and stark realistic portrayal of the Holocaust, you'll probably be let down. that's not what it is. it's a fable. go into it with open mind and open heart and let it sweep you away with its magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most overrated Film of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will never understand why this film and the star (Roberto Benigni) were/are so highly praised. This film is mediocre and plain pathetic at what it tried to do. I felt that it was only highly praised because everyone was sooo in love with Benigni and his ridiculous antics! I will never understand how this won any Oscars, or what exactly made this a great film. Now some of my favorite films are those that deal with WWII ("Downfall" for example) and the Holocaust. ("Schindlers List" stomps on this.) I appreciate what was trying to be said about the inhumanity of the Holocaust, and the fathers love for his son in keeping the truth from him. I just felt that it was very repetitive and didn't say or do anything that hasn't been said or done before in film. It is still rated in the Top 100 a decade later so there is obviously those that think this is still an excellent film. I would hope that people would watch it again and see if they still feel that this is really one of the best films of all time. I just can't see how this is rated in the Top 250 when there are so many other better films that are just out of it. Doesn't it make you wonder why we have never heard of this film really since? For that matter have we even heard of Roberto Benigni since? I feel that so many of these ratings are because everyone likes HIM so well, and are therefore biased on their ratings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benigni a delight as Guido</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll always remember Roberto Benigni for the way he climbed over chairs to get to the stage at the Oscars. I couldn't imagine how a film about the Holocaust could include such a clown. But it makes perfect sense now. He was a clown before he and Joshua went to the concentration camp. And after he got there, his only concern was protecting Joshua from the reality. If "Stalag 17" and "Hogan's Heroes" can make fun of German POWs, why not a comedy about concentration camps? "Stalag 17" didn't completely ignore the seriousness of the situation. "M*A*S*H" is THE classic example of making light of something as serious as war in order to cope.Guido was so funny every time he explained the game to Joshua. And when he "translated" from German. Brilliant writing there! Yes, the others knew he was making it up. I could tell from their faces.Even when Joshua heard other children had died, this clever man would not give up. From time to time, Guido was shown facing the seriousness of his situation. Such as when he was ready to give up because he couldn't carry any more anvils. No, if it meant death, he would persevere! And still he showed his comic side, even then. I do wish he hadn't acted like such a clown even in that scene, simply because he wasn't quite convincing as a real person. But he was so entertaining, what did it matter? And he was serious enough when he had to be, when Joshua couldn't see it.Every once in a while the concentration camp scenes took a dark turn. This was necessary, since we shouldn't ignore the tragedy.The ending really affected me, but it wasn't all bad. The sad part was a necessity to show us this wasn't a joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If someone had told me that a genuinely moving story of a Jewish father and son who end up in a German concentration camp could manage to sustain such an artful blend of humor and tragedy, I wouldn't believe them. Then again, think of the popular success Americans have seen on TV in the shape of the enormously successful comedy HOGAN'S HEROES which takes place in a prison camp. Or the bittersweet irony of Billy Wilder's STALAG 17 with its blend of comedy and drama.But what ROBERTO BENIGNI has accomplished here surpasses all expectations on just how extraordinary this sort of material can be when executed with such wit, wisdom and humor and--even more importantly--without offending anyone with such controversial subject matter.The first part of the film is full of abundant humor as it chronicles the romance of the Jewish man and his sweetheart. Midway the tone of the film shifts to a darker element as the man, his wife and the young son are placed in a concentration camp. The husband is so determined that his son will be shielded from the stark realities around them that he pretends it's all a game. Benigni is a man of such irrepressible spirit that it makes the film's ending even more poignant.He deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar in '97 and the film itself was voted Best Foreign Film. The delightful score by Nicola Piovani won still another Oscar.Summing up: A fable, delightfully written and produced with an unforgettable performance by Roberto Benigni. Who can forget his joy on Oscar night when he bounded over the tops of seats to reach the stage and accept his Oscar?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most overrated film I've seen in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS I am not a cynic in the Pauline Kael mode. My main problem with Life Is Beautiful is that for this type of film to work, it must first be believable. For example, even if Anne Frank and her family had avoided capture, her story would have been believable because of the extreme measures that they took to protect themselves. So, too, are the heroics shown in Schindler's List.From everything that I know about the Holocaust, Life is Beautiful is anything but believable. It is so full of holes that I cannot omprehend why it was so well received. To be specific (spoiler warning):* The story begins in 1939. Guido's child, Joshua, would have been born in 1940. He is five years old when the family is taken way by the Germans, making it 1945. By that time, the Allies had liberated Italy and the Germans were long gone.* When they reached the concentration camp, Joshua would have been immediately separated from his father. He would never have made it to the father's barracks.* In "interpreting" the rules for the German soldier--and making a joke out of them, Guido makes his son laugh. The child would have been taken away immediately and Guido probably would have been shot on the spot.* Guido would never have been able to hide his son in the barracks. We are expected to believe that the Germans never inspected them. Give me a break! To make matters worse, whenever someone comes to the door, the child is in plain view. He doesn't hide under the blanket until after the person enters.* Guido attempts to shield his son from reality by making a game out of their imprisonment. There are about 50 men in the barracks. Are we to believe that all of them participated in the ruse? Surely some of them would have talked about the horrors that they had seen or heard about.* The scene where Joshua eats dinner with the German children is preposterous. Are we to believe that the Germans, with their fixation on racial purity, could not tell a dirty Italian Jewish child from their own clean-scrubbed Aryan broods?* The where Guido is captured and prances in front of his son's hiding place like Robert Preston in The Music Man rings totally false. First of all, it would have called attention to the fact that something was going on, and therefore, would have put Joshua at risk. Secondly, anyone acting that nuts in a concentration camp would have been shot on the spot.* I even find the final scene, where Joshua rides away in the tank, hard to take. Here is a small boy who has been kept in hiding for who knows how long. His only food has been whatever his father could sneak into him. The child would have been starved and half-dead. He could never have climbed onto the tank.* Finally, wouldn't the child have been more concerned about finding his father than riding in the tank? Surely he must have heard the gunshots when his father was killed. Yet even when he finds his mother, he expresses no concern about Guido.In my opinion, Life Is Beautiful trivializes the Holocaust, much as Hogan's Heroes trivialized the horrors of the POW camps. There are some horrors in life that cannot be made funny without insulting the memory of the human beings who suffered them. The Holocaust is one such horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly don't know how to feel about Roberto Benigni. Should I dislike or love this lad? I can certainly understand people who find his comic art rather annoying. Personally I didn't like the beginning of "La Vita ? bella" so much. All I could do was moan: "For heaven's sake, no! It's the return of the son of the pink panther!" Truth is that I can never forget the horrible trauma I got when I saw him hitting the last nail into the coffin of the pink panther series by playing Jacques Clouseau's son. But at least Benigni brings very diverse emotions out from me. This is historical: I shed tears at the end of "La Vita ? bella". It was so overwhelmingly touching. Otherwise this would of course make perfect sense but I'm really not a very sentimental guy when it comes to crying - especially on account of a movie. This is actually the first time ever and since I've watched films all of my life I think the moment was somewhat special. I guess that's really all I need to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very humanistic and different approach to the Holocaust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the film was wonderful, although at times it was difficult to sit through. I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry. Most of the times I cringed. Most people were offended by the film's approach to the holocaust. Now that we look back on that time...... it is understandable that we are horrified. But, how did the people really cope at that time? How did they make it through day in and day out. I think that the film vividly shows us the spirit of the human soul. And yes, at times it is our imagination, which includes humor that helps us make it through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"An Italian Jew's quick wit and vivid imagination allow him to devise an elaborate plan to save his small son when the family is forced into a Nazi death camp during World War II." This is the movie in a nutshell, and I wrote it that way precisely as a response to those viewers who apparently found the film either disrespectful or unrealistic. So that you know that I have a clue what I am talking about ... I am a seasoned journalist now writing a book about the Holocaust, and, accordingly, I have read several dozen books and seen several movies on the subject. I saw "Life Is Beautiful" for the first time last night on television and think it is one of the best depictions so far. No, no one will EVER make a film on this subject that is totally realistic, because moviegoers literally would be vomiting and fainting in the aisles if they witnessed ALL the horrors that the prisoners were subjected to. But, even so, some 75,000 people (out of millions) DID make it through, often due to strength of character, love for each other and an unquenchable sense of humor such as Guido had. And,therefore the film was, in a very real sense, realistic, and, so, I recommend it highly for viewers ages 15 and up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains some detailed informationRoberto Benigni definitely grabs attention in the late 1990s Italian film, `La Vita ? bella,' known in English as `Life is Beautiful.' In addition to directing and writing, Benigni is the main star of the film.The film can be said to be composed of two main parts-the first is pure comedy to the point of absurdity, and the second is dead serious with a touch of comedy. At first, the comedy that Benigni uses seems as if he is trying to showcase his own talents. But the comedy is put to good use during the second half of the film as Benigni, who plays Guido Orefice, must use comedy and imagination to protect his son, Joshua, from the horrors of being confined in a Nazi concentration camp. The two parts of the film also highlight two different time periods-the first part takes place in the 1930s, while the second part occurs around 1945. Although hints of anti-Jewish sentiment appear in the first part of the film, the majority of the first part is focused on living life in a spontaneous way. For example, at the very beginning of the film, Guido finds himself in a car without breaks, flying through the countryside until the car goes off the side of the road near a small farm. While at the farm, a lady falls out of the barn on top of him, to which he replies, `What kind of place is this? It's beautiful: Pigeons fly, women fall from the sky! I'm moving here!' During the rest of the first half of the movie, Guido keeps running into `Principessa,' the name he gives Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). Many of the `unexpected' meetings between the two are planned by Guido. Some film critics love `Life is Beautiful' while others are disappointed or even offended by the film. Roger Ebert is a good example of a critic who enjoyed the film: '`Life Is Beautiful' is not about Nazis and Fascists, but about the human spirit. It is about rescuing whatever is good and hopeful from the wreckage of dreams. About hope for the future. About the necessary human conviction, or delusion, that things will be better for our children than they are right now.' I give this movie a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roberto plays a very, very nice guy. He speaks lots of supposed-to-be-funny lines, unfortunately he's the only who laughs. Roberto marries a very, very nice girl whom he adores like a princess, then they have a very, very nice boy. This Jewish family is perfect.The tearjerker formula is to throw the happy family from heaven to hell, so they're sent to Nazi's concentration camp naturally. The very nice daddy lies to his very nice son that this is only a contest game. Upon seeing those miserable prisoners wearing dirty clothes, this bright boy is still idiotic enough to believe daddy's words. The actor-director's trick is that no one in the background is allowed to say a word except himself, so the boy wouldn't hear any complaint from those poor Jewish.Everyday Roberto and other prisoners are sent to work, he simply hides the kid in their bedroom where there's no food, water, or toilet. I suppose there's no need to explain how the kid can survive to the viewer either.Though the depiction of concentration camp, built purely from Roberto's mind, is quite laughable, he claimed the movie is a fantasy about "power of imagination." Ironically, it ends with a voice-over saying, "This is my true story."The simple-minded movie is covered up by its beautiful score and fools millions of audiences, including members of Academy Award who use to think a foreign language film is definitely a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sub-Chaplin farce that Le Pen would enjoy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roberto Benigni was enjoyable in two Jim Jarmusch films, 'Down by Law' (1985) &amp; 'Night on Earth' (1991); his wife, Nicoletta Braschi was great in 'Mystery Train' (1987)- which was a massive influence on 'Pulp Fiction' (1994).This film, as with the more MOR of what people deem arthouse ('Cinema Paradiso', 'Il Postino', 'Manon des Sources'), attracted awards and acclaim. Er...did I miss something?*SPOILERS* The first half is a poor blend of sub-Chaplin farce shot in the style of 'Il Postino': all lush colours &amp; the agrarian dream that Himmler sold the German masses. We are meant to see how idyllic life was before the nasty facsists came in and started painted anti-Jewish slogans on horses (?). Perhaps the uneducated viewers ought to read Primo Levi's 'The Periodic Table', or watch 'Christ Stopped at Eboli', or, if they want to capture the psychopathology of fascism- watch Pasolini's 'Salo'. With fascism always going through rises in popularity- see Mussolini's daughter, Le Pen or the BNP targeting the ignorant underclass- anyone dealing with it as a theme should be clear about its negative qualities. We should see the causes- not poor sight gags &amp; hammy acting.The second half of the film is worse- many critics wondered if Benigni was trying to make a joke out of the Holocaust. Was he trying to prove the maxim from Woody Allen's 'Crimes &amp; Misdeameanours': "tragedy plus time equals comedy"?. Because the Holocaust is probably the one thing that this could never apply to. In fact, to deal with a depiction of the Holocaust directly- to portray a Concentration Camp- is impossible. The illusion of cinema cannot relate the actualities of the horror. So, 'The Truce' was a failure- while 'Schindler's List' is more offensive than this film: being made to get that elusive Oscar from a pseudo-guilty jury awarding the Holocaust, not the film, in a manner most offensive. 'Life is Beautiful' has risible scenes of lager-occupants passing anvils to each other &amp; a series of fun games in the realm of the final solution. Holocaust-deniers would love this...Benigni comes across a pile of bodies, prior to a sub-Allo Allo scene involving a searchlight. This simply does not work- a sole serious scene in a poor comedy does not translate the depth of horror. This is cheap, in the manner that 'The Night Porter' is- do Italians not comprehend what Nazi-ism was? (I have read apolegetic letters in British papers stating that Fascism wasn't as bad in Italy as it was in Germany- because being deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau &amp; lying shot in a gutter in Salo is an amusing comic jape in the mode of this film?).In Primo Levi's 'If This is a Man?' the deportees are told "there is no why"- a horrifying term that brings the nightmare world of Kafka to life. Benigni's film fails to bring that horror to the viewer; as Spielberg's film made the most offensive scene I have witnessed palatable: the shower that meant death to the majority of deportees was transformed into...a shower. And the problem is viewers 50 years later, watching this as some sort of self-pitying schaudenfraude, unquestionably accepting these kind of films. Mistaking the acts contained with the quality of the film; but there are no fictional images that could capture this. The only films that capture the Holocaust- and should be seen by all and played in schools rather than this film or 'Schindler's List'- are 'Nuit et Brouillard' by Alain Resnais and the epic-'Shoah'.We all know history depicted on the screen is fiction and that elements of history are as tenuous as fiction- but there is no doubt about what the Nazi Concentration Camps did. And this film does not fight the constant spectre of fascism- it merely makes its audience feel a little fake empathetic guilt before turning the film off or leaving the cinema to enjoy the freedom they enjoy.This is one of the worst films ever made 0/10.</fullReview>

Beningni's character destroys his best friend's car and his beloved uncle's business - this is nasty and not cute, Roberto. Finally there's a backlash against Benigni in the Italian press. Grow up, Roberto, they say. I was horrified at his preposterous behaviour on American talk shows - people bought this cute schtick? This was an ambitious, calculating, cynical comedian groping for an Oscar on the coat tails of the Holocaust. There's no business like Shoah business. As for the film?

Even though it is rather controversial, the movie's plot, acting and screenplay are just too brilliant to ignore. It all starts as a pretty lame comedy, but then in the second half it turns into a moving and touching story with some truly brilliant moments. I don't consider this a comedy (the first hour really got me wondering what the fuss was all about), it was much more an emotional movie. There's one scene that kinda sums it all up and makes me lump just thinking of it. To all none Italian people who are not used to reading subtitles: don't let them scare you off. After a while you won't even notice you're reading them. You may kinda fall asleep during the first half, but you'll be wide awake watching the second half.Over here (The Netherlands) when a movie ends everyone stands up instantly and sprints to the exit of the theater.

To drain all but the slightest amount of discomfort from the nightmare that was the Holocaust in order to use it as a setting for uninspired and unoriginal slapstick is almost offensive. Had this been an American movie with Jim Carrey or Jerry Lewis, the outcry would have been severe. Yet accolades are being showered on an otherwise empty film, which neither evokes bittersweet irony in the face of unspeakable horror (which would have made fore a more appropriate and compelling film) nor childlike whimsy (as some have suggested the film represents). Perhaps the greatest testament to Benigni's brilliance as a filmmaker is that I left the theatre merely bored and not appalled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Would "Life is beautiful" have had so good reviews, had there not been part of the movie about the holocaust ? I really doubt it. This movie is only a dull comedy that lacks brilliance and is based on rather silly gags. It is also flatly shot. But the real bad part on that movie is that by showing the concentration camnps as it does, it lets the audience think that the Holocaust was not so terrible after all. Begnini shows the concentration camp as if it was the Warsaw ghetto : people are working hard and some die in the process, but the very idea that there were some gas chambers working in order to annihilate millions of people is hardly evoked. The very fact that the little Giuseppe survives with so little trouble is hardly acceptable when one knows how mercilessly children were exterminated. Of course, some passages of the movie are full of emotion, but they are only minutes in a two-hour movie for which Begnini lacks the necessary tact to use such a subject. If I do believe that his intentions were pure and noble when he shot this movie, I hardly appreciate the intense marketing surrounding it. It does lack respect towards such a grave and important matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is a simple story... but not an easy one to tell."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the last 60 years, films regarding the Holocaust have had to tread carefully. It is truly a horrifying and disheartening period in Mankind's history, and, quite evidently, little humour could possibly be derived from it. Perhaps the last mainstream film to attempt such a thing was Charles Chaplin's classic 1940 satire, 'The Great Dictator,' which memorably spoofed Hitler and his Nazi regime, and poignantly highlighted the plight of the Jews. Indeed, Chaplin's film was released approximately a year before the true Nazi death camps, such as Auschwitz, were constructed, and Chaplin would later state in his 1964 autobiography, had he known the actual extent of the Holocaust's horrors, he could never have made such jokes about the Nazi regime.It would take until 1997 that a film dared to try again. Popular Italian comedy entertainer Roberto Benigni co-wrote, directed and starred in 'La Vita ? bella' (Life is Beautiful), a truly heartwarming wartime tale of love, family, courage and imagination. The film made an international star out of Benigni, with 'La Vita ? bella' winning three 1999 Academy Awards (including Best Actor and Best Foreign Film), and nominated for a further four (including Best Picture and Best Director). Though I find it difficult to judge a performance in which an actor is not speaking English, there is no denying that Benigni does a terrific job as both actor and director. His surprise Best Actor Oscar win was only the second time a performance completely in Italian had been awarded (after Sophia Loren for "La Ciociara" (1960)).The first half of the film contains not a hint of the war, and acts as the genuinely entertaining story of Guido Orefice's (Benigni) whimsical attempts to romance a beautiful Italian teacher named Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), whom he calls "Princess." Guido's exploits contain a large amount of innocent slapstick, evoking fond memories of Chaplin's antics sixty years earlier, and it is truly a pleasure to watch. We gaze in wonder as he continually meets his "Princess" in the most unexpected of places, whether she falls from the sky and into his arms, he arrives at her school pretending to be an Aryan inspector, or as he serves as a waiter at her engagement ? to a loud and rude bank manager with a certain attraction to eggs.After Guido "rescues" Dora from her unwanted marriage, riding her out of the engagement party atop of a green-painted steed named Robin Hood, we cut to five years later, and the two lovers are now married, with a bright and curious child named Giosué (written Joshua in the English subtitles), delightfully played by the young Giorgio Cantarini, in his screen debut. On the boy's birthday, Guido and Giosué are captured by the Nazis and herded onto a train to be transported to a concentration camp. Not being Jewish, Dora is spared such a fate, but she insists that she be taken also, unwilling to abandon her family.In an effort to protect his young son from the horrors taking place around him, Guido cheerfully pretends that the entire concentration camp set-up is a huge game, with the ultimate prize going to the first team to score 1000 points ? the ultimate prize being a real, fully-working tank. Young Giosué's imagination is captured by such a prospect, and he enthusiastically sets about winning 1st prize, his daily duties largely involving remaining hidden and silent on the top bunk of a set of beds. Meanwhile, Guido spends his days performing gritty slave labour, lugging hefty anvils considerable distances, all the while detailing to Giosué the phenomenal time he had playing hop-scotch and tug-of-war.Whenever Giosué occasionally expresses his disbelief in the authenticity of his father's explanation, Guido is always able to sway him back. "How ridiculous. They were just teasing you!" exclaims he, when Giosué reveals what he had overhead from a sobbing old man. "There are wood ovens, but there are no people ovens. Putting people in ovens creates too much smoke!" The weary, disheartened Jews in the adjoining beds do their very best to perpetuate Guido's glorious façade. In one highly-amusing incident, to put his son's doubts at ease, Guido volunteers to translate a speech from one of the bad-tempered Nazis ? the "rude men who yell" ? despite not speaking a word of German, substituting the actual speech with the stern rules to his supposed game.There's no doubt that 'La Vita ? bella' shields the audience from most of the horrors of the Holocaust ? no deaths are actually shown. Indeed, with the exception of one, no deaths are explicitly implied, with most of the murders lying deep in the subtext, only apparent due to our knowledge of history. The death of Jewish children should have been a heart wrenching moment in the film, but somehow Benigni manages to gloss over it. Giosué comes running to his father during the day, declaring that he refuses to take a shower as he has been told. We immediately recognise that the remainder of the children must now have been led to the gas chambers, but we do not dwell on it. The wider focus of the Holocaust is simply not what this film is about ? it is about a loving father and his desire to protect his family with the most powerful weapon he possesses, his sense of humour and imagination.</fullReview>

The "comedy" acting was both unfunny and irritating, a sort of Italian version of Jim Carey. I do not like this exhibitionistic, overacting style and could not really warm to the main character.2. Having visited Auschwitz, read the books of Primo Levi and many others on the holocaust, I felt that the concentration camp sequences in the latter part of the film totally unrealistic; it looked more like a holiday camp. I believe that the death camps (the ones that had gas chambers) were all in Poland and was not sure where this camp was supposed to be. I became even more confused when an American soldier drove a tank in to liberate the camp (the Polish death camps were liberated by Russians and the only inmates left behind were those who were in the hospital block who were too ill to participate in the death marches).I can not understand why this film is so successful and has had so many awards. The silly "comedy" and the unrealistic concentration camp make this film very disappointing</fullReview>

Anyway, Guido, a guy who spends the entire movie laughing like an ass, tries to make the best of the situation and tells his son a story about winning a tank when he gets a thousand points. Kids believe the darndest things. This is supposed to be heart-warming, even though it just plain isn't. The writing is just never really good enough.This movie doesn't really have much going for it in the first 100 minutes or so, but the ending is nice. It's really touching and all. Okay, the power gets thrown in the dumpster because a dead character doubles as the narrator, but it's still good. The idea behind this film is Oscar-worthy, but the way it's done is often just boring and Guido's joking isn't that amusing to me. Maybe others can see the humor is not shutting up but I don't. So overall, "La Vita e Bella" looks like a missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roberto Benigni is a GENIUS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life is Beautiful" is more than a masterpiece. It is possibly THE most incredibly wonderful movie that exists. Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni) is a Jewish waiter in 1930s Italy. He has managed to hide his ethnic background, although he is fully aware of the anti-Semitism around him (one man has sons named Adolf and Benito). To counter Mussolini's nationalism, he goes to a school to "prove" that the Italians are a superior race: he shows off his bellybutton. After some flings with "principesa" Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), the two of them get married and have a son named Giosue (called Joshua in the subtitles).A few years later, the Nazis are rounding up all the Jews in town, including Guido and Giosue (Dora demands to be taken also). But Guido has the most imaginative plan: he tells Giosue that they are playing a game. In what may be the movie's most surprising scene, they enter a barracks where everyone is wearing those suits that we've seen in footage of concentration camps, and Guido "translates" for the Nazi guard: he announces how they are participating in this game to see who can get the most points, and you lose points for being a crybaby, asking to see your mommy, or asking for food. You are quite literally assuming that he can't pull it off, but he does masterfully.Throughout the whole movie, you keep expecting that he's eventually going to go over the edge, but he never does. "Life is Beautiful" is more than beautiful. Benigni's Oscars for Best Actor and Best Foreign Language Film were probably the most well-deserved Oscars in recent years. If you ask me, the movie should have won Best Picture, and every other possible Oscar. It is a work of pure genius.</fullReview>

The main character's antics, while funny on paper and to those who think that juxtaposed banna peel jokes are God's gift to humor, fail to inspire any emotion other than eyerolling. Simply put, it goes on and on and on. The only worthwhile scene in the film takes place during the time after the child is introduced and before the concentration camp speech begins particuarly with B.'s explanation of the "No Jews and Dog's allowed" scene. But that gag fails as it is stretched way to thin once they're in a camp. The musical score was quite good as well. However, bad acting, a poor script and the constant parading of the "angelic" child makes one wonder why this film generated any awards in the first place let alone Academy acolades.While many defenders of the film have said that those who don't like the film won't like it because one must suspend some sense of reality in order to appreciate the father-son element, they themselves either willingly or unwillingly ignore the atrocious makeup of the film itself. Simply put, the fundamentals of the film reek.</fullReview>

It's silly, manic, zany--all good qualities if we're watching a Mel Brooks film. But there's something distinctly distasteful about a joke built around the drudgery prison camp inmates were forced to undergo. Call me a stick in the mud. Tell me I missed the point of this movie. I've heard it all. However, I didn't miss the point of this movie. Roberto Benigni isn't exactly Ingmar Bergman, and his points aren't all that hard to grasp. And I don't mind the point of the movie. I just hated the execution of it.As for the other two WWII movies released that year, I thought "Saving Private Ryan" stunk too. I know, call me sacriligeous, but there you have it. On the other hand, I thought "The Thin Red Line" was breathtaking--a stunner, pure and simple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think Benigni deserve all the praises, or Academy Award. He doesn't act. That kind of act he does in this movie is the only kind of act he knows. Just like when he received the award by standing on the chair and his speech. He is Guido, even outside the movie. Just like Tommy Lee Jones doesn't deserve the award in the Fugitive, because he only acted the only kind of act he knew. Time proves, he (almost) does the same kind of act and character in every movie he is in. Let us all see what time will prove for Benigni...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this film but it didn't touch me the way like it did with most other viewers. I must agree with a comment made earlier by Andrew Campbell that the first half was entertaining but the second half which took place in the concentration camp was a disappointment to me. I can't really tell you why but the whole thing seemed a little ridiculous to me. I'm not saying it's a bad film. I just think this film is over estimated.Everyone is saying that's it beautiful how the father is trying to protect his child. That the message of this film is so positive and that we can learn from it. I must agree that Benigni's intentions are beautiful but that does not mean that this is one of the better films ever made just because the message is so positive. But it seems that I am one of the few who thinks that way. I found this an average film and give it 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My comments are these: 1. Roberto Benigni (Guido) was so obnoxious that after 10 minutes of his crazed antics I was hoping the statue in the main piazza would topple onto him. 2. It's asking for too much suspension of disbelief to accept that the beautiful Dora would even speak to, much less fall in love with, a pestering boob like Guido. Nowadays she'd be seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) against him in court. Back then, she'd probably have had a beefy brother tell him to buzz off. 3. Many people have condemned "La Vita ? Bella" for its saccharine portrayal of Auschwitz. I have to say that, unlike some of the critics, I think it's OK to experiment with different artistic interpretations of the Holocaust, even comedic ones. But because of the horrific nature of the Holocaust, employing comedy to interpret it is going to be an exceedingly difficult endeavor. In trying to do so, "La Vita ? Bella" fails completely. 4. If you want to see an outstanding Italian movie about fascism and Italian Jews, I highly recommend "The Garden of the Finzi-Contini" ("Il Giardino dei Finzi-Contini"). Now that film is an artistic achievement. 5. "La Vita ? Bella," by contrast, is a dud, and I cannot believe that it won an Academy Award, or that it has garnered so much praise on this site. I suspect that it's just another bad film (along the lines of "Last Tango In Paris" or "Henry &amp; June") that appeals to people who consider themselves highbrow but aren't. I gave it a 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Encino Man was a big Box Office success in North Korea. How was the movie in reality? I guess this just says everyone has a different perception of things...The Pauly Shore mess had the same influence it did on North Koreans that "Life is Beautiful" did on Americans...Who was it that invented the term "Schemas"? This movie was at best fast paced, only mildly amusing and just a little bit interesting. At worst, it was devoid of any laughs, depressing, bleak, grating and somewhat ridiculous. Roberto Benigni stays true to his usual screen personas, Woody Allenish neurosis and "5 words a second" dialogue. (If you want his real great movies, pick "Il Monstro" or any of the Jarmusch flicks) The romance was mundance and predictable, and all too abrubt. (For example, he crashes a wedding, and fifteen seconds latter he is married to the bride and has a two year old kid.)  The atrocities that occured during WWII were horrible, and making a joke (and profit) out of such an event is probably the most sick and twisted thing to ever appear on celluloid. Perhaps it shouldn't be taken too seriously, but do consider the next generations of relatives who had family brutally murdered and exploited during the Communists/Nazi regimes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film with anticipation, and I was disappointed. I can't understand how it could win any Academy Award. It doesn't take a cynic to realise that the scenario is plain ridiculous - it's just not possible for Benigni to exhibit humour with such abandon and yet avoid any serious consequences. Okay, so movies are about suspension of disbelief half the time, but this one is about the Nazis, it's got historical basis. You don't take liberties with that kind of facts and manipulate it any way you want so you can bring out a touching finale.Even if I could have disregarded all that, his antics are silly and over the top. It didn't take a foreign language for me to see that. Maybe it's just me, but I thought this film was pretentious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second half of this disappointing movie ran like a bad episode of Hogan's Heroes. See Hogan make fun of Sgt. Schultz by translating his instructions into some zany nonsense! See that wacky Hogan using the death camp's PA system to send funny messages to his wife - then here him say "oops they're coming" and run away laughing! See Hogan freely move around the camp with complete carte blanche all the while concealing his little Sgt. Labeau even though he's the only kid in the barracks! See the fun-loving Nazi, Colonel Klink, invite Hogan to be a waiter for an important banquet and then get upset when Hogan doesn't know the answer to a riddle, "Hooooggaaaannn!"Ok, so Bob Crane does not have the comedic timing of Roberto Benigni, but the shallowness of the story is the same. What started out as a light, funny, pratfall-laden Benigni comedy turned into a pretentious scattershot bore of a movie. The relationship between Benigni and Joshua was as deep as the Three Stooges episode where Curly performs all sorts of silly antics to get a little baby to stop crying.Really, people, I don't think I'm being too picky here. The acting, aside from Benigni who can be genuinely funny, was awful. The woman who played Benigni's wife delivered her lines as if she was reading cue cards and the little bambino, although very cute, kept looking at his real life mamma or handler or whatever, off camera.Obviously, I do not reccomend this movie, but if you are in the mood for an uplifting, inspirational and funny film with an Italian flavor, by all means go rent Cinema Paradiso instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My girlfriend and I went to see this last night. She thought it was the most moving film she'd seen in years. I was hardly moved at all.Best Actor? A one note performance as far as I could see. Constantly manic, ignoring rather than reacting to what was going on around him. Very few nuances suggesting what his character must have *really* been feeling in the camp. There was only one scene where he managed to do this, and it was well put over. This was where he finally realised that Horst Buchholz was not going to help him. The mask disappeared briefly. Excellent scene.I suppose you have to like Guido in the first place to be moved by him. I thought he was a shallow and selfish jerk. Maybe that's where the film and I parted company. I never cared that much about him because of that.It's seems to me that this film was less about the triumph of the human spirit, and more about extolling the virtues of self-delusion. This runs counter to my philosophy of life (too much of this in the world) and is yet another reason for my dislike of this film.Contrary to what my girlfriend jokingly said of me after she heard my reaction to the film, I *do* have soul &lt;g&gt; and am quite easily moved by a good movie.

Those characters should not have had to use up their lives playing that retarded game. Mental patients belong in asylums, not in power.

Many children of families with limited means grow up thinking that they are first class citizens thanks to protective fathers that sacrifice to give them that impression. But why should dad have to sacrifice so much?It's a silly movie. I guess they are running out of angles to examine the holocaust from. I know eventually this will happen. It has to.The movie itself is a competent offering. I thought the first ten, fifteen minutes were intolerably boring. It becomes more entertaining with the visually stunning party and street scenes.

The film is a comedy, though tragic. Or a tragedy, though comic. God, my head aches! It is an appreciable, though missed, attempt to mix the tragedy of the German WWII lagers, with the comic efforts of a father trying to save his child's ingenuity from the worldly ugliness.

		<fullReview>Which is itself an exaggeration, of course. But I cannot possibly imagine how rabbis and survivors of the Holocaust can recommend this movie to anyone. The first half of the film is so achingly unfunny I turned the tape off. Eventually I tried it again, and discovered that the second half turns into a completely different movie. Auschwitz is portrayed as a particularly grubby holiday camp where no one is beaten, the guards never shoot Benigni as he runs around looking for his little boy; people go to the infirmary and come back; and no one starves. I'd say this film plays into the hands of the revisionists who claim that the Holocaust never happened. The Nazis are indeed 'the mean people who yell a lot' since that's mostly all they do. Run Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR to see a truly brilliant film about life in a Fascist state, and then run SCHINDLER'S LIST to find the best fictional portrayal of the Holocaust. They work together about as well as the two halves of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL do. This is a real disservice to the memory of the people who died in the camps. Roberto Benigni is also one of the least funny people I have seen in film in a very long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(SPOILERS ahead!)"It's not supposed to be realistic! We already know how horrible the Holocaust was."The above is a direct quote from another user comment. I beg to differ (what, so now we're going to show how hilarious and heartwarming it is?). No movie, or the sum of every documentary, reel of footage, essay, book, novel, etc. could possibly convey the horror of the Holocaust.The first half was moderately amusing, but I was moved neither to laughter or tears by any moment (and in retrospect the first half seems to have been calculated to engender goodwill for the second) in the film. I wanted to be affected by it, and fully expected to appreciate it, in no small part because it came highly recommended to me by a very good friend whose taste usually coincides with mine. But I cannot chalk this film up as a mere disappointment.The dramatist who attempts to muck around with the details of the Holocaust fights a particularly uphill battle, given how acquainted we are with it and its magnitude both in numbers and scope. That said, I have no qualms with dramatic license, provided that it is employed consciously and conscientiously. But "Life Is Beautiful" is not only unsuccessful but willfully negligent in these respects. (For starters, during WWII Italian Jews remained in Italy...)Factual errors could be ignored had the film been set in a more surreal or fanciful context, but it isn't; details are handled in a slipshod fashion when they're handled at all. And so I couldn't ignore my incredulity at the 'hiding' of the child, that not a single inmate spoke German, etc. ad nauseam.Many times have I heard the protest "I could never watch 'Schindler's List', I couldn't bear it." And I respect that. But in the next breath, the same person will often be heard singing the praises of this movie, and that to me is disturbing. The portrayal of the camp conditions alone amounts to a sugarcoating of the Holocaust, making it easier for the viewer to watch; perhaps it SHOULD be difficult, don't you think? But not in Benigni's version- his character even dies off-screen. By pulling its punches, the film is neither as sad nor as funny as it wants to be. The 'hope' offered up in "Life Is Beautiful" is really just of the standard Hollywood variety, will and imagination triumphing despite the most dire of circumstances. I don't have a problem with such sentiment, I just want a movie to *earn* it, and like so many popcorn pictures, "Life Is Beautiful" doesn't succeed, despite its unlikely setting. My suspicion is that if the film had originated in Tinseltown, critics would not have been so kind and audiences not nearly so enraptured. You gotta hand it to Benigni, the conceit of the movie is a great ploy and he's got some chutzpah for even attempting it.Could redemption be found in the midst of such atrocities and suffering? I believe so, but the kind suggested in "Life Is Beautiful" is false and fleeting, evaporating as soon as the kid stops fawning over the tank and wonders "Where's dad?" (Some have proposed that this makes the film an absurdist masterpiece, but any irony is far from intended- hence the bland, affirming title, the smiling faces on the posters, and the sunny first half.) A father's sacrificial love makes for a more-than-worthy premise for a film, but it is taken to shallow lengths here.Perhaps this wouldn't be so damaging if Benigni had not decided to co-opt for his movie what is arguably the most despicable and well-documented event in human history. The examination and implications of an event like the Holocaust should never cease, but I don't hold out much hope for our ability to avoid more like it, not if "Life Is Beautiful" and the overall reaction to it is indicative of our ability to prevent such monstrosities just by force of historical memory. How quickly we forget.(There were two things about the movie I liked: the transition in the greenhouse, and the relationship between Guido and his hoped-for, riddling savior.)I am impressed by Mr. Benigni's irrepressible optimism- impressed and annoyed, frankly -but he can't get by on charm this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally, I'm an incredibly easy mark for films that feature heavy doses of sentiment, abiding love, and the like. I can cry at the first gush of bathetic melodrama. This film, though, disappointed me thoroughly.I managed a few tears at the very end, and there were a few scenes that touched me in other ways, but, on balance, I thought the movie drastically short-changed the subject matter. Conditions in the concentration camp there depicted were dismal but essentially benign as compared to the reality; the earlier part of the film was unconvincing, almost slapstick in nature. Much, much better was the treatment in an autobiographical film by Primo Levi that I saw a few months ago...I can't remember its name, but it was about an Italian Jew (Levi) released from a concentration camp at war's end, and his long, winding trip home from Germany to Italy by way of eastern Europe. It was much more real -- much more compelling from beginning to end. "Life is Beautiful" was an original and somewhat startling idea for a film, and perhaps in better hands it could have been as wonderful a story as some people think this film actually was. On balance, though, I think the idea just couldn't work in execution.</fullReview>

While I recognize how well made the film was, I just can't see how you can make a film half comedy and half holocaust. It was meant to make you laugh and then cry, and so it did, so I guess it was a success from that point of view.

He tells The Kid a tall-tale, but there is no perspective chosen at all.

		<fullReview>General views of film expressed herein. No specific plot points are discussed.I respect that Mr. Benigni got his film made the way that he wanted. A true auteur piece in having secured financing for this film that he wrote, directed and stared in. Of course, that doesn't make it a good film. Frankly, I have little respect for LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and all the attention that it received. The only entertaining thing to come out of this film for me was Ray Romano (I think) on SNL doing a take off of Roberto Benigni at the Academy Awards. I think that he accurately portrayed him as the annoying starved for attention court jester that he is.If I were Nicoletta Braschi's Dora in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL I would have had Roberto Benigni's Guido arrested and a restraining order placed against him early on in the story. His character goes on the top of my list of bothersome people portraying even more irritating characters. It is mind-boggling that American audiences embraced this actor that they had so clearly rejected five years prior in THE SON OF THE PINK PANTHER that featured Benigni as the same yuck-it-up persona (albeit with a French accent).A great Italian film with a lovable child character (that also plays very well to American audiences) is CINEMA PARADISIO. SCHELIEDLER'S LIST is a "wholly unforgettable" movie about the "triumph of the human spirit in the wake of the Holocaust." A real life story of a war torn family is the incredible and ironic EUROPA, EUROPA (HITLERJUNGE SALOMON). It's the story of a Jewish boy separated from his family and taken in by Germans only to become a Nazi youth. Comedy is clearly an element that CAN be included in stories of human drama; the 1962 Czech film THE SHOP ON MAIN STREET (OBCHOD NA KORZE) is a thoughtful film that succeeds in every way that Benigni's LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL fails. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is along the lines of TV's Hogan's Heroes but much less entertaining.If you ever had any doubts about what went on in Nazi Concentration Camps, the French documentary NIGHT AND FOG (NUIT ET BROUILLARD) will shock you back to reality. The images of dead humans stockpiled and bulldozed into a ditches should give you something to think about after you get past the sight of human skin hides being used for Nazi lampshades. Whoever said reality is much scary than fiction wasn't kidding. This infamous film from 1955 shot on the site of Auschwitz is only 30 minutes long, but it is the LONGEST half hour of film you will ever see. Those who want to rewrite or white wash Holocaust history are clearly deluded in the face of reality.While the financial success of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL did NOT spawn a rush a Holocaust inspired comedies, there was at least one film that must have been helped by its success. JAKOB THE LIAR is a Robin Williams vanity piece; an Americanized remake of the Academy Award nominated East German film and well regarded book of the same title. It is a film that ultimately fails in the same way LIFE does with the caveat that Williams' performance is surprisingly restrained.The success of LIFE did get Benigni the backing he needed to make his next tour de force, a live action version of PINOCCHIO. The film turned out to be Italy's most expensive film ever made but was a major flop in the US. Benigni's popularity has, for the most part, since faded out of the American consciousness.</fullReview>

Sure, I would not like to be a Holocaust survivor and to be forced to watch this movie, because I would be probably deeply offended.Personally I was hurt by the extreme superficiality and by the several nonsenses which create really unbelievable situations. In the movie the tragedy is deliberately turned into a tale, from a father to a son, for the psychic survival of the child. But the fiction of the "game" must be confined to the child eyes, and not extended to the whole scenario of the camp. In this way, the show is irritating. From a mere artistic point of view, the movie is not very well directed and acted. Ideas are "old", gags on Nazis, on their way to speak and march, are boring and annoying. Once again, Nazis are shown mostly as stupid and their behaviour arouses mirth. Tragically, they were not !The great success of the movie in U.S. is amazing. I only hope that young people, facing for the first time this page of our History, will prefer to read books and watch documentaries or, if they like modern movies, Spielberg's "Schindler's List".P.S. Please, do not compare with Chaplin's "The great Dictator" (1940) ... that was conceived and produced DURING the WWII and not 57 years after!</fullReview>

But it is not.And don't forget "Captain Corelli's Mandolin." which is about Italians during the war but takes place in Greece and is apparently a true story.High ratings for all of the above ? but alas not "Life is Beautiful." It's a sad story but the whole thing feels like a stage set which it is. Especially the prison camp which is too small and clean to be what it represents.If you want to see a dark comedy about Nazis watch "King of Hearts" again. At least it is funny.Or, if you want to get the message watch "Captain Corelli's Mandolin." After all, this is not a stage play; it is cinema, in a world where "Avatar" will win Academy Awards this year.This movie also has all the hallmarks of a soap opera.Who dies and who lives and why "and guess who shows up at the end" is one for the classic soaps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Holocaust trivialized into a self centered flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again Mick LaSalle, movie critic for the San Francisco Chronicle hits it on the head. Mick is one of the few, non follow the leader, mainstream movie reviewers.To me, the movie crossed the line into Hogan's Heroes territory. I felt the movie trivialized the Holocaust. The "hero" makes the great self sacrifice at the end but life was too easy in this movie.I didn't find the humor to be uplifting or awe inspiring ie: Chaplin and/or Keaton.And, of course, the world media went ga ga again. Roger Ebert stating that if you didn't like the movie then you were probably a right wing fanatic.Oh well, it's now 10 years later, is this picture still a classic?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Overrated Film of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this "thing" (it doesn't deserve to be called a film) when it was released and I was absolutely dumbstruck at the favorable reaction it received; I continued to be amazed when it actually was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, and actually won Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actor for Benigni.This movie sounds only wrong notes from beginning to end. Perhaps the Holocaust has become too far removed in history to allow modern audiences (especially American ones) to realize that it has been wildly mythologized and horribly distorted in this trash.Those who "just loved" this movie -- as well as the members of the Academy who nominated it for Best Picture, etc. -- should talk to some of the quickly disappearing Survivors of the death camps; it will make them realize what a cinematic abortion Benigni has wrought. The "dramatic" moments are laughable, and the "comedic" moments are embarrassingly "cute". Benigni's "acting" (as well as that of his wife Nicoletta Braschi) is totally amateurish too. Those who compare Benigni to Chaplin have probably never seen a Chaplin FILM</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the excellent reviews when this film was first released and saw it for the first time this evening but was extremely disappointed. The second half of the film set in the concentration camp was innovative but absurd. The freedom with which the main characters were allowed to roam around with little or no control or obvious violence from the guards made the whole concept slightly ridiculous. Previous reviewers have correctly stated that this film is not meant to be historically accurate, which it obviously isn't. However to even suggest that the main character could have concealed the true nature of the camp from his son, by "the game" was ridiculous. There was no selection process when the train arrived in the camp which of course would have separated the father and son and presumably ruined any pretence of a story. It was so far separated from any reality I was expecting Disney characters to appear with jelly and custard at any time. Hugely disappointing !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NO, life is not always beautiful (some spoilers ahead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*For me, there is a very obvious dividing point between the two parts of this movie: the scene where Dora comes home with her mother and realises her family has been deported. From then on, from that open door showing a devastated and empty apartment that painfully jerks you back from the fairylike world of comic knights rescuing princesses in puffy pink, nothing can be the same; yet the makers of this movie carry on as though it were. The first part works just fine in its way (that of course depends on whether you like Benigni's style at all or not), although it is pretty inferior to his other films. The second is quite simply awful. Fairytales can be incredibly cruel (and most of them in fact are), and there is nothing a priori wrong with trying to present a concentration camp situation in terms of a fairytale (although I suspect you'd need incredibly good writing and a totally different kind of actor). The problem is, here it was done badly and in a completely wrong way, because they had failed to understand they could not use the SAME fairytale as in the first half. As a result, what we actually get is a Viennese operetta. One feels one is watching `Die Fledermaus', complete with bumbling soldiers and in-and-out-of-the-prison-cell shenanigans.The whole premise - telling the kid it's all a game and acting up to support the lie - that so many found noble and heart-rending, is for me simply beyond stupid and irresponsible. I can almost hear a chorus whining: `Awww. but he's doing it for the kiiid.!' It matters zilch whether he's doing something `for the kid' (filmmakers so often assume that they can simply put a child in the movie, and the audience immediately send their brains on a tropical holiday; sadly, it works); what matters is WHAT he is doing. And what he does here would have killed his son, himself, and many of his comrades (incidentally, it is made so very obvious that they really don't mean anything to him; what are so many lives compared with his own child's dubious emotional comfort? Their survival literally depended on understanding the camp rules, but of course they have to be made unwilling participants in a silly game devised for one child's benefit - and it's not even that - instead. So where is this humanism everyone is gushing about?) within the first few weeks. There are two things he could have done, for different reasons: he could either simply have told his son the truth, and thereby equipped him for at least trying to survive (after all, it's a very smart child, as we learn from the first part - although how a smart child would have gone for months believing Guido's story in that environment is beyond me) and prevented him from unknowingly jeopardizing others; or lied to him to shield him psychologically before inevitable death comes. Perhaps a fatalist would indeed have chosen the second option, but only an idiot would have mistaken it for a survival strategy, and from then on Guido looks more like a real fool than a clown playing one.There are some powerful scenes in there: uncle Eliseo helping up a female guard who has tripped while herding him into the gas chamber; the riddle-obsessed doctor asking Guido for help (although you can see that one coming from miles away), but they are lost in all the incongruous clowning and sentimental schlock - like the inexcusable scene of Guido making a whole idiotic speech to his wife on the camp's loudspeaker system. Even leaving aside the implausibility of his ever getting the chance, the sheer stupidity of the very idea, and the certainty that he and Giosue' would have been killed on the spot for such a transgression (before that, we heard how every child is to be killed, and so Giosue' is hidden, yet now the Nazis find him happily babbling into the microphone and nothing happens?! Are we all supposed to be on the toilet at this point and so not notice?) - what is the purpose of that speech?! Having the oh-so-cute line `Buongiorno, principessa!' and similar inanities that just don't belong there repeated yet again? For the purpose of letting her know they're still alive, one word would have been enough. In the end, even his death somehow manages to seem unreal. Instead of shaken and saddened, I was left rather relieved I did not have to support this selfish and foolish person's annoying presence on the screen anymore."La vita e' bella" contains a lot of superficial "joie de vivre", and doesn't want us to think much, as though encountering unspeakable evil were the same thing as grabbing a quick bite; and this movie is a cinematic equivalent of a pizza fast food chain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nauseating Holocaust Farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually don't take time to make reviews about movies I don't like. But this one managed to infuriate me in such a way that for once, I feel I have to make an exception. Now I don't reject as a principle the idea of a comedy about the Holocaust, but mind you, it is a very sensitive subject, so you have to be really talented in order to afford carrying out such a project. I admit the first part of this flick does get some laughs, but not much more so than some easy entertaining comedy that you watch to relax after a long working day. That's not exactly what you call big art. It would be OK if the movie tried to be a parody of a Fellini movie for example. Roberto Benigni is certainly a gifted slapstick actor, but hardly more profound than Jerry Lewis or Louis de Fun?s. Actually, if I want to laugh my head out, I'd rather watch Mister Bean instead.But sorry, I don't think Benigni can compare to Chaplin, and if you compare this film with "The Great Dictator", sorry again, it falls short. First, "The Great Dictator" was shot in 1940, and as such, it was obviously much more of a dare and of a statement to make a caricature of Hitler while he was still alive. Secondly, Chaplin knew about Yiddish culture, and the portrayal he made of the Jewish quarter for instance, as a parody, had at least some connection to reality. It is pretty obvious, on the other hand, that Mr Benigni doesn't know much about the subject he is dealing with, and did not care to document himself about it. By the way, Guido Orefice does not sound very Jewish, but it could be translated from Italian as "Guy Butthole". No, I'm serious.What is obnoxious from the start is that Benigni seems to be quite self indulgent, naturally convinced that as an accomplished Italian buffoon, he is totally irresistible. He makes a caricatured court to his wife in real life, and it seems to take a few poor jokes and calling her "My Princess" so that she falls into his arms. The point of Mr Benigni seems to be more or less that : I am so funny, I am so genial, that I can take the most horrible and the most taboo subject I can find, and it will infallibly become as funny and genial as I am myself. That's as narcissistic as can be. When does Mr Benigni plan to make a comedy about pedophilia?Now, the second part is really hard to take. The concentration camp looks like some severe prison in Switzerland. There were actually no children in concentration camp barracks because they were GASSED right away, and I wonder how long our irresistible Mr Benigni would have lasted in Auschwitz. Probably the Nazis would have thought he was so funny and genial that they would have him perform his laughable tricks while somebody was hanged...Besides, I think lying to children in order to make them believe that life is a bed of roses is a very dubious philosophy. Children are not as stupid as one would like to think, and they generally feel when they're lied to. Transposed into a political context, lying to people in order to make them believe that "life is beautiful" has already been done many times. Thanks to Mr Berlusconi who started his career by creating a trash-TV empire, the Italian cinema which used to be one of the most productive in the world collapsed in a mere few years. Here is what remains of it. Bravissimo.The final "happy ending", with the kid laughing his head out while he is riding on an American tank with a white star made me so angry I wanted to punch my TV! I don't remember having ever experienced such a feeling before.For those interested in Holocaust comedies, if you can get hold on that, check out "Train de vie". It is not the greatest movie, but since Jewish people took part in it, it is already much funnier, much more realistic, and much more respectful. As a long time movie lover, I am genuinely appalled beyond words by the success and recognition Benigni's despicable flick managed to achieve. I don't even want to give this movie a rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benigni attempts to pull the wool over our eyes. This is a dishonest, despicable film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Widely hailed by the media and culture vultures alike, Life is Beautiful fluffs out its feathers as 'the first ever Holocaust comedy'. "A Holocaust comedy?", squawked the masses, "We'd better see that!". What's more, it's 'foreign', as in non-American, very much de rigueur in Hollywood circles. But the fact that a film detailing, humorously, with the 20th Century's greatest tragedy won the Oscar accolades it did is enough evidence of its true worth.It starts simply enough, with Benigni as the humble paesan who marries, has a kid, enjoys the good life in pre-war Italy. Soon, the evil Nazis have moved in, and his family is whisked off to a concentration camp where prisoners run around freely and no-one loses weight. Our hero attempts to protect his little boys from the horrors by creating an elaborate trick: telling the little tyke that it is all part of a highly imaginative birthday present. Soon, the film falls into a series of wholly implausible events, and we, as an audience, realise the real trick has been played on us. Benigni, too, seems to think the Holocaust was a trick, reflecting Allied guilt and denial after the Liberation. The fact that the movie was so loved suggests a sinister appraisal of its values: a collective sigh of WASP relief that it actually wasn't as bad as they'd been led to believe.The Guardian newspaper from Manchester &amp; London called it 'fundamentally mendacious' and as such was the only newspaper not fooled by Benigni's three card trick. The writer/star/director of Johnny Stecchino would do best by sticking to what he does best: making humane, funny, light-hearted films. Life is Beautiful is none of these.The Hebrew word for the Holocaust is "Shoah". Benigni proves, without shame or responsibility that 'there's no business like Shoah business.'A despicable, reprehensible motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am the type of person that stays away from watching previews and reading any form of critique before entering a cinema. The only thing I knew about this film was that Roberto Benigni, Italy's Jerry Lewis, wrote, directed and acted in it. The first half of the film blew me away! It was very funny and life was beautiful! Then out of nowhere Jews are persecuted, people get sent to concentration camps and Mr Benigni becomes annoying. I didn't know who I wanted to slap out first, Him or his cutesy little son who never got dirty inside a supposed harsh and un-human environment of a concentration camp. For that fact, his wife still looked a little too pretty to me with that heavy make-up, which did not resemble any sedimentary cosmetics produced by mother earth.Many historical questions must be raised when dealing with something so historical such as a holocaust. Where was the over-crowding? Why was everyone so clean? Why did everyone look like they ate three square meals a day? Why were the Germans portrayed as if they came from an episode of 'Hogans Hero's'? On and on..If anyone noticed, this film relied on two major sets where at least 80% of action occured. The first half was set around the town square. Then to make an ALLEGORY of the second half, we have the concentration camp square. Forget other smart semiotics such as ANALOGY and METAPHOR'S to answer the cheapness and un-imaginable use of locations question.'Schindlers List' comes to mind as to what this film had wanted to be. Do we have to applaud this film because it is a foreign film (read: 'Art-house cinema') or do we praise the film for dealing with the holocaust issue. I say foreign film-makers make as many bad films, or even more, than the ones that come out of Hollywood. And this life was beautifully stupid!</fullReview>

Anyone who thinks this is even a so-so film should first view the documentary, "Shoah", which through interviews with survivors of camp internment, people who lived near the camps and those who worked in them, makes it abundantly clear that the antics of this Italian buffoon in the film would have at least got him beaten, if not killed. This film totally trivializes history and the unimaginable and unbelievable barbarity these humans suffered at the hands of other humans. This very gifted Italian comedian evidently has the biggest ego and mote in his eye of all time. Didn't he research his story? Charles Chaplin said if he had known about the concentration camps, he wouldn't have made "The Great Dictator". Would that Miramax had the moral insights of Chaplin and shelved Bergnini's monstrous lie of life in a Nazi concentration camp. A horrible dishonor to the millions who suffered and died in these camps and the few survivors, who can barely bring themselves to talk of what happened to them and those with them in these slaughter houses.</fullReview>

The film is really very low quality. If you want to see a quality comedy about the holocaust, try Radu Mihaileanu's (a romanian director) 'Train of Life'('Train de Vie'), which is some million times better(it was written before Benigni's film(and filmed before, I think), and the script was read by Benigni's producer, who should have produced but didn't, and might as well have 'inspired' Benigni, if you see what I mean.

The film trivializes the deaths of 6 million, while letting everyone else breath a little easier for not having to face, even at the big screen's remove, the completely dehumanizing horror that was Hitler's death machine. If you think "Life is Beautiful" is sweet or uplifting, I invite you to watch "The Last Days," the Spielberg-produced documentary of Holocaust survivors, or even to see "Schindler's List" again.

I will not be considerate of you who have not seen the film so read no further if you don't want to know what happens.The movie at best was Ace Ventura meets the Nazis. The reason why? Because the whole world around the spastic lead character seems normal while he does absolutely insane actions. Yet his actions, which would have him killed within a minute of being in the camps, don't get him killed until the very end when he could have actually avoided it. It saddens me to have such soulful performances of the Holocaust victims and such realistic settings wasted on such terrible mess of a lead character. Don't get me wrong, I think one is allowed to bring humor to such tragic times, but the juxtaposition of the realism and silliness was too much here. Tragedy with humor deserves restraint.For those who want to know more about the Holocaust, I would recommend the Pianist or the Maus books or go to Dachau, but don't see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry but I could not get beyond the fact that this was a comedy about the Holocaust. Is the World so screwed up that everything can be commercialised? I find it especially offensive when non-Jews make these comedies. Its hardly like the Italians have anything to be proud of in the way they treated the Jews during the war. If the film was a German comedy about the Holocaust would it have won an Oscar I wonder? I am sorry but making a comedy about the Holocaust or about Cambodia or some other genocide is just not a good idea. Making a slap-stick comedy about such an event is simply tasteless. No surprise it was so popular in the US.Its not that good comedies can't touch on these subjects - Cabaret is not only funny but a musical - and I think its excellent in lots of ways. Most importantly its respectful for those who died when the Nazis took Berlin. Life is Beautiful lacks respect. The fact it comes from a country that was an ally in with Germany in the Holocaust is unforgiveable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown and extremely overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it awfully strange that everyone is embracing a movie that strips the Holocaust of any of its meaning. This movie asks us to laugh at the events transpiring on screen, but not to feel or understand any of the horrors.Benigni would have done his film a lot of good had he given us more of a feeling of how the people's lives were in terror. Then, the message of the transcendence of love and life would have been so much more powerful. Instead, he merely laughs everything off, giving us the feeling that even he's not taking his subject matter too seriously.So, in the end we are left with a movie that trivializes the Holocaust - and people should be ashamed that they think so highly of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despicable fascist propaganda. Benigni's manges to reach the lowest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a disgrace; it tries to hide the collaboration of Italian fascists to the deportation of thousands of Jews and non-Jews to death camps during WWII in Italy. Believe me, Italian fascists were as obnoxiously criminal (and sometimes even more) as their German peers. In this fascist revisionist libel Italian fascists are depicted like harmless comical characters untouched by the crimes against humanity, they and their German associates were responsible for, crimes that live and will live in infamy until the end of times.Death camps according Roberto Benigni were some kind of poorly managed boot-camps in which you could mange to survive by means of being slightly more intelligent than the average prisoner. There's a moment of the movie when Benigni manages to reach the lowest ? an endeavour you had thought not possible after one hour and a half of the previous ordeal ? it is when he, very underhandedly, provides the viewers with a thick mist in order to veil, that is to hide, a pile of corpses of prisoners murdered by the Nazis.Let us suppose, just for the sake of the present argument, that a fascist movie can be funny ? this is arguably a fascist movie ? well there isn't a single funny scene in this poor excuse for a movie, the joke are trite and all of them can be predicted by someone who has seen at least one cheap comedy before.This thing has been unjustly compared to The Great Dictator, which is maybe the worst movie Charlie Chaplin did, but the the comparison is still unfair, The Great Dictator is an overrated sentimental bad movie, but it is not fascist propaganda like Roberto Benigni's.If you want to see an excellent Italian comedy dealing with the same subject try Lina Wermüller's Pasqualino Settebellezze (1975) http://imdb.com/title/tt0075040. You will not forget the sequence in which the great Giancarlo Giannini seduces a two tons whale-sized SS woman officer in order to save his life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not only is it appallingly badly directed and boring; not only is the humor and so-called acting amateurish at best; this film is trying to make some points about the Holocaust that are utter lies!Anyone with even a minimal understanding of the Holocaust would have to first of all discount ANY movie which purports to make the subject into a comedy, of all things. I hated the Chaplin movie, "The Great Dictator," for the same reason.But that's not the only problem here. The distortion of reality presented in this movie is abominable. Concentration camps were not sleepaway camps where you could just hide your kids in safety if you were clever enough. I really don't want to go into the horrific details of what concentration camps were really like; I don't think that is appropriate in this forum.Even if it were possible to keep your child hidden away in a camp, I question the legitimacy of making an obviously murderous regime into a silly game of "points" to win a tank, just to shield your child from the cruel truth. I am sure that any child in a concentration camp (who would have survived, which was virtually impossible) would have been all too aware of what was really happening. I see the hero's attempt at shielding his child as lying, plain and simple.The thinly-veiled insult contained in this movie is: if only all those poor victims of the Holocaust had only had a sense of humor! Then of course many wouldn't have died, and there would have been so much less suffering. I really hope that anyone reading these lines gets my sarcasm here.But the worst thing about this atrocious movie is the way it has rewritten history. The only other people who are doing that on the subject of World War II are neo-Nazis, I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is possibly the most wretched abomination I've ever been forced to endure. Never was I amused, stimulated, impassioned, engrossed, or even interested. Divided into two independent halves (which in and of itself isn't necessarily bad), it proceeds to bore and insult the unfortunate viewer with two seperate stories. The first of these unlikely tales involved a horribly contrived and utterly loathsome tale of a man and a woman falling in love. Basically, he drags her around the city to various locations where he knows something specific will happen, such as a man tossing a set of keys down from a second story window to a locked-out friend, and she falls in love with him. Whoopee. Nothing is done here that hasn't been done a thousand times over in better movies. The second half amazingly and deftly trumps even the first's diabolical drabness by continuing its utter bore-fest, but then contributing what may be the most insulting, degrading, and unholy storyline ever to grace (or in this case, curse) the screen. The filmmakers evidently thought it appropriate and amusing to have a good chuckle at the expense of all of those sustained and killed in Nazi concentration camps, as the one in this film is depicted as more of an expensive resort than a death camp. Of course, there were token scenes that showed a death or two, but never was the horror ever at the focus of the story. (This may have worked if the picture had anything else going for it, such as a storyline, but sadly such amenities are absent from this stinker.) I am shocked at the poorness of this movie, and I walked out asking myself something that years of exposure to the supposed decay of society, American pop culture, had never caused me to wonder: "Is nothing sacred anymore?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is an insult to anyone who has experienced the real holocaust, not this contrived, farcical version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words escape me! Perhaps ludicrous, contrived, insulting come close. There is nothing factual about the depiction of the holocaust in this ridiculous, totally unbelievable mess. Death camps were not nasty places where people toted weights around, got a little dirty but remained shaven, were able to keep their sons not only hidden but alive and well despite a starvation diet, had access to records, phonographs and loud speakers, could basically move about at will and suffer little more than the inconveniences of a run down boarding house. This movie claims the camp where our heroes sojourn is a death camp, (not one of the thousands of concentration camps that were located throughout Nazi occupied territories) complete with gas chambers and ovens. There were only six death camps, all in Poland, and all were dedicated, absolutely dedicated, to the dehumanization unto hideous death of their inmates. Slow agonizing demise from Zyklon B was the easy part; twenty minutes of choking, while clawing at your throat and eyes and it was over. The devastating removal of every vestige of humanity through constant beatings, lack of sleep, lack of food and water, lack of any semblance of medical care, torments that ate away at body and spirit over endless days, was the intolerable part. No one ever spoke to a guard without being shot on the spot. Guido would not have been taken around a bend to be killed, he would have been shot, or beaten to death, or hanged, publically to display for the other prisoners both his impotence and the Nazi's total control over life itself. It is absolutely impossible for a boy to have been hidden for a day much less weeks in a death camp. To depict this living hell as a Stalag full of Schultz's, largely ignoring at least one of the inmates, who gets to clean up and wait tables, with his son, no less, is an insult to every person who has been touched by the real horror of the holocaust. This would have been a great propaganda film for Goebbels to have shown to the Red Cross to show how humane the Nazis really were. If this was meant to work as some laugh-your-way-through-life's-troubles allegory, then a vehicle more appropriate than the greatest genocide ever perpetrated by man against man should have been chosen as the vehicle. As it stands this movie is a travesty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>La vita ? bella sucks. The first half of the movie is mildly interesting and sometimes even funny, but from the moment daddy Guido and son Ferrucio are heading for the concentration camp, director Begnini's hideous master plan takes over. Guido explains to his son that an unforeseen and rather unpleasant truck ride is part of the kid's birthday present. Once they enter the concentration camp, Guido has a lot more of explaining to do. The reason they are here, he tells the bewildered kid, is that a huge game is going on. There are many different ways to score points, and the first contender to reach a thousand points will win the first prize, consisting of a real tank! In order to avoid a one way trip to the gas chamber, Guido orders his son to hide in his bed all day. Now that is real fun! Day after day the kid is running or hiding. All part of the game. Sometimes his father's romantic nature takes over. For instance, he makes an old gramophone blast his favorite love song all over the place, so that his wife in one of the other barracks will know that Guido is still alive and very much in love with her. Happily, at that moment there is obviously not a single German soldier in the camp to shoot this loving soul right through the head. Apart from the whole story being silly and incredible, one may wonder if on the long run it is a wise idea to frame a series of very unpleasant experiences in a kid's life as a game. If he gets out alive - and of course he does - how will he feel later when he discovers that he has witnessed one of the biggest crimes off all time, believing it was all just a game? The answer is: he will feel guilty as hell and, to make things worse, he will think of himself as a particularly stupid and trusting person. If I was a psychiatrist, I would try very hard to have this guy for a client. But Benigni is such a romantic and caring person, that he doesn't seem to realize that sometimes thinking can be a great asset.</fullReview>

Everything in this film is far-fetched and overdone, even without novelty. The scene the protagonist broadcasts to his wife in concentration camp -- It's a crude fake out of the real beautiful scene from The Shawshank Redemption (1994).And this guy, Roberto Benigni, this guy is a clown without a spirit. I've seen several movies he made, each and every one sucks. Somebody says he is "Italian Chaplin". Sorry, he's no par with Chaplin in an way.

		<shortDescription>A lie for the naive and ignorant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only the naive and ignorant will find this film charming. Those who know anything about the Holocaust will see it for what it is--a lie that desecrates the memory of six million dead.Under the Nazis, six million Jews died for no other reason than that they were Jewish. This invests the fact of their Jewishness with transcendent importance. In "Life Is Beautiful," however, Roberto Benigni's character Guido is Jewish only because the film announces that he is. His Jewishness has no other significance; it is not the affirmation of anything; it is a manipulative plot device. Guido's goodness is not attributed to his being Jewish--that is something to be dispensed with quickly, as if it were an embarrassment.And so Benigni ends up treating the Jews very little differently than the Nazis. For one thing, he shamefully misrepresents the reality of the Nazis' Konzentrationlagers. A Jew would have been murdered for any ONE of the acts of defiance that Guido gets away with. Benigni's film turns the real danger and real violence and real death of the Holocaust into something like a Roadrunner cartoon in which Wile E. Coyote never really suffers or dies. But this is a lie: under the Nazis, the Jews suffered and died. They did not get away with carefree acts of defiance.What is more, the mass of Jews in the camp in which Guido and his son are imprisoned are treated as nothing more than the faceless and nameless background to Benigni's disgusting clowning. They are given no more individuation--no more personhood and uniqueness--than they were by the Nazis themselves."Life Is Beautiful" is an obscene exploitation of enormity and sorrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>but this film is not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admitively, I'm not a big fan of Benigni and I don't consider his kind of humour as even remotely funny, but what makes this exercise such a truly unbearable experience is that good old Roberto chooses the Holocaust of all things as a gloomy backdrop to make himself shine all the more.Its always a big risk if the same person directs, writes and plays the lead and to my knowledge only Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles, Vincent Gallo and Woddy Allen can get away with it. But all of them have some kind of self-deprecating approach. A quality that is completely absent with Roberto Benigni. What makes it all the more annoying is, that most of the people fall for it, as was evident in the cinema when I watched the film.So in order to make himself look good he writes a script that places himself in the middle of some very mean and nasty Nazis. Thankfully he doesn't need to bother with characters as everyone knows that the Nazis are are the epitome of evil anyway. But portraying himself as the tireless adversary of the oppressors isn't quite enough for Benigni. In order to hammer it home to the everyone that he is the good guy, he puts himself in charge of a cute little child, that he has to protect from the trauma of concentration camps. Sometimes this is quite easily done. As the two of them wander aimlessly around the grounds, they happen to come across a huge pile of bodies. We haven't realized this at first cause there was some very spooky fog floating around. Protectively Benini shields the boy's eyes from the unappetizing sight while the music reaches a dramatic crescendo. What a nice guy. This might seem like nitpicking to you but as they were apparently deported to a labour camp and not to an extermination camp, they wouldn't have come across such a sight. But any historic accuracy is secondary to Benigni as long as something gives him another opportunity to make out what a emphatic, altruistic and considerate character he is. Its so unsubtly done, it has to insult anyone with a bit of intelligence.I know, coming up with a comedy set in the Third Reich is always a tricky business but Lubitsch and Chaplin have proved that it can be done. Benigni though fails on all fronts. Some scenes are shamelessly nicked from 'the Great Dictator', in another some raw eggs are placed in a hat and you think that this is so corny and predictable and he can't possible have the villain don the hat (ha ha) and yet he does, and even worse, the audience around me behaved as if this was the funniest thing they'd ever seen. Well, if this is your kind of humour you're in for a real treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a solid movie ! Behind its comedy, contains a very sad story !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La vita e Bella, subtly is a movie about "the hard times" of Jewish, packed with semi physical-dialogue comedy. In the first watch, this film sending its form with catchy and vintage style, such as those Cinema Paradiso. Yes, because of its catchy love story and incredible music score, i got easily erupted by sentiment and admiration. Instant 10 star for this potent Italian film.It was directed and casted combinedly by the Italian underrated Roberto benigni. In that year, this film win 3 Oscars for best lead actor, best music, and best foreign film. Sad to hear the critics goes adversely, maybe some people just cant stand and condemn those dark era of Jewish being made fun to. As the technical aspect of movie, this film is just meh. Insipid art direction and severely prosaic. Besides the lead, the cast are reprehensible and the cinematography seems reach paucity level of interest. But when we see from the story and moral impact, i need to confess it is impressive. Two of my favorite scenes are when benigni rolling the red carpet for his lover in the trench of the rain and when benigni hijack prison's microphone to advocate his lover everythings gonna be alright. These scenes incredibly catchy, beautiful, and feels like grandiose, plus with vintage music score seems calming. The ending also one of my top attention. The fact that the ending is gloomy but heroicly made also one of the strongest point of the movie. Benigni seems intrepid to made deviant ending those days. Unhappy, but to unmask the dark side of the history seems expedient. This is what i like from Italian movies, they attend to surpass the proliferation of happy endings. They lease the canvas and fill it with their own trepidation portrayal of realities. Then these realities that possessing the sentiment aspect of their movies not by cheap forced sentiment scenes with people hugging each other supported by unnecessary music score. Italian is vice versa and they are elegant.</fullReview>

Guido is comical and sharp, making the best from each situation he encounters. He falls in love with a girl Dora. Later he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher. Dora is set to be engaged to a rich but arrogant man, a local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many "coincidental" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Finally Dora sees Guido's affection and promise and gives in against her better judgement. He steals her from her engagement party on a horse, humiliating her fiancé and mother. By the year 1939 they are married and have a son, Giosu?. Through the first part, the film depicts the changing political climate in Italy: Guido frequently imitates members of the National Fascist Party, skewering their racist logic and pseudoscientific reasoning (at one point, jumping onto a table to demonstrate his "perfect Aryan bellybutton"). However, the growing Fascist wave is also evident: the horse Guido steals Dora away on has been painted green and covered in antisemitic insults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may like this movie more than I should, as right after I finished watching it, I received my very first partial request from an agent. Even now, as I'm writing this, I'm ecstatic. But even putting all that aside, this is still a fantastic movie.This is the first good Holocaust movie I've seen that both 1) isn't so depressing I feel drained for the rest of the day and 2) is still reverent and respectful and dramatic. It is hard to make a character-driven Holocaust movie, mostly because the enormity of the event takes away from the characters. Spielberg was able to do it with Schindler's List. Benigni does it in a totally different way with Life is Beautiful.The main plot of the movie is centered around a funny Italian Jew waiter who was put into a concentration camp with his son during World War II. His son is only four or five, so he makes up stories about how they are playing a game and how when they get to 1000 points, they'll get a tank. It's cute, it's funny, it's depressing, and it just works. If they had played it hollowly or cynically, it wouldn't have been successful. But they didn't. Benigni- who picks up a well-deserved Oscar for his role, becoming the only person to ever win Best Actor at the Oscars for a performance given in a foreign language- tells his son these things as if they were the absolute and total truth, giving himself to them, wanting to believe them himself. It's a sight to behold.Naturally, there were critics who attacked this movie for not being another grim, miserable, slog of a Holocaust movie. They just have in their minds that movies are supposed to be one way, and if they're not that way, they must be bad. I hate these kind of people. They don't have a right to live, let alone be critics. Honestly, I think it's a bit pompous for an American critic (who is part of a country that was an ocean away from the Holocaust) or even a British critic (who is part of a country that managed to avoid having their citizens butchered in it, though they lost many people in the war effort) to attack the portrayal of the Holocaust from a country whose Jews experienced in quite personally.Either way, it's a completely shallow thought. This movie gets how horrible the Holocaust was. In fact, it gets it a lot more than many other movies set here do. It gets it in a personal, somber, humanistic desperate sense, a sense in which you have to do whatever it takes to stay alive and not wait to die and get your spirit pounded out of you. I can understand why Americans and Brits might not get it, though that's no excuse for the amount of ignorance in the reviews, but it makes perfect sense.The first act of the film- which takes place before the Holocaust- is actually the best in the film. I could watch that and nothing else and be satisfied. Part of me wishes that been stretched out to two hours and made the entire movie. It would have been the funniest, most heartfelt romcom of the 90's. The relationship between our main leads (Guido and Dora) is phenomenal... which is of course why Dora is shrugged off to the side when the Holocaust portion starts in favor of Guido and their son, Joshua. Yes, I know it makes sense from a logistical standpoint, and it's a great story on its own right, but it is jarring.While I love this movie, it does have some pacing problems. The first act seems disconnected from the rest. The transition isn't completely out of the left field, as plot points from the first act are developed in the second and third, but it seems almost like an entirely different team made the first act, or like this is the result of two scripts being mashed together. It's not terrible, but it is sort of distracting. I think a rewrite or two could have been a boon.Anyway, this is still one of the best movies of the nineties, and it broke down a lot of barriers for foreign films. It certainly helped that this is prime Oscar bait (WWII, sacrifice, mildly happy ending, love and loss), but it never once felt like Oscar bait to me. Benigni made this movie solely because it's the movie he wanted to make, and I'm glad it was such a runaway success. It's a brilliant film, and one people will watch over and over again long after dredge like The Pianist has been forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best foreign films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This is my story. This is the sacrifice my father made. This was his gift to me."The film that introduced the world to the charming Italian actor, Roberto Benigni (perhaps not because they saw his actual movie, but for the way he accepted his Oscar for his performance in this film as he leaped through the seats of the actors that were attending the ceremony). This is my favorite foreign film because it manages to balance a wonderful story that begins as a romantic comedy and ends up being about the tragic events that took place during the holocaust. How could Benigni possibly pull something like this off? He's telling a hopeful light hearted story in the midst of a horrific historical event. Using the premise of the love a father has for his child, he manages to turn the terrible ordeal into a childish game in order to protect the innocence of his son. We've never seen a holocaust film quite like this, but it works because of the amazing performance from Benigni and the passion he put into this film. The chemistry between him and his wife, Nicoletta Braschi, and the performance from Giorgio Cantarini playing the cute son end up completely elevating the film and turning a well known horrific story into one of love and hope. There are several scenes that stood out for me in this film. At the beginning one can find several similarities with Chaplin's work in The Great Dictator, especially in the scene where Benigni impersonates a fascist professor explaining to the students why they are the superior race. It is a hilarious scene where Benigni proves his comedic physical talent. The love story is so well developed that it could've worked on its own as a simple romantic comedy, but the film takes a surprising turn during the second half where the main focus becomes the relationship between a father and the sacrifice he makes to protect the innocence of his son. It is a beautiful love letter about hope and in my opinion it handles the material with a lot of sensibility. Another brilliant scene where we see how far the father is willing to go to shield his son is when he offers to translate for a German officer the rules of the concentration camp and he completely makes everything up so his son would believe it is only a competition. It is a hilarious movie that at the same time is extremely touching due to the dark events surrounding the film. Benigni took a huge risk with this story, but he managed to find the perfect balance and turned the film into a masterpiece. The music from Nicola Piovani is one of the best scores I've heard in a film and it definitely sets the tone of the movie. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful is one of the best foreign language feature film I have ever seen. Roberto Benigni has done an amazingly intense work in both direction as well as his role as the lead character Guido. It is a tragic comedy film set during the world war 2,and shows how a father protects his son from the horrors of the Nazi concentration camp , by employing his brilliant imagination to tell his son that they are merely playing a game,with the winner going home in a brand new tank.He makes the best out of each situation he encounters. Every part of this wonderful movie is brilliantly directed, and keeps you captivated( my favorite was the eye winking connection between Guido and his son, Giosué).There is also an instance where Guido asks a man what he thinks of the current political situation,when the man calls out to his kids named Adolf and Benito, thus silencing Guido. This movie shows the value of life for a common man , and how important it is to be happy and keep others happy. Other similar titles I have liked are "the Schindlers list", " the pianist",both of which portray the humanist touch during the Nazi atrocities in WW2, and also "the Shawshank redemption".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful Amalgamation Of Love, Family, Tragedy &amp; Sacrifice!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winner of Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Life Is Beautiful (also known as La vita ? bella) is a sweet, delicate &amp; intimately crafted drama that begins as a mesmerising love story full of heart, laughs &amp; affection, only to later change its course to paint a touching portrait of a father-son relationship with mankind's darkest period set against its backdrop.Set in Italy, the story of Life Is Beautiful concerns Guido; a young, carefree Jewish man who courts n marries the woman he loves &amp; lives happily with his family until Italy is occupied by German forces. With his entire family forcibly deported to a Nazi concentration camp, Guido attempts to make the best use of his wit &amp; imagination to shield his son from the horrors of the Holocaust.Co-written &amp; directed by Roberto Benigni, Life Is Beautiful brims with an irresistible charm from its opening moments, introduces all its characters in a captivating manner, and turns darker as the plot progresses. The two halves of the narrative are entirely different in mood, with first-half serving as a pleasant n hilarious love story while the other half is closer to a survival tale in tone.The screenplay adds ample depth to its characters in the first act &amp; succeeds in making the audience invest their emotions into these characters which makes the next part all the more heartbreaking &amp; difficult to watch. Set pieces are in tone with the depicted timeline, Humour is cleverly infused into the story, Cinematography makes expert use of warm colour tones &amp; handles the camera very efficiently throughout its runtime.Editing lets the story unfold at its own pace &amp; its 116 minutes of runtime is without any dull moments while the soundtrack simply consists of beautiful, elegant &amp; heartwarming tracks that further elevate the whole experience. Coming to the performances, every cast member chips in with vital inputs but it's Roberto Benigni once again who steals the show in the role of Guido, and his confident, charismatic &amp; cheerful work goes a long way in making the film work.The scenes involving Guido &amp; his wife Dora, brilliantly played by Nicoletta Braschi, and then between Guido &amp; his son Giosué are a delight to watch and the chemistry Benigni shares with his co-stars is pure bliss. However, the film tends to get a lot of useless flak for using comedy in a Holocaust-related drama but frankly, it isn't even about Holocaust in the first place, and that part is quite evident if one tries to view it from Guido's perspective &amp; what he really was trying to do.On an overall scale, Life Is Beautiful is a powerful amalgamation of love, family &amp; sacrifice that wonderfully balances its elements of comedy, drama, romance &amp; tragedy to illustrate the great extent a caring father goes to protect his son's innocence, and presents Roberto Benigni in complete control of his craft, both in front n behind the camera. An extremely melancholic &amp; deeply heartfelt cinema that's equally amusing &amp; emotional, Life Is Beautiful is one of the finest gems to come out of Italian cinema, and is highly recommended to every film lover out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, this is for sure one of the most touching films I've ever watched... It is unbelievable how parental love, imagination, humor and childhood innocence are all mixed and presented in this astonishing film. Although, the soundtrack and the music are awesome. It would be a mistake not to mention the great interpretation of Roberto Benigni as well as his son (Giorgio Cantarini) and wife's (Nicoletta Braschi) great interpretation. I totally recommend it to everyone because after all it is an aspiring, hopeful and optimistic film and in my opinion it teaches you to be strong and courageous even when things are going absolutely wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The brilliance of this film is the way it sucks you into the seemingly charmed life of the lead characters, recently married parents of a happy young boy, only to watch their happiness stripped away by WW2. It tears emotions out of you as you watch helplessly along side of them as the war destroys there lives. The performances are so genuine from all the actors, it's no surprise that Roberto Benigni won as an actor and the film won best foreign film! Although it's a depiction of war, it's not quite as hard to watch as some war films as it focuses on the father and son and the unique relationship they have throughout the war itself. I don't want to say to much about the ending other than the way they tied the entire story together in such a sad and yet, uplifting way is a rarity among films. You must watch this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first really Italian movie at the cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie because there was nothing else at the cinema to watch.. What a nice surprise it was! I fell in love with first part and almost cried my eyes out on the second part.. This is one of my all time favorite movies! A must watch for every fan of sad romance and human history.The main character is very authentic and has performed his role as if he really lived in that time and place..The Director and his team have perfectly matched the expectations of the more educated audience but at the same time the kept a good level, that well appeals to the general public looking for a night out at the cinema.Thumbs Up !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Robert Benigni's Classic, Life is Indeed Beautiful, Regardless of Where It is Lived!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his heartrending Holocaust dramedy, Roberto Benigni brilliantly plays Guido, a die-hard romantic in fascist WWII Italy, who falls in love with his idealized incarnation of femininity - Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) - through a series of coincidental and surreptitiously intentional meetings. While Fascist forces grow in power around them, he woos her with magical imagination; so shamelessly sincere in his earthly motivations that at times he seems to levitate while expressing himself. He even rides a horse into her engagement party to rescue her from a loveless union with a hulking fascist bureaucrat, as we witness his romantic honesty transcend every spastic goof he involuntarily makes. In a flash Guido's wish comes true. Guido's marriage to Dora introduces the couple's jovial five- year-old son Joshua (an endearing Giorgio Cantarini) into their 'beautiful life'.But soon the film takes a fearsome turn. Guido, who is Jewish, and his little boy are arrested by the Nazis and the gentile Dora insists on climbing aboard the same train, bound for a concentration camp. From the moment they are arrested, Guido turns his charm and imagination to the desperate task of shielding his son from the truth of their horrific reality. He constructs an elaborate fantasy, convincing the boy that everything is indeed fine and that they are playing a great game, and that all their hardships will earn points that will add up to the ultimate prize ? a real tank. Regardless of how much Joshua comes to doubt his father's idyllic framing of the horrors that surround them, Guido never lets down the pretense. In his constant battle to hold his son's imagination, he seems like a knight defending a castle. Humor is the only tool he has to deflect death, torture and the threat of discovery. And that's how Robert Benigni is able to maintain what would seem an improbable balance: the film wins heartfelt laughs through his gentle buffoonery and quick-witted fibs while never once downplaying the inhumane horror of the concentration camp situation. Each laugh comes with the lingering threat of death, which Benigni vividly yet fairly subtly depicts, brilliantly combining slapstick comedy with nuanced social commentary about the Holocaust. He effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. And he draws from this an unpretentious, enormously likable film that plays with history both seriously and mischievously.But what makes Life is Beautiful memorable is not its laughs or sense of reality, but its huge heart - a simple, timeless, uplifting tale of the indomitability of humanity even in the midst of inhumanity. Life Is Beautiful manages to walk the extremely thin line between humor, fantasy, and tragedy with astounding grace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I felt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The performance of Roberto Benigni has a lovely magic full of emotion, feelings and especially love. This film is one of those movies that make you think for days and make you see things differently, spontaneity and simplicity with which tells a story that is not easy to count makes the movie really touch your heart and make you mourn. The theme of the Second World War and the abuse they endured the Jews have been treated at different times and from many angles but I think the film touches something that had not been seen and is a pure love between a father and his son. From the locker room to the music and reaching the proceedings there is a link that strengthens and enriches the story that message of hope that leaves us. The love that is reflected in the story makes an imaginary world where evil does not exist and life becomes a game where bravery and courage make a man become a hero is created. The mood in difficult times and believe that everything can be better makes the story forms a bubble in which one is protected until the moment the curtain is lowered. I really hope that the world will never forget the suffering that so many families lived and the sacrifices that some men (They are not in the history books ) did to save beings they loved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of humanity .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie name means one thing not other, it states "Life is Beautiful" so it don't mean Jews are beautiful or Hitler is and it's not to sympathize with any faction. Roberto Benigni the writer, director and the lead actor was able to deliver a tale of tragedy and horrible incidents in history by romanticizing the incidents and making a side of comedy in it. He also was able to win the heart of his audience by presenting Guido, who is a young Italian guy ,a bit of a dreamer and adventurer, romantic and really talkative and loquacious. He loved Dora the teacher who was from another social class and started his own fairy tale with her (Like when she ran with him on the supposedly white horse). Then with the part when the Jews were taking to concentration camps, in which he made all the events seem to his son as a part of a big game they play, and this was my favorite thing in the whole movie. He didn't sugar caught the truth, he hid it from his who wasn't supposed to know such facts and incidents were happening at such young age, and by that Benigni kept the smile that was on your face when the film started but without overdoing it. It's a comedy and drama about "people", without any hidden agenda that asks you to take a side or to sympathize with a faction as I said over another, enough reasons to watch the movie are the amazing music, the beautiful sets and and the Italian language it self.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Extraordinarily Beautiful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't believe I've seen a more beautifully crafted movie than Roberto Benigni's "Life Is Beautiful". The entire movie is absolutely filled to the top with hilarious and heart warming moments. The film is wonderfully clever all throughout with moments that will fill you with such joy you may find yourself crying at both the sad and happy parts. If you haven't explored the foreign movie world now is the time to get over that because this beats most of the English movies I've seen. Roberto Benigni who acted and directed it does the most excellent job acting, full of passion, love and happiness which Im sure he directed the film with the same attitude. However the film is a tear jerker so watch out, but what's a couple tears for such an amazing experience. Life Is Beautiful is an amazing amazing film for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing heart-felt film about the Holocaust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I typically don't care much for sub-titled movies. Foreign films to me are slow and about nothing. So I naturally went to see Life is Beautiful with a chip on my shoulder. I wanted to hate it. I wanted it to be just another movie that Hollywood was praising to show that they were an intelligent bunch of people. Oh boy was I in for the surprise of my life. Not only is this film good, I honestly believe that it was the second best film of 98, next to Saving Private Ryan. The mere fact that Shakespeare in Love won best picture over not only Ryan but over this, is a joke. It's actually funny.Benigni did everything in this film. He wrote, produced, directed and probably swept the floors at night. There is that much raw energy in this film. There really is. For someone to have that kind of vision is truly incredible. And not only is the film a terrific cinematic experience because of the importance and seriousness of the subject matter, but it is one of the funnier films I've ever seen. When Roberto is translating the German soldiers insructions to his son so that he isn't scared, it is at that moment that you realize you are under his spell. He's got you and no matter how much sceptisism you may have about the film you know you're witnessing a classic in every sense of the word.I loved this film. Loved everything about it and I am so glad that I got to see it and cheer Benigni at the Oscars. He certainly deserved his best actor award and he should have gotten more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film as a freebie to commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day and I was fully prepared for gruesome upfront coverage of the holocaust. I was somewhat surprised by the actual film. I loved the first 45 minutes, during which Guido is courting Dora, and the juxtaposition of that happiness against the stark reality of the concentration camp was very effective. I really began to feel with the characters, particularly Guido, and I was pleased that the ending wasn't too neatly wrapped up, although I found myself hoping that they would all come through to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie...but....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is sweet and fun and just about the greatest statement about the strength of the human will to live as I can think of. Roberto Begnini is a great guy and a wonderful slapstick comedian...BUT... am I the ONLY person to notice that Begnini's character is OBVIOUSLY an adaptation of the amazing waiter from the novel 'I Served the King of England' by Bohumil Hrabal??! This Czech novel also shares the statement which Begnini's boss refers to him as "a server but not a servant"...If someone can find some acknowledgment of Hrabal's brilliant novel please feel free to drop me a line at the email address provided above... i recommend the movie but the book is completely different in many respects. It is about a great (though somewhat deluded) Czech waiter during World War 2 who winds up marrying and having a child with a Nazi German woman which goes sadly awry. But the overflowing optimism of the main character carries him through any and every ordeal... Most of the similarities pertain to the main character who is a waiter in fantastic restaurants virtually identical to Begnini's character at the beginning of this film. I just wanted to bring this up because people who enjoyed this film would most likely enjoy this book as well which sadly is not given any credit by the filmmaker (to my knowledge...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I won't watch it again, why???? (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew this film was critically acclaimed, but would it have been had the 2nd half not taken place? The first half is funny stuff, and you could just imagine R.Begnini sitting there writing it laughing, then something happens, like he didn't get the toy he wanted in his happy meal, so he changes everything. I know it wasn't like that.I tend not to write a review in IMDB unless I like the film, because who am I to say a film is rubbish, a film will always be liked and hated, no film can please or upset everyone, but I think this is one film that will do a lot to appeal to a lot of people. People looking for laughs will laugh, even the 2nd part is funny, and people looking for a love story will find one, the romance isn't fake like many films, where Miss.x plays love interest not Miss.X. And the film will move people who want to be moved.I felt sad at the end when he dies, but I didn't cry, and I'm bit of a girl, I cry easily. But the last line really hit me hard 'And that's the sacrifice my father made for me', I'm only 18, but this film will really give parents particulary Fathers a big lump in their throat. This is a film that makes me more sad when I think about it, than when I actually watched it.The scene when he is walking in the fog, he comes across something, which o me didn't seem clear on VHS, but the next day I figured it must have been a pile of bodies, and this is what made me feel bad, Even though he'd seen all that misery he kept sane for his son. Had the whole film been like the first half, I could watch it again but...This is a film everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a FAIRY TALE. Really.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the negative reviews of this film are missing the point entirely. This is not a faithful historical recreation; it was not billed as such. It is a fairy tale. Period.Benigni's humor may not appeal to everyone, and of course the film manipulates sentiment in a grand manner, but it is no shameless misappropriation of the historical record. It does not cheapen the horrors of the Holocaust, nor pretend to be documentary.This is a touching and sweet story of love and war, funny and poignant, and holding it to higher standards is silly, not to mention irrelevant. I wonder whether setting this during, say, the Hundred Years' War would have kept everyone's feathers smoothed.The film can be critiqued for many things, but the subject is not one of them. I remember the admonitions of several high-school English teachers: "Don't give a book a bad review just because it's not a different book."I suspect that many viewers were unable to set aside their gag-reflex prejudices, and were not reviewing the film itself at all; they were reviewing the FACT of the film.</fullReview>

I at first didn't like having to read what was being said because it distracted from seeing what was going on but after getting used to it, I'm so glad they didn't dub it. I did not realize how beautiful and captivating the Italian language is. I love the way they express themselves. This movie is very different from a Hollywood made one, but I found the story and characters delightful. Roberto Benigni does talk a lot, but he's very sincere and funny. I agree with the person who said this was not so much a movie about the holocaust as it was about the love this man had for his wife and child and wanting to give them hope in a seemingly hopeless situation. For me, this film has me interested in viewing other foreign films and keeping an open mind about the story they are trying to tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clever Italian Fable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life Is Beautiful is a highly acclaimed Italian fable which has made a star of actor/writer/director Roberto Benigni who has received numerous accolades and even the coveted best actor Academy Award.Having heard of this praise and seeing Roberto's exuberant acceptation of the Academy Award I had to see what all the fuss was about.Roberto Benigni creates a rather interesting film. For the first 30 minutes or so we have a light hearted,Charlie Chaplin esque comedy mixed in with a romantic sub plot.The execution of both the romance and comedy though not annoying or without its charm is rather weak as the comedy is rather simplistic slapstick - none of which is funny or inspired and the romance though quite sweet in some ways is rather corny and quite pat in its execution.But after this rather mediocre start the film takes on a more serious tone as Roberto's character Guido is a Jew and being World War two times he is quickly rounded up by Germans and also taken is his son (Giorgio Cantarini) and though not Jewish his wife (Nicoletta Braschi) insists she must come along and forces her way into a train on its way to a concentration camp.This sets the scene for the rest of the film to be a wonderful experience as Guido tries hard to make the experience for his son tolerable he tells him a clever story,he explains how this is all a game and that the Nazi's are just acting mean because they want to win,he tells him in depth the rules of this game and through the power of imagination and his son's trust Guido is able to some how shelter his son from this horrible experience.Life Is Beautiful is a tremendous fable past the first 30 minutes. It tells a wonderful poignant story with strong and serious undercurrents all told with charming light hearted humour.The film is further highlighted by beautiful performances from Bengini and by Giorgio Cantarni who is unbelievably natural and excellent at conveying emotions for such a young actor. His character's vunerabillity&amp;imaganation is perfectly played out and is a wonderful compliment to Bengini's charming,humorous and touching performance.Overall this is a lovely film which could have been a classic if not for a awful opening half hour but still if you forget the bad start you will be truly enchanted by a touching film whose title is an accurate summation of the film's powerful universal message.3.5/5</fullReview>

The high production values are obvious - the settings, the music, the acting - all speak of a director who is highly skilled and who has a "vision" which he wants to show his audience. Despite his antics during the Oscars, Roberto Benigni comes across as a sensitive and mature actor. His real-life wife, who also plays his "film" wife is poised and heart-warming. The young boy who plays his son is amazingly mature and talented. BUT . . . . . . does the film trivialize the Holocaust?I wonder what families who had loved ones who suffered think of this film??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy which brings us closer to tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can we possibly comprehend the horror of the holocaust? Those who have yet to see La Vita e Bella may well deny the appropriateness of using comedy as a means to this end. The very idea strikes one as tasteless and disrespectful.I can only urge you to watch the film and make your judgement afterwards.The unique quality of this film is that it appears to conform to all the requirements of classic comedy. Its plot is permitted the contrivances which are comedy's hallmark. We do not question the likelihood of this or that happening because our disbelief is willingly suspended. It as if we are entering a pleasant, if rather tiresome, bourgeois romantic farce.But as the film develops, we gradually become uneasy as we notice reality running dangerously parallel to comedy. As Guido hurtles down the streets of the town on his bicycle in Chaplinesque fashion, we notice propaganda posters daubing the walls. We have no time to read them, just notice their presence. These darker undertones have intruded slightly on our merriment before, but from now on they will be ever more intrusive.It is only when the wife returns to her deserted, ransacked home that we are wrenched out of our happy complacency. Through a series of almost imperceptible shifts, we realise that although the comic form of the film is being maintained, we are actually being confronted with a tragedy of almost incomprehensible horror. We realise that Benigni is using comedy to throw the impending tragedy of the story into unbearably sharp relief. The caricature is simply a mask through which we perceive heroism and resourcefulness engendered by love.Inevitably, Benigni's treatment of the holocaust will be compared to Spielberg's. The problem with Schindler's List is that its laudable aim of presenting the reality of the holocaust with chilling accuracy leaves us, the audience, as horrified onlookers. We become voyeurs, the lucky ones whose lives have been untouched by such terror. We look on aghast but we cannot really imagine the experience as our experience. The more sickening the representation of cruelty becomes, the more removed we are from what is being enacted in front of us.Violence in this film is only alluded to. Even the most shocking act of violence we are personally confronted with is masked from our view. We see Guido being frog marched through the camp to certain death. To the very end he maintains his act of convincing his child that reality is make-believe. Even this last summons becomes part of the elaborate game, requiring him to subordinate his own personal anguish and terror in order to protect his child.And then he disappers behind a wall and we hear the shots. Nothing more than that. For a moment, the comic form of the film almost leads us to believe that we will see him poking his head round the corner and giving as a cheeky grin. But there is nothing, just an eerie, unendurable silence, until finally, the executioner comes back into view as he returns to carry on with his duties. It is at this moment Benigni conveys us to us an elemental truth about the holocaust which has hitherto alluded those of us who were untouched by it. For it is here that the film is stripped of any comic artifice. Strangely, though, we witness this incident almost emotionlessly. We cannot believe it has happened. This funny man is a survivor, he always pulls through, it is his function in the film to survive. And suddenly we are exposed to the utterly devastating realisation that he hasn't. The comedy has lulled us into a false sense of security. We have been cheated, and we are truly bereaved.In a sense, the comic form of the film is not dissimilar to the father's treatment of his son. Except that, as adults, we are expected understand Benigni's use of his form, invited to see through the comic charade in a way the child must not. But at the same time, it is his very use of comedy which allows him to hold us back, albeit ever so slightly, from the uncompromising cruelty of the holocaust - until, that is, those shots are fired and we grasp their meaning - not with tears and emotion but almost as something hard and tangible. A man dies with no more ceremony or dignity than we might swat a fly.A distillation of all that is abhorrent in man's inhumanity to man is contained in that silence.The need, however, to make sense of human suffering and loss is satisfied in this film when the child survives his ordeal both emotionally and physically. Of course, the comic form of the film requires a happy ending and that is achieved as soon as the American tank rumbles towards the jubilant boy whose patient, credulous innocence has allowed both him and Guido to win their respective prizes. There is nothing gratuitous here, however, nor in the reunion of mother and child. The happy ending has been bought at an incalculable cost.Of course our emotions are overwhelmed in these closing scenes. If we fail to be moved by the triumph of love over adversity, we must surely acknowledge something lacking in us. Earlier in the film, our tears well up to the strains of the Barcerole directed across the bleak prison courtyard, to the Guido's impromptu broadcast over the PA system, to the sight of a mother choosing to board a train which will take her to the death camps. It matters not that these incidents are unrealistic; in the context of the drama, they ring perfectly true as they symbolise the irrepressible force of love.It is relatively easy to document the horror of the holocaust, quite another to express the truth of it meaningfully. It is, by definition, unspeakable. But whilst words might fail us, Benigni's film helps us feel it. He achieves his aim through art and deliberate artifice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Nazigame" vs "Guido's game"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La vita e bella is a great film and I gave it a nine. After reading several other comments I'd like to add the following:The aspect I liked most in the film is that Guido and his son played this game in the concentration camp.As an Austrian I have learned a lot at school about the history of WW2. Obviously this also included the concentration camps. The existence of these camps - or better the idea of massproduction-killing-farms - had become an accepted fact. For some reason I did not think anymore about how crazy and absurd these concentration camps actually were.When I first saw Guido and his child playing their game in the camp I thought that that was an absurd idea. Only later did I realise that their game was actually a lot less crazy than the reality.I have become aware again how incredible it was what Hitler and lots of helping hands had tried to do. There has never been a more crazy and devilish game invented.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I had expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the theatre fully expecting to dislike this film intensely. First of all, the idea of making a film about someone clowning his way through the holocaust does seem, as many have said, very distasteful. Secondly, I have never found clowns, in general, to be very amusing. However, Benigni is often really funny, and parts of the first part of the film made me laugh quite a bit.The story really is in two parts; the first being a fantasy about how a clown outwits his rival and succeeds in marrying the woman he loves, and the second, another fantasy about how the same clown succeeds in outwitting a band of murderous thugs. I would say the most emotional moment of the film is the one when the American tank enters the camp grounds.So, while I do not think this film is the transcendent masterpiece some say it is, it is, nonetheless, an excellent film.</fullReview>

"the game" there are too many scenes where you don't know which reaction touse, tears or laughter. benigni really has helped makesomething very special. not a lot of money was put into this picture, yet many of thescenes are from a cinematographers viewpoint, stunning to say theleast. i don't want to give anything away from the movie, but there isscene after scene where you cannot but appreciate the time spentand freshness benigni brings to the silver screen.10/10by the way, if you throw enough money and talent at a picture,it doesn't seem too hard to get the academy's nod when it comesto oscar time.

		<fullReview>As with any film of considerable worth, there will be the disparaging throngs of disheartened, traumatised cynics. The film was not intended as a documentary for the survivors of any holocaust, nor as a self-help video for those overwrought with the horrors of the Nazi massacres. If this is not evident to everyone, that is shameful. 'Life is Beautiful' is just a slice of life and absurdity and how one man handled a horrific situation in the face of protecting his son.The film does not purport to say that what the father did was wrong nor right, but it opens the world up to interpretation. There are many who may feel that Concentration Camps must be filmed in one specific "Schindler's List" kind of format. Well, for the close minded and blinder-wearing subscribers of such fare, there is a very saddened life awaiting you all.If the "Holocaust" is too close to your heart, it may be impossible to view the movie in an objective light. "Why isn't it shown in the way I heard about it?" or "Why isn't it filmed the way I remember it?" Well, because you are not Roberto Benigni. You have a different view of how things were, are, and should be. Open your eyes, people, and see another part of life.For those who missed it, the film is translated as "Life IS Beautiful," not "Life WAS Beautiful," nor "Life SHOULD HAVE BEEN Beautiful." The story is about relationships and the struggles that go on in life presently. It may be a metaphor. Maybe World War II is a tough time for people to associate with. Maybe I am just a cold-hearted uncaring person. Maybe Roberto Benigni is as well. I don't think so, but then again, I am subject to my own opinions.Don't be afraid of change. Don't be afraid of difference. Don't be afraid of another perspective. Don't be afraid of life. It's time to stop living in the past. 'Life Is Beautiful,' is a brilliant movie, masterfully written, filmed, acted, and one that is thought-provoking (as evidenced by such disparity in these critiques). It should be enjoyed for what is is and not for what you want it to be. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humour against fascism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main skill that can be credited to "Life is Beautiful" is to be a film that believes that humour can win against authoritarianism. That is something most of intellectuals use to deny. As another Italian, a sociologist, Domenico De Masi, said once, "it is an awful thing that most of intellectuals tend to give importance only to sad and pessimistic analysis." In fact, it seems that people think that humour is not a serious thing. So most of us tend to repeat the same error as before with some artists like Toto or the Marx Brothers. It is about time to understand the political and aesthetical contribution of humour as to increase the best in our lives. In a certain sense, "Life is Beautiful" is near to another film, yet very different on approach and proposals, namely "Architecture of Destruction" the documentary about art in 3rd Reich. It is worth to see this film as a contribution to new approaches not only to the terrible fact of fascism but as well to the aesthetic reception to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is beautiful is really two films. The first part -- the story of a poor bookseller's courtship of a beautiful school teacher set in WWII Italy -- is a delight. The wryly ironic comments on the important contribution of Jewish artists, philosophers, and composers to European culture work well, as do the magical pratfalls of the always charismatic protagonist. Benigni's masterful Chaplinesque performance reveals the stupidity and hollowness of both facism and racism. The second part -- set in a concentration camp -- while it tries to further the satire of the first part -- fails. It is not funny enough to mitigate the grimmness, and it is not grim enough to do justice to history. Still, it is a noble effort and worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A kinder, gentler Holocaust, from your pal Roberto Benigni</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for the first time yesterday -- I had no idea what it was about in advance. I was very surprised to find that it was about the Holocaust. However, compared to what I have read, heard, seen, and learned about the Holocaust, this movie was very disturbing. The premise of this film was basically that "humor" (as defined and provided by Roberto Benigni) is sufficient protection against something as evil as the Holocaust.No fu**ing way.Benigni was raised a Catholic, and while some Italians (among others in German-controlled territory, such as Africans and Romani) were also forced into concentration camps, I have read of no public statements to the effect that Benigni has some sort of personal connection to the Holocaust (other than happening to be born, after the fact, in a country that was formerly an Axis power). Yet Benigni evidently feels qualified to present a film that put out a cinematic message something to the effect of: "Oh, oh, you poor victims of the Holocaust, if only more of you had been able to cling to the time-exalted crafts of HUMOR! and ACTING! as I would have, well, then perhaps more of you would have survived the war and its aftermath in much better shape! I weep for you and your lack of my wisdom! Did you not know? Life-a is-a Beautiful! I wish that I could have been with you back then in order to teach you this wonderful thing!" And what greater love could Benigni have for his (not really) fellow Holocaust victim than to (not really) die while never wavering from his beliefs in HUMOR and ACTING? How (not really) noble -- how (not really) Christlike.And judging from the contemporary responses of Hollywood and its related businesses (such as film critics), such individuals and agencies were tripping over themselves to be complicit in this travesty. Why? Because the same shallow, self-entitled, lazy, bloodless, drug-addicted, Godless, perverted individuals who think that their "craft" deserves greater respect than the work of someone who gives more than he takes from this world, like, say, a farmer (by the way, Benigni's father farmed), know that as long as they applaud such tripe, they are validating their own useless lives and professions.Benigni displayed about as much understanding about the Holocaust as a typical US white would display about the horrors of US enslavement of Africans and its ongoing aftermath.More self-indulgent and self-validating nonsense for the practicers of "the craft", while simultaneously a willfully ignorant yet comforting tale of "the power of one" for the movie-goer.A perfect Hollywood formula, from your bestest buddy and substitute Jesus, Roberto Benigni.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful begins with a nonchalant nod towards its whimsicality, issued by an unknown narrator that the uneasy story about to unfold is anything but acquiescent and virtually an engrossing tragedy. What follows next is a bright and colorful landscape of two Italian-Jewish friends gallivanting through the countryside. It looks like the setting of the fable Pinocchio. It isn't before long that the "once upon a time" setting terminates and relocates into a serious tone. In this juxtaposition, the film triumphs. Guido (played by Roberto Benigni) is an incorrigible optimist, both facetious and clumsy. But he's honest, friendly, and (at times) oblivious to perhaps just how whimsical he is. But he has no complaints and shrugs off bad karma. When it's dark, he'll light a candle. If his bike has a flat, he'll skip to work. If it rains, he dances (point taken). Guido's characterization, gradually built up in the first half of the movie, is pivotal for later illustrating the relationship with his innocent son, Joshua. He's never a man to accept defeat and insists on marrying the beautiful senioria Dora after multiple fortuitous encounters. Their chemistry is affable and the kinetic synergy between the two in the fairy tale frame is hypnotizing. I can't help but admire the film's foreshadow abruptly after the two elope, where Guido steals her away on a horse literally marked for death. But recall, he's not one to let a rainy day ruin his parade. Reality occurs several years later, where Guido, Dora, and his only son Joshua are sequestered into a Jewish Ghetto (a hostile concentration camp riddled with Nazis), and Guido is burdened with the task of explaining to his child that the visceral reality is actually just a fun, elaborate game organized by "bad guys". In some ways one might identify these scenes as a cathartic justice for all of the mishaps Guido caused earlier in act one; alas, Guido continues to make the best of his situation, even in one so extreme as the infamous Holocaust. I began to wonder over halfway through the film if Guido's motives were to ward off reality from his son, or, more poignantly, himself. For Guido was always a character living in a superfluous fantasy. Consider then that the Holocaust is the ultimate test of an optimist's character, and one that is innately passed from father to son. Life is Beautiful is also one of the finest Holocaust films I've seen (among Schindler's List, The Pianist, and Sophie's Choice to name a view). While it is far from the most visually graphic, it is nevertheless ominous and intimidating in its depiction of mass genocide. It's appealing that the ethnocentrism here wasn't preached like in Sophie's Choice, or that the Nazis were Satan's disciples like in Schindler's List, or even that the film was so god damn bleak from start to finish (*cough, the Pianist).What we're given here is an entirely different take on such a grim subject matter. The perspective is accentuated from the transition into fairy-tale to reality. The reality hardens when it's exploited by an optimist in a pessimistic scenario. The payoff, in the finale, is a bitter triumph. Life is beautiful. Never before had I ever thought twice about that sentiment. From now on, I will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's ultimately a rather exploitative tear-jerker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I entered 'Life Is Beautiful' not really knowing what to expect; I certainly didn't anticipate a part slapstick comedy. The film charts Guido's (Roberto Benigni) romantic pursuit of Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), their married life, the birth of their son, and finally their removal from Italy into an extermination camp by the Nazis. The initial phase of the story is quite pleasant and sometimes funny, it has numerous running gags all concerning Guido, most of which he uses spontaneously to impress and bemuse his love interest Dora.Guido is an affable, happy-go-lucky character, his spontaneous charm works well overall, especially in a scene where he manipulates an important guest's choice of dinner and in another where he comically translates a rather ominous looking Nazi. However, he can become exhausting, and he also becomes somewhat brash considering his surroundings in the latter half of the film. This brings me on to the depiction of the Holocaust. Guido's escapades within the camp are completely implausible and rather stupid, he sneaks around being his effervescent self whilst it is clear that in reality he would've been shot dead very quickly. The film doesn't offer hope because of its sheer implausibility, all it achieves really is trivialising the Holocaust. This film is rather like the term 'ethnic cleansing', it doesn't work because it's impossible and perhaps insulting to try and euphemise genocide. I'm not sure who the film's target audience is. Is it a children's film? That is one of the few ways I could perhaps see it working, as a method of introducing a young mind to the Holocaust. But there is a problem with this, too, the film doesn't even begin to offer an insight into the haunting evil of the Shoah. Instead, the audience gets a completely maudlin tale of 'spirit' and 'hope' that, with very little veracity, exploits one of humanity's most abhorrent events for the sake of saccharine pathos.Judging from others' opinions, I think this film will bode well with the overly sentimental who enjoy crying and disregard credibility.www.hawkensian.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrifying events presented in a ludicrous way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hated this movie. Horrifying events presented in a ludicrous way that never rings true. The first half of the movie is Guido winning a woman's heart through a contrived series of events in the process of which he strips in front of a class of children while impersonating a fascist politician and generally causing chaos with zero consequences. Guido came across as annoying and childish. Then the second half is the same thing but set in a death camp. Guido is able to run around a concentration camp doing silly walks, making fun of the guards and playing hide and seek with his son. Whenever he gets caught at this, he is easily able to distract the Nazis. The other children are all exterminated, but this is just mentioned off-handedly and glossed over. The movie falls apart when logic and thought is applied to it, so you just have to accept that it's a sentimental fairy tale about how the triumph of the human spirit. That might be OK in some contexts, but it seemed to trivialise the events portrayed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent And Outstanding Italian Tragicomedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life Is Beautiful is an Italian film which tells the story of a Jewish Italian, Guido Orefice, who must employ his fertile imagination to help his family during their internment in a Nazi concentration camp.Guido was played by Roberto Benigni, who also directed and co-wrote the film.It also stars Nicoletta Braschi,Giorgio Cantarini,Giustino Durano and Sergio Bini Bustric.Life Is Beautiful is a tragicomedy that presents Guido, who moves during the 1930's from the country to a Tuscan town, where he is entranced by schoolteacher Dora. Dora likes Guido, but she remains faithful to her pompous fiancé, so Guido has an uphill struggle. Meanwhile, anti-Semitic attitudes lead to attacks against Guido's Jewish uncle. Leaping ahead to five years later, during WW II, Guido and Dora are married and have a son Giosue. After they are imprisoned in a concentration camp, Guido goes to elaborate lengths to keep his son from understanding the truth of their situation. He tells the boy that they are competing with others to win an armored tank -- so everything from food shortages to tattoos is explained as necessary for participation in the contest.Life Is Beautiful is a truly one unforgettable film.Although I find some of Benigni's slapstick a little bit over-the-top and forced,it still overcomes the message presented by the film as to the sacrifices a parent would do for their children.In this case,it was a child's innocence is worth protecting.It was also both poignant and sincere as well.Even though some viewers may consider it implausible or some form of manipulation,it nevertheless proves to be some sort of sensitive and touching especially when one tries to protect one from experiencing childhood trauma during the World War II Holocaust.It was definitely touching and a heartwarming story that would truly be unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>''Life Is Beautiful'' is certainly one of the best movies I have ever seen. Its a kind of movie which will make the audience laugh and cry at the same time. It has three themes: romantic, comedy and tragedy. Certainly it can give us an idea about the Holocaust which took place seventy years ago. I loved this movie, everyone will love it.The film takes place in Italy. Robert Benigni, who is perhaps the best Italian actor, plays Guido, a witty Jewish shopkeeper who can make jokes even in the darkest situations. Nicoletta Braschi plays Dora, a girl from a wealthy non-Jewish family who falls in love with Guido. And of course, one has to praise the performance of Giorgio Cantarani, who plays the little son of Guido and Dora. And Pietro De Silva plays Bartolomeo, who becomes a close friend of Guido in the concentration camp. The film's story comes to a climax as Guido and Giosue are taken to the concentration camp, and Dora, despite being a non-Jew, joins her husband and son in the train taking them to the concentration camp. After reaching the camp, Guido does his best to make Giosue think that being in a concentration camp is a game, and they have to play this game for a few days.A really amazing movie. If you liked movies like ''The Pianist'', ''The Boy In the Striped Pajamas'', ''Anne Frank: The Whole Story'' and ''Schindler's List'', then you will also certainly like ''Life Is Beautiful''. I know that ''Life Is Beautiful'' has been criticized for it's excessive funny elements, but you will never actually will the ''pleasure'' while seeing the movie. You will feel sad all time while seeing it. Yes, you will laugh at some jokes of Guido, but side-by-side with this you will feel sad thinking about the the innocent 6 million Jews who were killed by the Nazis.A wonderful movie. Everyone should watch it. I'd finish this review after giving the score the movie should receive: 10 out of 10. This movie should be watched by EVERYONE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The secret of a beautiful life: "Be Italian!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what nationality other than Italian could a man have gotten away with naming his film Life Is Beautiful (La Vita ? Bella), for surely it must be the most beautiful language of all, so much so that to watch this film without subtitles would still be an event. The flow of the dialog is so unnaturally rhythmic for a foreign film; the barrier that is usually developed between viewer and the unknown performers' language is instantly shattered. What's just as significant about Beautiful is its status as a risk taking combined-genre film.Director, co-writer and star of Life Is Beautiful Roberto Benigni, however, is of a daring variety, to the extent that he is unsatisfied with the restrained convention of mix-and-match films and so instead has stumbled upon his own creation, in which he incorporates the entire spectrum of human emotion into one production, with themes ranging from slapstick to genocide, romantic comedy to holocaust/war drama and from the beauty of life to the tragedy of death. What's even more amazing than the theory of this magnitude of variations is his ability to pull it off!To say that the first half of this film, which revolves around lovable goof Guido's (Benigni) attempts to court the beautiful Dora (Benigni's wife Nicoletta), is often carefree is not to suggest that it is careless. True, this section is cheery and light-hearted, but never resorts to cheap sentiment or unjustified romance. On the contrary, the many set-ups and pay-offs that Guido uses to not-too-subtly, yet adoringly pursue Dora are some of the cleverest that one could conceive, ranging from creating an umbrella out of a steering wheel and a pillow to magically producing the "key" to Dora's emotions.When much more of this banter has taken place to the point that Dora is on the verge of loving Guido, he suddenly takes a different, more seriously approach. He tells Dora that he dreams of making love to her and could happily live the remainder of his life doing it. Now traditionally, if a man tells a woman that he hardly knows of his fantasises for such things, he's probably either drunk or tragically misguided in the ways of seduction. But it is the quiet innocence and gentle honesty with which Guido expresses his desire that detracts from any illicitness or sinister motives that might otherwise be present. He says "make love" with such na?ve charm that its phrasing has no meaning pertaining to sex and to imagine this man having sex is just impossible. To him, making love may just be a nice hug.Eventually, while Guido is waiting on patrons at the rehearsal dinner for Dora's pending marriage they meet surreptitiously under a large dining table. Nicola Piovani's award-winning score is at its must potent here, discarding the booming consistency of a string orchestra, leaving just a single harp, strumming and plucking to the absolute sincerity of the scene. Dora crawls slowly and somehow gracefully to Guido and they share their first kiss. "Take me away," she whispers. This is the second most beautiful scene in the film.Five years later, Guido and Dora have a beautiful son, Giosué (Cantarini), and eventually, Guido and his family are relocated (on Giosué's birthday!) to a concentration camp. While sceptical, Giosué allows himself to be told by his loving dad that the camp is a game and the prize, if the rules are followed, is his very own tank. When Guido is selected by a German officer to translate the regulations of the camp into Italian for the rest of the captives, he seizes the opportunity to convince his son that what he says is the truth in the film's funniest scene. As the officer shouts orders and motions violently, Guido shouts in turn a succession of hilarious rules and conditions of playing the game that can be found below, including the loser each day having to wear a sign that says "Jackass"! Giosué is happily persuaded.To learn in the second half of Beautiful that Benigni as an actor as well as a writer is no fool is very rewarding. The utter seriousness and desperation he conveys when he speaks with one of the camp's doctors (an earlier acquaintance made in Arezzo) who he hopes will help his family escape is a refreshingly versatile scene, as is the one immediately succeeding it where Guido is carrying his sleeping son back to their quarters in a heavy night-time fog. He takes a wrong turn and stumbles upon what is at first a pile of vague figures. As he approaches, the light reveals the large heap of slaughtered Jews that lay before him, still somewhat obscured by the mist. Watch Guido's shattered yet restrained expression, his wide and silent eyes, as he steps slowly away from the massacre.That said, Benigni's sentimental disposition that steers the film is always a welcome motivator, as in the scene when Guido attempts to make contact with the separately incarcerated Dora: after slipping away from the patrols, he and Giosué approach an unmanned P.A. system used for barking demands at the prisoners. Guido switches it on and an uncharacteristically colourful shot of the camp's megaphone is shown as he bellows into the microphone to his lonely wife, "Buongiorno, Principessa!" This is the most beautiful scene in the entire film; if it doesn't bring you to tears, then nothing ever will!The quintessential feel-good movie about the horrors of World War II, Life Is Beautiful is an ingenious masterpiece that follows one of the greatest inspirational philosophies in cinema: if there is but one thing that can be taken, felt or experienced totally and sincerely in film or any form of art, why should it be misery? Why should it be terror? Why oh why should it be hate?No? For man's sake, for life's sake, and for love's sake, let it be love, and the beauty it holds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely a great movie, worth seeing. Very funny, and horrific; not in a Clockwork Orange kind of way, rather, like slapstick, jokes and slapstick. The horror of the movie unfolds as the protagonist is slowly revealed, and we see that it is told from a distance of many years. Presented as a story remembered, it could fall into a trap of too much artifice or sentimentality. It doesn't even get near that line, dealing with the horrific overtones implicit in the plot with restraint. I give this one thumbs up! Plot Synopsis: The story begins with the story of the protagonist's father, and how he met his mother. He was a Jew, and she not, in prewar (WW 2) Italy. His father is very fond of humor, slapstick and joy. He wins his wife away from another gentile. The boy protagonist is born into prewar Italy, and then we fast forward to the time period when Jews were rounded up and killed. The protagonist's father makes believe that it's all a game to the child, who is at just the right age to make it believable that he would swallow such nonsense hook line and sinker. They (all three main characters) are interred at a concentration camp; where they manage to stay alive until the allied forces come. Except that the father dies saving his child's life. Did I mention that this is a really good movie? You could rent it tonight, and have some real eye opening fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, this film is all about Love. Human Love. The special kind of Love a father has to his son. After seeing this movie, I understood more about this human faculty called Love. I understood that Love is a distortion of reality only Humans are capable of. This father distorted and twisted the awful unbearable reality of being captivated in a concentration camp. Why did he do that? For his son not to be scared? Maybe. I think he did it so that his son do not live in hatred which is self destructive and for his son to find joy in the most awful of situations. The thing that moved me the most is that until the very last moment, the father continued playing the game of twisting the reality preserving the emotions of his son. The lesson learned from this movie is that "Imaginary" is necessary to beat unbearable reality and it is even better when it is done for others ...That's love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different take...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing so much about "La Vita ? Bella", I was excited when I discovered that I was to watch it for an English course. I had heard mixed things beforehand, from family, friends and critics, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Despite Benigni's over-acting, I quite enjoyed it for the first 45 minutes. However, when Guido (Benigni) and his son Giosué are sent to a concentration camp, my views quickly changed. Guido decides to hide the truth from his son, telling him that it's all just a game, and that in order to win, he must obey the Nazis. Even at the risk of losing his own life, he tries to make Giosué laugh. I was offended by the way Benigni turned such a serious situation into a light-hearted comedy/drama. The Holocaust is not something to be joked about, under any circumstances. All in all, there was good cinematography and performances, but the tone of the movie made me feel sick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatly underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one colossal success for the modern filming industry.The truth is that this might be called as one of the greatest films ever made and that would not be exaggeration.A beautiful film for the truth about life... It shows how the insanity of some individuals can ruin the life of others.The main conflict is between love, hope and will against despair, hate and impasse. It brilliantly shows that real life is not a fairytale, in real life people die, in real life things DO NOT happen the way you want it. There are no magical good guys who come and save everybody. Despite the arrival of allied forces, those people are far from saved. Most of them have lost their beloved ones and their place in society. They have lost their meaning of life, which no "Aragorn"-type hero can bring it back. And still the life is beautiful... In it's unfairness, in it's cruelty it is the most intriguing thing man will feel. Nomatter if you are in a concentration camp or anywhere else, you value life the most. Life is what you make of it. If you despair the happiness will go elsewhere. So the key massage of the movie is: Whatever happens, do not despair.I would not want to rate the acting, the action or anything else in the film because there still has not been made up a grade high enough to fit in this case. But I will still put one - "PERFECT MASTERPIECE"! And I just wonder, who would dare to say anything against this film or rate it below 10! My advice: If you hesitate to watch it - DO IT! You will not regret it!</fullReview>

Subtitles are not even needed to see the passion that comes from actors that portray the characters. All of the scenes are beautiful and well shot also. You learn to love Guido and his family very quickly, and the way he deals with the hardships in his life shows his selflessness. Even when he and his family are brought to a concentration camp, he prevents his son from realizing what is really happening by pretending that its all a game in which if they win, they will win the ultimate prize of an army tank. The real prize that Guido gives his son in the end is not a tank, but the gift of life after many near death experiences.</fullReview>

Anyways, "La vita é bella" is the greatest movie I have ever seen.In my days I have seen a few movies but I have never cried, I mean, I just don't cry. But when I watched "La Vita é bella" something changed - I cried for the first time for many years. I mean, we have all gone to school and we all know what happened in Europe in the 1930's to 1940's. We do know all the MILLIONS of people whose life's where sadly lost but do not understand because it's too big.In "La Vita é bella" we get to know this sweet Jewish man and the problems that existed in the society in which he lived. Everything changed when he manged to get himself a family and the day when the Nazis came it was very emotional. In a matter of fact, there were many scenes in the movie which were touched me emotionally.Long live "La Vita é bella" and long live humanity!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I was completely captivated by this movie-laughing and crying simultaneously. I have heard some criticism about the light heartedness of the film being inappropriate given its subject- WWII, The Holocaust. However, I think the heart of the film isn't really about the Holocaust, it is about love, fatherhood and hope. Further, I think that the juxtaposition of the human spirit set against a backdrop like The Holocaust was a brilliant decision, it heightens the true spirit of the film. Everyone knows (or should) how devastating this part of history was, so I don't think it is a disservice to focus the movie on a father and his son. It truly is a beautiful, wrenching film. The main character displays an emotional integrity of sacrifice and strength that far surpasses our traditional requirements for a hero. I was in awe of this character the entire time, and I have to admit the colorful MGM old Hollywood beginning was irritating to me, in spite of it's cleverness- but the way it bled into the main storyline... it is critical to introduce you to the characters this way. Just watch and let it be what it is, and it will deliver a transcendental experience. The movie really takes your heart and runs. An absolute must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I've finally gotten around to watch this movie, years and years after its release. First of all let me say that I'm usually not a fan of Benigni's work, but this film was a wonderful exception. This is first and foremost a story of a man's love for his son and wife. Throughout the comedy and horrible tragedy that's what's essential. And so you imagine what you yourself would do, would you be able to stay strong for your child and want to protect them and make them laugh even when you're all worn out?! You'd hope so...Benigni in this film is a worthy 'tramp' in the style of Chaplin. There's a healthy mixture of sad and funny moments and somehow the film manages to stay very serious and lighthearted at a time. I was however a bit stunned by the sudden ending but apart from that it's all in all a very good film.</fullReview>

Sometimes it's a bit to unrealistic, but I failed to notice when watching the movie and did so afterward. Two moments make you realize how awful the war was, the moment where they discus a mathematical question involving crippled during diner and the moment where the doctor want's the man to solve a riddle, they make you realize how the people could have let this happen.

It has a little comedy, but mostly is a film about love between a family, so powerful that the father will stop at nothing for his son. The near-death experience for the little boy in the showers, shows that life truly is beautiful. A Great movie. A 10/10, this is a somewhat sad movie, with a few comedic parts in it. Intriguing as it is powerful, this movie is great to watch if you're looking for a movie that has a moral, a purpose, a point.

		<fullReview>i guess you would never think about one film combining two totally different style stories into one film so perfectly: comic loving story and tragic but optimistic concentration camp life.the loving story starts from Dora falling from the sky and finishes by taking Guido's "green" ride. all this first half is delightful and Guido's humor makes you laugh loudly. then it turns to the other half by Giosue's grandmother show-up. the three-member family was put in concentration camp due to Jewish. Guido demonstrates pretty well his love for Giosue, making up the concentration as a game. he doesn't forget to encourage Dora by playing the music. tragic concentration just can't keep up away Guido's love for his son and wife. the love will be Giosue's treasure all though his life, and i think even touch every child.i would say this film not only tells a moving story about a man but also about a brave woman, who would leave her engaged for true love, even against family wishes. that's why Giosue doesn't know his grandmother until the bookstore scene. she would rather be with her family in concentration camp than living alone safely outside it would be totally perfect if only the comic elements could be involved with more realistic events.after all, i give it 9/10 and strongly recommend this movie to you, man and woman</fullReview>

It is a beautiful love story which also shows a man's smart and funny sense of survival in what is to be one of the most horrific times in history. Set in WWII it gives a different look at making it through the Holocaust by taking love-filled daring chances to keep your family together.

		<fullReview>I am a 15 year old sophomore in Colorado, and I was in awe at the masterpiece that Roberto Benigini has created, without the excess use of profanity, sex, and violence. The story was wonderfully splendid and the abrupt switch in gears from comedy to drama didn't halt his storytelling process. He greatly deserved his Oscar, and he should have won in more than just that territory. I have recently noticed that many of my favorite films are foreign. With film makers like Myazaki and Benigini, it's no wonder. Other films to see if you liked this: The Diary of Anne Frank, Children of Heaven, Saints and Soldiers. This is one of those rare movies that can be shared with the family! - Sparky</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Triumph of the human spirit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I take on board the criticisms of this movie by those who think it trivialises the Holocaust, but I think it is necessary to interpret it in different terms entirely. The reality of the Nazi death camps is not portrayed here; it would be impossible to do so in a comedy. Instead, we are given a sketchy idea of what life was like in that terrible situation and the movie focuses on the efforts of one man to survive and protect his son from the horror. It is a very light-hearted Italian view but maybe it makes a contribution as an alternative to more serious heart-rending accounts of the Nazi atrocities. Of course disbelief must be suspended if we are to be convinced that an intelligent child could avoid the reality of his situation, but I felt that the boy was playing along with his father, even though he somehow knew what danger he was in. I found myself wondering what the goal of the film was, and it wasn't to trivialise the most intense human suffering but offer an alternative response to it, and show a different type of courage. We can go through life weeping over the suffering in the world, which is all around us and hard to escape, or we can choose to concentrate on the good in other people and use that as a power to change things. Optimism is not necessarily self-delusion, sometimes it is the only thing between us and insanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comment from somebody who liked the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a wonderful film about the nazi Holocaust. Behind its appearance of comedy hides a very critical spirit but, above all, a sad story. In fact there are two possibles interpretations of the film: that of the child, who thinks that all is a play (and, actually it is the interpretation of the children who see the film) and that of the adult, who face up to the cruel reality with optimism. Besides, it is a love story, not only between a man and a woman but also between a child and his parents.I liked very much the film because the director is able to tell us the story of the Second World War making us laugh (and also cry, of course). It is a wonderful story about the fight for survival, the love and the cruelty of the human being. I recommend this film to all people. If you like war films, or non-conventional love films, or simply you just want to have a nice time see this film...it will make you think!!</fullReview>

The jokes in the movie are not always funny, but sometimes it is well done. The effects are good! and sometimes it is emotional. I don't understand the fun, we are joking about the holocaust with a story that is so unbelievable!I gave a 6 as grade.Advice: watch it if you have nothing better to do!It is not as funny as spy hard! by leslie nielsen, however I think it was supposed to be the same genre.

		<shortDescription>Comedic melodrama in concentration camp? Impossible, obviously.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very surprised that this film drew so much critical acclaim. It is noteworthy for trying to view the holocaust from a different angle, but fails miserably in the attempt. I can understand why people liked this film, but I believe these people have kept themselves blissfully ignorant about the reality of the holocaust.The movie is, roughly, in two parts. The first half is a rather beautiful love story taking place in some world of fantastic realism. It's nicely poetic, but spoiled for me by the frequent appearance of a hyperactive Robin Williams imitator overdosed on speed: unfortunately, the lead actor.The second half is, obviously, more problematic. After Benigni and his "princessa" have created a model Italian core family with a cute little son, and after a gradual and skillful build-up of the antisemitism theme, the three of them are suddenly deported to a concentration camp. The mother is separated from them, and the father tries to protect his son by telling him that it all is a big game and that the winner will win an actual tank. I do not object to this idea; it's a good premise for a movie.The problem is the depiction of the concentration camp. The barracks are tidy; everybody has a bunk for himself; the prisoners are reasonable friendly; it's only that there is little to eat and that everybody has to work very hard. There are some references making clear that people are murdered and cremated, so we understand that this is supposed to be a death camp. But the movie painfully avoids really conveying these horrors to the audience. It has to do so, of course. You can't have comedic melodrama between piled-up corpses, people sleeping on top of each other, and sick people left to die without treatment.There is a reason why almost nobody ever really tried to depict a death camp. (In case you wonder, the camp shown in detail in "Schindler's List" is just an "ordinary" KZ, no actual death camp. In Spielberg's film, Auschwitz is only depicted from narrow angles in subjective perspective, so that you never really see anything; which might be the only appropriate way to show anything at all.) I understand what the filmmakers tried to do here, but what they have accomplished is the belittlement and playing down of the holocaust.In my view, the film's critical reception only goes to show how little is known today about the atrocities of the Third Reich, and how many people have spared themselves opening their minds and imaginations to what really happened. I grant the movie three stars because I don't doubt the good intentions, but I felt decidedly appalled by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Moving Example of True Love In Reality and How Precious Life Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to the comments of many, this is not a Holocaust movie;anyone who wants to sit through 2 hours of unspeakable bestiality,suffering and horror needs therapy. If you want to see the reality ofthe Holocaust, watch actual film footage of naked bodies ofinnocent men, women and children being bulldozed into massgraves, as I have done because I am a historian who wants to seethe truth; or visit a Holocaust museum and speak to a survivor, as Ihave done also. By now we should all know the reality of whathappened, which can never be convincingly depicted by actors orsets in a movie. The survivors I spoke to dwelt on the human spirit,survival, love, and even forgiveness of the Nazis involved. Mostcomment that the movie is split into halves, but its theme is Lovein the fullest meaning of the word, and this gives the film totalcontinuity. More than half of marriages now end in divorce andleave children with one parent, many of the other marriages areunhappy ones, all leaving children scarred, not to mention theprevalence of child abuse. This film is about how love canblossom in good times and bad. The wife didn't run away, shewanted and needed to follow her family, the husband used isinventiveness and humour and most of all his love for his wife andchild to protect the son against all odds, and communicate to hisunseen wife that he and their son were alive; all of this because ofLove, not romance or sentimentality or sensuality as love is toooften portrayed, usually ending in disappointment, separation andanother search for Hollywood love or "romance". The movie isintelligent and assumes we know the real Holocaust and neverattempts to be historical, apart from the brief view of a mass gravejust as a quick reminder to us of the true horror, its message islove pure, in its joy as well as longsuffering and pain. Many willattest that life is beautiful even more after brushes with death, andthe film is mainly centred on the son, who for the rest of his dayswill never forget his parents love and attention, and the protectionhis father gave him, allowing him to appreciate that life is trulybeautiful and to pass his experiences onto others and his ownfamily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let us put aside for a moment whether slapstick makes for a 'good' movie. Let us put aside the question of whether slapstick is appropriate for a movie about the Holocaust. Let us even put aside the question of whether you can have a movie about love and life and hope--even call the movie, with no sense of irony, 'Life is Beautiful'--when you're talking about one of the ugliest periods of human history.The most basic problem with this atrocious movie is its dishonesty. Benigni and his apologists would claim that this is a fable, a work of fiction, that is not about the Holocaust. However, if the Holocaust is brought up, the movie is (at least in part) about the Holocaust, regardless of what a director may imagine. Moreover, even a work of fiction, which by definition need not be factual, must be true and honest. It cannot conflate the historical anomaly and at the same time diminish the historical majority. [These ideas are an adaptation of an article by Holocaust author Cynthia Ozick.]Specifically, 'Life is Beautiful' is whitewashed of any Jewish influence, a fact probably stemming in large part from the movie's being based on the experiences of Benigni's own fascist father (who was arrested when Italy defected to the Allies late in the war). The names are not Jewish. There is nothing Jewish about the behavior or the experiences of the lives of the characters. And indeed...SPOILER WARNING SPOILER WARNING SPOILER WARNING SPOILER ...the main survivors of the movie, Dora and Josue, are both Christian, whereas the only theoretically Jewish character, Guido, dies.Also, just to mention briefly the obvious stuff, the concentration camp looks more like summer camp, the Nazis are portrayed (the little that they are at all) as buffoons, and there is no real sense of terribleness or atrocity. (If Benigni wants to make a powerful point about love, why does he have to diminish the horror of the camp to make it?) Even the dead bodies in the fog appear like something out of a Dali painting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surely one of the most disrespectful movies ever made. A vanity project for Roberto Benigni and wife which happens to involve deportations to an Auschwitz where children are allowed to run and hide ! A creaky plot which for the first part of the film is devoted to the cult of Roberto Benigni as a socially inept goodhearted soul who wins the heart of his wife. Self-serving in the extreme. Maybe in Italy it was seen as a brave move for a big movie star to take on a Jewish role, but in the U.S. such choices don't even rate a comment. Benigni practically screams love me for most of the movie until the deportation. The scenes inside the concentration camp are suitably graphic but as always the focus is on Roberto. Our poor Roberto, HE is special, his love is special unlike the other millions. Ends ridiculously with Roberto calming down his son before he gets shot. So calculated for maximum Roberto and Oscar love. Have no idea why people let themselves be manipulated by this pedestrian movie. A cynical use of a horrific event to further an actor's lovable persona.</fullReview>

Many seemed to be troubled by the lightness of the first half, but to my mind the whole point is to set a reference for the second half. Like Man Bites Dog and Trainspotting, La Vita e Bella sucks you in with humour and then spits you back out with shock. Unlike many other defenders of this film, I didn't find it uplifting. I found it gut wrenching. The fact that it was able to have the same emotional impact upon me without the horror of say Schindlers List is a testament to the film as a whole. Without the levity of the first half the gravitas of the second half would be lost. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have resisted commenting on what I feel just may be the greatestfilm of all time. But in light of the lengthy comment by "Francis A.Breen, Jr., M.D.", I feel compelled.This film is real in a way that documentary films and history textscan never be. The simple reason is that it is far too dangerous forthose two mediums to take such a slant on the holocaust subject.the reality, as Mr. Breen fails to recognize, is that the humanbeings who were affected by the holocaust (and other people inother imprisoned and tortured situations) needed to and did retaintheir humanity, their dignity and...yes... their sense of humour. Humour has always been a great "equalizer" in these situations. Many holocaust survivors and other POW's tell tales of how theyused humour as a survival tool... and I feel that it is a vitallyimportant one. Thankfully Roberto Benigni had the guts and needto put that element of humanity on film. I, for one, feel that he did iteffectively, with dignity and humanity. I am offended that anyonewould give so little credit to the human spirit as to suggest that intimes of tragedy we all just roll over and give our improsonerswhat they want. Human will is stronger than that and the bestchance we have of retaining our humanity and sanity is to notsuccumb to the emotions that those captors expect and revel in.This film is beautiful, important and TRUE. It shows us, ourancestors and our children that we can do more by staying "alive"then we can by rolling over. It also contains a wonderful messageof sacrifice - if only we all could imagine giving so much for ourchildren and the next generation as a whole. Maybe somebody gained a little perspective by seeing this film. Maybe someone learned to believe in the human spirit. Maybesomeone joined Amnesty International so it will never happenagain. Maybe someone just looked at loving their child a littledifferently. This movie had to be made and it had to made the wayit was. I thank Mr. Benigni for making it. It is more than "a movie",it is pure poetry. Life IS Beautiful... all life. If you can get thatacross in 2 hours, then that is powerful film making and there arebetter people on the planet right now for having seen it.</fullReview>

The first part of the movie, dealing with coming of love between the couple, was fairly delightful, even if it being kind of corny. The second half is not worse than the first, but not really better than it either. Benini's character convinces his son that their just in a game when their actually in a concentration camp. That worked for a little bit but after a while it got kind of sappy. You keep wondering if it's actually going to do more harm to the kid than good. The movie has it's funny moments, and it's warm hearted moments, but I really can't call it a great movie. Benini's performance is good, but I kind of think the only reason he won best actor was for people to see a guy jumping over chairs and acting crazy. I give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally rented Life is Beautiful yesterday. I was disappointed - and I wasn't expecting too much. As a comedy it fell flat to me. The movie leading up to the characters' imprisonment bored me to tears - I did not find the slapstick funny, and I normally love slapstick. I found the main character (the father) annoying.Once the plot moved to the concentration camp, I still did not find it funny, but that's fine with me as I would probably be mildly concerned if it was funny. The only thing I found very unique or interesting about the film was the made-up "game"... but that wore very thin and got boring, too.Any genuine feeling I felt while watching this film came from inside me, from how I already feel about the Holocaust - the movie didn't move me at all. SPOILER -- Well, I was moved a little, at the end. Moved to wonder "oh, my god, who is going to explain to that kid what REALLY happened, when and how will they explain it, and how will that make him feel??" But those were totally hypothetical questions, because I never really bought it that the "game" ruse would work.END SPOILER--From looking at the comments, it looks like I'm in the minority here. The movie didn't impress either of my housemates, either, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I asked you for a great World War II satire, you might say "The Great Dictator", or "To Be Or Not To Be", or "Hail the Conquering Hero" or "Mister Roberts", among others. But "Life is Beautiful" is different.

How did they take one of the most serious, darkest events in recent history and manage to make it beautiful and funny?I have no idea. Maybe it's the superb script. Maybe it's the fabulous acting, even from that little boy. However they did it, they ended up succeeding, and I applaud the makers of this fabulously charming movie.Of course, there are sad parts too - it wouldn't be much of a Holocaust movie without them.

		<shortDescription>And so is the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life Is Beautiful When I first heard of this film's concept, comedy against the backdrop of a Nazi concentration camp, I thought it was brilliant. Upon seeing the movie I discovered that my initial impression was right. Roberto Benigni has achieved a true masterpiece with this work, which will be remembered years from now for its greatness. Benigni's character is so endearing that he is able to make the contrived slapstick and serendipity that pervades the first half of the film consistently amusing. It is only in the darkness of the concentration camp that we truly understand the necessity of establishing his comic character. Threaded within this comic/horrific juxtaposition are scenes of emotional power: his gentile wife's demand to get on the train with her Jewish husband and son, the dashing of hope over the realization that the potentially life-saving doctor is insane, Benigni's character's interpretation of the German guard's instructions all are indelible. And finally the part where Guido (Benigni) walks to certain death as his son watches, still believing that they are playing a game for a prize and totally unaware of the evil surrounding him, is a vignette that is rivaled by few in film history. Ultimately, in the throes of inhumanity the potential of humanity shines. As the older son narrates at the conclusion this was his father's gift to him, as this film is a gift to the rest of us.BTW, a good film to watch on Father's Day, though it presents high expectations. </fullReview>

Brilliant filmmaker and actor Roberto Benigni tries to protect his child from the horrors of World War II and the German Nazi's overtaking of him, his family, and every Jewish person in between. Unlike many films, like Schindler's List, he pretends that the war is a game because as a loving father, he wants to shield his child from the terror that the war really is.

		<shortDescription>An unforgettable film that will move everyone's hearts to laugh and to weep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among all my favorite movies, this is one of them which I irresistably fall in love with, a movie filled with humanity, passion, and warmth. Delighting those who you love makes la vita bella, even in the hellish conditions. This is the main idea of the whole film.I think director-writer-actor Roberto Benigni is a genius. I think he deserved more Oscars! Skilfully and successfully, he combines humor, wit, and love together to move everyone's hearts.The first half of the movie contrasts dramatically with the second half; the former tells the fairy tale of Guido from his courtship to Dora to building a happy and warm family, the latter tells the hellish holocaust in which Guido, who has become a slave under the brutal rule of the Nazi, uses humor to delight his beloved son in the most awful environment and to hide from him the awful truth. It is the second half that makes all the audience impossible not to weep---Guido's good-intentioned lies ("the game"), the chances he grasps to communicate with his wife, for instance, the opera music he plays when he serves the German soldiers in the holocaust, the funny walk he does when arrested by a German soldier so as to delight his son even in his eleventh hour, and finally, his sacrifice. I think all of these are unforgettable scenes in each audience's memory.Aside from love, other aspects that this movie will make you think about are, in my opinion, the meaning of life, slavery, and war. The key to have a beautiful life is clearly portrayed by the Italian genius. "La Vita e Bella" is a rare masterpiece in this epoque.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moving, entertaining, funny, but falls short of being an extraordinary film. Its always nice to see a foreign film so honored by the Academy Awards, pity better works such as Luc Besson's La Femme Nikita and Betty Blue by Jean-Jacques Bieneix did not receive similar praise in the past. It will definitely not be considered a Masterwork in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Social commentary, satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** SPOILER WARNING ***The social commentary and satire of "Life is Beautiful" was portrayed wonderfully through the acting talent of Benigni and his physical comedy. Guido's imagination and ingenuity show the triumph of the human spirit despite the ugliness of the days of Hitler. Rather than rub the tragedy of that era in the viewer's face, writer, director and actor Benigni does the opposite, minimizing brutality and violence seen, in effect using reverse psychology to show how sad that time really was. Guido as he's taken away to be killed is smiling at his child and exaggerating his march so the boy won't be scared. He isn't even allowing himself grief, perhaps being more deprived than those who allow themselves the sadness. The costume design was also excellent, using period pieces without being overdone. The way the costumes looked in the beginning with the happier portion of the film worked well, with bright colors, moving to drab colors when Guido and his son had to go to the concentration camp. The costumes helped serve as a backdrop (along with the set) for the time and tragedy of the period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To make a such a movie about the Holocaust would require an extraordinary actor, who could convey the contradictory desire to spare his son and simultaneously feel the horror of being shipped to a camp. Instead, all I saw was him literally trying to make a big joke out the experience, because Benigni isn't capable of portraying fear while playing a clown. The scene where he does the "funny interpreter" shtick for the Nazis is especially awful--he was risking the lives of all the inmates with his game. I was shocked that he won Best Actor, though of course that is consistent with the travesty of the Oscars. It wasn't a true story, but at the end the boy claims "This is the story of my life" as if this were a true life story. It was a cheap trick. Very dishonest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously, I'm in the minority, but I didn't think that much of this movie. Not that it was bad, just that everything else that Benigni has done or been in (aside from Son Of Pink Panther) has been better. I realize the Holocaust is an important subject, but making a movie about it doesn't guarantee greatness. I'd recommend you watch The Boxer And Death, 7 Beauties, Schindler's List or Shoah instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roberto Benigni ?s speech and reaction at the Academy Awards made me laugh and cry at the same time. He was definitely one of the most animated and jolly persons that I had ever heard and seen in my life. I just got the video and the movie is just as precious as Robert himself! The movie has movement, rhythm, it is a look the holocaust from the eyes of a little boy, who's dad "Guido Orefice" played by Roberto Benigni (Son of the Pink Panther, Pinocchio) had the most wonderful perspective of life that I ever heard about .The role of dad "Guido Orefice," was in reality based on that of Benigni's father himself, which indicated that Roberto inherited his great and awesome humor. That is a precious gift. What a thankful heart! I absolutely loved the movie. There is that famous show business saying:" to make people cry is easy, but to make people laugh is hard." To, I would add if you will, to make people cry watching such a predicament is even harder. There absolutely nothing in the movie that I did not like. I fell in love with every detail. Normally when I buy a foreign film I like to get the original, especially those in Italian which is a language that I understand very well, but I ended up with the English version, even so no complaints, I really, truly enjoyed the movie. My favorite scenes:Guido Orefice on is bicycle, Guido Orefice, his wife and his son on his bicycle. The way he treated the woman he was in love with, always saying: "Buon giorno, Principessa!" Guido in front of the students in his undies! All he did to charm "Dora" Nicoletta Braschi (Afirma Pereira; Pasolini, un delitto italiano) the love of his life, and also in real life, Benigni's wife. My favorite quote: "Serving but you are never a servant. Serving is an act practiced by the Supreme being himself. God serves man but He is not a servant." Go get this movie and see one the best movies ever! It deserved all the awards and nominations it received.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alright, but the first half is just plain irritating...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't seem to be nearly as enthusiastic about this film as the other reviewers on this site. To be sure, I loved the concentration camp part (never thought I'd hear myself say that...), but I really wasn't too impressed with everything leading up to it - which, unfortunately, was rather a lot. Roberto Benigni's ha-ha-look-at-me-being-funny antics of the first half are so saccharine, so slapstick-like that they really are quite irritating at times. It would have been OK if this part of the film (the introduction, so to speak) had lasted ten minutes or so, but unfortunately it lasts much longer than that, and it really becomes rather tiresome in the end. Thank God the concentration camp scenes for which the film is famous DO make up for the first-half irritation...Seven out of ten, I'd say - begrudgingly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>as a general rule don't go to see a foreign film dubbed. getting used to subtitles is not hard and true language of the actors contributes so much to a film. i could not imagine seeing a dubbed version of life is beautiful. i don't know italian but it sounds amazing. this movie is brilliant. the very fact that it so controversial (in this case, but not always) indicates its underlying genius. a lesser movie would just direct us to the appropriate emotions at the appropriate time with manipulative camera work and melodramatic narrative (a la titanic), but life is beautiful is chock full of conflicting feelings. it covers all the nuances of thew human condition. you know, laugh cry blah blah blah, but it does it so so well. roberto benigni i think is one of the greatest comic geniuses of our time. i would also like to point out another thing: i am told by people who like me (i think) that on a whole i am a very insensitive person (with movies, and in real life apparently). i never cry at movies, in fact movies that i feel are trying to make me cry tick me off something fierce and i become totally apathetic to the characters. the only time i have ever even been weepy eyed was when i was just a kid and i thought E.T. had kicked the bucket. so keeping all that in mind, the fact that life is beautiful moved me so much is a testament to its success as a film. 10/10. my favorite film now, followed closely by das boot, burnt by the sun, and red. my favorite parts of this movie (ij no particular order) are 1. the hilarious part where he is "translating" for the german soldier. 2.the very underratted romantic scenes at the beginning with the red carpet and little "miracles" roberto performs and 3. the kid (what a cute kid!!) in essence, one needs to see this movie in the light that it is a modern day fairy tale. it is definitely not a realistic depiction of the holocaust, and isn't supposed to be. i can see why some people are insulted by its comedy, but i just can't agree. there are plenty of serious, upsetting movies about this subject, notably schindler's list, which was good but i never want to see it again. i think it is much harder to take this subject matter as a background and have such positive material in the forefront. in fact, i don't even think this really is a holocaust movie. it's a character study of the father-son relationship, and in that medium it is ultimately a masterpiece.</fullReview>

The father must protect the innocence of his child by making the Nazi concentration camp seem like a very fun game. It's amazing how the director maintains the "happiness" in this film even though it is set in a very "dark" place. After viewing this movie, you will have a totally different perception about the world. It proves that NOTHING can destroy the human spirit and the film gives you a good reason to continue living on. It also teaches us to keep an optimistic perspective even during times of distress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful is truly an exceptional film. It takes a historical situation, the Holocaust, and puts its characters inside the walls of a concentration camp. This is about all that is true, and so it is historical fiction, but the plot is what is terrific. The first half is Roberto Benini doing a comedy routine and it is slapstick and often hilarious. The second half deals with the holocaust and a plot by which Benini must make up a game to tell his young son in order to shield him from the horrific truth. It is the rules of this game and ways that they are presented that make the movie so remarkable. nearly every important detail that appears in the second half was foreshadowed in the first. This movie is not only very enjoyable, but also extremely smart and creative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For everyone who didn't like this movie, because it was unrealistic or what have you, I feel kinda sorry for you. You've really missed the point. I think the true story here is about a father and the love he has for his family. He wasnt making the tragedy laughable (for those who said that).. He was trying to protect his son from an even greater pain, and going to whatever lengths he had to, to make that happen. He was trying to make it laughable to his son, all the while knowing how unlaughable it really was. Yeah, maybe in reality that would have been impossible too back then.. But a documentary wasn't trying to be made here. Its a story, obviously leaning on the side of fantasy... and after watching it, I couldnt help but get the sense of feeling its too bad we all don't have someone in our lives who loves us that much.But, hey thats just my opinion.. I think everyone who must pick apart every movie bit by bit, really needs to lighten up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in years. What I think is so spectacular is that it doesn't try to be perfect, with fancy locations and extravagant costumes. It gets right down to what a movie should be, which is an incredibly acted and heart-warming story. I hadn't seen this movie when Roberto Benigni won the Oscar for Best Actor. In fact, I thought he was just an enthusiastic guy, and really nothing more. But when I saw "Life is Beautiful" a few months after the Academy Awards, I realized that Roberto Benigni was truly a talented actor...one of the best today! "La Vita ? bella" or "Life is Beautiful" is a wonderful story that is romantic and touching. It also shows the horrors of concentration camps. So I give it a 10 out of 10, and recommend it to anyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie makes me uneasy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always admired Roberto Benigni, along with Jim Carrey, he is one of the hardest working comics in the business. Thus, I really wanted to like this film...I really did! Unfortunately, I came away from the cinema feeling uneasy. His trademark irreverence is intact, but he's also added a large, sugar coated spoonful of political correctness. It's almost as if it's mandatory to feel good after viewing it.For those who enjoy the films of Benigni, you should investigate the films of Franco Franci. I consider Franci a true comic genius, and he's had a big influence on Benigni comic style. He was popular in Italy during the late 50's, 60's and 70's as part of the comedy team Franco e Chico (Chico Ingrasia was his straight-man side-kick). Their James Bond parodies are as hilarious as anything conjured up by Michael Myers. And, look for their Clint Eastwood spoof called, The Good, The Bad and The Stunned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two movies for the price of one - the first is a delight, the second a travesty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life Is Beautiful is really two separate movies - completely different in plot, tone and intent. The first part is a breezy romantic comedy, one which is exceedingly well-done: clever, goofy, big-hearted and a lot of fun. It resurrects the style of the old silent classics like Chaplin and Keaton and adapts it for modern day audiences. And Roberto Benigni is a first rate clown - a hangdog mixture of Woody Allen and Kramer from "Seinfeld". If you were to turn off this movie after the first hour, you would have gotten your money's worth.However, if you stick around for the second part you'll likely want your money back - as well as a full public apology from Benigni for being such a moral retard. For, once he and his son are rounded up by the Nazis and sent to a concentration camp, the movie turns into one of the biggest travesties in the history of cinema. Just who was the idiot who allowed Benigni to introduce something as weighty as the Holocaust into this whimsical and paper-thin world? Inflicting Bugs Bunny or Charlie Brown with AIDS would make about as much sense.Now, I've heard this film defended as being a "fable" - as if to say, "Well, straight forward realism isn't what Benigni was going for." Well I'm sorry, but if straight forward realism isn't what you're going for, then you DON'T use the Holocaust as your backdrop; it is too real and horrific an event to yield its place to fables and fairy tales. Once you're a stone's throw away from the ovens, the logic of a cartoon world just does not hold up. And, sadly, it is only by such cartoon logic that we can conceive of Benigni keeping his son so well insulated from the horrors going on all around him. Implausibilities just pile up here like so many dead Jews (you find that phrasing offensive? Welcome to the world of Life Is Beautiful): the opening sequence with the guard, where Benigni pretends to "translate" his German - wouldn't any of the other inmates have commented upon how illogical his spiel was, and thereby alert the guard that he wasn't being translated properly (and, further, didn't this whole scene play like an egregious "Hogan's Heroes" rerun? Just what we need, a sitcom set in a concentration camp); and is it logical to assume that the kid would stay so well-hidden in his barracks all day, or that no guard would ever search the top bunks to find him?; how about the supremely idiotic moment when Guido (Benigni's character name) gets on the camp loudspeaker to say hello to his wife? Under normal circumstances, the schmaltz of this scene would merely be laughable, but the context of the Holocaust makes it instead deeply offensive. To which Benigni adds stupidity in the next moment by allowing the kid to get on as well: isn't the whole point to *hide* the kid, so that the guards don't realize he's still alive? Of course, Benigni knows he doesn't have to worry about them finding his son - after all, since he wrote the script, those guards will only do what he tells them to do, logic and history be damned.For that is exactly what Benigni is doing here: he's damning history, showing a cavalier disregard for facts. "Yes," I can imagine him saying, "I know six million were murdered, but I don't like that ending. I'll write my own upbeat version of the truth." Of course, that's precisely what Guido does with his son: he creates his own version of the truth, lying in order to shield the boy from the true horror of their situation. Ok, forget for a moment the plausibility of keeping up such a charade and instead ask yourself this: Is that such a good idea? I mean, after all, if the kid truly doesn't know the danger he's in, how can he protect himself? This is the same kind of logic that grownups use so frequently to lie to their young kids about death or divorce, or any other similarly weighty topics - almost always to the detriment of the child later in life. So not only is Guido's deceiving of his son not noble or "touching" - it's actually downright dangerous. Furthermore, even on a purely symbolic level, the notion that innocence could somehow be preserved amidst the horror of the Holocaust is an outright lie, and a truly insidious one. Anyone who's read Elie Wiesel's "Night," where he describes his childhood years inside a camp and the bitter toll they took upon his faith and his sense of justice in the world, would understand the true depth of this lie.To sum up, I have to be a little nasty. Normally, I'm a strong believer in "to each his own," particularly when it comes to movies. If you like something and I don't, or vice versa, we can argue about it, but ultimately we're each entitled to our opinions. Not here. The subject portrayed is so monumental, and its treatment so facile, that if you like this movie I have to say that there is something seriously wrong with you. Either you're a moral retard like Benigni, or you know nothing about the Holocaust, or you are far too easily manipulated into crying on cue and getting all warm and emotional inside that you lose sight of the depths to which the filmmakers are sinking. I don't know how this movie got such nearly unanimous across-the board support, whereas only a few short years ago Schindler's List opened a large debate concerning the ability of films to accurately portray the Holocaust. Could it be that this film's refusal of an accurate portrayal - in favor of its "fable" approach - is what makes it so palatable? Are we ready now to sugarcoat the Holocaust, make it less of a "downer"? Scary thought. Perhaps it's time for Mel Brooks to dust off his "Springtime for Hitler" musical which seemed so patently absurd thirty years ago; sadly, I could just see it now being the toast of Broadway.First part of film: Three stars out of FiveSecond part : Zero stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comment contains spoilers. I have only just seen this film on video. I neither loved nor hated it, but didn't think it made a very strong point. I'm surprised people were so moved by it as they obviously were. However I can't help having an uneasy feeling that if you are going to use the Holocaust (or any similar scenario) to make what is a fairly simplistic point about the power of love (we all know that parents will give their lives for the sake of their children - it is part of folklore and in the holocaust real victims did it all the time) you must be accurate and detailed. To tell a story that simply couldn't have happened (for example the child would simply not have survived even one day at Auschwitz, the barracks bore no resemblance to any I have ever seen in photographs - and where was the kapo? nor was it at all easy to contact a woman if you were in the men's camp) it seems to me makes the whole thing meaningless. The railway journey struck me as weird. Having packed its characters into a realistic cattle truck, the film then sends them on a journey lasting about five minutes, from which they get down only slightly dishevelled. I doubted the camp was even supposed to represent Auschwitz, and assume it had to be in Italy from the shortness of the journey and the lack of hardship endured. Where are the dead bodies? Auschwitz was also not liberated by Americans. Okay, so it's a fairy tale. But are we entitled to tell fairy tales about the Holocaust? Even if we are, why tell this one, risking the wrath of the genuine Holocaust survivors for trivialising their experience, for what seems a very shallow message?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Making people laugh about Concentration camp is a courageous if dangerous endeavor, especially as a wave of neo-Nazism sweeps over Europe. Laughing is a serious matter, however, as Begnini seems to believe, and why could it not make us discover new aspect of the Nazi horror? Well it could but in the case of Begninis's film it does not. The film is less a film on concentration camps than another love story, of a man and a woman and of a father and his son. The Holocaust is turned into a banal jail the Jews project (I particularly resented the depicting nearly every prisoner as Italian speaking, in itself a highly unrealistic assumption) to serve a melodramatic story. Italy has produced with Primo Levi's self-biographical book If This is a Man one the strongest account of life in Nazi's concentration camp to date. Begnini's film is indeed an insult to Levi´s masterwork. Read Art Spiegelman's Maus: A Survivor's Tale comic strip on the subject instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been almost two years since that movie's been released, it's available on VHS and on DVD now and I still can't understand how it's been able to lead such an incredibly successful career. It's not funny (in its first part), it's not moving and it's dangerous. Those crazy people who deny the holocaust events could even use some edited parts of this irresponsible thing. I know a lot of people loved it. I respect that. But I believe you have to be well prepared and well documented when you do a film that deals with the Shoah. Apparently Benigni was not. He should have watched the absolutely wonderful and unmissable nine hours of Jacques Lanzmann's "Shoah" at least twice before even considering to do this movie. A truly shocking film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life Is Beautiful changes people and their attitudes. Not towards History or Politics, like other Holocaust movies do (or at least attempt to), but towards life. What deeply moved me was the way Guido (Benigni) treats his son in the movie. He does not try to inject him unnecessary maturity, he teaches him how to deal with life in his own way: from a funny point of view, led by apparently infinite zest for life and not taking anything seriously.The father makes his son believe that they are participants of a collective game instead of prisoners in a concentration camp, and in his funny, creative and never ever desperate nature, he is always able to convince the boy.To me the ending was not sad at all. I realized it as a very positive one.And I think that is exactly what Benigni (although I have to say I can´t really laugh about Slapstick in general; be it Chaplin or Benigni) intended to tell us: Only when we remain young at our hearts, in acceptance of life, seeing not everything too seriously, maybe even seeing it as a game, as the young boy does, then only we are able, after such a gruesome experience like an imprisonment in a concentration camp, to rise our fists up in the air, to cry full of joy: `We have won!' Only with a philosophy of life like Guido shows us, we are finally able to admit to ourselves that Life Is Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful is better than both The Great Dictator and Schindler's List. Whilst I can already hear people shouting at me, this is true. All three are great films, but the fact is that LiB is more touching than either of the others. Schindler's List does not focus on the smaller characters enough for us to be emotionally involved with them, but we care about Guido, Giosue and Dora. The Great Dictator is also a great dramatic-comedy about WW2 which touches on the Holocaust, and is a fantastic movie, especially when we consider that it was made in 1940. This film, however, focuses on dictators and war, rather than the holocaust. LiB creates human characters that we love and care for, and so the experience of watching it is truly touching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was everyone watching the same movie as me?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am shocked to see so many negative comments about "Life is Beautiful." I was mesmerized by it, and think it is the best movie I have seen in a long, long time. Many people on this site have criticized the film for "making light" of the holocaust. "Life is Beautiful" certainly didn't lead me to think that the holocaust "wasn't so bad."Sure, a lot of the movie was not believable. It didn't have to be. I thought the whole point of it was to show that, despite the atrocities, people persevered through small acts of bravery. For anyone who wants to compare this movie with "Shindler's List", don't. They are both spectacular, but they are two very different films. Benigni doesn't hit you over the head with the horrible conditions in the camp. Instead, he implies a lot, and focuses instead on the love of a father for his family, and his intense desire to protect them. If some aspects of life in a concentration camp are portrayed as less severe, I don't think it detracts from the film's message at all.Instead, the most frightening aspects of the holocaust are shown in the faces of the characters. Recall the scene where Dora learns that the children are to be killed. Or where Guido discovers that the doctor is not interested at all in helping him, but is concerned with a riddle that he would like Guido to solve. When Dora is sorting the clothing of the older Jews who have been murdered, I kept expecting her to come across the clothes of Guido's uncle, and from her face, I think she did too. It is a credit to Benigni that he didn't go for melodrama in this scene, but instead focused on Guido's message to Dora over the loudspeaker.I think too often we tend to focus on what happens to people instead of how they deal with what happens to them. This movie made me feel more angry about this part of our history than any other film I've seen, but it also made me feel very hopeful. Benigni, without detracting one bit from the horror of what happened to them, makes heroes out of victims.If you haven't seen this movie, SEE IT (in its subtitled version)! But if what you see is a "comedy" about the holocaust, then you're missing the point....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to disagree with all the people who say that Life is Beautiful makes a joke out of the war. This movie is NOT funny despite all the humor that we hear. As I was laughing at the jokes, I was terrified of the things people made jokes of. This movie screamed out that you don't need blood and gun shots everywhere to tell people about concentration camps. Sure, this isn't as realistic as the real thing was in the 1940s, but who will claim that other World War II movies are completely? This movie is about hope and if humor was the only way to preserve that, then why not use it?Many claimed that Guido's attitude toward life was the way it was to keep his son's sanity, I think that laughing at their experience and playing a game was equally important for both of them as well as people in their bunk.This is a terrific movie and it truly shows that Life IS Beautiful even in the worst of its moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Schindler's list not less than four times, I was convinced that nothing more could be said of the holocaust. I was wrong. Life is Beautiful is not only the most profoundly moving story about the holocaust that I have ever seen, but it is perhaps the most powerful story of Life itself that I have ever seen. The film paints the kind of contrast between good and evil that is most reflective of the deepest things of life. Good does not go head to head with Evil here. It transcends it. In this film, Hate cannot overcome or understand Love the way Darkness cannot overcome or understand Light. The main character, Guido Orifice's simple love for his wife and son is so much more true and real than the hate that surrounds him, that the hate loses its power, even its very existence. I was so moved by this film that I couldn't move from my seat after the credits were finished. I had witnessed true beauty in two hours of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>La vita ? bella is one of the best movies I ever seen. I'm a big fan of Charlie Chaplin and Benigni is to me a modern Chaplin. He combines a sad, even awful event with humor, so you get a movie by which you can laugh and cry at the same time. The movie start out as a pure comedy when Guido (Benigni) and Dora (Braschi) keep bumping in to each other. "Buongiorno principessa" becomes one of the returning lines in the movie. By the second half of the movie, Guido and Dora have a son and in Nazi Italy they are taken to a concentration camp. At this point the movie becomes really beautiful. To protect his son, Guido says that it is all a game where the big prize is a real tank. Benigni is a genius in keeping the balance between humor and drama. I really advise you to go see the movie if you haven't already done that, but don't expect a completely accurate description of the holocaust, because that was not Benigni goal. His goal was to make a movie about the love of a father for his family, a goal which he definitely achieves. 9/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am amazed that people believe Life Is Beautiful is satirizing the Holacaust. Would this allegorical film be less controversial had it been set in Bosnia or in America during slavery or during our continuing racism? Perhaps I am naive, but I choose to see this film as a story about creating hope and trust in a place where neither is present. I believe almost all of us have experienced such a place; perhaps in reality or in our own minds. A time when someone else had to care for you because you could no longer care for yourself. Guido did not see himself as a hero or a helpless victim, nor did his wife. They were simply people who loved their child and each other above all else. I will long remember this film not for any specific scene, although there were many fine ones, but for the amazing example of the potential of the human spirit and the love one may have for another. I wept when I first learned about the Holacaust in sixth grade, I wept when I saw Schlinder's list, I wept at Life is Beautiful. I hope we never forget how brutally one human can treat another. I also hope we never forget the hope and promise that Life is Beautiful displayed so eloquently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful. Not once in the movie did those words get said. And that's just another defining point of what I took away from this film. Everything that was to be said, every message in this movie was not conveyed through brilliant speeches, touching confessions, or other verbal acts. I believed everything I saw in this movie. And the reason for that was, because every thought, every idea, every feeling was not told through straight conversation, it was shown through actions. By the time Guido was getting on the P.a. System, I had forgotten about Dora. I had passed her off as another faceless victim of the Holocaust. Those thoughts prepared me for what is probably the greatest scene ever shown on film. I don't think I've ever cried because I was so happy and touched (I'm 15 years old, and a guy, far too concerned about masculinity and other such things), but I was bawling. I felt ready to be a father, to just try to emulate the love that Guido held for his wife and child. This movie isn't about the Holocaust. The fact that the family was a victim of it is just a plot point. It's not trying to make some touching social commentary about families staying together through the thick of every problem that could roll their way, it's not trying to say something about the sheer hilarity of the Holocaust. It's simply trying to tell a story about a man who loves his family. This movie inspires me daily. This movie has changed my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film turned out to be quite controversial, at least in my country, because of its references to the Holocaust. As for the movie itself, I don´t think it ranks as a masterpiece, as I have seen written all over the media. For starters, Benigni is a great comedy actor, but he isn´t much of a director. The final cut of the movie seems to be made by an amateur. Some scenes have no connection with the plot of the movie, not to mention some fragments of the story that are hard to believe, even in a fiction environment. And, to be perfectly honest, the ending is pathetic... that cliche might have won Benigni some Oscars, but is very antipathic to non-American viewers. To sum up, much ado about nothing, that´s my opinion. The film is good and the idea is actually excellent (perhaps with a better director...), but it isn´t a masterpiece; far from that, it´s a face in the crowd of last year´s film making, with such great titles as "The Thin Red Line".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the film, I am still disturbed over the story. A Jewish father plays games with his son in a Nazi death-camp. I have read a lot of books on the subject of the Holocaust, and none of them ever led me to believe that there was any reason for celebration or games by children or adults in the concentration camps. What makes this idea very sickening is the actual fact that children were either quickly disposed of in the gas chambers or were used for hideous experiments by Nazi doctors. Benigni tries to make light of the realism of the Nazi goal of the "final solution" for the Jews and others. What made the Academy think he deserved best actor for this film?

		<shortDescription>A Story of the Gift of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite a debate has raged about the appropriateness of this somewhat comedic film that touches upon fascism and the Holocaust. How does a movie deal with such evil and tragedy which can easily offend an audience? The Pawnbroker (1965) touches upon such terrible experiences in a touching and yet harsh way through the pain of a Holocaust survivor. The death camp scenes in the Pawnbroker are at times not plausible but the emotion of the movie always rings true. Life is Beautiful is also centered on personal Holocaust experiences but the central character could not have been shown in the realistic way of the Pawnbroker. While the Pawnbroker deals with the anger and the trauma of a Holocaust survivor, Life is Beautiful asks the question, is there something more important than survival?Viktor Frankl, the noted psychiatrist who endured the death camps, saw those who chose to comfort others and though starving gave away their last piece of bread. While he praises these actions, Frankl also makes a chilling comment about such sacrifice. His simple statement speaks volumes, "the best of us did not return". This is at the heart of Life is Beautiful. How does a filmmaker even dare to touch such an explosive subject which casts such a harsh light on all of us and brings profound guilt? Roberto Benigni does the impossible by the use of fable, comedy and dream.Life is Beautiful first uses the style of the great comedian Charlie Chaplin who made the excellent film about Nazi persecution, The Great Dictator (1940). One reason why this film and Life is Beautiful are successful is that the evil of fascism is not discounted. Through the physical comic scenes we slowly see that the fascists without kindness or mercy have no heart or soul. The critics are partly right. Sometimes I felt uncomfortable with comedy in a death camp but these moments passed because this movie is more than just a comedy.The death camp story of Life is Beautiful is also a dream and a nightmare. Here Benigni often uses the style of Fellini very effectively to show the devotion between husband and wife as well as the hell of the final solution.Underneath the comedy and the dreams, in the end, this is a story of the gift of life from a father to son, a gift of life from one human being to another. In many details this is told through fantasy but as with the Pawnbroker, emotionally it rings true. The movie is a fitting tribute to those whose kindness could never be broken even in the death camps and who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Life is Beautiful is a timeless film that deserves every honor showered upon it. Bravo Roberto!</fullReview>

A lot of critics have said that basically, you can't make a comedy about the Holocaust. Maybe it's possible, but this is not the guy to do it. His humor is extremely broad and unsubtle -- I'd even say dated. And he NEVER STOPS YELLING -- even when he's telling his little boy to hide from the Nazis so he won't get "turned into soap." The kid, by the way, is wonderful -- best thing in the film by far. But really, if you're expecting a life-affirming comedy about how the power of love can overcome the most cruel and unfair circumstances... you may be disappointed.

Benigni completely romanticizes it. No one is dirty or overly thin.

		<fullReview>La Vite e Bella is the type of movie that if you liked Forrest Gump (FG) you will love this. Both movies have the exterior vision of merely being a romantic comedy. Yet internally, both movies are talking and expressing very serious subject matters. With FG we see a) How disabled people can contribute to society and other people's lives. b) The movie FG is more about us as normal people than it was about FG. Normal people kill pop stars and politicians, child abuse children, use drugs and generally hurt others through words. With La Vita e Bella, the message is not about war, but how do you protect sensitive people to the violence and insanity around them. We do it everyday with violent TV progs and films. How do you control what young children watch and hear? To what extent will it affect them? Should we lie to our children to protect them from the outside world? The movie also shows true romance and love no matter how bad your situation is. The movie is not saying that lying is a way out of tricky situations, rather change the situation into a parable or a game like what Christ did to lessen the impact upon others. This movie is a 10/10 classic and deserves the Oscars hands down for its creativity, originality and being able to place two movies into one effortlessly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me first say that I don't think Life Is Beautiful trivializes the Holocaust. Admittedly it uses the stark cruelty and violence of the Holocaust only as a back-drop to love of a father who is desperately trying to protect his son by playing a game which has a comedic outcome to the viewer, but in fact is a deadly game. I'm sure the actual cruelty was also soft-pedalled somewhat so as not to overshadow the father/son relationship. However Roberto Benigni who co-wrote, directed, and starred in this film makes no doubt as to how he feels about the perpetrators of the Holocaust and mocks them at every turn whether it be his comment about "Visigoths and spiders" or the using of the guard at the camp or the shallowness of what appeared to be a sympathetic friend/camp doctor. Chaplin, the Marx Brothers, and even (forgive me) the Three Stooges have all mocked the Fascists. I believe that Benigni, who is brilliant in all his roles, in this film offers a story of triumph of the human spirit where comedy is only protection for his son. The film also captures the era well and features a strong performance by Nicolleta Braschi as his wife and an outstanding performance by Georgio Cantarini as his son. I will see this film again. Four stars!</fullReview>

It's no secret that Benigni is the spiritual successor to Chaplin (and Keaton as well) but he has now made a film that is worthy of Chaplin. In fact, while Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR is uneven - thanks to it being ahead of it's time - Benigni has managed to complete the work and convey the message that Chaplin attempted valiantly with that film. Benigni's heart, humor, intuition and artistry has resulted in a miracle - a comic masterpiece set in the holocaust.</fullReview>

Even though "Central Station" from Brazil is also a brilliant film, I recognize that "Life is Beautiful" deserves the Academy Award for Best Picture in a Foreign Language. Thanks Italy for offering the world such a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic movie... why some people do not look at it the right way?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing must be clear about "la vita e' bella": it's not a movie about the holocaust!!! All those people that fell "offended" by this movie should have a less biased look to it. The Holocaust is intended to be, like in a fable, the SYMBOL of evil. And in a fable you don't need to be crude or realistic, you only need to understand the true message this movie gives us: love can beat evil! In every situation, love and a true smile (life is beautiful) can shield innocence from being corrupted from evil. And it is possible to die still smiling and playing this wonderful game that life is... and human dignity still remains alive! Some people criticize the fact that the prison camp in unreal (but some believe it's in Italy, where no nazi prison camp ever been made!), but all the movie is symbolic and "unreal"... it's a fable where we can laugh and cry together, where we can "feel" the power of life and love. Many Israel people have understood this message, and they loved the movie. I did! One of the best movies of the century! Just one more information: Benigni's father was imprisoned in a nazi camp, and when were asked from his child to tell his story, he invented a sort of fable... from this memory the idea of the movie came to Benigni... to tell how love can shelter a child from horror!Ciao</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the 4th performance of Benigni's that I've seen. In the other three I felt that either I was missing something (that was as plain as day to Italians), or that he just wasn't quite nailing "it." Well, this time I felt he did. With much respect to the critics of his treatment of the holocaust, he managed to convey its brutality to me, ie when the children and elderly were on their way to being "showered", the Germans shouting a bunch of harsh sounding and untranslated words, Jews being carried from their homes without a moment's notice... Those scenes sent chills up my spine. I really don't think anyone will ever take what happened lightly because of this film, (unless they were predisposed to taking it lightly before they saw it). Rather than make light of it, I felt he was showing how far his character had to go, and how inventive he had to be to protect his son mentally and physically from the horrors that surrounded both of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a very cynical filmgoer. I will routinely deride a film for any scene that strikes me as overly sentimental, melodramatic, or unrealistic. I do not cry often at movies. "Life is Beautiful," however, is so brilliantly executed that I was forced to set aside all of my prejudices regarding movies. Indeed, in a real concentration camp, Guido could never have commandeered the PA system and spoken to his wife. Yet I watched that scene, entirely aware it was unrealistic, with tears running down my face. Such is the power of "Life is Beautiful." I never thought a movie could make me laugh and cry at the same time, but that happened more than once here. Appreciate this film for what it is. If you want to see a harrowing, realistic depiction of the Holocaust, watch "Schindler's List." If you want a portrayal of the bond between a man and his family, the sacrifices people will make for their children, and the triumph of human spirit over adversity, see "Life is Beautiful." A lesser filmmaker could have severely botched this material, but Roberto Benigni pulls it off with aplomb. His film is magical, emotional, spiritual, and simply beautiful. Do not miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had to be one of the most moving I have seen since Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown. While singing the praises of this movie, I feel I must rebutt some of the previous comments. After 50 years, there is a widely held cultural context for the horrors of the Holocaust and the concentration camps, and I feel that Benigni is drawing on that in this film. Do we really need to see the horrors and obscenity of the concentration camps again to know that they are there? I think that bombarding the audience with horrific images can be a numbing experience, while subtle imagery (the cat searching for it's owner in the pile of clothing, the elderly and children undressing under the cold, steely gaze of the female guard, etc.) are enough to convey the complete inhumanity present. If you really needed a little gore to convince you things were bad, there was the 2 story surreal pile of bodies emerging from the mist. Lack of gore should not be seen as a lack of condemnation of the horrors of the Holocaust, and its lack of such sets it apart from other films dealing with the same subject matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Life is Beautiful" has its share of flaws. But that doesn't matter, because it is easily the most powerful film of any released in America during 1998. Grippingly, it tells the story of Guido, an Italian Jew, played by Roberto Benigni and how he does everything in his power to spare the life of his son during the Holocaust. I've heard that one of the main criticisms of the film is that it strains credibility from time to time. While this may be true, it behoves us to think back to a similar Holocaust drama, "Europa, Europa," which is an even more incredible and seemingly implausible story - and based on a real-life account. Thus, it was easy enough for me personally to suspend my disbelief while watching this wonderful film. It's been several years since I was this moved at the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just gotten back from the theater and I am still stunned. I think what made this film so unusual is that the two principal characters, Guido and Dora, are selfless and truly in love. This is a film about falling in love, as 99% of romances are, but also of *staying* in love and what that that truly means--following your family to near-certain death, thinking of your wife's worry enough to reassure her you and your son still live, sheltering your son from the cruelties of life. Where American cine is absorbed with the self-absorbed lovers, this film focuses on the love expended on others--a rare treat.I truly think I saw tonight one of the best films of the decade, if not of all time. A few scenes--the boy meeting the American tank, Dora stepping into the train, the rain-soaked wooing--are so specatular they can't help but be indelible.Two weaknesses--the execution of Guido is so nonchalant that it is almost impactless. Sure, we see him give his son a final salute, but the offscreen shooting is anti-climatic. Secondly, the death camp seems as harsh as a prison, but no concentration camp. The ghastliness of this butchering, seen in clearer focus, would have made Guido's actions all the more heroic.</fullReview>

In some sense it is close to "Titanic" because it makes an entertainment from a great tragedy, but here there is no attemt to achieve crude realism, and for this reason the movie is much more truthful. Also, the contrast between comedy on the surface and the tragedy deep inside is so great, that it makes your mind be strangely divided between two contradictory feelings of laugh and anguish.

		<shortDescription>Life is Beautiful (1997-98) - La Vita e' bella: Italian translation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Italian national treasure Roberto Benigni makes his greatest film ever with the story of making every day into a beautiful day, even if every day is a tragedy. The movie begins as a romantic comedy, where Benigni plays Guido, a charismatic waiter with a desire to make life beautiful, and then he falls in love with the girl of his dreams. Five years later, he lives a happily married life with a new son named Joshua. Then, the movie starts to enter dramatic proportions. Guido's fairytale life takes a serious turn, when he and his family are sent to the concentration camps during the Holocaust, and tries to show his son that this is just a simple game. He wraps up this beautiful message, and makes a beautiful movie called "Life is Beautiful". Now I think that since you are reading this, you might think this review is only in Italian. Well, the answer is 'no'. But here's what I have to say about the movie: although the movie was Italian, I can understand the deep and true heart to this story. Roberto Benigni arranges a great script, an excellent score by Nicola Piovani, and also arranges a hilarious performance for himself as the man who makes life beautiful. Also, the comedy in one half of the film, switches to a part of the film that takes place during the Holocaust, and that brings a dramedy charm to it. The film is a great portrait of family, courage, and imagination, and the movie is something I can watch again and again either in English or Italian. "Life is Beautiful", in my review, "beautifully meaningful, and contains a huge heart".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life isn't so Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benigni; an Italian actor, screenwriter, director, and (lets not forget) comedian, won an Academy Award for Best Actor, after portraying Guido ? an Italian Jew who manages to conjure-up humorous stories at a concentration camp where his wife and son are captive. The only excuse for his behaviour is the need to cloud the truth from his son Joshua. Whether this reason is enough to mock the true horrors of the Holocaust is a debate of its own.After moving to Arezzo, Guido intends to open a bookstore. Here, the director begins to implement Fascist undertones, such as the Fascist leader who refuses to give Guido a signature to allow him to open his own bookstore. Guido then realises that Dora, who later becomes his wife, is the head Fascists fiancée.For a while, 'Life' does actually seem 'Beautiful', and Benigni's comedy is plausible. The film hints very little anti-Semitic references in the beginning, until Hitler's army evict Guido and his son, Joshua, from their home and guide them to a concentration camp. After Dora manages to track them down, she is voluntarily allowed to join the captives.Guido and his son, along with the other male captives, are sectioned off from the women. Guido reassures Joshua that this is his birthday surprise, and that it is a test of endurance which, in exchange for points will result in a 'prize', a life-size tank.There is an awkward resemblance between him and the infamous Chaplin who was widely famous for portraying Hitler in a comedic fashion (most memorably 'The Great Dictator'). The difference however is that Guido's character, unlike Chaplin, was created long after the war, and at a time when the Holocaust was distant from becoming history, Chaplin's humour was taken at face value. Chaplin was later to apologise to the US for his portrayal of sucha serious event, and admittedly acknowledged that if he knew the true atrocities of the war, he would have reconsidered his approach.Benigni's film however was released in 1997, a very sensitive and historical era. Many of the films that depicted the Holocaust during the 90's have proposed a serious effort to recreate the realism and stigma that revolved the captivation and mass murder of innocent Jews. Most memorably, Spielberg's seven-time academy award-winning 'Schindler's List' (1994) depicts a tremendously reckless vision of horror and the innocent murder of men, women and children. I cannot imagine to compare both films with the same frame of mind, which begs the question, should all films revolving the Holocaust be seen in the same way? Take a modern event, the 9/11 disaster, could you see such an event become apart of a comedy hybrid? It begs the question as to whether it is ethical for a comedian to direct and act in a film which is expected to have serious undertones.Benigni had been approached on many occasions over this issue. He claimed that he was not making a comedy of the Holocaust, but instead a comic who lived through the Holocaust. If you take the comedy out of this film, you are left with a very pathetic approach to the true events inflicted by Hitler's army. There is a lack of reality, for example, all the captives seem clean shaven, the boy is miraculously able to hide for days inside the cabin without getting caught, and there is little emphasis on death. Shockingly, Guido is able to hijack a booth where he makes 'loving' and reassuring announcements to his wife Dora over a microphone, and is not left severely punished, or worse, shot! In the beginning, Guido even pretends to know German, and offers to translate the Nazi's instructions to the camp, whilst all along reassuring Joshua that it is a game, depriving the others of important information for their survival.Such events are highly unrealistic, and any of these attempts would be treated without tolerance. Romance, comedy, and a hazardous attitude are probably the last things on a Jewish captives mind at the Holocaust. Furthermore, it is worrying when spectators laugh at Benigni's material, as it is definitely far from a laughing matter.It's even more unrealistic when Guido dies from a gunshot (off camera of course), after getting caught trying to find his wife Dora. He instructs Joshua to stay in a sweatbox until he hears and sees no one. Soon the camp is dry, and the Nazi's are driven out by the American force, and Joshua is approached by a friendly American in a life-size tank. The boy rides the tank, and is soon reunited with his mother.In Benigni's world of fiction, life truly seems 'beautiful', but it doesn't take much research to unveil the true horrors that came with the Nazi war effort.I give this film 1 out of 5 for its unreal, thoughtless and inconsiderate approach.Article By Screen Reverend @ www.screenreverend.co.cc</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film meant a lot to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously by reading over the comments there is a wide range of views regarding this film. I am by no means a film critic, however I am very sensitive to making light of serious topics. I am sad to see that some found this film so offensive. The majority of people that I know who have seen this film feel that they grew as a person from seeing the film once, however found the holocaust backdrop to upsetting to see again.Although the beginning of the movie is a lot of slapstick type humour (which is not usually my style) I think that it was meant to develop the character of Guido and his way of living in every moment minute by minute and not taking life to seriously.In the second half of the movie the humour was definitely turned way down. Although it was not a realistic depiction of a Nazi work camp (which is what I belief it was supposed to be as opposed to a death camp) I feel it still demonstrated the horrors of the holocaust without being graphic...it had definite references to those who could no longer work being led to their deaths, children being led to death showers, betrayal, and the horrors and complete dehumanization that that occurred in Nazi Germany. I did not feel that the film made light of the horrors that occurred.The acts of Guido to attempt to protect his child to me were thought provoking. The ability to totally loose yourself in the protection of others is an important concept in my mind be it your child or a stranger. In no way did it appear to me that Guido took the situation lightly...instead he was doing the only thing he knew to do and the only thing that gave him reason to live...protecting his son.The title "life is beautiful" in no way pretends that there is anything remotely beautiful that can be taken from the situation of the holocaust. Instead, what is beautiful is the strength of the human spirit to overcome including forgetting oneself for the well-being others.To me it also speaks to life in the innocence of a child being beautiful and the importance of protecting that as well as being grateful for every moment of peace we live in and recognizing how each day of peace we live in is a blessing. The holocaust was a horrific unspeakable event that was in no way beautiful and I don't think that the movie was in any way trying to say otherwise. I definitely think the movie is worth seeing once as it deeply touched me and made me think of ways in which I could be more selfless and realize how good I have it and the importance for me to try to enjoy every little moment of peace and safety I am blessed with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie of all time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although many will not say this is possibly the best movie ever made, I say it is. I mean, there is almost nothing wrong in this film.Starting out as a romantic comedy, we meet the characters in Life Is Beautiful. Much depth is given to the main character, Guido Orefice. The man is just awesome and never once does he regret the life he has, even when shut behind the evil of the concentration camps. Dora is the girl he's in love with. Although I found her performance the weakest in the film, she still did a good job at portraying a woman dying to escape the lonely and miserable rich life. She decides finally to run off with Guido, and this is when the movies transitions from romantic comedy to a beautiful drama.The movie puts us ahead by five or so years. We meet the adorable son of Guido, Joshua (I may have forgotten his name so I'm not sure if I'm right). Although given only about ten minutes to develop before the Holocaust, you can't help falling in love with the little boy who just unconditionally loves his father. Some Nazi stuff is foreshadowed before the next part of the film, preparing the audience for what is to come.Finally, our characters shipped off to a concentration camp. The movie drastically changes but in a comfortable manner. Guido convinces his son they are in a game in which they are competing to win a tank. Joshua eventually believes this, and their lives begin to spiral downhill farther than ever. They see some ugly things and everything they do has death knocking on their door. But they stay alive, and you really feel for the characters when some hope is lost in them. You know they don't deserve such a life.But things only get worse when the war ends. Back in the Holocaust, Nazis would start a massacre within the camp when they would hear that their enemy was coming. One of the characters (I will not say which) is killed rather suddenly, but still is effective in a good way. It is so sad because of what has happened. Two characters are finally reunited as the prisoners escape from the Nazi camp, and the story ends at that.After this I found myself appreciating just the making of this film because it was so well-handled. The Holocaust is a touchy subject but not once is the situation abused in the comedy and wealth of the story. The movie was well-penned and directed, and Bengini really knew what he was doing. The movie had the perfect balance of light and dark, and flaws are invisible unless you try really hard to find out what they are. This movie deserves a perfect score: a 10/10. Life really is beautiful.</fullReview>

After watching the film in full I felt that this was like a Disney movie from the 1950s or 60s: charming, mildly entertaining, but always shallow.

		<fullReview>I know that people who watch this movie will find it disturbing, but the love and fight of Roberto's character is unbelievably wonderful. His will to keep his son alive and safe, and letting his wife know that he loves her and still alive, I love it. The best seen of this movie is when he plays an old opera that he and his wife share a love for and he sneakingly plays it while in a Concentration Camp to give hope to her. It is a beautiful song and I have the wish to find it, but I think he is brilliant. The story is touching and I think that everyone should see this movie because it will fill their hearts with joy. It really is amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one film that should be seen at least once a year! NEVER AGAIN! This shows that it was not just German Jews who suffered but Hebrew people from all nations and ethnic backgrounds wherever the monster known as the Nazional Socialist Party was found in those years.Jews from as far from Germany as Italy, Ethiopia like me or from Persia, etc. who happened to be in Europe or in the Middle East at the time when the Nazi's invaded were all subject to being captured and seeing a tragic end come to them in the Nazi death camps.This film is more tragic than humor. Especially at the end, which I will not reveal, because I do not want to spoil it for you. Enough to say it could have had a happier ending and I will leave it at that.They should show this film on Pesakh and even more appropriately for on Purim but not on Khanukkah as the sometimes tend to do. Khanukkah is a different kind of remembrance so TV stations, I advise you to show Fiddler on the Roof instead of this film on Khanukkah. This film is best suited for Purim because Hitler and Haman were the same kind of monster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is spite of its immediate success, "Life is Beautiful", is destined for even more significant greatness. This movie will stand the test of time. The picture is a swirl of metaphors, symbolisms, contrasts, and foreshadowing.The movie starts with one man's extremely carefree life, a comedy. The movie in contrast concludes with the same man's sacrifice and agony, a tragedy. I'd highly recommend this movie for a film appreciation class. A close study in a group setting would be very enlightening and entertaining for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is beautiful - a marvellous film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years we have all seen Holocaust films and TV documentary's, read harrowing Holocaust History books and by using our imaginations we have slept in the barracks, spit out the food offered, and walked in striped prisoner clothing the degrading camp streets of Auschwitz- Birkenau, Treblinka, Belzec, Sorbibor, Dachau and Mauthausen. We need to remember that there was 2700 concentration camps, most of which, Chelmno and Gross Rosen for instance, no one remembers today.Whilst watching this wonderful film Life is Beautiful, we ourselves become Jews, we instinctively identify with camp people of all races and deep down we know we would not have survived the camps, perhaps most of us would not want to survive such inhumane and incomprehensible treatment. So, let's imagine we did survive the camps, if we did then hopefully Life would be beautiful. So it goes without saying that we have a duty especially if we have not been in a concentration camp to see that it is beautiful for us and for all others within our family circle and orbit. And this is for me the humanitarian message contained in this great film - to make life beautiful for all. It is without a top 10 Classic film, there's no police chases, no street-smart gangsters, no blonde molls, no letters of transit, or aeroplanes to Lisbon and freedom, but it contains pathos, real life true-isms we cannot not ignore, and a hero who rides a bike and laughs. I understand the actress who played our hero's wife is in fact his real life wife, which is rather touching, if only we all had a wife like her. The acting, lighting and filming are first rate, and without doubt it is the film of the decade, and in 50 years time it will have a huge audience. If you have it on a video then save it, this film and anything connected to it, including old posters, will one day fetch thousands on Ebay and at Sothebys auctions.One personal regret "I wish I had been involved with the production, the tea boy observer perhaps, and whoever wrote the script and placed it on the screen for us all to enjoy is a genius. Thank you to all who worked on this film, thank you for allowing your world and your unique Italian humour to touch our lives. Thank you for telling us that Life is Beautiful.

		<shortDescription>The true meaning of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life is beautiful" is with no doubt a masterpiece. It pictures the "love" so perfectly. Love of a husband to his wife, and love of a father to his son. Roberto Benigni stars as Guido Orefice in the movie, who is trying to make his son believe that being in a Nazi death camp is just a game, and he does it perfectly by his sense of humor. And it's wonderful that you cry because of the pain that Guido takes and because of he was killed for his family, AND you laugh because of the game he made for his son to not suffer anymore. All I can say is that you can feel the REAL love when you see this movie. My grade is A without any doubt. A "must see" movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"La Vita Bella" is a wonderful movie (especially if you watch it with English subtitles and hear the beautiful Italian language spoken). Even if you do not like the Italian language, this movie is very well written. The war setting is perfect for the character development. This movie is categorized as a drama, however, I believe it would be better described as a compound love story. It is the story of a man's love for his wife and son. Refreshingly, it's also about the man's love for life in general. He approaches every situation with a positive attitude and conquers his goals, no matter what is at stake. It is the best feel good movie I have ever seen. Though the plot is not the most complex I have ever seen, it triumphs in its innovation and keeps the viewer engaged and entertained to the last. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has a love for dramas and love stories alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Italian Neo-Realism Flipped on it's head...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...And it's skull cracked as it landed. Instead of feeling real in any way, this is the most contrived, artificial thing I've ever seen. Instead of being a powerful portrayal of a problem that touches us all, this is a weak attempt to show people overcoming a threat that is portrayed very badly. After a somewhat effective opening scene establishing Guido the main character, we start story A. "Guido(who is so poorly portrayed that you will never for a second stop thinking its Roberto Benigni) meets a beautiful woman who has to abort her wedding and go off with him." Forget the fact he is able to meet her only through an extremely belief-straining series of coincidences which really aren't that funny, but the idea that she feels compelled to even cope with, much less love, a guy who flails his arms like he's on fire and speak like a kid on crack to her is impossible to believe. Story B: the over-hyped holocaust comedy section. People wonder how Guido manages to keep his son in the dark about what's going on around him (which is very questionable in and of itself ethically) The answer is that what happens simply does not reflect the holocaust properly. There isn't the hideous lice problem that existed, offices are left unattended so that Guido can go in them and make a disgustingly sweet moment by playing a record to the camp, piles of dead bodies do not result in the stench simple logic requires they would have, etc. Forget being indignant, just the irritation was reason enough not to waste your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Beautiful As It Sounds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally: I loved this movie, even before I knew it won 3 Oscars. Robert Benigni has done a super job acting. I would say he was a genius disguised in a clown in this movie. So impressing.The message: The message of the movie is as clear as its title. So deep it is, like I've never seen a movie holding such a deep message. It tells people, that no matter how much worse life could get, you can still make it seem like a beautiful flower to others, and this is the only way you can make life as beautiful as it could get.The dialogues: The dialogues were in harmony with the rhythm of the movie, they were cheerful and realistic at the same time.The soundtrack: The soundtracks in this movie can't get any more better than they was. I consider them the best movie-matching soundtrack I ever heard, and the most beautiful emotionally expressing through sound the same message the movie is trying to convey. You can notice that the sound of the soundtrack is very flexible, it was altered by the genius Nicola Piovani in a way to suit for either happy/cheerful times, and sad/dramatic times.Conclusion: This is the most beautiful movie I ever seen since 1984; the day of my birth. I never laughed and cried as much at the same time in one movie. Life is beautiful, but it can't get any more beautiful if you don't intend seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes You Laugh and Cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been numerous films about the Holocaust: A few of them were mediocre, many of them good, and a few were real masterpieces (with "Schindler's List" topping the latter league). However, in my humble opinion, "La Vita e Bella" deserves special praise because it is truly unique in its approach of this great historical tragedy: More specifically, the movie manages artfully to make you occasionally laugh loudly, while on the same time it keeps this grave horror in its proper perspective, and therefore makes you cry; especially in the end, it makes you cry fiercely.The actors' performances are great, with Roberto Benigni being simply superb in his role of the straggling father, who despite his agony and suffering, cleverly manages to portray the concentration camp as a game to his son, in order to protect him from realizing the terror he is in.Although some things are a bit oversimplified (e.g., the camp is depicted as place where the main problem is not the death but the hard work, without showing pictures of harassed and degraded inmates), this approach is followed in order to keep the balance explained in the beginning of this critique: "La Vita e Bella" tries to tell us a very serious story, yet it also tries to remind us that we have to keep our mood always positive, no matter the circumstances, and then we might have a chance to get away with it. Little Joshua can tell you more about how to do it... A 9/10 film.</fullReview>

Indeed, absolutely nothing as "La vita e bella" is just the kind of movie that has to be seen and that has to be watched over as soon as it is on the television screen. A comedy that is filmed around the dramatic adventures on some concentration camp and Roberto Begnini isn't the sort of preacher (certainly not at the end) and as viewer you simply don't know what to do : laughing or crying... You know that laughing is a very bitter thing to do in situations like these but still it works... Some scenes are heartbreaking, or may I say the lowest common factor humankind can fall into (the scene at where Begnini expects help from some "befriended" SS-general turns out to be finding a solution for a stupid riddle). There isn't a real message and if there is one then it must be keep on smiling. "La vitta e bella" won 3 Oscars, and for Christsake, it might have made Begnini crazy, but it's still too less...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trust me... this will of course ruin the movie if you read on. Course I thought it was disappointing anyway.The whole comment above would read, Pretty good movie up until that cruel twist.We watched this in film class. And I will admit that I'd been wanting to see this for quite awhile. The fact is, I found it to be one of the most disappointing movies of all time. I've seen my fair share of movies, and I'd thought this to be a family movie. But it really isn't. It lures you cruely into thinking it's a romantic comedy underlined with the Holocaust. The teacher said this is a good tear jerker. Almost 5 days later, I'm still in disbelief that he was shot to death. I had no time to cry over it. It says at the end.. this is the sacrifice that my father made. Yeah... he was more stupider than Ernest P Worrel. (nevermind)I figured as they were writing.. they decided to kill someone off for fun. To show that the Holocaust wasn't a fairy tale. It sure was a poor way of doing it. There's alot of tragic movies out there that are better than this. Braveheart, The English Patient, Titanic. Hell.. Face/Off... what else?? Hmmm.. oh wait... This is a silly reference.. Mortal Kombat 2. Johnny Cage is killed. WTF??I do realize that alot of people like this movie. That's great. I'm glad they liked it. But I didn't. I'll probably never watch this movie again. (watch it in italian) I will admit however that the best actor nod was probably dead on. And it's not like this is a poor quality show, I just figure that this guy had no brains. The wife was screwed up in the first place by getting on that train. She in a sense killed her love. And he shoulda thought more about his son than going off looking for his wife. That's no sacrifice to me.6/10Quality: 10/10 (Writing: 3/10) Entertainment: 5/10 Replayable: 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Italian movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, perhaps I overdid it in my summary. Better movies have come out of Italy, but still, La Vita ? bella deserves to be in a Top 50, if not Top 10. It really does.With this film, comedian Roberto Benigni had a huge responsibility: to amuse people, without making them forget it's a story about one of the most awful periods in human history.He has succeeded admirably, making a true masterpiece, which also perfectly defines the concept of "dramatic comedy".The first part, with Jewish waiter Guido Orefice(Benigni) getting in trouble with an arrogant Fascist(or,as he calls him, "lo scemo delle uova", the eggs-idiot)while he courts the latter's fiancée, Dora(Benigni's actual wife Nicoletta Braschi), aka "Principessa", is pure entertainment.The trouble,as well as the really funny bits, starts six years later, as Guido, Dora and their son Giosué(Giorgio Cantarini)are taken to a Nazi camp.To make sure his son doesn't worry, Guido tells him it's a game, and that they have to stay there until they've scored 1000 points.That's the movie's real strength: it's heartbreaking to watch the conditions in which the prisoners are, but we can't stop laughing when we see the various tricks used by our hero to keep his little boy unaware of what's really going on (the scene where he translates the Nazi orders in Italian is priceless).Another director would probably have focused more on just the laughs or just the tear-inducing scenes, Benigni, on the other hand, has created a perfect balance between comedy and tragedy, one of the best movies in history, not to mention the best one he's ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roberto Benigni, the Italian Chaplin, has made, in 'Life is Beautiful', a comedy about the holocaust. Which first begs the question: is it acceptable to do such a thing? To which the answer must be "yes". Often the best (and most unsettling) comedy is the blackest, in which the intertwining of the funny and the tragic makes us consider afresh the absurdity of life and death. And the holocaust, sadly, was horrific precisely because by the fact that it happened it proved that such events do fall within the range of human behaviour. If, in remembering the holocaust, we can only do so with solemnity, we put it in a mausoleum outside of the rest of human experience; and are thereby less, not more, likely to understand and remember.But this leads onto a second question: is it possible to make a comedy about the holocaust (or at any rate a good one)? Here the sheer scale of the awfulness makes a positive answer harder to give: for such a film to work, the comedy must be commensurate with the tragedy; and this perhaps cannot be done. An earlier (and brilliant) film of Benigni's, 'Johnny Stecchino', poked fun at gangsters: but even then, it was working with stereotyped gangsters as depicted in movies, not at real murderers extinguishing human life. With the holocaust, there is no such get outs: few have even dared make straight movies about this subject.The first half of 'Life is Beautiful' is a classic Benigni romp, poking some gentle fun at the less extreme excesses of Italian fascism as it proceeds. It's silly but good, a story of inescapable charm. But in the second half, the scene moves to somewhere like Auschwicz, and the film becomes more problematic. The idea (of a man who uses humour to save his son, and himself, from confronting the true horror of his situation) has some merit but is ultimately not sustainable in the face of reality. So the film has to tone down reality. Benigni is treated rather better than the average Auschwicz inmate (the film nowhere implies just how low the survival rate was); his fellow prisoners are shown as faceless zombies (distancing us when they do get killed); while when the subject of mass murder is directly addressed, the film inevitably slumps into mawkishness. There are still some good gags, and occasionally some telling moments (particularly those involving a "humane" doctor who Beningi befriends); but overall the setting rings false. The film might have achieved more poignancy and realism had it been set in a pre-deportation Jewish ghetto: by going all the way to the death camps, it overplays its hand.'Life is Beautiful' is still a funny and original film; but actually less brave than you might at first think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The script has some brilliant ideas, but the film is lack of interest, art and even heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to some people, Life is Beautiful is one of the best movies of all time, and for some, the best movie of all time, yes, because the movie seems sweet, right? How? There is a family, we watch how the father and the mother meet, oh! how romantic and warm it is. Many people like such things, the meeting stories. Sometimes, it begins with saying in a rainy day... In the first half, we see some superficial slapstick comedy. Comedy is different, tragicomic is different, Life is Beautiful is not tragicomic till the final that shook me a little. It is clearly seen that Benigni inspired from Charlie Chaplin movies, but if you ask me, his film, Life is Beautiful cannot be even "C" of Charlie Chaplin movies. People say that the first half is comedy, the second half is tragedy. No. There is nothing devastating or shaking in the movie. Benigni runs after only romance and comedy and little drama, but he does not show anything to us about the conflict or the intensity of the situation. If the story had been told in a different way, with a different mood (tragicomic and serious), it could have been a masterpiece. The idea is brilliant (a father who tries to conceal the (bitter) fact from his little son by saying all this is a game in a concentration camp), but the execution is zero. However, also the movie was excruciatingly boring, I don't know how did it happen, but for me it is the same as Fellini's Otto e Mezzo in terms of lacking interest. The (too heavy?) style including cinematography is lack of effect, lack of cinema feeling, thus the movie is lack of real art and even heart! I couldn't feel anything for the situations of the characters personally and the heartwarming, heartbreaking tone of the film didn't seem me sincere (I mean made for audiences) If you think that I exaggerate too much, please watch The Pianist or Schindler's List again to be sure (both are excellent movies by the way) Roberto Benigni was not the right person for this project I believe. His approach, execution is the same as street theater or child theater which no objection, but for such a story, almost unbearable. Yes, also the movie is not realistic, but it is not important, welcome to this fantasy, an alternative history or an inventive story, but as said, the movie can't carry that great idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie and has such high hopes for it. I thought it was going to be an amazing movie since it has received several good reviews. However I was greatly disappointed in this movie. As many others have stated, the first half of the movie is very boring. It's also not funny at all. I honestly found Guido to be very, very annoying. I also thought the way he tried to win over Dora was stupid. I mean to be honest, I just did not find him charming, or romantic. He was just not funny. I kept thinking to myself when is he going to get the girl so that all this nonsense stops. The second part of the movie was a little bit better, but not much. I could not stand the way Guido kept telling his son that them being there at the camp was a game, and that he would win a tank. I mean I know you don't want to scare your kids but come on. If I was a child and my father kept telling me stuff like that, I would know it wasn't true. I highly doubt his son was stupid, and I'm pretty sure he had an idea of what was going on. All in all, I just did not care for this movie. I found it slow, with lame attempts at comedy, and it just didn't keep my interest. THis movie did not touch me the way others say it has, and no I don't have a heart of ice, I am actually a very sensitive person. It didn't make me cry. I am glad I only rented it and did not purchase it. I give it a 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

Of course, no one could hide a child for that long in an adult barrack in a concentration camp! Furthermore: of course a prisoner could not get around like that, and suddenly act as a waiter for example just because it was suitable for him at the moment. Where did he get the appropriate clothes just like that, for example..? And then I have not even started yet, on how the father, the son, and the other prisoners could be so clean, well-nourished, and healthy-looking...I think this movie simply should never have been made..!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hated this film for so many reasons I do not really know where to begin. I am sick reading reviews that claim Roberto Benigni as the new Chaplin. Chaplin this man is not. Slapstick is a bit like ballet, it is either really good or painfully bad, and this movie was painfully bad. I am not a snob when it comes to humor but some of the scenes were so ridiculously mediocre and rigid that it took me all my patience not to vomit (as a previous reviewer claimed to accomplish after watching Schindlers list).Furthermore, I am sick of people saying..."well it was just the portrayal of the Holocaust as a child would have seen it". What nonsense. Why would a child see the horrors and mindless brutality of a concentration camp any differently than an adult? The reality was that women and children were immediately separated from the men and often marched straight to the gas chamber. To suggest that someone could just hide a child under their bed for the duration of the war is ludicrous. The character Guido was able to strut around the camp like he was on some kind of a vacation, mocking his German guards as you would an incompetent schoolteacher. The German guards were portrayed as the proverbial straight guys and the butt of a joke that I could never fathom.Maybe I am missing something here but anyone who left this film with a warm fuzzy feeling is profoundly ignorant. I do not agree with the many reviews that say "if you want the real story watch Shindlers list" or "this is a fine example of the spirit of man in the face of adversity". This is an example of nothing more than a poorly constructed comic farce that uses the Holocaust as a backdrop. The Holocaust was about the brutal mass subjugation and extermination of six million people. It should never be portrayed as anything less, and in this film it was. The Holocaust should never be used as a comic platform for a father and son bonding farce. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a quaking wreck of a movie: humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie although I had a strong sense beforehand that it was drastically misguided, after seeing it, I realized that it was far worse than I could have imagined. Roberto Benigni in his benighted way, probably thinks what he did here was heroic, I can excuse poor judgement and taste in an artist, but for the life of me, I cannot fathom how anything so misbegotten could be so popular and somewhat critically acclaimed. Certainly, there are true stories of incredible bravery, fortitude and even humor in the face of such unrelenting evil, but these are true stories (like the escape from Sobibor). Benigni, however, creates, out of whole cloth, as far as I can tell, a fairy tale which uses the Holocaust as background. He creates a character and situations that could simply not exist under such conditions and are not even remotely related to anyone or anything in the history of the holocaust. To further compound the problem, he constructs Aushwitz-lite in which the latter half of the movie takes place. A place with gas chambers, unrelenting, (but Chaplin-esque) hard labor, and with such seemingly lax security that Benigni's character can commandeer the camp's PA system, and effectively hide his son. Further, the inmates, who in reality, were starved and worked to death never appeared more than "bushed." These fictional liberties, to my mind, are unforgiveable. The Holocaust is always foreground, and there is no "lite" available. The Germans simply killed you, unrelentingly, for any reason whatsoever. Further, one of the worst aspects of arrival at a death camp like Aushwitz was the sudden separation (culling) of the children from the parents, husbands from wives. This activity, never overlooked, immediately told the prisoners they had passed from the land of the living into hell. Somehow this little fact was passed over by Benigni. He simply keeps his son with him. Indeed, none of the playful little camp activities portrayed could have ever existed for even a milli-second. Benigni's story could have taken place in any particular bad situation, why set it in a concentration camp. Perhaps my reaction seems humorless, but really, the humor here is strained and out of place. What was he thinking? Evil triumphed, millions were dispatched in the most monstrous of conditions. Nothing can modify this, the pure fact of its occurrence makes interpretation, let alone heart warming entertainment an impossibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect film for Holocaust deniers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My summary says it all. This film is an insult to anyone who lived through the real thing. No concentration camp even remotely resembled what is shown in this film. No child would ever be successfully hidden from those running the concentration camp. Anyone who acted like the character played by Roberto Benigni would have been immediately killed. If Benigni wanted to make a film about a father protecting his son from the evils in the world, he could have invented any situation or set of circumstances he wanted. He certainly didn't have to, and shouldn't have, totally misrepresented this period of time in modern history. For reality, try watching "The Pianist". Try visiting the Holocaust Museum. Take the time to see and learn what really happened. Life was not beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How on earth this awful film got so many awards in beyond me......Was their thinking "Its a movie vaguely involving the holocaust so it must be worthy of our shiny gongs"? This film is a vacuous flight of fantasy in very, very poor taste. It re-writes the holocaust as a not-very-nice-but-manageable experience which is nothing short of a sin. It dilutes the naked truth of what is possibly one of the most important events in modern history.Millions of people were horribly killed but this film edits that startling reality into nothing more than a cheap feel good soap opera. Don't get me wrong I loved "Spring time in Hitler" and can even excuse jokes about the holocaust but what bugs me about this film is it is trying on some level to be realistic and it falls so far short its criminal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That seems to be a favourite cliché applied to this fantasy film. The entire movie apparently is a child's dream about a concentration camp. Only in fairy stories would a death camp be so sparkling clean and spacious. The detainees in this (holiday) camp are free to move about as they please. They can even play with the Aryan Gretchens and Hansis if they want to.In the Czech Republic, there's an exhibit of drawings made by cute and precocious children vacationing at the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Their amusingly childish artwork shows typical scenes of camp life, large black monsters crushing tiny people wearing little yellow stars, for example.I happen to have seen another concentration camp film this week, Escape from Sobibor (1987). In that film, Jews also banter and jest with the Nazis, only they do it by applying axes to their heads and homemade knives to their stomachs. History would seem to have demonstrated that axes and knives are more effective tools for dealing with Nazis than making jokes at their expense."Uplifting" is another label assigned to Life Is Beautiful. It might better be applied to Escape from Sobibor, a true story about real people -- not "princes" and "princesses" -- overcoming real odds at huge cost to escape from an actual murder camp.Nice Offenbach music can be found in this film though, one of my personal favourites in fact, Tales of Hoffmann. SS men in actual death camps didn't keep a lot of Jewish opera records on hand for the musical edification of the inmates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a confusingly awful film. At first it seems like a rip-off of "An American in Paris"; the main character falls in love with a girl that's going to get married, and she ends up with him. There's a bit of clever romance during all this, but it's disturbing how quickly it shifts topic, while remaining very light. Lots of people seem to think it uses comedy and courage to tell a story. I think it's irreverently mindless, and skims off the popularity of one actor and the tragedy of war. I saw a clown, although energetic and somewhat talented, lying to his son who is to dumb to recognize the truth. He calls his act a sacrifice; it's really just a showcase of physical comedy leading to an emotional void. This film borders on propaganda, making light of the reality in concentration camps. Most of it just doesn't make sense, in that with everything that the characters did and went through, they would have suffered much more and probably would have been killed several times throughout the film. Knowing what they did, no one could be that emotionless or stupid. Comedy and the holocaust are not good partners and Benigni just didn't pull it off with this. Guido's game with his son came just too easily; it makes you wonder why if WWII was this nice everyone didn't come out as sugary sweet as this. I'm sure that Benigni is very good as a clown and will be other movies as one, but this wasn't as good as it should be. It won awards for the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

This guy comes across as a phony idiot/buffoon jerk completely devoid of any redeeming qualities, so even tolerating his obnoxious behaviour was a torment I endured to see why so many people liked the abominable damnation of a stupid flick. The main plot of outwitting both his son and the Germans in order for the son to survive was so unrealistically far-fetched it made the Superman scene where the parents launched the infant him into space to save his life look good in comparison. The real time conditions in those camps would have made the clown lose his sense of humour fast. I mean the last scene where they shoot him would have (should have) happened within the first few minutes he had entered the camp. The playing the music loud rip-off from another equally corny but successful flick (Shawshank Redemption) was enough to upset my stomach. And to give an Oscar to some bat crazy clown speaks volumes about the value of those so coveted gold-plated statues. I would refuse one like Brando did but wouldn't refuse the millions Brando got for reciting from some cue cards as Superman's father.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This "sentimental slop", hardly registering any intelligence, is considered a "masterpiece" and received numerous vapid awards, notably from powerful Jewish groups and pompous film festivals. It is both ineffective as a film and as a critique against clichéd injustice. I can't believe how empty it was, it starts out in a comedic manner, but it is absent of any laughs. The direction throughout was haphazard and even tedious. The "evil" Germans were cardboard caricatures who were so clichéd that they didn't even seem to exhibit any movement in the film.Its obvious this film was some attempt to portray the magical realism of early Italian films with a pressing new concern for so-called "ethics" but is biased, immature and intangible. It is another "holocaust" as collective conscience film that wants to hammer its obtuse point across.

		<shortDescription>Okay, but not as great as it might have been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be a fair amount of controversy surrounding this film, but after seeing it I have only a bare glimpse of why. Sure, it is something of a light-hearted tale set in a death camp and one can see why offense might be taken at that premise alone, but the humor is not used to make light of the situation, but rather serves as factor that mitigates the horror for us and for the boy who it is directed at in the film. I do think that Benigni could have made the death camp scenes darker as that would have made the contrast created by his behavior stand out all the more. The Nazis never achieve the truly commanding status they must have occupied in reality, instead they come off as dull buffoons which is something that might have been reconciled to create a better film. But then we must remember the function of the framing device which locates perspective on the young boy, so we have now a tension between what we know of the reality of the situation and the fantasy world that Benigni creates for his son. This is an interesting tension, but it is never drawn out fully enough. In only one shot do we ever get a sense of the loss of life that was the eventual outcome of these camps, and even then it exists in sort of a dreamscape so it is hard to say whether or not it really existed at all. If the scenes of Benigni away from his son had contained more horror the film might have been more able to build on the fantasy versus reality theme that seems so crucial here. Since this is the boy's story, the scenes of Benigni away from him lay outside the realm of his personal memory, so they exist as constructions implying that either the son has extended the cloud of fantasy retro-actively over things he learned about the camp or the filmmakers did not wish to break the aura that they created. I would tend to think of the latter as a the more probable cause. Benigni is crafting a fable here and applies a "fable-istic" aura to all of the proceedings, but frames the story in the perspective of the boy (post-Holocaust) thus opening the possibility to break down the wall of fantasy and insert scenes of tragedy that might have made Benigni's act all the more heroic. This criticism aside, there are quite affecting moments in the film. In the moment Dora chooses the forsake all for her family and follow them to the death camp, Benigni has created a piece of pure, selfless melodrama that illustrates the ties that bound families together in that time. We know Benigni must die, and thus the scene of his death is oddly unaffecting. But by pairing it with the coming of the tank at the end Benigni has made both moments all the more affecting. Life is Beautiful is not a great film. It might have been, but it never really explores the battle between fantasy and reality that is the core of the film. Fantasy wins out and reality only makes a few insertions making what could have been a truly uplifting homage to the human spirit somewhat dulled. Not dulled enough to consign it into the realm of mediocrity however, as there are enough good moments to make this a film worth watching. Benigni's courtship of Dora is quite sweet, even if I find the Benigni character a bit overblown for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful (1997) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Oscar-winning mix of comedy and drama centers on Guido (Roberto Benigni), an Italian man who uses his style of humor to win a woman (INicoletta Braschi) he has fallen in love with at the start of WWII. They eventually have a son named Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini) and the three are eventually thrown in a concentration camp where the father uses that same humor to try and protect is son from the horrors of the Holocaust. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is a rather unique film because it should have been a complete disaster. I mean, how do you really add laughs to the horror of the Holocaust? Writer-director and Academy Award winner for Best Actor Benigni manages to do just that and it's pretty remarkable what he was able to pull off. The film really does play as two movies with the first half being a romantic comedy and then we're thrown into the drama aspect once we enter the camp and the father must try and protect his son. This is a very far-fetched premise and there's no question that a lot of it is unbelievable but at the same time the film is just so charming and unique that you can't help but fall for it. The majority of the credit has to go to Benigni who manages to pull off a Chaplin by mixing laughs with politics, romance and drama. I was really impressed with his performance and you can see why he won the Oscar. He's so incredibly good no matter what he's doing. This includes the slapstick early in the film, the romance in the middle and of course the toughest job of trying to protect his son. The way the film uses the "game" to try and protect the kid was quite clever and you can just feel the urgency in Benigni's performance. Both Braschi and Cantarini are also extremely good in their parts. The movie also gives us a very touching music score that perfectly captures everything we're being offered. I'm not going to ruin the ending but it's incredibly touching in the way it plays out. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL isn't your typical romance and it's not your typical Holocaust picture, which pretty much means it's very original and quite daring but in the end it works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen Schindler's List and The Pianist, and consider both excellent. I've also watched video's from Spielberg's Shoah foundation, and read many books and accounts. Pál Turán's stories, for example. I've watched Hogan's Heroes, and the disastrous Pinocchio.Roberto Benigni has a particular "I can get away with anything" style that spoiled the movie for me. For example, he slowly rides a green-painted live horse into a fancy restaurant, has a long conversation with a bureaucrat that hates him, steals away a girl, and a large egg that happened to be right over the bureaucrat's head splatters on him as Benigni slowly rides away. No-one tries to stop him. Earlier, Benigni is getting away from the same bureaucrat on a bicycle, and collided with the girl. But as they start to talk, the bicycle is abandoned. It's just a movie prop, after all.This pervasive unreality saturates the film. Benigni isn't acting appropriately anywhere, so it's unsurprising when the Nazi's act with deference to him throughout the last half of the film. All the Italians are good, only Germans are bad (and just mildly so). The Germans are also dumb as bricks.I probably would have liked this more if I hadn't seen Pinocchio first. I did like the boy and many of the supporting players. This could have been a much better film with more reality and thought. A poor person would never abandon a bicycle. There's a good Italian 1948 movie by Vittorio De Sica on the topic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A comedy set in a concentration camp during WWII may sound like a dreadful even downright offensive idea. After all, humor downsizes the significance of things right? Wrong. Like Charlie Chaplin, Roberto Benigni understands that humor can be a powerful tool to overcome all things bleak and cruel. When things look darkest, that's when we're in most need of a smile.The story begins with Guido (Benigni), a Jewish-Italian man who pines to open a bookstore. He meets a young teacher (Nicoletta Braschi) who despite her mother's objections, they fall in love, marry and have a child. Years later, Guido's love for his family is tested when they are brought to a concentration camp. Attempting to put a positive spin on the situation, Guido convinces his young son (Giorgio Cantarini) that they are involved in a game to celebrate his birthday.Keeping things humorous without undermining the gravity of the situation is a hard balancing act. Luckily there are no cheap laughs, thanks mostly to Guido's zest for life. No scene is spared from his exuberance and his brand of humor is never tactless or mean-spirited. His need to save his family is the driving force of the films second act and every small triumph or insurmountable obstacle he faces gives the audience a very real emotional reaction. There is one scene where Guido's hope for escape is met with soul crushing failure. He then finds a record and plays its loud enough for his wife across the way to hear to console her.One drawback to this film is the timeline. Are we meant to believe the allied forces stormed the camp only a few short months after Guido and his family's arrival? Additionally some may experience emotional whiplash from a film that evokes laughter and tears in equal measure. To them I'd say, WWII was an event that coaxed similar emotions and actions. While the war showed human nature at its ugliest, it also showcased us at our best. Benigni however is not concerned with geopolitical posturing and keeps his more caustic meditations on fascism sequestered in the first act. The human story is the important thing and God love him for realizing this.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is Beautiful?A Moving and Compelling Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie as part of an English course at University. We were studying works on the Holocaust and had been given the opportunity to watch Life is Beautiful following a showing of Schindlers List.I was immediately put off before the showing itself by the fact that I knew it was in Italian and would be subtitled. Paying attention to what was happening on screen whilst trying to read the dialogue was not very appealing! However, I had judged too soon. Instead, I was presented with a tragic comedy that was both hilarious and incredibly moving. I was barely anywhere through the movie when I forgot all about the subtitles and was completely drawn in. I watched this movie again, much more recently and around 10 years after I'd first seen it, and it was even more amazing the second time around.In the film we follow the character Guido, played magnificently by the movie's Director Roberto Benigni, through his initial hapless attempts to romance Dora (the scene where he is pretending to be a school inspector is particularly memorable), into their blossoming relationship in which she bears their only child, and then into the dark territory of the horrors that surrounded the Holocaust. In keeping with the comedy theme, in place from the opening scene of the film, we watch the second half of the movie mainly through the father/son relationship of Guido and Giorgio. Aware of the terrors around him and his family Guido turns their hopeless situation into a game. Although this is for the benefit of his son one cannot help but feel that Guido also uses the comedy as a tool to distract his adult self from his terrible situation. Benigni throws himself into his role with such passion that his audience have no choice but to share his tragic journey. His performance is over the top, and rightly so; an understated depiction of such a character would have taken something away from the impact of the film. There are some stand-out scenes which are highly effective in their execution; one of the most memorable is the one where Guido plays Belle Nuit to the entire prison camp knowing that his wife will hear. The scene is both haunting and touching and, as the viewer is shown Dora's face, we are taken on her life journey through her eyes in a few powerful seconds. To place comedy as a running theme in a film that begins as a love story and stretches into a much darker scenario is a commendable feat. Threaded throughout the film, despite the Holocaust as its subject, are some truly uplifting moments which serve to remind the viewer that it's OK to laugh in the worst of situations.This film is a moving and compelling masterpiece that not only grips you from the start but stays with you long after the final credits have rolled. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

The movie tells about a man named Guido Orefice, who with his original personality falls in love with a schoolteacher Dora. Although Dora being currently with another man, Guido still fights for her and after 5 years he and Dora are married together and have a son, Giosué. While Guido is living his fairy tale life, not caring about the bad things in life, Italy is suddenly occupied by the German forces during the World War II. Guido and his son are taken to a concentration camp where Dora voluntarily follows them. In the camp men and women are naturally separated from each other, but Guido somehow finds a way to communicate with his wife and protect his son. Although the movie also tells about war and its sad consequences, it tells about it in a so beautiful and a happy way I've never seen before.The one thing above everything else which makes this movie so astonishing is Roberto Benigni, who plays Guido and who is also the director and the second writer of the movie. The movie got 7 Academy Award nominations and won 3 of them, you don't hear a foreign movie doing that every day, so it's a pretty huge achievement I'd say. Roberto Benigni won the Oscar of the Best Actor in a Leading Role, an Oscar more than deserved indeed. I remember Benigni saying somewhere something like it's a pretty funny thing to win an Oscar from playing yourself. If Benigni is really like Guido, then we need more people like that in the world. The character of Benigni has this unique, vivid personality which can not be described. It's like he wants everyone else to feel better than himself and he cares about his wife and son more than himself. Although the character being slightly surreal Benigni does the impossible by making the character reality, making it so believable. He is so likable, sympathetic and simply happy in a way that just makes you smile throughout the movie. An amazing role performance indeed, if I'd have three thumbs I'd put them all up.OK, if we forget about the main character in the movie the story isn't so original after all. A family driven apart during the war, forced into a concentration camp, doesn't sound so original anymore now does it? The movie pretty much hangs in the hands of the character Guido Orefice, which just makes the whole movie so brilliant, not forgetting the fantastic dialogue between the main character and other characters. This makes the screenplay very good, telling an already heard story which is always a treat for you if done well, but adding this overwhelmingly superior character to it, raising the whole movie from good to brilliant. This is complimented by the excellent music composed by Nicola Piovani, who won an Oscar from it as well. Adding so much more beauty to the story, making the funny and hilarious scenes also so dramatic and beautiful."La Vita é Bella" is all in all a brilliant film. It translates the sadness to happiness and beauty in an already mentioned way, a way that can not be described. The movie isn't just playing a fool on screen and getting some recognition from it, it's about true love and real courage evolving as we understand it. This is without a doubt all in all one of the happiest movies I've ever seen in my entire life. There is sort of mixed comedy and drama, but the real focus being on the drama after all, although the comedy side being absolutely hilarious and making you laugh. If someone succeeds in making you laugh and making you emotional at the same time that is always an achievement worth mentioning. This is a movie recommendation to everyone and for god sakes please watch the original Italian version, as I like to think that dubbed versions are more like a sin. Especially when the movie includes a role performance this amazing. Roberto Benigni is a genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Life is Beautiful celebrated Italian film director, actor, and writer Roberto Benigni puts his comedic skills to the ultimate test. Through this he creates a perfect example of the tragicomedy. Benigni participates in the film several ways : he plays the films main role, directs, and co-writes. Benigni is of course no stranger to wit, and he definitely displays this on and off of the screen. It's certain that wit was something that Benigni was glad to have when making Life is Beautiful. I say this because not many film-makers could successfully set a comedy in a concentration camp.Life is Beautiful is fixed into two parts, one more lighthearted then the other but still containing the same overall theme. The first portion of the film is a slapstick romantic-comedy which can seem a bit "been there done that". It is highly reminiscent to the 1950's melodrama, with the lush coloring and over the top acting. Guido(Benigni) is a Jewish-Italian waiter living in Fascist Italy during the 1930's attempting to set up a bookstore. Guido is overwhelmingly optimistic, fast-talking, and has a heart of gold. He falls in love with a local school teacher, Dora (Nicolleta Braschi, Benigni's actual wife), at first sight when she falls into his arms from the top of a barn-house as he arrives into town. The only issue that Guido faces is Dora's Fascist fiancé, who is cruel and overbearing.Guido's scheme to win Dora's heart consists of various premeditated run-ins around town. Guido at one point appears at Dora's school and disguises himself as the school inspector. He humors Dora by mocking Italian Fascist ideals and shows the school children the A1 structure of his Italian ears and bellybutton. At an opera Guido spots his "princess" on a balcony above him and attempts to lure her into noticing him by using Shopenhauer's theory of willpower, one of Guido's great attributes, that he learned from his friend Ferrucio. He repeatedly calls her name softly and she finally notices him. Later that evening they get stuck in the rain, with only a makeshift umbrella made of a steering wheel and pillow to protect them. With Dora's dress revealing her behind, a clear homage to the classic Bringing Up Baby, Guido walks her home and calls it a night.About half way into the film the pacing is shifted instantaneously. At first we are welcomed by Guido's new family. The couple now has a son, Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini), who is about 6 years old. There are only subtle reminders during the first half of the film to the Nazi dominated state of Europe. Now Joshua reads a sign on the window of a bakery that reads "No Jews or dogs Allowed", and the enclosure of Guido's bookstore has "JEWISH STORE" painted on it. One day Dora returns home and finds her home wrecked, and empty. She realizes that her husband and son have been sent to a death camp. Dora, who is not Jewish, is exempted from being taken to a concentration camp, demands that she get on the train with her family.On the way to the death camp Guido contrives a plan to set his sons mind at peace. He tells his son that he has been planing a special trip for his birthday, which has fallen on that day. When they arrive at the camp Guido improvises the rules of a game where the winners get a real tank. In order to win you must obtain 1,000 points-by not crying, not asking for your mother, not being hungry, and by hiding from the "the mean guys who yell". Through the assistance of Guido's improvisation and humor he keeps him and son alive.Life is Beautiful deserves to be put on the pedestal that so many undeserving contemporary comedies are put on. Some might think finding humor in such a delicate setting like the Holocaust might seem offensive, but Benigni is in no way abusing the seriousness of the Holocaust. One would hope that no one would need to be constantly reminded of the horrors of the Holocaust to understand the seriousness of the event. After all we are seeing the Holocaust through the eyes of a child who thinks of it as a competition or game that his father invented to keep him and his son alive. The point of Life is Beautiful is not the Holocaust. The fact that a portion of the film is set in a concentration camp only helps us understand that we can not let our spirit and hope for a better tomorrow be crushed even through the harshest, and most excruciating times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie when I was in the 8th grade when we were "learning" about the holocaust and I KNOW no one in the room had a dry eye. Even the "men" were crying at the end! I know everyone Truly enjoyed it though as they were talking about it for years to come. I am now in my sophomore year in college and still hear great things from the students who were in my class about the movie! The only down side about this movie is that if you are used to typical Disney endings and pray that everything will be alright for the main character you will be highly disappointed. I am still mad that it wasn't a happy of an ending as I would have wished it to be, but I would not and will NEVER say a single bad word about this movie to anyone who wishes to ask me about it. Every time you watch this movie, you can learn something new, if it is about a character, or a historical fact then you can constantly learn something or see something you never thought to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Life is Beautiful' is the rarest of pieces of movie-art. The blending of the tragic background, war and death, and true love interwoven with humor and family is devastatingly effective in reaching ones' heart.A university instructor, lifelong student of history, a former military officer -- and a boy who grew up in Europe as a 'military brat' of German and Italian ancestry -- a man who as many believes in true love and family, not a scene nor a line passes without some accurate historical reference, some tug of the heart, some piercing comment from a little boy as he plays a game of hide and seek amid rumors that others are being burned alive, that draws you.As a man, I find it difficult to both smile and cry, as I first viewed it in 1997, and without exception only while experiencing this sole masterpiece of story, acting, and directing each time since. The simple yet complex process of experiencing this movie and both it's raw and sophisticated themes and emotions is worthwhile and strongly recommended.Martin Dean Dupalo</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is one of my top ten movie's first i adore the cute little boy, and he plays excellent in this movie, also Roberto plays very very good in this movie with his humor he stole my heart. also this is one of the movies that made me feel sad at the end, and thats hard to do, especially in a movie. I think that the boy did'nt even know there was a war, cuz his father loved him so mutch he shadowed the war from him so he would grow up like a normal sun, there is only one question that i ask myself if i where a German soldier and i had to execute a man like "guido" it would hurt me for the rest of my life. Its a bit similar to "the pianist" i think when they show in the end that the friendly German officer with the love of piano-music is killed by Russian soldiers, cuz they both were great and good men and have been killed in the confusion of the war. I know la vita ? Bella is a fiction story but it sure seems non-fiction. its just a great movie that you have got to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought I can see such a good bitter-comedy about the nazy Holocaust. What makes this movie excellent is not the great and realistic humour, it's not the masterpiece acting of the father, or the incredible talent of such a young boy - his son. This movie let you feel the flavour of a really sad idea about our world: everything is so wrong and twisted, that we have to fake our children's universe so they can live normally in it... It's remarkable how you can follow the story of such a massive horror in the human history with a smile on your face, and also with tears in your eyes. It's funny, but it won't minimize the drama behind the laughter.Really impressive movie, one of a kind !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vita ? bella, La(Life Is beautiful)-----1997Made in Italy by actor and director Roberto Benigini This flick is not about racism but about the human spirit Life Is Beautiful shows how humour can set the spirit free even in the most darkest circumstances of life.In 1939 Italy,Guido(Roberto Benigni) is a carefree Jewish person who wants to open bookstore With his amazing sense of humour he woos a beautiful school teacher Dora(Nicoletta Braschi) Later on they marry and story moves to 5 years later.Now they have a son Joshua(Giorgio Cantarini) 1945 during WW2 they all are captured by fascists and sent to death camps.Guido makes his son believe that this is actually a game of 'hide and seek' in which one have to get 1000 points to be a prize winner which is a tankThe first half is full of comedy and humour and one might think its romantic comedy But second half takes a u turn and makes the movie intense and tragic yet lighter The second half gives a feeling of 'Schindlers List'.But this movie is not as brutal as that rather we see a deeply touching story told with imagination and humour Inspite of second half being dark and grim,light and comical moments are interwoven with death and misery all aroundLife Is Beautiful is a daring,original story As an innovative director and a supremely talented actor. Critic Roger Ebert,the first person ever to win Pulitzer Prize for film criticism says ...Guido uses the only gift at his command to protect his son. If he had a gun, he would shoot at the Fascists. If he had an army, he would destroy them.He is a clown, and comedy is his weapon.I couldnot have agreed and described it more profoundlyGuido in profound fashion, Guido personifies the axiom "Life is what you make it". It is an unexpected,oddly passionate yet deeply emotional portrayal of a father's sacrificial love for his son.Roberto Benigini popularly known as Jim Carrey of Italy gives his lifetime performance Its unimaginable to believe the way he portrays humour even in heart wrenching and emotionally driven scenes which can put many audience on the verge of tears He got well deserved best actor Oscar that yearRoberto Benigini...again triumphs as a writer and director.The scene where he is caught and sees his son hiding leaves you just speechless.Even in that haunting scene by dispalying humour he makes his son believe its part of the game.A class actLife is beautiful is not about barbarism and brutality but about human spirit.About hope for future Its about victory of hope over despair,light over dark and also this deeply affecting film triumphs humour over hatred In the battle against barbarism,Benigni is saying, there are also the weapons of joy and imagination. It makes u believe that life is not what happens to us,but how we react to it.We must learn to enjoy every moment of our life. It is up to us to make it beautiful.And one can assume the greatness of flick as inspite of being made in Italy this timeless classic doesnot only got Oscar nomination for 'Best Foreign' language film but it got 7 Oscar nominations in leading categories out of which it won 3 Oscars.Winner of Grand Jury Prize at Cannes Film Festival 'Life is Beautiful' poignantly shows us that in the midst of dark ugliness of death the light of life shines at its 'Most Beautiful'The movie is light but when the the credits at the end of flick rolled on....i was deeply touched and could not move for few moments.....Unarguably among the greatest flicks...............9.25/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best films i've ever seen and one of about only three films ever to have made me cry. I've watched it loads of times and it has never lost it's appeal. The actors are superb in it and the director is obviously very talented, he takes some very delicate subject matter and manages to make the film reflect the horror and sorrow of the concentration camps while retaining a n element of humour and hope However it is definitely better in Italian though, a couple of my friends have watched it in English, French and Italian and they have told me that the emotion is better portrayed when it is shown in the language it was originally written for. I reckon that it is one of the best war films ever made, showing not the violence and constant death that is expected of a war film but the slow heartbreak of a family being torn apart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no expectations at all when I saw this movie the first time, I mean foreign movies from southern europe tend to be mostly crap according to me. But what I first realized was that the acting of Roberto Bengini was outstanding. He seemed so real and at the same time he was incredibly funny. The movie is about him meeting the love of his life, Dora, and they get married and get a child Giosué. It's then the late 30's and since Guido is Jewish he and his son is transported to a concentration camp. Since his wife doesn't want to leave him she goes there too. Guido doesn't want to frighten his son and says that it's a competition where the winner will get a tank. Now he has to act like it's fine and that nothing's wrong. This is the best foreign movie I've ever seen and it's at least top-10 of all the movies I've seen. As I said Bengini's acting is outstanding and that he's the writer and the producer of the movie just makes the success of the movie more amazing. If you haven't seen this movie, I can assure you that you've missed something great. This is a masterpiece!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my father told me that the movie would be in Italian, I had my doubts because I did not want to read the movie. Little did I know how great the film would turn out. As a matter of fact, it is so great, it is almost impossible to describe.Roberto Benigni plays Guido Orefice. Guido is an extremely goofy man who doesn't take life too seriously, but is very happy with with his life. He cherishes the life he has in every moment. He is a waiter in Italy. Nicoletta Braschi plays Dora, the girl Guido falls in love with. She is a school teacher who is marrying a rich man. But she is swept off her feet and goes head over heels for Guido Orefice. After Guido rescues her from the man she is marrying, they get married and have a son. A son named Joshua.Joshua is a cute little boy who is goofy just like his father and loves tanks. Shortly after he is introduced, Dora comes home to find her house ransacked and her husband and son missing. She discovers that they are heading to a Nazi concentration camp in Berlin. She boards because she will not leave her husband, and the train pulls away from their little village.They arrive in a drab world with beaten and starving prisoners. Joshua is obviously frightened by this horrible place, but clever Guido does something that will forever protect his son's innocence. He tells little Joshua that they are in elaborate game in which every prisoner is really a player trying to earn enough points to win a tank.As the film picks up, it becomes more tense and the world seems to be crumbling around them. But Guido keeps Joshua's head up high, but things change when the war ends. Furious, the Nazis begin rounding up as many Jews as possible so they can kill them. Attempting to find Dora, Guido hides Joshua, tells him to do certain things in case he dies (he obviously coats it with something else), and leaves his son in a daring attempt.After viewing this film, you will learn to cherish and enjoy life as it is, rich or poor, just as Guido Orefice did. You will smile, laugh, and cry. Life really is beautiful.</fullReview>

The way the movie starts off with silly comedic and romantic situations really are very important in explaining the character of Guido. So, if you're not impressed in the first 30 minutes, wait up, keep watching. You'd have had a pleasant surprise by the time the movie finishes. Benigni has ensured that he does not show the gory gory images of holocaust. Also because this movie is not about the holocaust but only a simple romantic story with hope and optimism.

This film made me laugh and cry,although at the end they were tears of joy. Benigni is his normal eccentric self,but that's not to take away from the other performers. The relationships between the different characters are what make this film, whether it's Guido's relationship with doctor Lessing or guido's relationship with Dora.I heard that at the Oscars Spielberg didn't applaud Benigni when he got his award, saying that the film made a mockery of the Jewish plight in the second world war. It's a shame that he feels that you can't make light of the situation, because I kind of feel the jews who were being persecuted probably tried to make light of it, as this was probably the only way to keep their hopes alive. This story is about love, whether it be for spouse, sibling or offspring, surely that's not a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>La Vita a Bella is Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regardless of how historians and students feel about the Holocaust, do not be alarmed. This is a love story about a funny man and a lovely woman who have a son together. The Pre-WWII setting is simply a motif where everything takes place. However, this movie doesn't intend to be a rehashed bashing of Nazi Germany where we have seen in high profile films like "Schindler's List", "Diary of Anne Frank", and countless other Holocaust movies. These movies had a purpose and it was often to point fingers at those responsible for all the deaths in concentration camps during WWII. "La Vita a Bella' takes a different outlook and demonstrates how a nice European family fell victim to the political problems and tragedy of WWII. It's a sweet and wonderful film with a good sense of humor. Roberto Benigni was fairly unknown before this came out. But when he accepted his award for best actor, everyone clearly noticed his English was quite shaky. For a guy to win the hearts of the world with his limitations is proverbial. I remember when the cameras panned to the audience and so many people, actors and stars, were crying in joy for his achievement. The end of the movie had me crying my eyes clean as well. This is truly a gem and should be cherished for anyone with a heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had seen this film in a shop I would of honestly not have gone near it. Thanks to GCSE coursework I had to watch it I am glad I did. It is a comedy,a drama , a compelling tale... In other words excellent the fact I watched it in Italian with subtitles did not take anything away from Benigni's excellence. A definite must watch film. Even if you don't think you will like this kind of film get it and watch. But watch it in Italian with English subtitiles because having the voice over will make you bore quickly. With the subtitiles you will concentrate and believe me it will be a lot more funny. Benigni's genius is enough to keep you amazed so if you are looking for something good to watch this is the one to watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how he did it, however Roberto managed to successfully blend tragic drama (The Holocaust) with tasteful comedy. My only complaint is waiting so long to see it.By the way, everyone will be committing a dis-service by watching this in English. Please watch in the spoken Italian language. You will truly get a better feel for the emotions. I assure you after 5 minutes you will not find the subtitles hard to follow.I look forward to viewing other movies by Roberto Benigni. I understand he recently released a movie covering the war in Iraq.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie will leave you speechless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the few that have brought a lump in my throat. I don't want to give away anything but this is an absolutely must see for everyone. Not normally my favourite genre of film but you can't go wrong renting this one. At the beginning of the movie, it starts out a light hearted cute comedy between a man and a woman. It is fun but unless the viewer doesn't know about the location and timing of the movie, they don't really know what the characters are in for. When the Nazis come (it is set in WW2), the viewer automatically realizes that characters are in for hard times. But the whole time the main character stays as light-hearted and loving no matter the hardships they must endure. The character is truly inspiring and part way through the movie you find yourself praying that he and his family make it through the war together. They deserved to live happily ever after. But the sad truth is all the Jews that died during the atrocities of WW2 deserved to live, sadly that didn't happen. This movie may give the viewer a new perception.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the first shots of La Vita ? bella / Life Is Beautiful is when Guido (Roberto Benigni) and his friend Ferrucio (Sergio Bini Bustic) are driving their car through the beautiful countryside. Ferrucio reads a poem, Guido listens, the car brakes fail, but Guido thinks it is part of the story. It is the whole movie in a nutshell and a prelude of things to come. As a result of the brake failure they enter the village where he is hailed as The Great Dictator, in a scene meant as a tribute to that movie. Later we have the two children Adolf and Benito fighting on the bench. And the rather funny scene where Guido explains what it means to be Arian to the children as fake inspector.The first half shows the simple life in an Italian village, with Guido falling in love with Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). The rise of fascism is told as a background story first, but soon invades every facet of life. Guido later has married Dora and they have a child Giosué (Giorgio Cantarini). Guido has set up a book store (a reference to the burning of books by the Nazis). The second part starts with the train transport of all, with Guido commenting on the train ride to his son: It's the kind of risky humor that Benigni uses by mocking the whole Nazi-regime and its procedures. We see this again when the camp rules are translated by Guido.Of course this is not a real concentration camp, Benigni abstracts the horrors (almost nothing is shown) to make the Nazis look ridiculous in their manners and behavior. Guido remains more or less the same human he was in Italy, only his environment changes and that makes the dehumanizing of the Nazi-victims only more poignant. The movie also keeps the Nazis consistently inhuman as there is not one human aspect in the whole movie to be seen of them. Even the friendly Dr. Lessing is turned in a non-human (He only saves Guido for his own riddles, and shows no interest in saving Dora). And the movie also works by showing only the perspective of one family that almost breathes life. But the movie is too long in the beginning and lingers somewhat (the uncle's house for example). It all feels like watching a movie from the 40s or 50s, even in the acting and direction.When this movie came out, there was some debate about whether it was ethical to make a comedy about concentration camps. Roberto Benigni knew he took an enormous risk with this movie, and in lesser comedy hands this would not have worked out the way it did. But as art is all about taking risks, he was correctly rewarded for a new addition to coping with the history of the holocaust. As time will pass, probably still other ways will be found to tell this story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>funny and disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I watched this film, I was a bit hesitant because the basic premise sounds so ridiculous--a man who uses humor and imagination to shield his son from the horrors of the holocaust while in a concentration camp! I mean, how can this movie be funny? Is this another "Hogan's Heroes" or what, I thought.Well, first, most of the humor in the film occurs BEFORE the internment. This makes sense and allows the movie to be in good taste. I found myself laughing out loud on many occasions with the silly buffoonery of Benigni as he tries to capture the heart of a woman he keeps "bumping into". These moments also abound with charm and seem rather reminiscent of the work of Chaplin--lots of physical humor and charm.The second half of the movie does indeed take place in a prison camp. Occasionally, there were some mildly humorous moments but the goal was not a cheap laugh but were desperate attempts to convince the child that he should not give up hope. Despite the ludicrousness of the plot at this point (hiding a little boy in a men's dormitory in a prison camp), the way they explain it works out perfectly and should not offend or diminish from the horrors that were the holocaust.This film, though VERY cleverly written, was carried by Benigni's marvelous acting. He rightly deserved the Oscar for Best Actor for all his charm, enthusiasm and magnetism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I ever saw. Roberto Benigni's performance is flawless for the role. Many compare his performance with that of Chaplin and in my opinion that is wrong. Benigni never looked like he was acting. He lived the role.I believe there is no man who did not return without a tear. The screenplay was really a masterpiece and an Acadamy Award would have been a perfect accolade for that. The innocence of the son when he says, "We won" was very heart touching. For an Indian like me, this movie really brought some interest in watching Italian movies, or for that fact, any foreign film.A must watch from me for everyone.* * * * * from me.</fullReview>

Witty talkative Guido watches over his son Giosué, as they are separated from his wife Dora, and by outsmarting the camp officers he manages to keep his son safe form harm on many occasions. The dramatic ending is both beautiful and throat-cutting, and illustrates perfectly the human waste and tragedy of a war. La vita e bella, Bravo!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No *wonder* Russell Crowe missed out on best actor...Not knowing a great deal about this one besides the fact Benigni won best actor, I decided to get it on a whim.To say I was not disappointed is an understatement.Life is Beautiful is about a charismatic and quite loveably affable waiter by the name of Guido who manages to capture the woman of his dreams and the life of his fantasies. Life is indeed beautiful. Until, that is, the second world war begins and due to his religion of judaism he finds that society begins to condemn his people - this is something which he tries to hide from his son by putting on a facade of explanations as to why people are behaving why they are towards his family. When the family is shipped off to a concentration camp this front is tested to the limit, by Guido maintains it throughout to hide the true horrors of war from his son.To say that Benigni is outstanding would do him no justice - he's every inch worth his oscar, and commands the screen superbly. He conveys a man of pure heart who loves his family and people in general, and who bounces off everyone without being irritating. He keeps his spirit no matter what happens in his life, and this is reflected by events in the concentration camp.The rest of the players truly are top notch too, such as Nicoletta Braschi as his wife who is perfectly understated - this, really, is Benigni's show and she gracefully gives him centre-stage.Throughout, the story uses comedy immeasureably well, and contains plenty of extremely humourous moments. It even manages them in the concentration camp in a way which never hides the seriousness of such a place but which smarts as bitter sweet. Again, the centre of all comedic moments is Benigni.As well as being amusing, his character is completely believable - he is so convincing as the kind of man there are too few of - completely good, through and through. His only vice is stealing another man's bride, but she wasn't happy in that relationship anyway!I fail to mention the quality of the direction and storytelling - the direction is perfect and never fails to keep you hooked to the screen - we feel a part of this world. The storytelling, or narrative, is top notch too - not for one second is this close to being boring, or daft, or unbelievable.There is much more I could say, so I'll finish by stating you really should see this one.Immense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but I think this movie is extremely overrated. I did not find it the least bit beautiful or emotional. I give them credit for trying to make a realistic depiction of the Holocaust, but I was completely unaffected. I loved Schindler's List, which is in my opinion an enormously superior film. I have always been horrified by visions and stories of the Holocaust, but this movie doesn't even come close to sticking with me. It has to be one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen in my life. I also think that it is a Shakespearean tragedy that Roberto Benigni won an Oscar for this performance. A truly horrible letdown!! I give it a 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benigni does himself and his movie justice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL was a simply charming film. The silly wit in the first half combining with the clever quick thinking of Guido in the second make for an awfully sweet and heart warming movie. But what Benigni did far more better was finish his contemporary classic with a certain justice that, though silly, would make everyone smile and cheer. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is without a doubt from the heart.We are introduced to the life of Guido Orefice, who captures the heart of a lovely lady and five years later, does all he can to keep the innocence in his son during the holocaust.Earlier before this comment, I questioned the notion, but LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is truly a story about the human spirit and the effort to persevere in the most hardest of times. LIFE can apply to your life as well. Though a little troublesome at first thought, what better ice breaker was when Guido pleaded everybody to move when the brakes in the car went out? Roberto Benigni has created one excellent flick.</fullReview>

Setting the rest of this movie in a concentration camp just doesn't work for me. I cannot ignore the knowledge that great cruelty and unimaginable suffering occurred in places like this. If you are a sensitive person, I suggest you skip this movie. It'll rip your heart out by making you care so deeply about the characters and then.... well I don't want to give away the ending.

		<fullReview>Roberto Benigni won his well-deserved Oscar for in VITA E BELLA, LA, or LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL. Benigni, who co-wrote and directed this film, stars as Guido, a bumbling-but-kind hearted Italian-Jewish waiter who wins the heart of Dora (Nicolleta Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife) by means of charming wit and romantic humor. Guido uses the same kind of love and affection to comfort his cute son Joshua when the family is forced into a concentration camp near the end of WWII.Benigni's acting will no doubt remind movie buffs of the samewhimsical shine Charlie Chaplin glossed with, the kind that tugged onto the heartstrings of people. The love Guido had possessed for his family had warmed me from head to toe; it proves that no matter how bad the odds get, love conquers all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What starts out to be a zany slapstick comedy turns out to be one of the years best. ***1/2 out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life is Beautiful" starts out awful. It has no idea about what it wants to be, which is somewhere between a screwball comedy and an emotional tearjerker. There are more emotions being shuffled up in its script as there are minutes in the movie. The story is also very hard to follow. So how can a movie like this work?The comedy part of this film details a hotel waiter in Italy in the 1930s, Guido, played by Benign, who also directed and co-wrote the movie. This man is a clown in some ways, and he creates most of the film's funny slapstick humor. A few examples of this include Guido arriving in town in a runaway car with failed brakes, his love at first sight with a woman named Dora, the many different directions one hat can lead to, and how he is mistaken for a school inspector giving a speech about his wonderful body.After he and Dora eventually get married and have a son, who is five years old the first time we meet him, we learn that he is Jewish. In 1945, all of the Jews in the town are sent to a prison camp by the Fascists. Doha makes the decision come along to be with her family.However, Guido makes up a story about a game that all of this is to his son to prevent him from learning the horror of the truth. The game is where everyone competes to be the fastest to earn 1000 points, then the prize is a real life tank.It's at this point where the film takes off, and makes the audience feel sorry for the characters. And the story is as breathtaking as it is realistic. The film softens the holocaust to put in this humor, however. In real life I'm not sure that the couple would have lasted a week.The performances were overlooked by me until the film's third act, where the father learns to keep his cool under all of this stress. Roberto Benigni is superb, as he is directing this movie. His comic touch seems out of place, but never do I have any complaints about it.Nicoletta Braschi, Giorgio Cantarini, Gastonia Durano and Horst Buchholz, whom I have never heard of, all are at their very best, as the side characters. There are many, and sometimes they are a bit distracting. But in the end I am only praising the film for its choice of characters."Life is Beautiful" is visually stunning as well. The scenery and mountains are beautifully precious. I think this movie might be up for a nomination of best cinematography of the year. Without it, I think the audience may have been board between the characters talking and the humor layout.This movie, in the end, does nothing less then remind us that life truly is beautiful, and we should never question imagination or our gut feeling about something. This is easily one of the best foreign language film's of the year. If it wasn't for the disastrous first half this movie may have made it to my "Top Ten of 1998" list. Still, we have a treasureous movie here that clearly works in what I call the "Think and Forget" method. Great job, Roberto Benigni.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprised at how much I enjoyed it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I wasn't looking forward to this film as it was in subtitles and was about such a dark subject but I had heard good things about the film and decided to watch it and I have to say I don't regret it. It was my first subtitle film and once you get used to reading the subtitles on the screen, you soon forget that you are watching a subtitled film.The first part of the film was bright and breezy with beautiful scenes of Tuscany and Italy. It starts with Guido Orefice played by Roberto Benigni who in 1939, arrives in a large Tuscan village to work as a waiter at a local hotel. He meets Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) there and begins to court her. There are some very funny scenes which happen when he keeps meeting up with her, like her falling on him, him falling on her, then turning up at her school as the School Inspector, only for him to take his clothes off. I found the love story so touching and cheered when Dora finally decided to get rid of the jerk she was engaged to and choose Guido. The scene I most love is when she asks him to get her out of her engagement party and he comes on a green horse that has been vandalised by some unknown person and he rides the horse into the hotel and carries Dora away like a knight in shining armour.The film moves on to the last year of the war. Guido and Dora are married and have a son. Guido also has his bookshop he wanted when he first came to the town but their lives are changed forever when the Germans invade and send Guido and son Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini) to a concentration camp. Dora follows and demand that she is put on the same train as her husband and child.This starts the darker and gruesome side to the film. Guido pretends to his son that it is all a game and that they need to score 1,000 points to win a real tank but tells his son that he must keep hidden, not ask for food all the time or he will forfeit his points. There are some horrible scenes, one scene when Guido is bringing his son for a walk and sees the piles of bodies tossed as if they are rubbish and making sure his son can't see the horror before them. Another scene is when Dora and the other woman prisoners are sorting through piles of clothes that have been taken from people who were later gassed. There is a cat there and you flashback to the scene when Guido and his son are travelling to the concentration camp with a little girl stroking her cat and it is shocking that this innocent little girl is killed for something she can't change, and shouldn't have to.The scenes that tugged at my heart was Guido, somehow getting across the barrier between his wife and himself and telling her how much he loved her, the scene where he plays the music which has some significance for the both of them.What I wasn't prepared for but which I should have been was when Guido is killed at the end. That is truly a bombshell as you have been with him from the start and watched him survive all the horrors of the camp and keep his son from seeing the true reality that it is almost like your friend dying. I thought it was poignant when he is still keeping up the game with son and he is making a joke out of being lead away and he is still keeping up with the pretence even though he knows when he is being lead to his death.All the actors are brilliant, Nicoletta Braschi who plays his wife in real life, Giorgio Cantarini, Giustino Durano and Horst Bucholz. Robert Benigni definitely deserved the Oscar for his role and the film definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've had an interest in German history for a while, but it has taken me some time to get to this film.I wasn't sure what to expect, having been told it is "heart rendering", "devastating" and "a comedy set against the holocaust". I was pleasantly surprised.While anyone who is into historical epics which have spent billions on research for accuracy is going to hate this film, it does something which so few Holocaust movies do - it looks at a story of an individual and there methods of coping.While I'm not at all certain that this story could have ever happened this way, it does explore the fact that, even in the darkest times in our history, we can find some light and I felt this was portrayed beautifully. Comments surrounding the death and destruction of the concentration camp are very misguided - while this lacks the powerful and terrifying images of films like Schindlers List, it manages instead to portray the horror of the Nazi's as an individual horror, which is often simply taken in ones stride.A film which, on its own, would mis-represent the holocaust but, with all the other films out there, is a great new, and refreshing, take on those dreadful events.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that this is one of the most touching, saddest and at the same time beautiful movies of the last centuries if not the complete film history. The actors, above all Roberto Benigni, seem to completely identify with their roles and the movie therefore has a dense atmosphere and enormous authenticity. Despite all the, for the audience, obvious terror and despair of a Nazi concentration camp, the movie still manages to deliver a hopeful undertone. But it never becomes boring or campy in doing so. If you want to spend two hours watching an excellent story nicely told, try this one. You won't regret it, I'm sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guido is a young-eccentric Italian Jew that begins his life in Toscana. There, with his personal way to live (life is beautiful, there's always place to optimism and to live happy, without hating) he is able to make Dora fall in love to him. They marry and have a child. Some years later, II World War begins, and him, as a Jew, is brought to a concentration camp. There, he will make all the efforts to make his kid to forget all the nightmares of the real life and tries to hide him by telling that this is a game. The movie has two different parts: the first one, a comedy where Benigni shows himself as a clown, and later in the concentration camp, where benigni makes a dramatic part, where, indeed in the worst places, there's time to hope. Very well directed, the film is never annoying and never too childish, nor excessively dramatic. The acting of Benigni is just superb, how, knowing that these are hard times, is he able to seem happy, as he is alive. The soundtrack is also wonderful and the script is very well done, all the scenes have their point and their importance for being there and the two hours it is long seem shorter when you are watching this film. one of the best modern masterpieces, beautiful, interesting, touching, highly recommended to everybody. The only bad point is the fact that the movie is sometimes quite fantastic and far from reality, there are some moments when Guido is in the camp, that, he would have died due to his acts, but he doesn't. I know it was an Italian camp, and their were not as evil as the Polish ones, but it is sometimes unbelievable.Anyway, life is beautiful, enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sublime triumph of love, despite the worst of situations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My summary conveys the message of this movie. This film is an astounding tribute to the beauty of the human spirit, the ability to maintain a hopeful and optimistic outlook, the unique bond between a father and son (or husband and wife), and the triumph of love...all in coping both with everyday life situations and later, with the horrific environment of a Nazi concentration camp.This Italian film tells the tale of a bubbling, carefree Jewish book shopkeeper, Guido, who embarks upon a romance and marriage in 1930's Italy, soon raising a son with his wife, Dora. The family's happy little world crashes when the Nazis force father &amp; son to a concentration camp. Guido seeks out ways to communicate with his wife, who has voluntarily followed her 'two men' to the camp and is of course now separated from them in the women's barracks. Also, in order to make life bearable for his little boy, Guido pretends that the horrifying Holocaust events are all an elaborate game, with a tank offered as the grand prize.The father turning this unspeakable situation into a game creates a unique perspective, to say the least. Personally, I found this touching tale very emotional, although of course in quite a different way from Schindler's List, a tremendously moving film with its graphic depiction of horrifying truths the world must never forget.Some seem insulted by this movie, which I can understand. Perhaps this film might be interpreted as an outrage to the memory of those who suffered so much. However, this is not a documentary and I don't think its intent is to deny or trivialize the Holocaust. It is a fictional family's story. The concentration camp setting might indeed seem insensitive, but I agree with those who feel this is simply intended as a film about hope, as personified by its main character, Guido, and about the bonds of family.This lovely tale, so unexpected, touches the heart in a very personal way...the wife and mother bravely following her loved ones into danger rather than face separation, the father concocting this incredible wild scheme to protect his young son from being frightened by the atrocities occurring all around him. Guido is so charming, funny, inventive, and appealing. The film tells his entire adult life story. It's not just about the Nazi years; the concentration camp is only the latter part of his tale, as it also amusingly and touchingly chronicles his courtship and early married life.This movie is just a moving, heartwarming FICTIONAL story of a wonderful, optimistic, unique individual and his family. Don't let the sub-titles dissuade you. You absolutely must see this incredible film. It's amusing, romantic, and of course tragic...all three. Above all, it indeed shows that despite all the cruelty of the Holocaust...at least for Guido, in both the best and worst of situations...Life is Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a heartwarming journey into the soul. Set amidst the outbreak of WW2, and concentration camps, this is the journey of one man and his family, and their unbreakable bond and love for one another that is able to endure even the harshest of situations. The main character, Guido, has the amazing ability to see the positive and the hope in even the most desperate and frightening times. This movies is a spiritual renewing, "feel good" pleasure that has a lot to teach us about the small joys that are present everywhere if we only just take the time to look for them.I only saw this movie once on TV, but its impact has stayed with me forever. This is one of those films that you just are not able to forget because it has such a positive and uplifting message. The acting, and the scenery are also done very well. Taken together, this film is a work of art that everyone should view at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film an amazing inspiration which shows us that the virtues of cheerfulness and keeping our spirits up can go further than ever imagined.This is a story of a man who manages to save his son from a horrific fate by preventing the latter from losing hope, and helping the boy to relate his experiences in the concentration camp to what a child is more used to, a competitive game. Guido the father, shows us that even the most inhumane realities do not have to bring our spirits down, and through this positive mentality, we can even conquer horror stories as brutal as the holocaust.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, beautiful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I simply adore this movie and cannot see how people cannot love it. This is not a movie about the holocaust it is a movie about the lengths man will go to protect his family with the holocaust as merely a back drop for it. The use of humour within the drama works well, gravitating from slapstick comedy in the first half to a more serious style in the second, as the film takes on a more serious story. It seemed fairly obvious to me that this movie was about hope and love rather than the holocaust and I don't feel Benigni made light of the holocaust, more he used it to show us hope in a seemingly hopeless situation. This film could have been set in any other hopeless situation like this but then again why should it be. Of course I can understand that other people do not need to share my views but in watching this movie I came away with a mixture of feelings, sad yet also oddly rather contented. This movie may not be for everyone but I would definitely suggest people try it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is Beautiful is a completely original depiction of the Holocost, filled with dark humor. When I first heard that there was a comedy of the Holocost, I was extremely against the idea. I though it would minimize the importance of the event and make it appear trivial. But it isn't making fun of the Holocost, and the extreme light hearted humor actually adds to the tragedy of the story. Benigni delivers an amazing performance as Guido, a care free, creative and playful individual you instantly adore. We watch him win the heart of the woman of his dreams, successfully open the bookshop he always wanted, and have a kid. Then, because they are Jewish, they're sent to a concentration camp. But Guido makes sure his son doesn't know they're in real danger, telling him it's a game, and being careful to always hide his suffering. He continues to be hopeful and funny, and that's what makes the tragedy of the Holocost so real. We see Guido create a Beautiful life for his family, then we see the Nazi's destroy it. The difference in the lives of Jews before/after Nazi's is clearer here than in any other Holocost film I have seen. Guido's attempt to keep the illusion of beauty alive for his son is, to me incredibly inspirational. Life can be, and should be Beautiful.10 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

Bell.After I watched it I realized that our humanity has experienced such a disaster named racism. I will not go through the history about it since I guess that you all know much than me about it. What I want to say is that Roberto Benigni acted on this film as if he were in the Nazi World. What is interesting is that he never lost his belief in "hope" to the end for his little and defenseless boy. Roberto Benigni, named as Guido Orefice in the film, changed the life into a game in favor of his child whom has no knowledge about the situation they enter. Guido Orefice does not lose his optimism even if he knows that there is the possibility to become died by the soldiers.Finally, I want all visitors to watch this film again and grasp the main point which Vita ? Bella tries to implant. Racism is the worst thing that can be ever thought by a human kind. I hope this "illness" will never be experienced anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a movie this film ain't too bad. Quite a nice first half, with a beautiful setting and charming humour. However, Benigni deserves an absolute panning as he has basically stomped over the bones of 6 million jews in the concentration camps so he can reach the Hollywood summit. The premise of this movie is absolutely impossible. Anyone with any knowledge of world war two history would know that this is a disgracefully inaccurate depiction of a concentration camp, as it appears much more like a home for POWs than a location for the extermination of a race of people. However, clearly this would have prevented the movie's creation, so he chooses to ignore the facts and ploughs on regardless. Frankly, I found this movie deeply offensive, and those who regard this as a triumph of love over despair, should rather view it as a triumph of one man's ego, and a viewing public's wilful ignorance, over reality and respect for the dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A positive outlook on life during such adversity, this is the central theme of the excellent holocaust film "Life is Beautiful."Roberto Benigni was voted best actor by the Motion Picture Academy for his portrayal of a Jewish man, who when imprisoned by the Germans during World War 11, tried desperately to rid his young child of fears by making a game out of the holocaust.The film begins with the very funny courtship of Benigni and his wife, who is not Jewish.Horst Buccholz, so young and charming in "Fanny" appears as an Italian army official. They years have matured Buccholz. It was sad reading of his passing a few years after this marvelous film came out.The scenery is breath taking and Benigni alternates his feelings in a terrific comedy-drama performance.Just as liberation appears to be imminent, Benigni is shot by the Germans. Unaware of his father's death, the son will carry on in his tradition. His ride on the tank will bring a tear to your eyes.A moving and endearing film, not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have you all lost your bloody minds?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the immortal - although very paraphrased - words of Lieutenant Dane: "*Life* is *beautiful*? Well, kiss my crippled ass!"The first hour or so of this movie felt like being invited to a fancy dinner party in some beautiful restaurant in Toscana and having to spend the entire evening next to some socially challenged, annoying moron with delusions of charm and an inability to ever shut up. The second hour of the film is basically identical except now it's set in a concentration camp. So basically, the film is two hours of unfunny jokes with a Holocaust backdrop thrown in to make it critic-proof. How sad. Imagine a six-year old trapped in the body of a middle-aged Italian man on a steady diet of Red Bull and Ecstasy - that's how I'd describe Roberto Benigni's "characterization" of the film's star, Guido. He even has trouble stopping himself from laughing at his own wit at times (although referring to Benigni's humour as "wit" is like calling Xzibit an accomplished thespian. I'm not even sure it can be called "humour" - it's almost insulting to such masters of the genre as Adam Sandler or Owen Wilson). I guess this is how you win an Oscar these days. If you want to see a truly good performance from a comedian playing a foreigner, look no further than Sacha Baron Cohen's "Borat" which was released last year (I'm just telling you this in case you've been living under a rock for some time, or if you're from Ohio - in that case, I'm sorry). At least in that film, the main character was *supposed* to be mildly retarded, while in Benigni's movie the lead makes you unsure if you should laugh or cry as he hogs up precious screen time with his oh-so-hilarious antics. Sacha Baron Cohen was, by the way, almost completely ignored by the Academy. Go figure. The film's plot is about one man trying to make life less unbearable for a little doe-eyed kid throughout their stay in a concentration camp. They don't arrive at the concentration camp, however, before one excruciating hour of Benigni's constant mugging and a love story that rings so false it would make even Michael Bay retch. The second hour of the film is considerably less light-hearted than the first but just as boring, repetitive and unrealistic. In reality, a guy like Guido wouldn't have survived a week in a concentration camp. Chances are if the Nazis didn't kill him first, the other Jews would have, if only to shut him up for once. Just how the hell did Guido manage to keep Doe-Eyed Child Actor hidden from the Nazis for so long? The film can't possibly be supposed to be serious - it's too implausible - and it's not nearly funny enough to be a comedy. What a mess.The film only hints at the true horrors of the Holocaust and never really shocks or disturbs you. It doesn't say anything that we didn't already know about this tragedy and the unfunny jokes only make it more offensive. Ask yourself this: does Jim Carrey have anything to do in a film about the Holocaust? I thought not. Does a second-rate hack with only a shred of Carrey's comic talent but with the same urge to mug and overact have anything to do in a film about the Holocaust?? I think not!All this aside, the film is competently made in most other aspects, with some beautiful scenery and a not-too-awful score. Other than that this is an embarrassing and inexplicably acclaimed ego-trip. The only truly funny thing about this disaster is how everyone is calling it a masterpiece and actually believe that the Oscars were well deserved! Oh well, people loved "Crash", too (Paul Haggis' 'RACISM SUCKS' epic, not the one where James Spader has sex with a leg wound). Honestly, this film is so corny I'm surprised aliens didn't etch secret messages in it with their rayguns. How can you hand out a Best "Foreign" Picture Oscar to a flick that ends with a freeze frame of a mother hugging her child? Seriously, a FREEZE FRAME? Give me a break or some insulin because this is too much sugar for me. In conclusion, this film is manipulative, completely unrealistic, offensively stupid and features one of the least likely love stories ever. And it's unfunny. Dreadfully, hopelessly, comatose-ly unfunny. This coming from a person who could find something to laugh at in "Scary Movie 2". Trust me, I laugh very easily at various kinds of comedies, and "Life is Beautiful" is easily one of the worst movies ever to win an Oscar. And please don't call me insensitive, heartless, or soulless... I don't call you a tasteless, easily manipulated sheep, now do I?Finally, I'd just like to say that Benigni has one of the scariest smiles I've ever seen. Think Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise and Rip Torn combined times a hundred. Every time his mouth twisted into one of his well-practiced, sh!t-eating grins (and this happens almost every twenty seconds throughout the movie, so don't worry, you won't miss it) I had an overwhelming urge to run from the room screaming. Avoid this movie.</fullReview>

La vita é bella (1997) is a wonderful movie from Roberto Benigni.It won three Oscars giving one for Benigni for best actor.This Italian filmmaker combines comedy and tragedy in a way Charles Chaplin used to do.Laughter and tears walk hand in hand in this movie.It offers you lots of funny moments and also moments that can be very sad and touching.In some moments you can find your eyes filled with tears and be laughing at the same time.Benigni's energetic acting brings you in a good mood.All the actors are terrific.Benigni's real-life wife Braschi is amazing and the kid actor Cantarini does a marvelous job.This is a perfect movie.It shows life can be beautiful even when it seems ugly.</fullReview>

The film was financially successful, earning 23 million euro in Italy.

		<fullReview>A fable, especially when transferred to film, can be a beautiful thing. It becomes even more beautiful in contrast to the horrors of reality all around it. But not only can a fable be beautiful, it can be hilarious, heart-warming, and heart-breaking, and Life Is Beautiful shows us a wonderful film that is all of these things.Life Is Beautiful gives us Guido Orefice, a Jewish man who is innovative, brilliant, and extremely funny. He works for his uncle in Italy in pre-WWII Italy, before all mayhem breaks loose. He meets a female school-teacher, Dora, whom he entertainingly wins over. Years pass, a son is born, Eliseo, and the threesome is seized and taken to a concentration camp, where Guido refuses to give up hope.Roberto Benigni is incredible in his performance as Guido, who works against the odds, out of his overwhelming love. Nicoletta Braschi does a good job too in her role as Dora, and the biggest surprise of all is little Giustino Durano's solid performance as Guido's son. These three characters are so rich and captivating, and most of the minor characters too are strong, but a few of the characters with tiny roles seem strangely unmotivated and seem to take away the tiniest bit of magic from this film.Benigni's direction and co-writing with Cerami, though, is terrific, and reminiscent of classic films. It's all so beautiful, so warm, real, and full of color, that one can't help but immediately fall in love with the film. It never loses its ability to entertain, but it never loses its sense of reality, either, making it lovely and strangely horrifying simultaneously. Piovani's score is excellent as well, and displays the atmosphere of a fairy tale in its haunting beauty.Life is Beautiful is exactly what a film should be all about, and it never loses its focus: human emotion that within which lies the beauty of life.Final Grade: A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As opposed to the in-your-face bluntness of 'Schindler's List', this works on a pretty interesting level.Some spoilers...The modern sitcom works by taking a generally quaint topic and making it as vile as possible. Here it goes the other way by taking something enormously evil (the Holocaust) and trying to inject humor in it.Compared to Mel Brooks' self-effacing stupidity (OK, Mel, we know you're Jewish already!) this has an edge. The concentration camp is a game--everything is seen from a child's perspective. Notice how this continues until the end when we realize the child has been telling the story all along, not Guido. If we had been introduced to this fact earlier, we'd know something was afoot. Instead we get some effective, yet simple, surprises.The creators saw the Spielberg parody in this and so they quote 'Empire of the Sun' with the tank and Americans.So skip the empty first half and get to the good stuff. After this, 'Great Escape' meets 'Producers'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mainly heard of this film from a trailer, and the fact that the leading actor won the Academy Award instead of Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan, and he certainly deserved it! He also directs the film, but lost the Oscar to Steven Spielberg, I think he's much more compelling as the actor. Set in the 1930's Italy, the first hour of the story sees friendly Jewish book keeper Guido Orefice (Oscar and BAFTA winning (for acting) actor, writer and director Roberto Benigni) having a fairytale romance. Using his cunning wit he wins over Italian school teacher Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) who was set to marry another guy. He basically makes it out like he is a prince who has found his "Princess", and getting the timing right he always shows up, making her smile, until she gives in. Years later Guido and Dora are living together with Guido's Uncle Eliseo (Giustino Durano), and they have a 5-year-old son, Giosué (Giorgio Cantarini), and they all seem happy. I thought the whole film was going to be a happy and charming comedy throughout, but I was wrong. It becomes a gripping drama when Guido and his son are arrested by the Germans and taken away to a concentration camp, with Dora demanding she go too. They are split, but Guido with Giosué wants to protect him from the horrible truth, so Guido tells his son that this is a holiday, and a big game where he has to get 1000 points to win a tank and leave. This lie seems to be very convincing as some of the prisoners and the Germans go the way that Guido expects, and his son does not suspect anything, even with the near catches. When Guido tells Giosué he has 1000 points, he makes him hide while he tries to escape and find Dora, but he is caught, and sadly killed. Thankfully though, Giosué comes out of hiding, a tank really does come with an American (the only English spoken in the film) soldier driving to take him, and he finds his mother Dora, both a tragic and happy ending together. Also starring Sergio Bini Bustric as Ferruccio Papini, Marisa Paredes as Dora's mother, Madre Di Dora; Horst Buchholz as Doctor Lessing, Lidia Alfonsi as Guicciardini and Giuliana Lojodice as School Principal/Headmistress. Real life comedian Benigni is fantastic being funny in the first hour, but also very compelling as a serious actor in the realistic concentration camp environment. Both a great funny film, and a great dramatic film, just a great Italian film. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Music for Nicola Piovani, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film not in the English Language and Best Original Screenplay. It was number 56 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Very good!</fullReview>

Half of the film surrounds Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni won a well deserved best actor Oscar as Guido, along with a second Oscar for best Foreign film as director and writer) as a Italian-Jewish waiter who is in love with a "princess". This half has more of the comedy than drama, but the second half is melodramatic as Guido has a son now with his princess and they are taken to a concentration camp. But so to shield his son from the horrors, he makes a game the two can play as their ordeal unfolds.

		<fullReview>Benigni is lauded by many Jews because he embraced the holocaust.Actually we are overwhelmed with that holocaust theme too much. Schindler's List, The Pianist and this movie...There many be many other movies but these three are the most top-rated ones I guess. Well let me give some statistical knowledge about the WW2.WW2 was a period of immense human(not just Jewish) suffering.Nearly 55 million people lost their lives but only six million of this death toll was Jewish. Due to the holocaust 4 million non-Jews made up of Poles, Roma, homosexuals, communists, dissidents, Afro-Germans, the disabled, Soviet prisoners and others had lost their lives. About about 20 to 28 million Soviets died in total, of which 13 to 20 million were civilians. Now given that these statistic are absolutely true why the these directors insisting make movies on the holocaust?As a human being I sympathize with the Jewish people who suffered immensely then! But as a human being I also sympathize with other non-Jewish people who lost their lives then! Why the heck they don't make movies out of the sufferings of Soviet,Poles,anti-communists etc...? If this Jewish suffering had been so real why does this race's governing council create the same stuff in Palestine with a great newspeak of terrorism? Does the Western have a courage of making a movie on Palestine, Hiroshima,Yugoslavia? Isn't anybody aware that The most notorious atrocities occurred in China, including the slaughter of almost half a million Chinese during the Nanjing Massacre, also known as the Rape of Nanking, and Unit 731's experiments with biological warfare in Manchuria, with a view to killing a large part of the Chinese population. Japanese war crimes also included rape, pillage, murder, cannibalism and forcing female civilians to become sex slaves, known as "comfort women". Many of these occurred in Korea, which Japan occupied from 1910 to 1945. Doesn't anybody think it is worth cinematizing the suffering of these people as much as the suffering of Jewish people? It may be a great script to think of a dream quality to make your son survive the concentration camp but it is due to create something else. You may create a dream quality to survive the brothel in Korea or China. Do something for those people. Amen to the Jewish suffering!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just can't get how such a train-wreck of a movie could get produced, let alone win an Oscar.Roberto Benigni used to be a decent comedian, often over-the-top and politically incorrect to the bone. But he was okay and had some enjoyable comedies under his belt.Then, somehow somewhat, he was given the role of Cinamatic Genius and was led to believe he could write and produce whatever piece of outrageous cinema he wanted, because he was so damn good, funny and witty.Sadly, Life is Beautiful is a comedy about the Holocaust.Sure, not about The Holocaust, but about a father and son getting swallowed by the Nazis death machine. But the "familiar" dimension of the tragedy shouldn't be a poor excuse for getting away with poorly written slapstick comedy about lotteries, birthday parties, riddles and romantic liaisons.The "concentration camp" looks more like a Fat Kids Summer Camp, considering the relative freedom of movement, and the convenient presence of the female camp nearby, allowing the corny "Buongiorno Principessa" episode.The Nazis look like brain-dead tools who talk a scary language and don't understand Benigni making fun of them (while that alone would have granted death on the spot, but hey... it's a COMEDY!!!). Italian fascists instead are the stereotypical self-important buffoons who were even too inept to be considered scary.The message of the movie, whatever it is, gets lost in a sea of cheap comedy in a frighteningly misplaced location.Is it supposed to be sweet, touchy, emotional and even funny? To me it was just painful, disrespectful and unfunny (even ignoring the absurdity of the situation).Last but not least, Benigni spoofing Chaplin is the craptacular icing on an equally shitty cake of a movie.The fact Benigni got an Oscar, worldwide recognition and domestic superstardom is a clear sign of how sheepish the movie industry is... Some topics just scream "Oscar-bait", and sure Holocaust is one of them.Sadly, Benigni had to take a different route to get to the same goal.</fullReview>
