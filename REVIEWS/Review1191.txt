		<shortDescription>Near Pixar Quality Animation, Not Pixar Quality Storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may not be fair to compare an independent Belgian animation to industry dominators like Pixar, but the film industry is competitive. This film has excellent animation considering it was made by an independent company. Many vibrant colours are featured, and although the don't burst of the screen like Rio, it does add to the aesthetics of the film. Yet, it does feel like the film is very self contained, but it doesn't impact it in a good way. The setting explored (or not) has a lack of scope and the film clearly suffers from this. But for kids, this will not be a problem.Despite strong design and animation, the direction is nothing notable. There are a maximum of two slightly interesting ideas (in the form of transitions) but other than that, everything else seems average, with no courageous attempts add to adding anything to the story.Unfortunately, the film falls flat on the storytelling (particularly through dialogue) which just results in everything being cliché and predictable; it brings nothing new to the table. It appears that the writers just gave up, a shame considering if the dialogue wasn't so forced then the film wouldn't suffer so much. There isn't even an innuendo to keep the adults entertained. This film is a good way to keep the kids occupied for 90mins, but nothing that adults will obtain any pleasure from (unless you are in awe of the animation which I doubt you will be).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for the kids but not much for adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a family film, 'Robinson Crusoe' is a long way from awful but it misses the mark. It may be good for kids, providing that they don't expect too much, but adults won't find much for them.Just for the record, this is coming from a huge lifelong animation fan in her early 20s with many animated films being considered favourites, just in case one accuses me (as is so the standard thing on this site these days) of seeing it through adults eyes too much.The best thing about 'Robinson Crusoe' is the animation, with the exception of stiff human designs and lack of scope for the setting. There is a lot of gorgeous detail, especially the parrot's feathers, rich vibrant colour, good smoothness of movement and the animals look good.'Robinson Crusoe' also has a groovy and dynamic soundtrack, the story (even if a very, very loose adaptation of the story) is at least coherent and easy to follow and some of the characters have charm, especially Ainsley (though really disliked the rather cheap treatment of him) and the humorous if slightly over-used villainous cats.On the other hand, while the story is coherent it is also very predictable, too safe and bland, not much to be excited by here, even the climax feels like very watered down Looney Tunes/Tom and Jerry or something. The human characters do lack the colour and charm that went into some of the animals, especially the dull and unsympathetic protagonist, and other characters veer on the annoying. The script is lacking in laughs, emotion or any kind of colour. The voice acting is not too great, there's been worse but it does sound inexperienced with clichéd and obviously false accents.In conclusion, good for the kids but little for adults. 5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a pleasant movie for both kids and adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost missed this movie - that my daughter at 8 and her coisin at 10 wanted to see - after reading the harsh comments here on IMDb. 5/10? come on!... But I decided to give it a go. And what a pleasant surprise it was. The animations are superb, I missed nothing here compared to Pixar and Dreamworks. And the story and screenplay was above average too. I could name dozens of high profiled animation movies with worse stories. I was entertained all the way, and had to stop myself from breaking out in applause at the end. There's something this studio does in its own way, which is not typical the big studios, and thats refreshing. Looking forward to their next piece. Im giving it a solid 8 out 10, and will definitely recommend this film to everyone. A very fine piece of art. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My review on this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit that when I first saw the trailer to this movie, I immediately thought that it was going to be a terrible movie. However, I cannot judge a movie until I have watched it. After taking my niece to watch it, I was surprised to how well done this movie was. I will break down this review into each sections.The cast: the voice actors for this movie were a good choice. Each one of them fits their character well and while I admit a couple of the voice actors do have room for improvement, they were definitely not terrible by a long shot. Out of them all, Marieve Herington was the best. She is definitely an underrated actor who deserves more shots at other movies and TV shows.The animation: the animation to this movie was superb and very well detailed.The CGI works well, it flows smoothly and it didn't appear to skip any frames or cuts. You can see the amount of detail they put into each character and all of the surroundings. The people who worked on this definitely put a lot of work into this and deserve praise for that.The story: The Robinson Crusoe (AKA Wild Life) is based of Robinson Crusoe, a novel written in 1719 by Daniel Defoe. The movie follows a similar plot as the book but instead, the movie decides to take a more kid friendly route. The story to this movie is simple, it doesn't try to copy any other movie plots and it's original as movies get. Overall, the story is quite decent and it is something kids can enjoy. Certain adults may enjoy this as well.Overall, this was a good movie. My only complaint really is that it didn't really need to be based off Robinson Crusoe book and could have been it's own stand-alone that wasn't based off any material. I give this a strong 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty decent animation from Lionsgate/NWave animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering that nWave doesn't have the budget to compete with DreamWorks or Pixar (typically the most conservative when it comes to 3D), 'The Wild Life' does well to the match the storytelling of Robinson Crusoe into an animation flick. This clever animal-centric perspective offers a playfully anti-imperialistic spin on Dafoe's classic tale of Western superiority. Director Stassen's 'The Wild Life" offers them another dynamic playground in animation to look for. A small budget animation but was beautifully made.A by the numbers retelling of the classic survival story. With a few funny moments this is nowhere near as anything good from the likes of Pixar but it does just enough to keep you entertained. I go with 3/5 for the work by this new animation studio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In South Korea, but still before opening corresponds to the expectations for this film. Childhood read Robinson Crusoe. I think the memories and remind adults who have children have the feeling of fun and will give you a lesson. Only the trailer looks exciting characters look so cute looks interesting. Because the holiday season opened in September in Korea seems even better view as the family. Because it is the same director and director of Sammy's Adventure Fun sees already guaranteed. I have a wife and children at this time of Thanksgiving and the holidays of Korea In South Korea, but still before opening corresponds to the expectations for this film.

		<shortDescription>Not a total shipwreck but still needed rescuing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An animated feature that isn't Dreamworks or Pixar Disney? Instead an independent animation studios based in Brussels by the name of nWave Pictures. Having a small portfolio but boasting the first 3D animation feature 'Fly Me To The Moon' in 2008 and a fairly successful 'House of Magic' (2013) I'm impressed by their ambition.I have to remind myself that it's a cartoon movie and the target audience would be children as it's based loosely on Daniel Dafoe's pioneering novel, which is much darker involving cannibalism and murder. It's probably more on an ideas of Crusoe as oppose to a movie about the book.It's very vibrant and the animation is great, crewed by voice actor regulars but unknowns. I do wonder if a bigger voice would have promoted this film more; I'm not saying the acting was bad because it isn't. I suppose the budget wouldn't allow the team to do so.It unfortunately doesn't bring the same level of entertainment or laughs that the big guns like Disney and Dreamworks do, however it doesn't feel rushed and is structured quite nicely; I just doubt there enough going on to keep the attention of viewers, especially the younger ones.The characters are good but again just falls short of feeling anything towards any of them. I couldn't pick a favourite character and some actually start to be annoyingly clichéd more than anything. Even with a character death, it just hits the deck.It's a good effort and easy to watch, but there's little else to note about it. But keep up the good work nWave! There's some serious hidden treasure there and this isn't a complete shipwreck.&nbsp;Running Time:&nbsp;6 The Cast:&nbsp;4 Performance:&nbsp;8 Direction:&nbsp;6 Story:&nbsp;6 Script:&nbsp;5 Creativity:&nbsp;5 Soundtrack:&nbsp;6 Job Description:&nbsp;5 The Extra Bonus Point: 051% 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - ticks all the boxes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an age where animation has endless possibilities, it's nice to see a movie that doesn't get bogged down trying to be unique, current or for all ages. Robinson Crusoe does a very solid job as a simple but fun flick you can stick on for the kids. But nothing more.Having seen the trailer a dozen times or so, I was expecting to be totally disengaged and bored, but it managed to stay interesting throughout. The animation is surprisingly strong, detailed and textured (especially the parrot's feathers). Though this meant it was nice to look at, a lot of the movement lacked physicality, which doesn't sound like a bit deal but it made some of the slapstick gags less effective.The main problem is the script. There's nothing disastrous about it, it's just very safe and uninventive. We're quite spoilt with the likes of Pixar in their quirky characters and dialogue, which makes movies like this feel badly written. But it does the job. The pretty amateur voice cast doesn't help either, being dubbed from its original French to English.Ticks all the boxes, but is in a completely different league to the likes of big budget Pixar and DreamWorks movies. Not worth paying to see, but if it's on TV it'll happily entertain the kids while you do something more interesting.3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing here for adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nerdy Klutz Robinson Crusoe is shipwrecked on a tiny island where, with the assistance of various helpful members of the local wildlife, he manages to survive despite the depredations of pirates and some feral cats.This CGI feature originates from Belgium. It is bright, colourful with attractive set and character design and animation.But it is populated with extremely annoying characters ? almost all of them - a story which is almost totally uninteresting, an over-reliance on the villainous cats to drive the plot, an unsympathetic protagonist and a number of things which took me straight out of the film (the island is hardly bigger than a ten-bob note ? how on earth does it manage to sustain the varied wildlife?).There is little here for adults and, like Ratchet and Clank just a week ago, I imagine it will be successful with an undemanding audience of youngsters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>do not see this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this easily goes into my top ten worst films ever made, the animation was passable, but script, story, dialogue, and especially the dreadful voices were all the worst i have seen for a very long time. i expect anyone over five years old would come away with a splitting headache. when will europeans stop trying to make American films, they completely lack the sensibility and cultural aspect that you need. this was such a misguided film, trying to tick what the producers thought were all the right boxes for a commercial family film. but they got every single thing wrong in a big way. how this managed to get a release here in the UK is beyond me.</fullReview>
