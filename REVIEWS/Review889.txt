		<shortDescription>Smart, funny spoof that is impossible not to like!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Men in Black" and "Galaxy Quest" are in my mind the best sci-fi comedies ever made, because they are both hilarious parodies of two different cultures. Whereas the latter spoofed obsessed fans who take sci-fi entertainment WAY too seriously, this one spoofs the paranoid, tin-foil-hat brand of conspiracy theorists. It has funny characters, witty lines, and does not at all take itself seriously.There are a lot of small details that can take multiple viewings to catch. One thing I found funnier the second time I watched it is the scene where Will Smith has just been severely lectured by his boss in the interrogation room when Tommy Lee Jones enters, asks a few questions, and tells Smith to come with him. Smith: "I can't, there's still a lot of paperwork to fill out." Jones: "No, the paperwork is all taken care of." Smith's boss (walking by): "Hey, nice work, Edwards!" This is one of many quick, funny scenes that you only really get if you're paying attention.All the actors do a good job, too. I thought Rip Torn was the funniest character, and Edgar the bug was hilariously gross. Linda Fiorentino was one of the coolest female characters ever. She put Ripley to shame. Every time I watch this, I want to marry her.Overall, it's a great comedy that is clever and fun all the way through. 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Agent K (Jones)'s partner retires, so he has to find a new one. Street cop Will Smith seems an unlikely contender to join this very special service and help K battle illegal aliens.Barry Sonnenfeld's experience as a cinematographer put him in good stead for planning this quirky fun sci-fi comedy.Men in Black is given life by Sonnenfeld's shot-choices, for greatest comic effect, terrific fun musical score by Danny Elfman, and two perfectly cast actors: Tommy Lee Jones' wry delivery and Will Smith's comic persona make for a movie with some real personality.Vincent D'Onofrio is a memorable bad guy - especially when we don't have to look at his regular face.A few death scenes will be too gruesome for kiddies, but once they're a certain age its bound to be one of their favourite movies. Such terrific imaginative fun.10/10Woman: "You here to make fun of me, too?' K: "No maam, we here at the FBI do not have a sense of humour we're aware of. May we come in?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sci-fi comedies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As my one line summary says, this is one of the best sci-fi comedies ever made, next to the classic Ghostbusters and the highly underrated Evolution. This movie has action, comedy, and some of the best special effects in the last ten years. Rick Baker, Hollywood's resident 'creature man', as I like to call him, has made such a wide variety of aliens. There's the first alien we see, Mikey; there's the Worm Guys; and the villanous Bug. But there are many others, such as Frank the Pug and the twins. The squid baby is pretty neat. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith have an undeniable chemistry together, which repeats itself in the sequel. Linda Fiorentino is also good as the leading lady, and veteran actor Rip Torn is gruff as the head of MIB, Zed. Vincent D'Onofrio is also pretty good. My favorite line: "No, ma'am. We at the FBI do not have a sense of humor that we are aware of." All in all, two thumbs up, baby!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Sci-Fi. As Good As Ghostbusters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I stated above, Men In Black is just as good as the sci-fi comedies Ghostbusters I and II. But instead of chasing ghost's we're chasing after rogue aliens.James (Will Smith) is an officer in the NYPD and one of the top officers. After a hard night, James is questioned by his own police force for allegedly killing a suspect who fell off a building. As James insists that the person was acting strangely, Agent K (Tommmy Lee Jones) comes in and takes him out. James is welcomed to a secret agency which keeps aliens in check. After a brief examination of his life, James (now Agent J) joins the agency. On his first day, suddenly K and J are on a mission to stop a massive cockroach from destroying Earth and starting a galactic war. The chemistry between Smith and Jones is hilarious. Smith has some great comedy scenes especially when he is using his new weapon, the Noisy Crickett and him trying to deliver a baby squid type creature. The aliens are smart, their inventive, and their just plain fun when seeing how they identify themselves and hide their identities. The story is funny and will keep you laughing at almost every scene.The presentation of aliens as everyday people trying to live normal lives in Manhattan is a lot more fun than the presentation of murderous aliens (Independence Day). Another great part is that the film isn't overblown with special effects of alien explosions and massive battles. Instead comedy and chemistry keeps this top comedy flowing. Men In Black. Starring: Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Linda Fiorentino, and Rip Torn.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God, do I remember when this movie came out in the summer of '97. This movie brought aliens back in the strongest way possible, everyone was singing Will Smith's catchy song of the same title. But I remember seeing this movie and just wearing out the VHS when we got it. As a 12 year old kid, I just adored this movie and so badly wanted to be apart of the Men in Black. I thought they were so cool. Years later, I got the DVD because I wanted to go for a trip down memory lane, this may not be as cool as when I was a kid but this is still a very fun sci-fi flick that makes you laugh, squirm and also has some good scares. There is a reason why Will Smith is a star, he made this movie a riot to watch and has every star quality you could imagine. He and Tommy Lee Jones take us on an incredible ride through our world where the person that lives next door to you just might be an alien.Agent K is a member of the Men in Black, a secret agency without ties to any government, whose goal is to maintain Earth as a "neutral zone" for aliens seeking refuge. K's former partner, D, has just retired, but identifies New York City detective James Edwards as a potential replacement, due to his agility to follow a disguised alien. After putting Edwards through several tests, K offers him the chance to join the MIB, which Edwards accepts. Edwards' past identity is erased, and he becomes Agent J, assigned to K by the agency director, Zed. The fleet warns that a "Bug," a member of a giant cockroach-like alien species that are currently at war with another alien race, has crashed down to Earth and is seeking an object known as the Galaxy that would turn the tide in favor of the Bugs. To prevent this, they are willing to destroy the Earth unless the MIB can secure the Galaxy before their deadline within a day.The make up effects in this movie are just incredible. The main villain that was the bug was one of the creepiest looking things you've ever seen. Vincent D'Onofrio who is one of those great secrets of Hollywood always delivers an outstanding performance makes the villain even more creepier because of his jerks and twitches. The CGI effects are very noticeable but I don't think they could have gone any other way since the aliens are over the top. The humor is on key, one of my favorite scenes is when Tommy Lee Jones is trying to find out information and you see Will Smith in the background who is helping a lady give birth to an alien and the tentacles come out and start carrying him around everywhere and even slam him on the car. Men in Black is the definition of a summer blockbuster, it's funny, action packed, had the great actors and a very catchy song that is now stuck in my head thanks to this review. I still like Men in Black, I think anyone who just lets go and watches this film is guaranteed to have a good time too.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, effects laden sci-fi comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Agents Jay (Will Smith) and Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) protect our world, that is crammed full of aliens who live among us, and most of them are respectful citizens of planet Earth, but every race can have a bad apple or two. Smith and Jones make an unlikely pair, but they work in harmony really well here, and it's a pretty funny adventure.Fine special effects help to bring the aliens in MIB to life, and they have as much character as the duo in black, and they get just as many laughs. The film carries a good plot and is entertaining from the opening scene; which sets the tone of the film nicely, and makes you yearn for some more.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great fantasy-comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am very upset that most people take this movie too seriously This movie is just a nice comedy with a very intriguing subject. Most people try to find bug in this movie but i believe that they should just sit back and enjoy the great epic line. Let's be serious do you believe that a galaxy can be carried around a cat's belt or that "Elivs is not dead he's just gone home" ? For this reason I believe this is an excellent comedy with a Sf theme. I also appreciate that the acting is very good and the script is very nicely written. I urge people to stop taking the "noisy cricket" too serious! This movie is making fun of the people who take this sort of things too seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Men in Black" is a fast-paced action-comedy that over-achieves the whole way. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith make an amazing comedy team as the title characters who protect the Earth from the scum of the universe.

		<fullReview>This movie was really fun to watch the first time I saw it in theaters, upon subsequent viewings, however, it loses its luster. Still though, it is still a fun movie to watch. Unlike the sequel which rushes us through the story, this one takes a bit more time developing the characters even though it is only about ten minutes longer. Both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are very good and funny, especially Smith because he is the new guy so he is seeing all the weird aliens and such for the first time. This is also something missing from the sequel. In the end though the reason I probably like this one so much is that it sort of reminds me of a Ghostbuster movie, and seeing as how we will most likely never see another sequel to that movie it is nice to see a movie sort of like it in that they are keeping tabs and hunting aliens rather than ghosts. The pug dog scene is funny, and the dog is not over used as in the sequel, and there is also a funny scene where Will Smith must deliver an alien baby...their main objective in this one is to track down an alien insect that has hijacked the skin of a guy and is trying to find a universe. If he succeeds the Earth is destroyed, of course Tommy Lee's character is so calm about the whole situation that you feel you have nothing to worry about. So for a funny movie that has great scenes of Will Smith training and becoming a Man in Black watch this film and do yourself a favor and skip part two...not that it was entirely bad, I liked it okay, but it just seems like an unnecessary sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MEN IN BLACK (1997) ***1/2 Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Linda Fiorentino, Vincent D'Onofrio, Rip Torn, Tony Shalhoub, Siobahn Fallon. Giddily hilarious sci-fi comedy: think a 90s "Ghostbusters" meets the "X-Files": hard-as-nails, deadpan Jones (a great master straight man) is one of many secret agents of MIB (Men In Black) recruiting steetsmart, mouthy Smith (a great wiseass) to team up and stop an intergalactic alien bug (in rotting human form D'Onofrio who gives a brilliant, funny turn) from wiping out the Earth and all mankind. Incredible out there special effects from ILM and ingenious aliens from self-professed "Monster Maker" makeup guru Rick Baker. Hip, clever dialogue and fine chemistry from the odd couple gives this comic book adaptation of Lowell Cunningham a glossy work over including Bo Welch's inventive production design and Danny Elfman's atmospheric score. Fluid direction by Barry Sonnefield.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I never seen sugar do that."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Men in Black(based on a comic I've never read, spawning a TV series I haven't watched, so I can make no comparisons to either) are an agency that protect Earth from not only what the aliens, some of whom are already here, might do to it, but also the common man's ignorance of this situation. It opens a doorway into a fantastic world(whilst playing it straight since most of these guys are used to this stuff) that would be overwhelming were it not for rookie agent J(Will Smith, who brings both his sass and undeniable charm) posing as a proxy for the audience, asking the questions we want to, and being given the exposition and explanations that we need. He is likable in his naiveté and his efforts to help the people affected by the outer-space stuff, and the odd couple dynamic between him and K(Tommy Lee Jones, awesome and enjoyable as the old grump who's blasé about what they experience) is great, as are the various other character aspects. Linda Fiorentino is perfectly cast as a somewhat cold coroner, and she has a nice, strong female role. As the villain, we have Vincent D'Onofrio giving an unforgettable and unique performance as the large cockroach(!) wearing the skin of farmer Edgar. It's a size or two too small, leading to it/him making some rather inelegant movements and? possessing poor motor skills. And don't worry, at the same time, he's seriously scary. He's immensely physically powerful, and he can't *stand* humans. This really gets into perspective, and that the importance of something is not defined by its size. This is primarily a comedy, as well as a fun sci-fi action adventure with some very unexpected situations and outcomes. It's exciting, engaging and a cool universe that we want to see more of, with this being a brief(and well-paced) peek at roughly 90 minutes. There are creatively designed creatures and big, shiny guns. Danny Elfman supplies this with a bombastic and playful score. There is a bit of moderate to strong language and a little violence and gore(little of it involving people, and just about none of that graphic) in this. I recommend this to fans of the stars and the concept. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun sci-fi action film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men in Black starts as NYPD cop James Edwards (Will Smith) has an encounter with an alien disguised as a human, he is contacted by the mysterious Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) who tells him about a secret organisation that monitor &amp; control alien activity on Earth &amp; if he wants a job he's in. Meanwhile a huge cockroach like alien has landed nearby &amp; is in search of an Arquillian disguised as an antiques dealer (Mike Nussbaum) who has something he needs, a Galaxy in a marble. Edwards accepts the job &amp; he becomes Agent J, he soon finds himself in the thick of the action as an Arquillian battle cruiser threatens to blow up Earth unless the Galaxy is returned to them...Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld who replaced Les Mayfield shortly before production began this is a pretty fun sci-fi with some neat special effects but when all said &amp; done doesn't add up to much. Producer Steven Spielberg hired David Koepp to do a rewrite on the script by Ed Solomon which in all fairness ended up pretty good, it doesn't take itself too seriously &amp; was based on character's from a comic book that only ran for 6 issues in 1990 &amp; it's no co-incidence that the film feels like a comic book itself, it's very over-the-top, it's quite funny at times &amp; it's even occasionally witty as well. There's a touch of satire here as the whole alien cover up issue is played for laughs as it's a commonly accepted theory. The cheeky &amp; jokey Will Smith plays nicely of the deadpan Tommy Lee Jones, there are some funny one-liners, some neat aliens &amp; it moves along at a nice pace. There are some good set-pieces as well although overall the story is average fair &amp; while it's undoubtedly fun to watch there's not much substance beyond flashy CGI computer effects &amp; once the whole Men in Black idea has worn off by the 30 minute mark it doesn't really have anywhere else to go &amp; becomes a bit repetitive.Director Sonnenfeld does a fine job, the special effects scenes are impressive &amp; the film has visual flair &amp; style. The alien creatures are very imaginative like the little guy in a mans face controlling him or the baby squid like alien or the worm guy's &amp; all the other's that are dotted throughout the film. The special effects &amp; CGI computer effects are superb as one would expect from a film with this sort of mega budget. That totally out of the blue ending that comes from nowhere is a bit odd though, don't you think? The violence is tame although there are maybe a few scary scenes that might not be suitable for younger children &amp; there is a fair amount of bad language. Apparently Quentin Tarantino was offered the chance to direct Men in Black but turned it down, wow just imagine how the film might of turned out if he had accepted!With a budget of about $90,000,000 Men in Black is well made with excellent production values as one would expect, it has that big budget Hollywood look &amp; feel. Danny Elfman provides his usual recycled score that sounds the same as his other's. The acting is OK, the two leads play off each other well &amp; are an amusing contrast at times, rumour has it after reading the script Will Smith didn't want to do the film but his wife convinced him otherwise. Apparently Clint Eastwood was offered the role of K but turned it down while Chris O'Donnell &amp; David Schwimmer were both offered the part of J but foolishly, considering their's &amp; Will Smith's subsequent careers, said no.Men in Black is a good light hearted sci-fi film that can be witty, funny, clever &amp; exciting but maybe not quite on a consistent level. It's still a very good film though &amp; definitely one worth checking out if you haven't already. Followed by a sequel Men in Black II (2002) a cartoon series Men in Black: The Series (1997 - 2001).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Men in Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Barry Sonnenfeld has turned New York into a cinematic world; a place that on the surface is the regular city of freedom and liberty, yet its seedy underbelly, instead of being a place of hookers and criminals, is instead a place where aliens try to live, albeit illegally. With a mixture of real action and SFX, this world comes to life with some revolutionary concepts which, back in 1997 made Men in Black a real effects-heavy blockbuster. Even today, the effects and techniques hold up well, but a film must have more than superficial aesthetics to succeed, right? Well fortunately it does. The humour and strength of the script is the real driving force, along with the main two leads, and the effects blends into the story seamlessly.Men in Black has aged well: the jokes are still fresh, the story is still fairly engaging, and the atmosphere and charisma of the film is unaffected. It is no classic by any means, however yet still manages to offer over 90 minutes of good quality entertainment, appealing to many genre aficionados as it cannot be merely pigeonholed as belonging to a single cinematic category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cosmic rhymes with comic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The less that we could say is that movies about extra-terrestrials are becoming more and more fashionable. It's certainly the most fertile period for alien movies since the '50s. At the time, these flicks were some kind of Cold War metaphors that promoted anti-communism and McCarthyism and were disguised as tales depicting an invasion from outer-space. Today, it's mainly a very valuable excuse for developing special effects and ultra-sophisticated animatronic creatures. Only, in the case that's picking our interest right now, there's something different.It must be specified beforehand that there are different kinds of alien movies. The first kind is the invasion film which dominated the silver screen in the middle of the twentieth century and which seems gaining in popularity since recent box-office successes like "Independence Day". The second kind is the benign alien movie a la "E.T." where space invaders are kindly and inoffensive and where humans look like a primitive form of life in the universe."Men in Black" belongs to a third type that we don't see much often. We could call it the alien comedy. It's a film genre that is not much approached and which releases even fewer great successes on the box-office side as well as on the critical side. There has been "Mars Attacks!", but critics didn't hook to that kind of iconoclast humor from Tim Burton. But with "MiB", they will get hooked for sure."Men in Black" stars the endlessly serious Tommy Lee Jones and the rising star Will Smith. Jones plays the role of K, a MiB agent, that is an organization which monitors extra-terrestrial activities on Earth. K hires Smith (re-named J) after he successfully pursued an alien in the streets of New York City.Their first mission together consists in recovering a galaxy (because it seems that the size doesn't have any importance) on 'Orion's Belt'. Their adversary is a 'bug disguised' as Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio) who is also searching for the galaxy. With the passing of the events lived by the two agents, we gradually discover the Men in Black world, their weapons, the different species of extra-terrestrials who live on Earth and what their job implies (and it's not included in any job guide...).It is hard to define what is the 'meat' of the movie. It could be the duo formed by the two principal actors, the futuristic gadgets which will make salivate those who have an eye on advanced technologies or it could also be the aliens, who are CG, played by actors with special costumes or remote-controlled. In fact, there's a little bit of all this. But I'd say that the most interesting moments are those which make the audience laugh wildly.In that case, it's Will Smith who's the best. In a performance that seems to be an evolution from his hot-shot role in "Independence Day", Smith is incredibly funny and wacky and he always provides good laughs, should it be for moments of physical comedy or when he makes the use of jokes and irony.And what could be better to complete a jester role than combining it with its total opposite? This fact makes that the movie enters in the category of 'odd couple' films. We must admit it, Jones plays his role with professionalism and his serious and his calm of stone give him a particular look in the tongue-in-cheek style. The sequence of the car in the tunnel with Elvis Presley's "Promised Land" playing in the background is the best example. In fact, the only moment where he laughs, it's when he tells a joke that is so appalling that the viewer could only laugh of him and not of his joke.I also fairly loved the famous segment where K and J's boss, Zed (Rip Torn), displays pictures of real-life people who are supposed to be aliens themselves. In the lot, I've spotted Steven Spielberg (I've always told myself that he had to be from another planet), Danny DeVito (who redefines the 'little green man' term) and Sylvester Stallone (who apparently had difficulties to get rid of his extra-terrestrial accent). And at the end of the movie, we also learn that Dennis Rodman would be an alien too, which wouldn't be too surprising for obvious reasons...I've been somehow muddled by Vincent D'Onofrio's performance. Was he really there during the entire movie moving in such a mechanical way? Or was he played by a giant-sized animated puppet by moments? Anyway, in both cases, we can only raise our hat.I wouldn't say the same thing for principal actress Linda Fiorentino who looked very annoying. The end of the movie is also ambiguous.Special effects are mentionable. Aliens, even if they are totally peculiar, are well-conceived, should it be with the help of computers or from Rick Baker's hand. It must be said that the fact that the story is an adaptation of a rather unknown comic series (which also proves that comics' adaptations do not always involve superheroes), there must be a special treatment that should be brought to the presentation because comics images are rather stylized. The final result is more than satisfying.In a genre not much approached like the sci-fi comedy genre, "Men in Black" is probably the greatest representative of it since "Ghostbusters" in 1984. It's a very funny thrill ride that you would want to see again and again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>''Men in Black'' is a great comedy and sci fi movie, that is not only part of my favorite movies of all times, but also very inspiring and entertaining. I am so glad that neither David Schwimmer and Clin Eastwood accepted the role of J and K , because I cannot imagine two better actors then Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to play them! Will is so funny, while Tommy is sarcastic and ironic and they have an excellent chemistry as a team!We can see many references made in this movie to ''E.T.'' and "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and the end where a big alien is playing marbles with our galaxy is brilliant! I also learned after this movie, that existed actual ''Men in Black'' who were supposed to be in contact with UFOs, what was a big surprise to me, since I imagined it to be a creation of the director or writer.Agent K is a member of an organization called ''MIB'', that has been keeping track of extra-terrestrial aliens on Earth for over 40 years as a police for alien activity on Earth. K needs a new partner and after knowing about the abilities of James Edwards, a NYPD officer, he sees that the guy has potential to be his partner. James eventually becomes agent J, being erased from the government's and society's records and receiving a new identity. With many funny scenes, specially from J trying to ''adapt'' himself to his new world full of aliens, both K and J needs to save the world from destruction with their high tech weapons. Their enemy is a ''Bug '', considered to be a plague and one of the worst aliens in the universe, and also a very large and disgusting cockroach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but totally unmemorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When NYPD cop Edwards pursues a subject that he believes was some form of alien he finds a mysterious agent believes him and offers him an interview. When Agent K offers him a position as a man in black he discovers an underworld of aliens that is regulated and hidden. When a bug comes to earth in search of the universe agents K and J find themselves in a race against time to stop the bug and prevent the destruction of the earth.This film was well hyped when it first came out and got plenty of good publicity through Smith's song of the same name. However it always felt like a film that was gearing itself up for a sequel rather than a film in itself. The story is in two strands - the first is J's fish out of water act and the second is the search for the universe. These two interlink as the main body is the attempt to stop the bug, but the funniest moments involve J being overwhelmed by the tings around him - in this setting he is the most accessible character to the audience as we are experiencing the same as him. The plot is a little daft but it's all delivered with tongue in cheek and has enough laughs to keep us amused.Smith delivers yet another popcorn blockbuster and does his usual cocky performance that we've seen so many times - the only thing that stops him getting irritating is that he is clearly out of his depth in K's world. Tommy Lee Jones is very good and in my mind, a lot cooler than Smith, he does get some good deadpan lines but mainly is Smith's straight man. It's hard to imagine anyone else doing the role as he does it so well and I hope they manage to twist the sequel to bring his character back in - I can't image Smith can carry MIB2. Fiorentino, D'Onofrio, Shalhoub and Rip Torn all add class in support but this is mainly Smith and Jones's show.The special effects are good and the action is cool in a comic book style. However the length of the film and the focus on K and J's interaction rather than a straight up plot does make it feel like it was made with an eye on a franchise rather than the film as a complete package itself.Overall a funny stylish comedy that will amuse throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This had been around on television for some time and I'd avoided it because it seemed so popular among the crowd that likes to see gore and ooze on the screen, and because I tuned in for a few minutes and caught scene in which the two men in black (Smith and Jones -- two exotic names for you) used ray guns to blow the head off an alien, and then another different head, covered with elastic glue, wriggled into sight. Enough is enough.But I caught the whole film more recently and the humor is generally more subtle than that, although the usual special effects abound. I'll give an example of what I mean. Smith and Jones have just shot down a huge flying saucer that has whirled around the skies like a just-loosed inflated balloon. The saucer crashes into the earth a hundred yard from the two men, and its momentum carries it towards the duo standing there immobile. Closer and closer, it plows through the earth towards the two fixed figure, stirring up a monstrous cloud of roiling dirt and debris. It looks as if they're about to become part of that debris. Jones is starring defiantly at the approaching catastrophe as if staring down a villain in an action movie. Smith says nothing -- no wisecracks, no cries of fright. He simply glances briefly at Jones with an entreating expression. It's only an instant but it's at least as funny as any other scene in the movie.The catastrophic shoot outs and wreckage may appeal to the kids but what I found most admirable were the smaller touches of absurdity. Multiple TV screens of aliens let loose on earth to lead normal lives include clips of Sly Stallone and a popular network weatherman. Two of the aliens, looking normal, or relatively normal, enter a restaurant for a chat. And the director and writer make sure that we see what they order. Not the usual fare, not sandwiches or spaghetti, but pierogi -- Polish dumplings.I won't carry on about it. Will Smith is our proxy. He finds out what's going on as Tommy Lee Jones leads him through the problems they face. Smith is often puzzled, frightened, and given to ironic cracks. Jones is his opposite, the straight man who never smiles, and who is just as funny because his absurd statements are delivered deadpan. Ditto for Rip Torn, who plays it almost as a serious thriller. Linda Fiorentino is alluring as all get out and I'm glad she was there, so she could tumble through the trees in a short skirt.The kids will get a kick out of the wreckage and the grown ups who are sensitive to the more delicate touches will find it funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining and funny sci-fi/comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm about 16 years late seeing this, and I saw the third one first (with no need for #2), but I must say that this is one of the most fun movie-watching experiences I've ever had. It was non-stop laughs and thrills from beginning to end. The element which stuck out to me as being done extraordinarily well was the writing, specifically the comic interplay between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Their characters are so different, and yet play off each other so well. Even the smaller parts were well-written and played. Of particular amusement to me was the largely physical performance given by Vincent D'Onofrio as the main bad bug. You can tell he gave it his all with his awkward speech patterns and movements. It really seemed like he was adjusting to a human body, and it was all done with a sly sense of humor. The only thing I find lacking was some dated CG, but considering it came out over 15 years ago, it was fine. If anything it adds to the B-movie charm, and some of alien design was probably influenced by 1950's "Creature Features" anyway. All things considered, it was an absolutely incredible and enthralling viewing experience. It's just a shame I waited so long to check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MIB: A Special Effects Joy-Ride All the Way!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The term "Men in Black" refers to the slick black suits and wraparound sunglasses that all MIB agents wear. Like "Ghostbusters", it's both a comedy and a scary sci-fi movie. The evil alien bug kills seven people: He eats Edgar and then puts on his skin as an "Edgar" suit to pass as human. He also kills: the "Zap-'Em" bug exterminator. A waiter and 2 aliens at the sleazy Greek Restaurant, where aliens eat pierogies. The tow-truck driver and the bug-smashing morgue clerk. All because he is looking for the "universe hanging from Orion's belt", which is hidden somewhere on Earth. Other carnage: An alien jumps off the Guggenheim Museum. "K" zaps "Mikey" the bug-eyed alien. The giant cockroach swallows "K" whole so therefore it gets blow apart; twice. Thrilling CGI by ILM. According to the MIB: The aliens among us include Al Roker, Sly Stalone and Martha Stewart. Elvis didn't die, he just went back to his home planet. Aliens are taxidrivers, pawnshop clerks with heads that-grow-back and tandem bicyclists. Agent "J" has his hands-full delivering an alien baby squid. The agency's headquarters is a huge complex with Rip Torn as the boss (Agent "Zed"). Just remember: there are maybe 1500 aliens on Earth at any one time. Most of them live in New York City and Queens. The secret government agency run by "The Men in Black" is your first line of defense against total chaos and destruction from alien invaders, such as the Arquillians. Terrific alien "suits" by make up genius Rick Baker. Look for the alien bug suit worn in the movie "Explorers". My favorite supporting characters: "Frank" the talking Pug dog and the sexy "morgue queen". "Don't zap her so much, she'll develop brain cancer and forget half of the classes she learned in medical school."-Will Smith as agent "J". The most perfect example of contemporary filmmaking: Best film editing, cinematography, CGI, musical score, sound editing, scripting and comedy acting that you will ever see. Miles ahead of "Ghostbusters". Vincent D'Onofrio (as "the bug wearing the Edgar suit") gives the most convincing performance. He should have won an Academy Award. Note: The MIB music video is not on the one disc DVD repackaged version. Easily the best of the 3 movies in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An always surprising and amazing action/adventure sci-fi comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best and most original films to come out of Hollywood in the last 20 years. Director Barry Sonnenfeld takes his unashamedly different approaches to film and comedy into the area of the "comic book movie franchise" genre. The wonderful cast is headed up by the always dependable Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith as Agents K and J, respectively. It is an absolutely delightful film, in every sense of the word. The movie combines drama with humor and action, and does it very well. It is the best film I've seen in the area of achieving these moments of fierce action and real-world occurrences, directly followed up by moments of off-the-wall sci-fi adventure and outrageous dialog/characterizations/body language. 'Men in Black' is more or less three parallel stories running simultaneously, all expertly navigated by Sonnenfeld. We have the background story of the Men in Black agency, being told to us by Agent K and Director Zed (Rip Torn). In a nutshell, the agency has been around for a long time now. It is tasked with monitoring alien activity and protecting Earth's citizens from any harm the aliens might have planned. Smith first shows up as NYPD cop James Edwards, who through a very strange (yet hilarious) set of occurrences, is gradually inducted into the agency and learns the ropes, therefore becoming the newest recruit. And we have the not-so-unfortunate story of a douche bag farmer named Edgar, who is killed but his skin is used as a disguise 'Edgar suit' for an evil alien bug. This bug plans to find an item of great importance to him and to other alien races, so that a certain war between two of these races can continue, and his own race can continue to feed off the casualties - literally. Now, while this may seem like a lot of unnecessary explanation leading to a lot of unnecessary exposition in the film, this is simply not so. The story is explained, very quickly, in just a few scenes. Sometimes, we figure out things as the characters do, other times, we are let in on stuff long before the characters ever are. But the film does not ever lose pace because of these elements, nor does it stop so the audience can catch up with all these goings-on. The film purposefully barrels along at a breakneck speed, and the audience is just expected to dive right in and hold on for dear life. Once this is accomplished, the story is really not that hard to understand. However, if one feels that the story disappoints or just doesn't understand it, then the film is always entertaining just as a great popcorn flick. This would also probably be the case for why small children enjoy these films so much - they may not understand the story particulars, but they like the special effects and the comedic moments. This is all assisted by not only the main cast, but also by several great character actors and actresses, such as Tony Shalhoub and Siobhan Fallon. Whichever way you look at it, 'Men in Black' is a ridiculously entertaining ride of action and all kinds of comedy, and I highly recommend it. Which is not something I can say for 'Men in Black II', unfortunately. Since I haven't seen 'Men in Black III' as of yet, I cannot comment on it in the slightest. I'm hoping it's just as good, or better even, than this first installment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love both men as actors. As both are really the best duo in this groundbreaking film.Agent K real name Kevin(Tommy Lee Jones) is retiring for personal reasons of his own. Despite his gruff interior is a soft side to him. As he recruits unorthodox cop, Office James aka Agent J(Will Smith).Despite the fact of not following the rules, J is picked over what he saw and seems to be more of a people person than the military people that are also recruits.Jones straight man to Smith's comic foil are an odd but nonetheless really hilarious match. As both must duel with aliens. That are humans in disguise. Taking on Vincent D Onofiro in a pre-Law and Order CI appearance as the antagonist! Fifteen years old nearly sixteen but still, a classic to date!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only mainstream sci-fi films could learn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could have reviewed this film after Men In Black 3 came out, but whatever.I was seven when I first saw this. I remembered the heavy promotion and the music video of Will Smith's resurgence into hip hop. I remembered two things: This film is kinda weird and I want a pair of Ray Bans.Weird in a good way. It's not a conventional sci-fi film. I would go on to say that it's a dark comedy. Everything about sci-fi films is portrayed in such a different tone. It has an unusual blend of wonder, eeriness, and comedy, which you could tell right off the bat with the opening music.I found the idea refreshing. We've all heard of the mythical men in black, supposedly shadowy figures that silence UFO witnesses. Here they portrayed much more light heartedly, as people doing a job. The exposition in this film is actually subtle. The humour derives itself on the fact that most characters are so deadpan and that they're very used to dealing with extra terrestrials. Instead of a film where we're trying to understand how to defeat the antagonist, we're looking at a film where it's just all in a day's work.Another source of great humour is the dynamic between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. The grizzled emotionless veteran and the young idealistic new recruit. Agent J shows us the human perspective while throwing in that genuine Fresh Prince comedy.What baffled me is how lowered the scope is of this film. The climax involved the destruction of the earth by an alien battleship and they bleakly made it clear that it doesn't matter."There's always an alien battle cruiser, a Korillean death ray or an intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on this miserable little planet and the only way these people get on with their happy lives is that they do not know about it!". Basically put, we don't matter, we are insignificant in the bigger picture.I remember that parts of this film freaked me out, especially scenes with the Edgar bug. But that has to be the best silver screen villain ever.I loved it and it will be one of my favourite sci-fi films ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Sci-Fi Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men in Black is a great movie, especially for sci-fi/fantasy geeks. Several things make this movie work. They are superb acting, great music, and excellent alien visuals. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith star as two agents from an agency that deals with aliens as Agent K and Agent J. J is the rookie of the group so K must train him to be a successful agent and possibly be even more. They have to deal with a bug who took a dead man's body to find a jewel and deliver the jewel to a battalion just off Earth or the planet will be blown to pieces. The acting is excellent. Will Smith is the best and Tommy Lee Jones is not far behind him. The score by Elfman is great to listen to. I also liked the Grammy-nominated song by Will Smith. The makeup and alien visuals are great and not stupid like most cheesy sci-fi flicks. This is a very good movie! I rate this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoa! If you ask me, MEN IN BLACK is an adrenaline pumping sci-fi ride that'll have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The first time I ever saw this movie was on my way home from Orlando in 1998. When the aliens appeared, I was scared. This was because of the special effects. Also, the martial arts and special effects were very well done. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this adrenaline pumping sci-fi ride that'll have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish to any Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones fan who hasn't seen it.

		<shortDescription>Modern sci-fi needs to revisit this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is simply so lovable, and it has affected many people who have seen it. Men In Black has such a nice atmosphere, and it's not gritty and dark as science fiction or fantasy written these days. How many people have seen this movie and were immediately (not entirely seriously) convinced aliens have visited us? When it's a movie like Men In Black, it's so much more fun believing aliens might exist. There are movies that make aliens seem like killing machines whose only purpose is to destroy human race OR they are the kind of wise creatures who are so much better than us. But the aliens in Men In Black are - apart from the villains - almost sympathetic. They seem nice and really ordinary. Most of the charm of this movie comes from Will Smith. He is a talented actor, and his experience in comedy such as Fresh Prince of Bel Air has given him the ability to deliver comedic lines wonderfully. For him they are natural, and while Tommy Lee Jones's character Kay doesn't get as many one-liners, said by him the feeling is different. The character Jay is exactly how many of us would like to be in a situation like this. Of course the aliens and secret organisations are all new to him and he is allowed to be openly confused, but he still seems extremely excited about everything instead of being too broody or too angry like most heroes in action. This movie was made in 1990s, and the effects aren't what we see in the theaters these days, but they are still pretty damn amazing. When we are used to see the extremely beautiful science fiction, something as simple as Men In Black is a nice change. Men In Black is simple science fiction comedy. It's a movie that made me like science fiction, and is still probably the reason I'm not into the kind of science fiction where everything is in space and where you can see the filmmakers tried way too hard. Men In Black has a quite simple setting, quite simple plots and ordinary characters. Jay could be anyone of us, chosen by almost randomly instead of having some kind of great destiny. This is what science fiction needs to revisit. This is amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently re-watched MIB. It's been years since I had last seen it, I used to love this movie as a child, but only now I can actually see how smart it really is.We follow Agent J as he discovers the truth: there is extraterrestrial life. We are just as surprised as him, and he serves as a guide to all these new crazy aliens. We also get to know the stoic agent K, with his own past and what he had to sacrifice just so he could do his job of keeping The Earth safe. We really like them throughout the movie. I don't even know if this works as a buddy cop movie, as K is more like a teacher and not only a partner.During this last re watch I could see what I believe is the central theme: "Don't judge a book by it's cover", or the message that you shouldn't judge anyone by their appearance because they can be so much more and surprise you. It's everywhere in the film. For example: The small gun that carries a big punch; all the aliens that look like normal humans; K's car that seems old; the aliens and the little girl in the test; and most of all, in J. In the beginning we only see him wearing these weird colorful clothes, and everyone thinks he is, well, not special. Then we see him in the suit, and he shows us what he really is about.And in the end we get a glimpse of our own irrelevance in one of the best last scenes in the history of cinema. Even the universe may not be what it seems.So, this is a great, smart movie, with a very solid story, great for children and adults alike. The effects, which stand the test of time, and details, are the cherry on top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Men in Black" is a fun and original take on the alien genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We're so familiar with aliens terrifying the bejeesus out of us in films that it's refreshing to see a well-known classic spoof the genre. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones work miracles together playing detective-like heroes assigned to take down and destroy aliens. Jones is hilarious. Usually playing serious men, Jones is so funny and doesn't take himself too seriously. Bruce Willis has nothing on him. Will Smith is a little out of control and that't the reason his performance works. He's a funny dude who isn't fit for saving the world. Jay and Kay bond perfectly together breathing energy to this fun film as well as an ounce or two of heart. Seeing Smith and Jones wear sunglasses and fancy suits while holding giant space guns is a cinematic sight no one can forget. With visual effects pretty spellbound for the time, "Men in Black" is fun and entertaining throughout. It can't compare to some of the other films mostly relying on unique creatures to draw us in, but it's such an original story that has a witty script by Ed Solomon and well-handled directing by Barry Sonnenfeld who not only knows how to blend comedy and intense action, but can make you truly care about the men in black shooting up giant cockroach aliens and working like charmers. "Men in Black" does get a little odd at times, not staying true to its premise and taking some plot turns that I wasn't particularly fond of. However, this film stays fun throughout and should be seen to experience 90's blockbuster action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's impressive how they were able to produce a great effects comedy out of such a corny comic book property. But thanks to a breezy script, some nice CGI and makeup effects and great comic writing, "Men in Black" fires on all cylinders. It's got a fine cast (Rip Torn, Siobhan Fallon, Tony Shalhoub, and my favorite Vincent D'Onofrio performance) and there's not very much here (at all) that feels forced. And to top it all off, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones prove to be gifted comedic actors (and at their charismatic utmost). As Sonnenfeld films go, it ranks right up there with "Get Shorty" and "The Addams Family". It's a great New York movie, popcorn movie, and a 90-minute series of memorable one-liners. It was a high-point of '90s movies, for me, and holds up terrifically today. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Sci-fi movie with great special effects. Good job Will Smith!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Men in Black" is a great movie, particularly for its sci-fi and dream geeks and it is the first version of the sequence. There are many things that make this movie successful. There is a great acting, fine music, and outstanding alien visuals. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith worked as two agents for an organization that deals with aliens known as Agent J and Agent K. Will Smith is as always the the best and Tommy Lee Jones as well is not far behind anyone. This movie has plenty of great things to discuss about; it is hilarious, adventurous, and filled with action-packed series.I really love both characters as actors as both are truly the best actors in this revolutionary movie. In spite of the fact of not following the policies, J is selected over what he saw and appears to be more of a people person than the military people that are also workforce. Right from the commencement of this movie, the story catches the spectator's concentration because the viewers will have no thought to what is going on. It was not until minutes later when everything is exposed. Even after that, the spectators will have questions in large numbers. All your private questions will be answered when Will Smith comes into the equation. Once this occurs, things speed up real fast. Performing as villain, Edgar, performed as Vincent D'Onofrio. Although he's not a villain, he's just one repulsive bug-like alien. He's my favorite character in this film. The reason after this was how his personality is in general. The persona of Edgar is just simple rude. As for the special effects, they possess their own exclusivity that makes it tempting to only watch one time.'Men in Black' is energy pumping sci-fi journey that'll keep you on the edge of your seat from begin to end. The first time ever I saw this movie was when I was coming back from Miami in December, 1997. When the aliens came into view, I was scared because of the special effects. In addition, the special effects and martial arts were very well played. The most amazing part in this sci-fi movie was the best quality men's suit worn by these celebrities to make this movie outclass. I saw the exact suits and jackets at one of the top ranking online site, desert leather.com where you can get all types of men's suites at very affordable price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No neuralyzer will be powerful enough to make you forget this experience ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through its effective combination of action, imagery and wit, "Men in Black" accomplishes the same exploit than "Back to the Future" and deserves the title of the second most classic Sci-fi comedy ever.Indeed, being the genre that requires the most expensive budgets, the most use of special effects, art-design and make-up, and relying on the difficult premise of spectacular entertainment and philosophical insights about human condition, Sci-fi was the most likely genre to be condemned for gravity and solemnity, no matter how heart-pounding the action is. Hence the heavyweights like "Blade Runner", "Terminator 2", "Avatar" or more recently "Prometheus", when it's all about wowing the audience, plunging viewers in a world of wonders and amazement, their disbelief suspended beforehand.How refreshing now to have a movie like "Men in Black", one of the most original contributions to Sci-fi but never taking both genre and budget for granted, and as a result, never taking itself seriously. "MIB" is a hilarious spy-action-comedy involving probably the coolest-looking secret agency of the same name, well with their Ray-Ban sunglasses and black and white suits; they sure have the coolest outfits. And talk about a thrilling job: monitoring aliens who visit or live on Earth, and controlling their movements inside and outside the planet. In fact, they're not even aliens but inter-galactic immigrants.And it really suits the film that it introduces the MIB during an arrest of illegal immigrants. Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and his partner intercept the patrol, and quickly exposes the alien, a weird bug-eyed Mexican who doesn't seem to understand one word of Spanish. His face reveals to be a human mask only held by a creature that bears some strange resemblance ?sorry for the outrageous reference- with the monster in "Howard the Duck's". The monster jumps on the horrified border patrolman but is immediately blown-up by Agent K spilling a disgusting blue slime all over the place and the poor guy's face.And then comes the key moment that unveils the film's most memorable device (after the black suits and sunglasses): the neuralyzer. Just one red flash, and the witness's memories of their recent sightings (and prevent the agency from some undesirable publicity) are instantly erased. Not only the poor patrolman and his colleagues have no clue about what is going on, but K's partner who feels it's time to retire will get the same treatment. He watches the stars in the dark sky and sadly declares "I'll miss the chase", to which K answers "No you won't", putting on his trademark sunglasses, and adjusting the neuralyzer.The film cuts to Edwards (Will Smith) a NYPD officer chasing an extraordinarily fast and agile criminal who leaves no doubt about his 'extra-terrestrial' background. No one believes Edwards, except for the coroner Dr. Laura Weaver who just discovered some pretty weird stuff during her autopsy, her enthusiasm will be abruptly cut in one neuralyzing flash from agent K. He confronts him with a pawnshop owner (Tony Shalhoub) in order to find out the model of weapon used by the alien, Geebs knows nothing and then the bad cop/ good cop routine is suddenly interrupted by K blowing Geeb's head off ? but only as a warning, the head grows back, contributing to one of the film's most defining moment.Still, Edwards is not part of the secret anymore and as we expect, gets a little red flash in the eye (believe me, it never gets redundant) However, K finds some potential in Edwards and leaves him a business card to assist to a recruiting session. The test, the admission in the headquarters, the little aliens who specialized in making coffee, and Rip Torn as Z, the head of the agency, everything is a triumph of design and humor. The 'MIB' is like an intergalactic 'spaceport' with the widest range of Aliens' you'll find in a film, but even the most rudimentary is more convincing than "Independence Day" atrocious octopuses.And the place works as a galactic bureau of investigation as well with all the procedural you'd expect, and treated the most seriously. And that's the greatest thing about "MIB" that aliens are visiting Earth or trying to find a cover is treated as if it was the most ordinary thing in the world. In a brief screen showing different undercover aliens, we can immediately spot Sylvester Stallone, these gags are the soul of "Men in Black". And don't get me started with Pavillon State monument used as a disguise for two spaceships or a weird fireball being the cause of New York 1977 black-out.But these gags work less because of their content than the way they're delivered. Tommy Lee Jones, with his humorless and very matter-of-fact tone, makes the weirdest information sound totally normal, therefore more hilarious. And the fact is that we end up believing him? Would you believe he'll get the hottest information from cheap tabloid newspapers? Well, in fact, given the context of the film, it all makes sense.However, the rhythm slows down a little because such a film still needs a villain who can only lead to more formulaic situation. The bad guy is played by Vincent d'Onofrio as a hillbilly whose skin was used to cover a hideous cockroach-like monster. His plot involves a small galaxy held by an Alien from an enemy planet, but it's not as creative as the whole set-up and while Fiorentino tries to find a place between the two leads, the film is never as funny and absorbing as when it involves Agent K and Agent J. The ending is perfect though with a last shot that teaches us a wonderful lesson of intergalactic-humility.As a comedy, "MIB" captures the existential Sci-fi spirit more than serious films : life's a joke, but stars are still beautiful to watch or to paraphrase Will Smith, the difference between "MIB" and other Sci-fi, is that comedy makes it look good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Sci-Fi Film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men in Black (MIB) (Columbia Pictures, 1997) is a sci-fi-thriller set in the 1980s. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, it stars well-known actors such as Tommy Lee Jones who plays K, Will Smith as J, and Linda Florentino as Laura. K recruits J to join a top secret government program that monitors and controls aliens living on earth. As alien monitors, they also work to keep peace among the alien nations who send representatives to earth to keep them safe knowing that the U.S. government is monitoring all alien activity. However, things go wrong when an alien bug lands in upstate New York without authorization, and begins a killing spree as it seeks a galaxy hidden on "Orion's Belt". The film is a combination of conspiracy theory and alien sci-fi as K and J work in the government's top secret division, monitoring aliens and setting back the memory of civilians who encounter the aliens. The alien creatures, their human interaction, intergalactic travel, and ability to destroy plants with their battleships, is reminiscent of Star Wars. Throughout MIB, the camera angles use various techniques, from objective to subjective, with significant use of camera panning to set the stage for many of the scenes. The use of panning allows the viewer to gain familiarity with the setting before the action begins on the scene, such as in the morgue when the camera pans the sheet covered body of the tall alien before K and J come in to take care of the bodies and wipe the short term memory of coroner. Camera tilting is used to imply urgency or build suspense such as the "give the kid a weapon" scene. The motif of men in black is maintained as all members of the secret government program wear black after they are recruited into the program. The black is like a status symbol playing on years of Hollywood stereo casing of secret government agents, which makes it a humorous parody of conspiracy theories, mind altering technology, and laser weapons. Overall the film is was quite enjoyable for its pure entertainment factors, with just enough suspense to hold an audience's attention. Conspiracy theorists should love this film for its almost believability as aliens disguise themselves and live as ordinary citizens with a controlling government running secret programs to hide what ordinary people suspect, but have never been able to prove the existence of like sasquatch. Now I think I'm going to watch MIB II to see if the sequel is a good as the first!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Blend of Sci-Fi, Comedy, Action, and Will Smith at his Blockbuster Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I'm in a movie discussion with friends and the topic drifts towards top comic book movies, I really need to remember to start including MEN IN BLACK. Released in 1997, I suppose you could say it was the first real mainstream Marvel comic adaptation (remember, BLADE wasn't released until 1998). To be honest, I wasn't even aware that it even was based on a Marvel comic until many years later. I guess the series was pretty short-lived, and the movie doesn't really do much to remain faithful to the source material. Still, a comic movie it is and it remains one of my favorites. It's funny, there's some great action, and the effects continue to hold up well even now. The Men in Black are a top-secret government organization dedicated to monitoring and policing extraterrestrial activity on Earth. When his partner retires, Agent K (Jones) sees potential in NYPD officer James Edwards (Smith). He recruits Edwards and exposes him to the truth: aliens are out there and they just want to go about their lives. Well, most of them. Edwards, rechristened as Agent J, has got his work cut out for him on his first investigation. An interstellar bug has arrived on Earth with galaxy theft on his mind, and an Arquillian battle cruiser has settled into orbit with weapons powered and intent to destroy the planet if the MiB don't provide them with said galaxy. The problem is: where does one hide an entire galaxy in the city of New York? Agents J and K had better figure it out or they won't have long to regret it.MEN IN BLACK comes from a time when Will Smith was king of the summer blockbuster. He was at the top of his money making game, and MEN IN BLACK is one of his best summer action hits. MEN IN BLACK has all of the ingredients for a hit that continues to entertain long after it's left theaters. First and foremost, it's got a perfect blend of action, comedy, and science fiction. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones have perfect chemistry, with Smith doing his usual routine (or what once was his usual routine) and Jones as his no-nonsense partner/mentor in the life of a MiB agent. The Smith/Jones partnership is the only factor that remained cool well into the sequel, despite everything else about it failing miserably. The creature effects in this movie are, somehow, better than both sequels combined. I imagine it's because it relies more on practical effects and makeup for the various alien creatures populating this world. Rick Baker's creature effects in MEN IN BLACK are fantastic. Mikey (the illegal alien), the worms, the Arquillian ambassador?the practical effects are the best effects. From the moment I first saw the original MEN IN BLACK, I'd hoped it would become an ongoing franchise. In my defense, that was before I knew how they'd nearly kill the franchise with the garbage that was MEN IN BLACK II. But there is still potential in the franchise; MEN IN BLACK 3 was nowhere near the train-wreck I was expecting and I would love for the series to continue on with new agents and the right writer/director.What a new MEN IN BLACK will need that the second film forgot was a strong villain. The original movie had a great alien baddie: a giant cockroach crammed in the skin of a white trash human farmer named Edgar, as played by Vincent D'Onofrio. D'Onofrio was great, giving Edgar a host of bizarre ticks and stiff movements with a full-on hatred for humankind. Then there is Linda Fiorentino as local mortician Laurel Weaver, who's only really there for plot purposes. She's also supposed to fill the role of a possible love interest for Agent J, but nothing really comes of it and, come to think of it, she doesn't really do anything in the movie. I guess Weaver could be seen as the weakest link in the film. Weak love interest aside, the rest of the film is populated with appropriately weird faces to fill it out. Rip Torn is Zed, head of the MiB, and Tony Shalhoub is intergalactic arms dealer and local pawnbroker Jack Jeebs. MEN IN BLACK is still a lot of fun more than ten years since it was originally released. After having watched the original again after so many years and finding that I love it just as much as when I saw it the first time, I think the series is due for a reboot with new agents and new sci-fi craziness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Make them happy memories."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a Comic Book that was based on the Real-Life MiB. Yes there have actually been reports since the Fifties that after a UFO or Flying Saucer encounter, many People reported being visited by enigmatic "Agents" dressed all in black and wearing sunglasses.But the reports were anything but amusing to those who had the unfortunate visitation. They were usually told quite forcefully, in short, to shut-up or pay the price. These were sinister, ominous, and frightening "People" that some reported as being really strange with pale white skin, awkward demeanors, and uncomfortable in domestic situations. In other words they didn't quite have a handle on the Human thing and were themselves Aliens masquerading as Government Operatives.The Movie takes the concept and turned it into an offbeat Comedy that works quite well. After all, those Real-Life situations were nothing more than anxiety prone, easily traumatized, Folks who were imagining such things at best, and at worst outright Hoaxes. So none of it is to be taken seriously.Given that, this succeeds on many levels. it taps into the whole Ufology thing and spins a wild tale of a mostly benign Alien Invasion. But there are so many different types of Lifeforms that occasionally some become a threat and so the "Black" Ops Government tries to keep a watch on the goings and comings. This is all handled in such good spirits here that it becomes an infectious, silly romp that is immensely entertaining and a lot of fun. It holds up well with good Performances and Direction, wacky SFX and make-up, and a good score. Not quite as good as Mars Attacks (1996), but still quite a Show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great memories from my chidhood watching this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I was about eight or nine and this movie first came out. I loved it so much as many of the kids my age did. I must have watched it 100 times and to this day I still enjoy it. It is easily the best of the series starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Will Smith is his usual hilarious self and Tommy Lee Jones plays his part pretty well too that being said I am usually not a big fan of his.This movie is about a young cop who while chasing a crook one day stumbles upon a strange secret. He meets a man named K from a special orginization called the Men In black. K recruits the young man as his new partner and he finds out what Men In Black does.This will always be one of my favorites movies. I have loved it since I was a kid and there is no doubt that I will be showing it to my kids one day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Galaxy Defenders in their very first mission (or is it? With prequels and such you never know really). The movie on hand though does work very well (even the little CGI that was used held up quite good I'd say), which is the achievement (especially) by the actors! Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones work perfectly together. The stern almost emotionless Tommy (aka K) and the energetic J, who's all over the place. That formula works like magic.Of course there is other things that make this fun, like the "aliens" that live among us for years. You might recognize one or two of them. Some are in the background some are shown very openly. A good mix of Sci-Fi, Action and Comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my childhood sci-fi movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most memorable sci-fi movies I have seen. It's nothing really epic per say, but the unique aspect of it all makes it stand out. Well at least when it came out. This movie had elements that hasn't been done before it and has a simple plot but it's interesting and engaging. Alien movies has been done countless times before but what makes this movie stand out is the investigative side of it. Instead of a one side fighting another in a constant battle. I first saw this movie during my childhood and thought it was the coolest thing ever and thought the soundtrack was so awesome. Even the Will Smith rap song that went with the movie during my childhood. The plot is about a group of special people that balance out the extraterrestrial life forms that are on earth and keep things secret for the rest of the world. And also wipe out aliens that are a threat to the planet earth. As the movie progresses you learn more about how the MIB work through the eyes of agent J(Will Smith) who is a new recruit. Who does a great job with his role while adding a bit of humor into the mix. Agent K(Tommy Lee Jone) is the really serious one of the two and takes his job very very seriously and is always serious. But the pair works well in this movie. Overall this is a fun sci-fi movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and for the most part it works.7.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men in Black (1997) *** (out of 4) Good mix of comedy, science fiction and action has NYC police officer (Will Smith) recruited into a secret agency that tracks alien life form on Earth. Soon he and his partner (Tommy Lee Jones) have the biggest battle imaginable as the fate of the Earth is at risk due to an alien bug. MEN IN BLACK is far from a classic but I think there's enough imagination here for two movies and there's no question that the leads share some terrific chemistry and that alone makes the film worth watching. Again, you're life isn't going to change by watching this movie but not everything should try to be an Oscar-winning drama. There's no doubt that this is a popcorn flick but what a good one it is. I think the greatest thing the film has going for it are the two leads. These two actors are so different that it was just perfect bringing them together. Jones has no problems playing it straight while Smith can go over-the-top and silly without becoming annoying. You put the two together and they perfectly blend and really make the film what it is. Linda Fiorentino is good in her supporting bit as is Vincent D'Onofrio as the mutant trying to take over the world. The special effects in the film certainly don't hold up as well today compared to more modern CGI flicks but they're still quite nice. The imagination in the various aliens is very impressive as are some of the gadgets including the one that erases memory. MEN IN BLACK doesn't try to do anything too special except deliver a good time and it does that just fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is awesome. They did a good high quality job on it, and it did not focus it all on violence. If you do not like gruesome aliens that look disgusting, you may want to not see this. The only one fact that I do not like is that one of the agents in there cusses a lot. They also do have a disturbing situation in one of the parts in the movie. Luckily they do not show the image of it. I can't wait to see the sequel, Men in Black II. Also, lots of people will say that this is comedy and action. There is not that much to laugh at in this movie. I personally think that people watching this should be about ten years old at the least when they watch this. Put five star rating for this and buy it. This is a movie that deserves to be in your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>J and K, the great comic duo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones is Agent K, a man who takes his work very seriously. He's all business, possessing no sense of humor that he is aware of. Will Smith is K's new partner Agent J. J is the flashy, showy type. Young, cool and hip, everything K is not. They are the Men in Black, part of a top-secret organization which monitors alien activity on Earth. Turns out aliens have been living among us, peacefully for the most part, for years. The Men in Black keep the alien presence under wraps. Everything is going along just fine until a Bug shows up. Now the Earth is set up for imminent destruction. Only J and K can save us. And if while saving us they can make us laugh all the better.J and K, Smith and Jones, are a terrific comic duo. They play off one another beautifully with absolutely wonderful chemistry. The obvious contrast between the buttoned-down K and the exuberant J provides plenty of comic gold. Both actors suit their parts perfectly, Smith the showman and Jones the straight man. With his wry, dry wit the supposedly unfunny K is actually one of the funniest characters you'll see. And J, new as he is to the whole aliens among us thing, provides plenty of laughs as he tries to come to grips with what the heck is actually going on. Smith and Jones are obviously the stars of the show. But they are ably supported by the likes of Rip Torn and Linda Fiorentino as well as Vincent D'Onofrio who does very well with a clearly challenging role, that of the villainous Bug who certainly doesn't blend in as seamlessly as all the other aliens populating Manhattan. It's a movie which has a great look to it, the whole menagerie of aliens look terrific, the visual effects are seamless. The story moves along well with plenty of laughs throughout. It's a movie which knows better than to take itself seriously. It's an unabashed parody and a very good one, with the great comic duo of Smith and Jones working ever so well together to put the whole thing over the top. Popcorn flick that it is Men in Black may not make many lists of the greatest movies ever. But it's hard to imagine you can watch this movie and not come away with a smile on your face.</fullReview>

I first saw this movie when I was about eight years old and remember watching it about ten times over when I first rented the film. I loved the partner duo as Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith star as two MIB agents trying to stop aliens that threaten to blow up Earth. I think this is one of Will Smith's fine early movies. This is the reason why he is such a huge blockbuster actor today. I highly recommend this film. This is a clever andfeel good movie that a family would enjoy.

		<shortDescription>A memorable comedy that even a deneuralyser shouldn't wipe from your mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barry Sonnenfeld directs this movie, starring Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith as K and J, two of the Men In Black, men who have the fun job of protecting the Earth from the scum of the universe.Aliens have been visiting our planet for years and it's the job of the MIB to make sure that they behave, pass through or relocate peacefully and that the general public don't find out all about them. Like Casablanca but with aliens. When NYPD cop James Darrel Edwards (Smith) runs down a cephalopod on foot he gets the attention of K (Jones), who then picks him as his new partner. J soon gets to see that there's a whole other world around him he knew nothing about. And that's just the stuff on his own planet.Sonnenfeld directs with style and great timing, helped along by great FX work, a smart and snappy script, a fun score from Danny Elfman and, last but by no means least, a fantastic cast including the likes of Linda Fiorentino, Vincent D'Onofrio, Rip Torn, Tony Shalhoub and the leading men themselves. Tommy Lee Jones has said that he now knows the secret of good comedy - stand next to Will Smith. That may be the case but I think he's selling himself short as his "straight", deadpan demeanour arguably produces even more laughs than Smith's smartass wisecracking although it has to be said that the pair of them make for one of the best (and unlikeliest?) double acts in recent times.There are verbal gags, visual gags, sly references for film fans and simply a whole lot of fun in every scene here (one of my personal favourite moments remains the "entry exam" moments), it's a film that it's hard to see anyone disliking and is certainly one of the best of the 90s blockbusters that actually delivered on all the promise it had.See this if you like: Ghostbusters, Men In Black II, Mars Attacks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's Jonesing for an excellent Buddy Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men in Black is one of those rare movies you don't want to end too soon, and 98 minutes is really too short.After all, they created (literally) a whole new universe, introduced some awesome alien and definitely great human characters and since it's an origin story, only about half of the movie do you get to see the dynamic duo in action.These sounds like complains, when in reality, I loved this movie.I saw Men in Black many years ago and I remembered liking it a lot. Perhaps, becoming relatively jaded in the quality of movies since made me forget on how excellent this movie was. All actors were dead on or near pitch-perfect in their roles, the comedy was huge, Tommy Lee Jones once again proved how wonderful he is as the straight man and Will Smith continued his leading man/comedy role greatly. Also, this movie introduced me to a wonderful actress, Fiorentino. (Too bad, she didn't return for the sequel.) But, as much as I like acting in movies, it didn't end there. The sets, cinematography, special effects (even at 13 years old now, it trumps a lot of movies today,) the comedy, score, screenplay, originality and action/adventure were all top notch. Barely a flaw I could see with this, possibly aside from the sad closing (SEE: Kay's decision) and Smith, though funny, was really just doing what he did best. Again.After a top secret agent of a top secret elite force retires, Kay (Jones) seeks out a new partner in rogue NYC cop Edwards (Smith,) who, of course, has to inevitably give up everything (which is nothing) to become Kay's partner Jay. It takes him a little while to learn the role of Alien Ambassador (with punked out guns and gadgets) and while he's getting adjusted, you'll fall in love with Jones's deadpan humor. Again, he plays the perfect straight man to wacky, on the edge and unorthodox Jay.Meanwhile, a "bug" or bad attitude giant cockroach inhabits a human body in order to steal the galaxy, which of course another space race wants back, even at the expense of Earth. Will supermen Jay &amp; Kay (and with the help of many zany characters (LOVE Frank the Pug,) and a mortician (Fiorentino)) solve the case and save the PLANET?! Is it really a spoiler to say? This is a must see. It's sad more movies can't be made like this today. Again, the special effects actually trump many since this, barely a moment did I not believe this universe they crafted didn't exist. (Well, Okay, I said barely: Smith delivering a child and being swung around wasn't 100% perfect, but still a good scene, again, thanks to Jones.) Though a bit gory at times, perhaps slimy and some bugaphobics might want to look away at times, everyone should see this fantastic adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men In Black is definitely a classic of the last decade, the special effects are phenomenal even for today and all of the scenes are memorable. I first want to say that Will Smith is one of my favorite actors and I think that he shows some of his range here he can play very funny and at the same time do very serious, the same can be said of Tommy Lee only when he plays funny it is a little bit more subtle and laid back. I think that they both had great chemistry and were the best people for their parts. This movie is first and foremost a Sci- Fi but it does have it's share of action. One of my favorite scenes involves an exploding alien and border control (if you've seen the movie you know what scene I mean). The direction is decent and I love some of the shots that Barry Levinson was able to get of the twin towers. Anyway it you haven't seen this movie definitely go pick it up. Also check out the second one, a third one is also apparently in production you can probably find more out on this site.</fullReview>

Tommy Lee Jones must (under that cliff face) think he's hit the jackpot for a paydirt picture: he just has to be himself, deadpan, weary but surprising. And everyone - including me - loves Will Smith, who keeps his improvising just in check.This is also an exemplary studio feature inasmuch as there's no hierarchy of labour. The animation and graphics, as well as foley artists right down (up?) to Danny Elfman writing the music are as important as one another. Ironically Men In Black a super postmodern comedy, but also a very modern achievement in terms of its composition. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men In Black was one of the biggest films of the summer in 1997. I remember seeing it at the cinema and laughing my head (substituting for another word) off. It brought in a lot of money at the box-office and continued to make Will Smith a star. This film is so wildly inventive and funny that you'll hardly care if it gets to be a tad silly. Director Barry Sonnelfeld is a talented filmmaker and has crafted a fun, highly entertaining film. So this may be one of my all-time favorite comedies, as well as one of my favorite sci-fi films. Will Smith stars as Agent Jay, who is recruited to be a part of a secret intelligence agency which deals with extra-terrestrials. Tommy Lee Jones is his partner and him and Smith embark on a mission to elimiate a lethal alien. Sure the plot is silly, but the film is hilarious. Smith and Jones have amazing chemistry and certainly prove to be a great buddy team. This film doesn't take itself too seriously which is a good thing, because as I've stated if you take this film too seriously you are certainly not going to enjoy it. Men In Black is rated PG-13 for Sci-Violence and Language. The action is bloodless, but the language is fair. Overall, a fun film which you'll have a great time with. The sequel, while not as good as the original, is still worth checking out too. Worth owning or at-least seeing.</fullReview>

MEN IN BLACK (known simply as MIB) is yet another summer affair in an already busy affair for summer blockbusters. But like the best ones, MIB learns not to take itself too seriously. Whether it concerns that anyone on Earth is an alien, or a giant cockroach, MIB knows how to make fun with itself and happily admit that it's a comedy. And as a comedy, MIB is actually clever and ingenious. The screenplay by Ed Solomon is filled with clever gags as well as clever ideas. The film is like one clever comic book cartoon with some really smart and hilarious ideas. It is based on a famous comic by Lowell Cunnigham, so the film does the right justice to its source.Will Smith, who last appeared in another alien invasion flick INDEPENDENCE DAY, is back, and joining him is Tommy Lee Jones, and chemistry between these two characters are terrific. Like in tradition of other partners like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the LETHAL WEAPON series, Jones and Smith have different personalities, and the sparring between them are worth watching. Solomon's screenplay gives these two guys a lot to do. The rest of the cast have been given the same good treatment as well, which is so much to be said about other summer flicks. The story concerns MIB agents J (Smith) and K (Jones) trying to save the world from a bug-like creature, who takes the form of a Hill-billy farmer (Vincent D'Onofrio) as a sort of human disguise, to take over the world by obtaining a sort of "Galaxy".Then of course, there are the special effects, which are terrific. Created by the effect wizards from Industrial Light &amp; Magic, the effects here are fun to look it, as they are plentiful. There's also a lot of help from Rick Baker, a professional with monster puppets and make-up, which brings to life a series of slimy yet creative critters as tiny alien "worms" or a giant cockroach that takes the skin and life of a farmer. These effects are darn good. Other than special effects are the production design created by Bo Welch, which are elaborate and fancy. Director Barry Sonnenfeld and his associates have a field day with these crazy, colorful, imaginative and, yes, slimy galaxy of visuals and creates a very stylish summer flick, but not so without substance.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Being A Little Kid...AGAIN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just revisited Barry Sonnenfelds great movie Men In Black. This movie has been a favourite since i was 6 or 7 years old when first viewing at my local cinema. When it was my first ever PG movie, i was enthralled by the 'baddies', the heroes, the comic book violence and the toned down language. When i watched it today, it still captured me. Remaining every bit as promising as I had remembered, and still it seemed that i should be watching something more for my age. Yet, i couldn't care less. This film is exactly why i want to make films, because its fun and if your end piece is 'enjoyable crap' rather than 'boring brilliance'; who gives a monkeys chuff anyway. The end result of this film may not be a top rated success with the critics, but it's enjoyable, fun and a roller-coaster ride of a film. I've always thought that its more important to be happy and enjoy your end piece of work than be given an award or a 100% rating success. The film itself doesn't go on any longer than it should, and doesn't remain to short to disappear from memory.Classy popcorn cinema that will always hold a place in my DVD collection.Plus....the box set was going for ?3 in HMV a couple of weeks ago. Can't complain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange but it works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fast paced and never too serious you cannot help but feel this is what cinema should be. Men in Black is certainly not just for the Sci Fi fans. It is a simple enough idea; a secret organisation manages the numerous aliens living on earth, unbeknown to the general public. The success lies in the all in a days work feel about the Men's dealing with the aliens, wearing suits to save the planet. It is also refreshing to see writers didn't try too hard. The top secrecy, for example, is maintained by flashing memory erasers. The story provides a mission but really the whole thing is just a lot of fun. Will Smith is excellent and strangely believable in his role. Together with Tommy Lee Jones' drips of sarcasm and impervious manner the interplay between Agents K and J works brilliantly. Coupled with a weird and wonderful selection of aliens characters makes for compelling viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tommy Lee Jones' finest hour and a half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Three Burials" not withstanding, this is certainly Tommy Lee Jones' finest performance in mainstream cinema, even including his psychotic brilliance in "Under Siege".The film is funny and well-made; still I can't help wondering about the film it could have been if director Barry Sonnenfeld hadn't been so fascinated with special effects (his commentary on the DVD is just about worthless).But Jones has a charm that reminds one of early Henry Fonda - all innocence despite experience, and supremely American in the best sense - plain, honest, determined.What a weird film for Jones' talent to shine through! But that grows from his inner strength - he makes this film, not the other way around.(Too bad he felt no such urge in the horrendous sequel, MIB II. But Hollywood sequels are what they are, and that would be another review.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith leading the way, this proved to be a rather entertaining movie about a secret alien society. Granted, true followers of the men in black know this stylized version of the secret organization is not true, but it is still interesting to watch. While I have never cared much for Barry Sonnenfeld's body of work, his fast paced cinematography works hand in hand with this movie, moving the viewer along at a pace which keeps them interested all throughout. Also, the creature effects were top notch, which I feel was the real scene stealer in the film. Tommy Lee Jones was exceptional, but Will Smith proved to be mostly annoying. Overall, the oddball nature of the film was rather satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a fun movie with a few interesting ideas. The ending after the ending makes you think about the relativity of size, and it was cute. It didnt take itself seriously which unfortunately ID4 and Lost in Space did. At 98 mins it is a little on the short side for current movies but I guess it is aimed at the short attention span of younger people.All the stars were good, Tommy Lee Jones plays Tommy Lee Jones with the usual staccato delivery and dry wit, Will Smith and his own brand of humour offsets TLJ nicely. Vincent D'Onofrio was brilliant as Edgar the bug. The loose skin thing worked really well. I for one will be looking forward to the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best alien comedy so far, but could be better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is so far the best alien comedy (not movie per se - that belongs to Alien), with good performances from both Smith and Jones. As the two main MIB, they forge a partnership which can sometimes border in the insane, but as the movie progresses, you can see how they complement each other. The aliens created for this movie are also pretty much what we expect aliens to be - gross disgusting creatures, at least the ones who claim roaches as their relatives. It springs some surprises along the way, and Will Smith is great at creating certain comic effects in this movie. But it could have been better if more thought were given to the dialogue and the plot was made tighter. While I have no grouse against the ending, it just felt a little anti-climactic after all that buildup.</fullReview>

The alien effects were seamless enough, and this technology will enable film makers to get away from the relentless anthropomorphism that science fiction films get stuck in. While there didn't seem to be much chemistry between Jones and Smith, still, the laugh lines were there, and the timing was good.

		<fullReview>I'd put this in the top 5 of 1997. Men in Black is proof that when you make a comedic science-fiction film, you don't have to do it by making fun of an existing one. I know, some people consider it a "Ghostbusters of the 1990's," but I don't believe that. The Ghostbusters never hid what they were all about, in fact they were publicity hounds, who exploited it for all it was worth. The MiB's did everything possible to hide themselves, their activities, and the supernatural creatures they sought to conceal, although hiding a flying saucer from thousands of baseball fans at Shea Stadium must be quite a task.From what I know about people who truly believe that aliens are among us, the MiB's are a threat. This movie takes this portion of UFO folklore and turns it upside down. I wonder if the creator of the comic book believes in UFO's.I wish you could give us the opportunity to give fractions of votes, because instead of voting "7," I'd vote "7.5!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual, Will Smith is decidedly likable, Tommy Lee Jones is decidedly craggy, and Linda Fiorintino is decidedly hot. The movie would have improved, however, with less effects and a little more plot. Even with a plot that is a little weak, the movie's fun because it exploits and satirizes so many UFO stories and urban myths. Will Smith pretty much plays the same character he always plays, but it still works. He pretty much saved..well almost...well, not really.. that awful Independence Day. Talk about needing a plot- one that made sense. But then, that's for another set of comments. MIB may not be the block buster it was hyped as, but it is an enjoyable movie worth watching a couple of times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On my top ten list of the best movies of all time, Men in Black is a fantastic sci-fi/comedy which introduces us to a universe where Earth has aliens living among us. Will Smith's character is initiated into the group in charge of policing these extraterrestrials by Tommy Lee Jones' character. Smith has shown very early in his movie career that he has a cinema presence not easily matched. My favorite part of the movie is where Jones tells Smith "A Person is Smart. People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals; and you know it. 1500 years ago, everyone knew that Earth was the center of the universe, 500 years ago, everyone knew that the earth was flat, and 15 minutes ago you knew that people were alone on this planet.

		<shortDescription>Forgettable style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an empty film. 11 years is not that much time, but it seems ages on this film. Looking at it now, makes me understand it has nothing inside.This is yet another film that develops around a certain idea of style. If you start counting them, it's incredible the amount of films made on that basis. Well, it's huge but understandable: style is something appealing for the crowds in the moment the film is released (though it gets easily dated) and something that doesn't require much skill to bring out. Just the right guy, in this case Will Smith who represents the top of coolness for a certain percentage of the population.The Guggenheim Museum was apparently a good choice, but misused. I wanted to see what they'd make of it, but in after all they just wanted to use the long ramp to show how Will Smith was able to run fast to the top of the building.If you see the extras on the DVD, check how Barry Sonnenfeld sounds like a nitwit. Completely clueless about what his job is about. He just remarks technical curiosity, he has nothing to say.My opinion: 1/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

I think one of the reasons it's underrated is because many people couldn't see beyond the spectacle of the special effects and the big production and forgot about the clever dialogue and great comedic situations. An example of the great dialogue: "-Did he say anything to you? -Yeah, that the world is coming to an end. -Did he say when?

		<shortDescription>Original is always best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the 80's we had "Who You Gonna Call?" from the movie "Ghostbusters," now we have the slogan "Protecting the Earth from the scum of the universe" in which "Men In Black" deals with aliens taking over the planet as secret agents try to protect those who should live and who should be exterminated.The cast involves Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K, a no nonsense man who plays everything by the book, drives a cool black car that can flip upside down when driving in a tunnel, speaking all the languages from alien tongue to Spanish; even erasing people's memories. His partner is Agent J, played by Will Smith, in which he doesn't get what the hell is going on until the second act. And that's great about most of the Will Smith movies I have seen (ID4, I, Robot, Enemy of the State) where his character doesn't know what the hell is going on in the first act, until the second act where he takes charge and in the end, he kicks butt.The main villain is an alien from another galaxy in which he rips the body off a bumbling farmer, Edgar (Vincent D'Onifero) and inserts his body into his where the alien Edgar shocks his human wife by asking for more sugar."Men In Black" is the "Ghostbusters" of the 90's for which it balances the laughter and fun at the same time where people would not be afraid to take their little ones to see this movie. I only recommend seeing the original and not the lame sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very similar film viewing experience to "Ghosbusters"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I use the summary title line to infer that MIB,as was Ghostbusters before,was very much a "cinema" movie. In other words,if you get a chance somehow to see this on the large screen,do it! The energy,special effects and rollicking rhythm of the movie fits better on a large screen with full sound.Borrowing on elements of any alien,sci-fi movie(and a few t.v. shows,like "Project UFO" and "X-Files")and throwing in a healthy dose of humor to create a fairly unique take on the "alien invasion" genre.Will Smith is a NYPD detective whose pursuit of a perp has him witnessing something he didn't expect he ever would see. For this,he is recruited by a grim-looking but humored agent(Tommy Lee Jones),who proceeds to explain the mission of his organization,the Men in Black,a super-secret organization that has no official ties to the government,has been in existence for over thirty years and is "the first,best and only line of defense" against rogues from other galaxies. Reluctant at first,Smith's character Edwards decides to give up his identity and join this elite group,partnering with JOnes' Agent K. Their assignment happens to be none other than tracking the bug creature who has possessed the body of a loathsome Kansas redneck farmer(played with absolute physical brilliance by Vincent D'Onofrio!),who has malevolent designs on EArth and the galaxy.BArry Sonnenfeld,who also helmed "Addams Family" and "Get Shorty",is hardly what I'd consider a perfect director("Big Trouble","Life With Mikey"? anyone?),but he seems right for this film,as it is played mostly for laughs,but with enough action to not bore most audiences. It's also kept juvenile enough to appeal to the kid demographic,much like "Ghostbusters".One last thing it has in common with it's 80s ectoplasmic cousin(besides the fact that hey were both produced by Columbia/Tri-Star)is that their sequels were watchable but nowhere near as good as the originals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest comedies to come out of Hollywood in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a year goes by where we don't hear some theory about aliens walking among us. Tons of sightings all over the world. Tabloid headlines lapping them up. One of the great things about Men in Black is the way it pokes fun at all of these concepts, and still finds time to laugh at itself in the process.Men in Black is one of those refreshing comedies we used to get in abundance, and are a rarity these days. I'm talking about films like Ghostbusters, Gremlins, Who Framed Roger Rabbit. All great comedies with terrific special effects that never overshadows the acting, and plenty of wall to wall gags from start to finish.Our story begins on the Mexican border, where cops have just grabbed a group of illegal Mexican immigrants. At the same moment, two men in black suits, Agents K (Tommy Lee Jones) and D takes one of the immigrants aside. In reality, this 'man' is an alien in disguise. This comes as no shock to K and D. And when they are forced to kill the alien (Mikey), they simply wipe the cops memories clear of the event. These agents are the Men in Black (MIB), whose job is to "monitor, license and police alien activity on the planet Earth."The Men in Black are about to get a new agent, the smart alec J (Will Smith), who has just had a close encounter of his own. J's resourcefulness in dealing with the alien impresses K, and J is immediately drafted. Just in time to combat a new alien threat.An alien cockroach (yes cockroach!) arrives on Earth to steal a miniature galaxy from two alien ambassadors. The cockroach (or Edgar as he comes to be called) will take the galaxy back to his people so they can conquer their arch-enemies, the Arquillians.If the plot sounds daft, well it is. Doesn't make much sense does it? But you'll find yourself not caring. Men in Black is tremendous fun. The writers get a lot of enjoyment out of poking holes at the old clichés of alien invasions and government conspiracies. It also has two great actors on top comic form. Smith and Jones are a terrific double act. Smith's wise-ass remarks and Jones' laid back, deadpan attitude are a perfect fit. Every scene with them is a highlight, and they get a lot of great exchanges:K (on an alien) "Did he say anything to you?" J "Yeah he said the world was coming to an end." K "Did he say when?"As we follow K and J on their job, we learn about their world and ours in the process. Aliens have been on Earth for years, living in secret. The World's Fair was a cover-up, and if they look like flying saucers to you, that's because they are. Steven Spielberg. Sylvester Stallone. They're aliens too. (No surprises there!) But the people of Earth must never know. Why? Because we're too panicky to handle the truth. Harsh, but probably true. The truth is out there. We're just too stupid to see it.A lot of the gags comes from the alien effects designed by Rick Baker. Some are slimy. Some are hairy. And some of them smoke too! And dogs, they're probably aliens too if Frank the Pug is anything to go by. But what is refreshing about Men in Black is the way Barry Sonnenfeld doesn't overkill the story with effects. Most of the jokes are more subtle, and one of the film's joys is looking for them. There is a nice running gag throughout Men in Black about whether or not cab drivers in New York are aliens. No, not as many as you think.Rip Torn and Linda Fiorentino (sexy as hell!) get a bit shortchanged because most of the exposure is on our heroes. That's a shame, but it doesn't spoil the fun, especially when you get great lines from Jones:Beatrice "You're here to make fun of me too?" K "No ma'am we of the FBI do not have a sense of humour that we're aware of."Clocking in at a lean 97 minutes, this makes the direction crisp, tight, and straight to the essentials. Maybe Men in Black should have been longer, because it would have strengthened the plot. But as it is, we have on our hands a very enjoyable comedy that just gets better and better with age.Love the gag at the end too. Our entire galaxy is nothing more than a marble being played with in a game of marbles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like other mid-late 90s movies, this one is hard to please.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the big movies released in the uncertain 1990s, FORREST GUMP, JURASSIC PARK, TOY STORY, and CLUELESS (no joke!) set all-time high water marks in innovation and creativity that equals up to timelessness. Not so with MEN IN BLACK! The costume designs and attitudes of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was what made it original, making this a franchise worth a hot sell, but that's the whole problem! This was Sony's finest hour back in the summer of 1997 after striving through miserable flops at the box office, only to have stumbled again with the high-tech remake of GODZILLA combined with more than $50 million of promotional advertising. Nobody wins in a game of risk when a product lacks the expectations we take for granted! It's a crying shame that Will "Fresh Prince" Smith's oddball acting performance kept INDEPENDENCE DAY from being a true bona fide science fiction classic, so you know what to expect from him in this movie. I'll wish him good luck on his successful music recording career. The visuals look duplicated as with other recent efforts on a budget of $70 million and the action is mighty scarce. Why in the hell does Hollywood have to blow excess dough on special effects? Just so that the audience can say "WOW!" or "IT LOOKS GOOD!" and keep coming back to the movie theater? The answer is a simple NO!! Even if MEN IN BLACK has the wow factor and looks good, it has no redeeming quality! Despite the luxury it has, the typically stupid jokes and puns contained here means it's branded as a "comedy", a very mainstream but tiring Hollywood genre with virtually no taste. Expect the usual things come the sequel. The future outlook is going to be terribly bleak for the big studios due to the fact that big budget movies will have all show and no go, combined with huge marketing campaigns worth millions. Sony isn't the only one in the red, though. Warner needs to focus more on how not to make a flop instead of endless campaigning over BATMAN movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good combination of comedy, drama and sci-fi with effective special effects made this movie very entertaining and thus, a big hit. It evened spawned a sequel that didn't do as well but I liked even better.To me, Tommy Lee Jones was the best part of this film. I liked his straight-faced, no-nonsense approach to the job and his deadpan comedy lines. Then again, I prefer almost anyone to the smug, macho-obsessed Will Smith, who is just full of himself in almost every film he's in (can you say, 'Chevy Chase?').At any rate, Smith and Jones play off each other well and Rip Torn, Linda Fiorentino and Vincent D'Onofrio are all entertaining in supporting roles.Rick Baker's special-effects team did a creative job with these monsters. All of them are quite different in appearance and fun to view. Negatives include too much language for a kids-appealing film and the usual military/government cover-up conspiracies the Liberal filmmakers love so much. Have you seen a Hollywood filmmaker who likes the U.S. government? Well, they like the money they make here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All effects, no brain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MEN IN BLACK, a sci-fi comic caper, proved a huge hit with audiences, and the cash-ins were soon flooding through the shops back here in the summer of '98. I was one of the 'lucky' ones to go and see the film, and I enjoyed it on a superficial level. Then, when I got home, I sat down and began to think about what I'd seen. As time wore on, I grew more and more disenchanted with the film before I realised that I didn't like it at all, really.The reason being that MEN IN BLACK is a film strictly for children, with kiddie humour (with everyone being covered in goo all the time, I was almost expecting Noel Edmunds to pop up). The plot is thin, and the film is simply a series of special effects as the different alien creatures are unveiled. The best special effect in the film is the part where the big alien hides inside the skin of a farmer, the loosened flesh looks very effective. Otherwise, they're all very CGI and too neat and fluid to look very realistic. There is also a spectacular UFO crash worth waiting for at the end, but the final confrontation scene is disappointingly clichéd.Will Smith is his usual self - like him or hate him - and he is given solid support by Tommy Lee Jones, but the actors have little to do apart from watch the constant cartoon-like special effects roll across the screen in front of them. It's okay, but a strictly 'disengage the brain and watch' film. Not my cup of tea I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aliens are amongst us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to popular belief aliens exist and are living amongst us; most of them are just getting on with their lives but some don't want to obey the rules? that is where the Men in Black come in. MiB is an ultra-secret organisation that even governments are unaware of; it is their job to process with all aliens visiting Earth and deal with those that present a danger. One such alien is a Bug that has landed in upstate New York, killed a farmer and is now wearing his skin like an ill-fitting suit. He heads to New York City in search of an item known as 'The Galaxy'. Two MiB agents, veteran K and new recruit J are on his trail. The Bug kills a couple of aliens who look human but raise some questions with coroner Laurel Weaver? until K erases her memory! Other aliens are determined to make sure the Bug doesn't get the Galaxy and threaten to destroy the Earth if the MiB don't retrieve it within an hour.This film is a lot of fun; there are lots of interesting aliens; they may disguise themselves as human when going out and about but their natural forms are delightfully strange. At only an hour and a half in length it isn't overly long but neither does it feel rushed. Time is taken introducing all the main characters; J's introduction is particularly entertaining as he starts off as an NYPD cop before getting recruited to the MiB? the recruitment test is great. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are great as K and J; both funny but in different ways. Linda Fiorentino impresses as Dr Weaver but is a bit underused. Vincent D'Onofrio makes a good bad guy as Edgar, the Bug, he has some great mannerisms even when special effects aren't employed. Given that it has a PG certificate it is a little gross at times; nothing too bad but I suspect if it had been released now it would have been a '12'. Overall this film is a lot of fun; a good blend of laughs, action and a decent story in a sci-fi setting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men in Black is a fun movie, even if it isn't a cinematic masterpiece. Just a joy to watch, it's well paced, funny and slick. It has undercover agencies, aliens, and Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, and lots (I mean lots) of jokes and a touch of action and mayhem. The meticulous Bo Welch production design is superb, director Barry Sonnenfeld's sense of pacing and comic timing impeccable, the Danny Elfman score absolutely perfect for its subject, and the cast is uniformly excellent. Nobody else could have played the role of Agent Jay with such an atmosphere as Will Smith; also Tommy Lee Jones delivers hands-down his best comic performance ever! The pleasant surprise in this movie, to me, was Vincent D'Onofrio, this guy steals the show with his perfect performance as Edgar the strange and funny farmer. I think he nailed it right, you just can't stop laughing since the moment you see him at the scene, his walk, his talk, and jokes are amazing it is just laughing your ass off!! All things considered, this movie is well worth owning. It is fun to watch with friends. It isn't the greatest movie of all times, but it is good nonetheless.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

The story is good,the special effects is very good and the cast is great.

		<fullReview>The men in black have been part of 'UFO-lore' almost as confused people have noticed lights in the sky and claimed that little grey men gave them a damn good probing on board the Starship Enterprise. The stories go that they're shadowy figures who cover up all traces of UFO and alien activity on planet Earth. Now, whether or not any of that is true, at the height of the nineties the X-files ruled the airwaves, therefore someone was going to transpose the men in black legend to the big screen.While die-hard UFOlogists claimed that the tone of the film was too light, it was a damn good family romp. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith play the titular Men in Black ? Jones is the hardened pro and Smith is the wise-cracking new kid on the job. When a rogue alien decides he wants to help himself to a device that will give him great power (etc) it's a race against time to prevent the planet from getting destroyed in the process. That's about all you need to know. The plot is kind of by the way when you compare it to the general fun-feeling of the film.It doesn't matter where Smith and Jones are they play off each other perfectly. That's why it shouldn't matter whether you're into sci-fi or not, you should enjoy this. It's the sort of movie that's in the same league as Indiana Jones, Star Wars and (the old) James Bond films. The whole family could sit down on a Saturday afternoon and enjoy this.It's a short and simple film (not just simple and fun to follow, but weighing in at a mere ninety minutes ? quite short for a summer blockbuster). But you'll enjoy it as primarily a comedy with the science fiction part later. Give it a go. Just don't expect too much from the 'so-so' sequels!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy with disgusting scenes: not recommended for those who ate popcorn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this comedy sci-fi movie we went into the parallel world of the MIB, special agents that regulate and supervise the entry, stay and exit of aliens on our planet, ensuring that we, humans, never know about it. For this, we follow the early career of Jay (Will Smith again fraternizing with extraterrestrials after "Independence Day"), alongside his senior partner, Kay (Tommy Lee Jones, whom we never see a smile) in an effort to rid the world of a kind of giant cockroach, very upset with humans.The film is an adaptation of the comics by Lowell Cunningham and can largely satisfy those who read it. Its directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (who has made other comedies starring Will Smith, as "Wild, Wild West") and has Ed Solomon's script. The two protagonists were well up to the challenge and their interpretations were great, with perfectly memorable comic situations. Of course, being a humorous movie, no one expected to see psychologically complex characters but, nevertheless, Jones achieved this effect by showing the most dreamer and something unfortunate side of his character, which was a positive bonus in this film. The correlation between the two actors also looks very good, which helped in the interpretation of their characters. Two equally unforgettable characters are Frank, the talking pug (voiced by Tim Blaney) and the Worm Guys, which arise at some point and are recurring in the comics. The visual and special effects were very well and were effective but didn't wondered or surprised. However, the special effects aren't enough to make a movie. They aren't the movie, right?Less good points? There are few, less relevant, so we can go over them. The most important or worthy of contraindication may be the existence of some repulsive scenes, with crawling insects, viscous liquids, saliva and things like that bathing the protagonists and, surely, causing vomits in some more suggestible viewers. So, this is a good film to see ... but without consumables.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can Double Bill With Ghostbusters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men in Black (1997): Dir: Barry Sonnenfeld / Cast: Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Linda Fiorentino, Vincent D'Onofrio, Rip Torn: Thankfully not a Ghostbusters ripoff but its title clarifies secret operations beyond our understanding. After pursuing a suspect a cop played by Will Smith is introduced to Tommy Lee Jones who is an agent for a corporation that monitors 1500 alien life forms inhabiting the Earth. An alien inhabits a human and searches for a universe, which happens to be a tiny ball dangling from a cat's collar. Jones has a device that erases any dealings with outside people. This is to keep the agency a secret. Exquisite effects with imaginative plotting evaporating in its action climax. Director Barry Sonnenfeld brings a sense of wonder with good comic chemistry between Smith and Jones. Smith brings out the bewilderment of the cop, and Jones plays it straight with dry sarcasm. Vincent D'Onofrio portrays the alien distorting a human. This allows for some effective humour. Linda Fiorentino is given a thankless role and her reactions are hardly realistic. Rip Torn is also flat as the head of the M.I.B headquarters whose role mainly consists of bearing a title. An interesting followup for Sonnenfeld who made Get Shorty prior to this. Its secret conspiracy elements are compelling in activity going on that are beyond our imagination. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously, Almost 20-Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, this movie is almost 20-years old. Two-years from now it will be 20-years old. I'm sure almost everyone who sees this movie, could agree that it doesn't look old and would find it hard to believe that it's 18-years old, already. I remember seeing this movie in the movie theaters as a kid. I saw it two times during that summer, and was a fan of the movie. Despite movies like these being PG-13, they expect a lot of kids under 13 to watch these movies as they're definitely entertaining for younger audiences. It's entertaining for kids to see good verses evil, or saving the Earth from aliens. So, most kids would enjoy the movie.This is one of Will Smith's most memorable movies. It came out less than a year after a higher grossing movie he was in, Independence Day which also had to do with protecting the Earth from aliens. Interestingly, if you read the IMDb trivia, you'll see that Will Smith initially did not want to accept the role, but his wife encouraged him to take the part!! Good for her, Will Smith belonged in this movie and was like perfect for the role. He wants to be in great movies, and this is probably the second highest grossing one he did, next to Independence Day. Smith's most recent movie he did, or at least the most recent movie I heard of him starring in alongside his son. I haven't heard any movies either of them have been in since, is After Earth. Although, reading the plot of the movie it might almost sound like it would be a role that would fit him after this movie. I haven't seen that movie, and it has been critically bashed. Will Smith even considered it his worst movie he's ever done. If you look at most of the IMDb reviews for that movie, most of them are negative. A lot of people reviewing that movie, no longer see Will Smith's son Jaden Smith as a good actor from his performance in that movie. The only other movie I saw him in was Karate Kid, which was a great movie and he did well for the role. So, too bad Will and Jaden had to star in a movie that hurt their careers.Well, I've mostly been talking about the actor Will Smith and his career. But, why is he great in this movie? Well, Will Smith is a cool looking guy and he also looks funny too. He can play funny roles in his movies, as he plays a very comical role as Jay in this movie. This movie is not only an entertaining sci-fi movie, but a funny one and the action in this movie isn't as serious as the action in Independence Day, it is still a funny entertaining movie with great action.It is also cool to see the technology in the movie. The technology in it seems beyond what we even have today, 18-years later. It is also cool to think of a secret organization in NYC that protects the Earth from aliens, without us ever knowing anything is wrong, along with aliens being among regular looking people in a crowd, especially in NYC.So, if you're up for an entertaining funny movie with action. If you're up for seeing an awesome movie with Will Smith in it, then this is one to see. They've done two other Men In Black movies since this one came out. I don't really care for the other two. I saw the second one, and the 3rd one I saw part of but fell asleep. But, from what I saw with the 3rd one, it didn't entertain me. I feel like the second and third one take the movies a different direction we see from the first movie, and are also more cheesy. This movie can be cheesy at times.Having a movie of an organization protecting the Earth from aliens reminds me of a show that was popular a few years before the movie came out, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, that are more for kids than this movie though have the idea of protecting the Earth from aliens. While there are no references to Power Rangers in this movie that I am aware of, I think it would have been cool if an alien from the movie, looked like a monster from Power Rangers. It would have been cool if an actor from Power Rangers made a cameo, which we could relate to. It's cool if a movie has references to other things in pop culture. Oh well! Now that I've talked about the Power Rangers, I ought to mention that the show it was based on called Zyuranger in Japan is a better show, and more worth watching than Power Rangers.I guess, I've gone off topic and have probably talked more about Will Smith in the movie and went to other points. However, there isn't much more I can say about the movie if I don't want to talk about the plot which would count as a spoiler. To summarize briefly, this movie is a fun entertaining action movie with the plot of the M.I.B. a secret organization protecting Earth from the Extra Terrestrial, when they're threatening. It's cool to see the technology, and this is a movie Will Smith is great in.But, to conclude with movies about aliens coming to Earth. If you want to watch a movie I consider better and more entertaining, is a movie I feel is way underrated called Earth To Echo. I could even consider that movie, the greatest movie ever made!! Thanks for reading and sorry if this review wasn't helpful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Linda Fiorentino, Vincent D'Onofrio and Rip Torn star in this 1997 sci-fi comedy based on the comic book. This takes place in New York where we meet Agent, K (Jones) who works for top-secret organization, MIB (Men in Black) which polices intergalactic beings. Soon, he recruits young cop, James (Smith) to become his partner and they try to stop a gigantic, cockroach alien that disguises itself as farmer, Edgar (D'Onofrio). Fiorentino (Jade) plays coroner, Laurel and Torn (Defending Your Life) plays MIB boss, Zed. This is a good film with some humorous &amp; bizarre moments, Jones and Smith are great together and Rick Baker's make-up effects are terrific as usual. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality beginning to an entertaining franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Men in Black" from soon 20 years ago is still one of the most famous science-fiction comedies out there, a combination not too common actually. It stars Will Smith (who also recorded the famous title song) and Tommy Lee Jones. But the highlight for me was probably Vincent D'Onofrio playing a huge bug. Total scene stealer and I'm also a great fan of him in "Criminal Intent" and everywhere else. The script was okay all in all, but I have to say I did not find Smith particularly funny. Tommy Lee Jones was not supposed to be funny, apart from very few very subtle scenes. He is a great actor, but it's difficult to appreciate such a serious character in a film which really has no dramatic ambition and only comedic purpose. Somehow the whole background story (past battles, deleting memories, aliens living among us, Smith's recruitment challenge...) and world they created was more interesting than the actual plot of trying to catch and kill D'Onofrio's character.The movie runs for 90 minutes and so far there have been already 2 sequels. These weren't rushed though. There was a break of five years to movie number 2 and even 10 years to movie number 3. I wonder if the fourth will come out in 20 years time. Just kidding. It's already planned, so it will certainly not be that long, probably 5 years max. We will see if director Barry Sonnenfeld returns just like he did for the two sequels. He also worked with Smith in "Wild, Wild West". However, there were also some plot weaknesses in this film here. Why would they recruit a complete newbie in the profession to save the world with TLJ's character. They must have a more experienced guy for that right? Or maybe did the monsters attack because the former partner retired and they wanted to make use of the occasion? And why would TLJ's character also retire at the end of the film. Maybe too much responsibility for Smith's character still in my opinion. Why is everybody retiring? Okay, the first guy was pretty old, but TLJ not really. Unfortunately, I was not too big on Linda Fiorentino's character. Her inclusion really only seemed with the purpose to have at least one female character in the movie, but I did not feel she contributed much to the story. Anyway, Will Smith reminded me of a young Eddie Murphy in this film, although that is almost a bit of an unfair comparison as Smith is not much younger actually, but just seems very juvenile for his age.This comic-based movie was made right after the end of Fresh Prince and propelled Smith into stardom on the big screen also. It won the Best Makeup award (Rick Baker the legend) at the Oscars that year (a lot of it thanks to D'Onofrio's bug I'm sure) and scored two more nominations. Actually, I would not have minded a screenplay nomination for Ed Solomon either. Especially the dialogs were really well-written. All in all I recommend this film although pretty much everybody probably has seen it by now. It's an interesting comedy and even with the scary setting of losing the earth to monsters and some killings happening (not graphically), it is all very light and should really harm nobody except very small children. It came out in the year when "Titanic" sunk everything else at the award shows and box office. But I still believe "Men in Black" is the better film even if it only came in second at the box office and did not even reach half of "Titanic"'s money. Watch it.</fullReview>

The chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith's characters was great and is what really made the movie. It was almost like a "buddy cop" film except in a sci-fi setting. The plot was unique and I especially loved all of the issued MiB gadgets. While it wasn't a masterpiece, it definitely kept me entertained with the humorous one-liners, alien creatures, and zany story. The complaints were few and somewhat expected from a sci-fi movie from the 90's. The effects and creatures were obviously aged and looked cheesier than I would have expected, but overall they weren't that awful. I also felt like the end was extremely rushed. It ended on a slightly sad note which didn't seem to fit, and they didn't really set up the final scene with J and his new partner very well. But in the end I would say it was an enjoyable experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men in Black was one of my favorite Hollywood blockbusters of the '90s. Watching this movie now, it has lost none of its charm. You have to love these two stars. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are amazing. They are a great duo on screen. These two are awesome and you can tell they enjoyed working with each other. This movie is explosive, fast paced, thoughtful, humorous, original, and even at times wise. Final point, get this movie, you won't be disappointed.As the movie progresses you learn more about how the MIB work through the eyes of agent J(Will Smith) who is a new recruit. Who does a great job with his role while adding a bit of humor into the mix. Agent K(Tommy Lee Jone) is the really serious one of the two and takes his job very very seriously and is always serious. But the pair works well in this movie. Overall this is a fun sci-fi movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and for the most part it works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies ever. Not just because it came out in 1997, the best year ever, but because There is comedy, drama, action, and serious points all blended into one. You literally don't know whats going to happen next in this movie if you've never seen it before. Tommy Lee Jones does a great job of acting in this movie. He played a role where he was supposed to be serious most of the time, and he always did a good job at keeping a stale face to convince you that his character really was a strict person that always tried to get the job done and then leave. He reminds me of a person that wakes up on a gloomy Monday morning and they just want to get through the day. They don't talk, they don't smile, they just do what they have to do until they can go home and fall right back into bed. Most people don't feel like this throughout the whole day, but Tommy Lee Jones made K seem like he had that feeling for most of the Movie. Will Smith did his usual thing, making people laugh in moments when you expect it to be serious, and being serious when you would think there would be a joke around the corner. It's good that one of the two stars was Will, because only a year after The Fresh Prince stopped airing new episodes, will smith is back in a movie that his fans simply can't not like. The two stars worked perfectly together, and I like how at the end, J kind of gets past K's shell that has kept so many people away. It's the unpredictability, and the blend of different genre's that makes this a great movie</fullReview>

Their decision to back a sci-fi action comedy pairing Smith &amp; Jones led to MIB becoming one of the company's highest grossing ventures.Ed Solomon deserves a mention for writing a sophisticated, urban comedy that will have even the most po-faced smiling. Boosted by Danny Elfman's impressive, jaunty soundtrack, laughs and surprises just keep coming.Wonderful supporting roles include Tony Shalhoub as crooked shopkeeper Jack Jeebs and Rip Torn as "Zed", transforming MIB 1 from a good comedy into a consistently strong, watchable parody of urban values. It's well-paced, cleverly directed with inventive makeup and ingenious CGI. Easily one of the best sci-fi comedies since Woody Allen's Sleepers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very enjoyable science-fiction comedy with some hilarious, alien moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, I'm going to say that Men in Black is by far a hundred times better than Men in Black II; and if i were to review Men in Black II, it would be a positive review, but it wouldn't be as well reviewed as the first one, which i am doing now. Science-Fiction comedies are very good to watch - a lot of them are very funny with great looking aliens and well-done, funny, good-to-watch, developed characters. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones play Agents J and K; and rightfully so, because they're absolutely great as them. They are the men in black! They're pitted against the ultimate villain - a giant, Alien cockroach that crash lands into a farm and goes inside a farmer (ends up taking over him) and whose wife ends up fainting after he pulls his face back....which is weirder than it sounds. HAHA.Men in Black is a wonderful and enjoyable science-fiction comedy with great fantasy, sci-fi, aliens, comedy and more, you'll not stop laughing. Such an incredible film - and a helluva lot of different aliens appear in it; Mikey, in particular, is awesome. 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MIB is a smart and funny film buoyed by the tremendous comedic interplay between its 2 leads: Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. They take the solid script and do everything right with it. The side characters (excepting the generic female lead) all hit their mark, adding to the enjoyment of this picture. Especially good is Vincent D'Nofrio (spelling?) who plays the "skin". He is as hilarious with his physical quirks as he is creepy. He must be having the time of his life acting here. And seeing Rick Baker's fabulous monster make-up effects is always a treat. The only critique is that it is not a film that particularly stimulates your brain or heart. But if you are looking for high quality popcorn entertainment, MIB is first rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1997's "Men in Black" is a fast, fun Sci-Fi action-comedy that remains a blast to watch even 15 years later!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, the 90's. A decade that started with the dying gasps of the 1980's, before becoming its own beast entirely. This is perfectly reflected in its media and film. In particular, the absolutely fun, fast and funny action-packed Sci-Fi comedy "Men in Black", directed by stylish filmmaker Barry Sonnenfeld (from a script by Ed Solomon) and starring Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.Smith stars as James Edwards, an NYPD officer who uncovers a strange and possibly extra-terrestrial threat one night while chasing down a perp on the streets. Impressed with James' feat of chasing down an alien on foot, an enigmatic and mysterious agent known only as "Agent K" (Tommy Lee Jones) recruits Edwards into the super-secretive agency known as the "Men in Black" (or "MIB")- a group of men and women who monitor, evaluate and police alien life on the planet Earth. Though the two men of different generations and personalities clash at first (in a way reminiscent of many buddy-comedies), they are forced to work together to stop an insect-like creature (portrayed by Vincent D'Onofio), who is seeking a mysterious artifact trapped on Earth, in a plot which could lead to the destruction of the planet.This is one of those perfect storms of a talented cast with great chemistry, a good script that flows at just the right pace, fantastic production qualities and a fine director to bring it all together. It's an absolute joy to watch even now, 15 years later.Smith and Jones are perfect in their roles: Smith as an eager, loud, almost brash young man who is unconventional by the standards of most establishments, and Jones as a semi-weary older, grumpier father-like figure trying to train younger partner. They work together with an amazing chemistry and come off as one of the most likable pairings in recent cinematic history. And their back-and-forth does provide fodder for many great jokes. D'Onofrio is a lot of fun as a slightly over- the-top villain who has stolen the skin of a farmer, which he wears like a suit, causing all sorts of fun physical gags and eccentricities. Rip Torn as the head of MIB is silly fun. And supporting roles by the likes of Linda Fiorentino, Tony Shalhoub and a voice-over role by "Johnny 5" himself, Tim Blaney, are perfect.The script by Ed Solomon is a lot of fun. He is able to find a happy balance between character development, action, comedic bits and the more broad Sci-Fi elements. It's an admirable script (especially compared to some of his past work), and while it may not do anything too daring, it's very solid and tightly constructed.Sonnenfeld's direction is top-notch. The visual style he built in films such as the two "Addams Family" flicks and his own quirky sense of humor are allowed to run wild. Sonnenfeld creates a great quirky, fun yet still slightly serious atmosphere that works perfectly in a film such as this. He was the ideal man for the job, and I don't think there is any other director who could have quite handled this film with as much class as he did.The rest of the production, including some amazing visual effects and awe-inspiring creatures created by Rick Baker. Set and costume design is top-notch. Danny Elfman's score is an absolute funky blast of memorable themes and fun action beats. This is an astonishingly well put-together film.The only real complaint I have is that the film does feel very basic at times in terms of structure. (And evidently it was subject to some big editing in post production to simplify the story) And a part of me does wish it took more chances with its material and premise.But regardless, the acting is great, the production incredible and the storytelling first class. I can't complain too much because everything is so well-done. (Although the first sequel is definitely a film I will complain about in a later review)"Men in Black" gets a 9 out of 10. If you haven't seen it... see it now!</fullReview>

Together with his partner agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), they police interstellar aliens on Earth. When an alien race threaten to destroy the Earth, they must recover something powerful.Director Barry Sonnenfeld is able to bring to life this imaginative comic book. It's smart and snappy. It has the wonderful crazy fun aliens. It is visually unique.The best part is the chemistry between the two leads. Tommy Lee Jones is grumpy stoic solid whereas Will Smith is marvelously energetic and funny.The script is tight, and hilarious. The CG is flashy and the look cool.

		<fullReview>And a technically very well made. The images, scenes and sequences are first class and spectacular in visual terms. The story is worth what it's worth in this kind of movies and we can't demand more but this one has a special feature beyond the train of monsters, violent scenes and wild fantasies: a good dose of humour in lots of scenes and the main two protagonists' speeches even in the most dangerous situations. The visual special effects are overwhelming and turn us breathless being also original and creative. The two main protagonists are very well in the role of intrepid and fearless special agents charged with the task of controlling the activity of aliens more or less clandestinely present in earth. It's a movie good to be seen with the usual limitations in terms of content but mastering a technique of great quality. A pleasant one and that's all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in 1997, the world was entranced by this film. It was a huge hit, and deserved every bit of its success. And the reason is obvious: it's fun to see the straight-faced Tommy Lee Jones up with the always smirking Will Smith. The plot may be simple, the subplots may seem a little contrived and unnecessary, but the duo are so funny that they make up for any small flaw the film has. And perhaps the very best parts of the film are the Oscar-winning make up and special effects that back then were not only convincing, they were special. And that's the one combination that hardly ever works: sci-fi extreme and comedy. And simply but, this film does this the best since Ghostbusters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Amusing and Entertaining Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw this movie I thought that it was going to be a stupid science fiction spoof. Most comedies these days I have found boring and when it comes down to sci-fi alien cover-up movies, I tend to like them realistic (such as the X-files) ? and this is why I approached Men in Black with intense scepticism.After seeing it I have come to the conclusion that it is a pretty cool movie. There are heaps of nice little ideas in this movie, the special effects are extremely well done, and the comedy is quite appreciable. The effects need not be commented on and the ideas and the comedy go hand in hand so this is what I will look at. I will not go too deep into much of the stuff because I feel that the movie will be spoiled. Unlike Empire Records, Men in Black is not a deep movie and as such, I can only look at the shallow nature of it. Men in Black is entertainment and that is how we must approach it. This movie is a comedy. There is the occasional political gag and a jibe at a famous person, but mostly the comedy is of the type that I really like, and that is character interaction. Will Smith plays the stereotypical, happy-go-lucky, authority-dodging, afro-American police officer. Simply put, I think he makes the movie. His attitude towards everything and the way he bounces off various situations around him create a very lively character.The aliens are extremely well done. There are the occasional human aliens, but most of them are very alien. What seems to be a human in one way will turn out to be nothing more that a vehicle carrying an alien. This is a creature canteen (using the terminology that refers to the bar seen in Star Wars) that throws as many strange creatures at the viewer as possible. The Mexican Aliens are by far the best. All in all, this is a pretty good movie. As a piece of though provoking literature, it is nothing; but as entertainment, it is great and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the third installment now out in cinemas, it seems like a lifetime ago that I went to the cinema to watch this. One thing that did strike me watching it today was how rough the CG looked but I suppose a Blu-Ray special edition can probably fix that. Other than that, there is very little I would change as this remains a highly enjoyable sci-fi comedy that isn't afraid of laughing at itself although it laughs too hard at times.Tommy Lee Jones plays K, an undercover agent with a mysterious organisation that monitors all alien activity on Earth and, if necessary, cleaning up the mess. So when cocky NYPD officer James Edwards (Will Smith) encounters an alien on the streets of New York, K takes it upon himself to recruit Edwards into MiB. But once Edwards has become the black-suited J, their section chief Z (Rip Torn) has an assignment for them - a nasty bug in the ungainly form of redneck farmer Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio) has made his way to the Big Apple in order to wreck an intergalactic peace conference between warring species - a war that now has Earth in its sights.This isn't a movie to think about too much because all you'll find are plot holes. Instead, what you'll find is a damn good blockbuster with all the special effects, pyrotechnics and one-liners you'll need to satisfy most tastes. There's even a damsel in distress in the shapely form of Linda Fiorentino but what really makes "Men In Black" stand out is its tongue-in-cheek nature - when a screen showing known alien activity appears and one of the subjects is Sylvester Stallone, you know that taking this seriously simply isn't an option. Jones has rarely been as good as he is here, maintaining a humourless and unflappable face at the digital chaos around him. Smith provides most of the laughs, as you'd expect, and his interplay with Jones is also good. It's almost a shame that the CG swamps everything else although it is looking a touch dated in places. The short aliens with the coffee and the little green one inside the dying old man do look somewhat crude these days, no doubt something that the new film is happy to address.My only real issues with "Men In Black" are the all-too-short duration which crowbars the plot into place and which make the film feel rushed and the highly polished feel to the thing. Every scene, prop and line of dialogue feels sanitised as though director Barry Sonnenfeld went through about fifty takes of each shot until it felt right. MiB headquarters, for example, felt less like a busy hub of technical innovation and administration and more like a forgotten set from some Sixties sci-fi show. None of it felt genuine or real and suspension of belief was almost impossible. But as I said, that's what you get if you look at "Men In Black" from a critic's point of view instead of a ticket-purchasing member of the audience, which I was all those years ago. This is still worth taking a look at because in terms of entertainment, "Men In Black" does a perfectly good job and if nothing else, it is a humorous riposte to an all-too-often serious genre so if you're not bothered by the likes of "The X Files" or "Millennium" then give this a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loosely based on it's source material, but fun, nonetheless!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I managed to get the original Men in Black comic this movie was inspired and guess what?It's radically different from the story written by Lowell Cunningham!It barely resemble the original comic it was based on, but, well, nobody said it has to be 100% faithful. The 2003 Korean Oldboy movie is radically different from it's original material too, but it's still a wonderful movie!So, since I didn't see any review here talking about the differences between medias, I decided to do one myself.One of the first things we can point is the organization itself.In the movie, it's a NY organization that monitors extraterrestrial occurrences and protects Earth from unwelcome guests.In the comic, it's an organization from Tennesee that monitors all kinds of paranormal activities, since ETs to monsters, creatures from hell, mystic occurrences, etc. It's not only about ETs. And the MIB organization from the comic, looks not for the welfare of mankind, but to control it, by leaving people ignorant.And how do they leave people ignorant?In the movie, they use the neuralizer to erase people's minds, so they can make up a story to cover all up.In the comic, either they kill people or they use the neuralizer (that looks like a flashlight), but different from the movie, this neuralizer hypnotizes people so the organization can take information from the subjects and then lead them to believe in whatever the MIB agent chooses to.In the movie, J is a black man that used to work in the NYPD.In the comic, Jay is a blonde white caucasian that was a government agent involved in suppress and infiltrate some drug dealers that ends up being captured by K and becoming part of the MIB staff, not by freewill, but by pressure.In the movie, K is a veteran MIB agent who works to protect people. He has good intentions.In the comic, Kay is a selfish, full of himself and obnoxious character which only thinks on himself and is capable of doing anything to complete his assignment. Even to kill people. He is portrayed like someone you probably wouldn't like to be around.As for Zed, in the movie he is portrayed like a real person, the boss of MIB, a well intentioned old man who looks to protect Earth.In the comics, Zed is mentioned by Kay like a real person, but he never appears. He is there just to give mission instructions and to monitor agents only.And notably, in the movies we refer to the title characters as "Men in Black", while in the comics, it's "THE Men in Black".Characters like the worms, Frank and Jeebes from the movie are also not in the comics, they were created specially for the movie. And as for Edgar, the man from the movie that was turned into an ET, well, he was completely altered, in the comics, his name is Horace, he is not eaten nor killed by the alien, and Jay just deals with the alien presence and settles the situation. Also, the humor in the movie doesn't exist in the comics, which uses a more serious and cynic tone. The movie basically uses mostly elements from the story titled "Encounter" which is Part 2 from MIB Vol. 1.Again, I'm just pointing out the differences between the two medias. I mean no disrespect to any of them, not the movie, nor the comic, they are both works that I appreciate and respect. But very different in their approach, as you just found out if you read what I just wrote.My only complain is that the 1997 movie got more visibility than the comics so I wish they could release these comics to the big public, following the release of the third MIB movie and let us make up our minds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was the year 1997, and the greatest agent the world has ever known was planning to retire and he needed to acquire and train his replacement. Who best to fit his shoes than Agent Jay (Will Smith).This movie made us understand why strange things and strange people roam around, with a solid plot that keeps you guessing "where is the galaxy?" "If it is here on earth and it is meant to be millions of stars where on earth could you hide that?" Leave it to the men in black, they not only found the galaxy and save the world from the Arquillians who were going to vaporize the whole planet earth to stop the bugs from getting the galaxy.I loved this movie in 1997 and I still love it now, listening to the soundtrack, doing the moves... all brings back fun memories of my youth. But the point am trying to make is, what makes a movie great is the ability to stand the test of time, no matter when you watch it be it 15 years after its initial release it will always be a classic.Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, who did a great job directing the screenplay and story done by Ed Solomon comes this well put together movie flick that mixes comedy with fantasy and a lot of action.Comparing this to its part 2 will be an unfair comparison, why? Because Men In Black 2 lacked the action and comedy to keep you watching, something Men In Black one had a lot of. I have to give kudos to the graphics it is far better than what I saw in Men In Black 2, also the screenplay is masterful each scene had enough happenings to keep you hoping the scene will drag longer.The producers are planning a Men In Black 3, something I hope will be better than 2, the Men In Black 3 coming out in May 2012 will be taking in a huge budget of over 200 Million dollars in production, something I hope will be put to good use.The Men In Black movie, led to the creation of the MIB animation series that span 4 seasons of 53 episodes. What can I say, but the franchise is a goldmine, one which the producers want to dig till there is nothing left.All in all, go see this movie whether you have seen it before or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the movies I've seen countless times, and I never seem to get tired of it, it has some cool aliens and when it was released it had some awesome special effects, more than that, and the best aspect about the movie, is that Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are great together, they have genuine chemistry, and they are very funny in their own unique way, Jones, completely straight faced in the most bizarre of situations, and Will Smith in wise-cracking form, and then you have the villain, a giant insect-like alien who steals the skin of a farmer played by Vincent D'Onofrio, his performance is really fun to watch, his movements, his way of speaking, it's great. Linda Fiorentino and Rip Torn are also good in their roles. The script is...well, I guess it was sharp, with witty and clever dialogue and situations, but I've heard there was a lot of improvisation and ad-libbing during production, regardless, the end result is an entertaining movie. Some of the later scenes go for gross-out comedy, with alien entrails and goo, but it never becomes disgusting. The secret to the movie's success, I think, is that it never takes itself so seriously, even the villain is there for laugh. I only wish the sequel was as great as this one, I'm hoping the upcoming third film will recapture the fun and wit of this movie.</fullReview>

I wasn't expecting much, I didn't expect a comedy either, but lots of surprises gave in. First off, the film is actually a spoof itself, of all the clichéd sci- fi's we have nowadays. I didn't expect it, but the film pulls it off nicely and had some great genuine comedic moments. At least THIS spoof wasn't clichéd, and actually had some cool ideas. The acting was good, and I love the combination of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. They fit perfectly, and without them, the film wouldn't be as great. Linda Fiorention's character wasn't too good, and seemed to be put in for guys to gawk at. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it and it didn't affect my viewing experiences. For a film of 1997, it actually has some good special effects. The 1990s is where film's special effects broke through and changed the cinema forever, and Men in Black respectfully places itself into the list. Alongside the comedy, acting, and special effects: I give huge kudos for the soundtrack. Sure, not the biggest thing to remember and say "hey, I love that!" but I thought it was nicely fitting for the film. ESPECIALLY the main theme. If you love parodies, smart, fast-moving ones like Ghostbusters, you'll love Men in Black. It was a treat for 1997, a breakthrough in parodies. I recommend Men in Black. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smith and Jones Lead a Flawless Cast into the Wild</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as much fun today as it was the very first time, if not more so. Tommy Lee Jones is brilliantly cast as the stern, no nonsense G-Man straight out of the 1950s, a role he was seemingly born to play, and while new recruit Will Smith was badly typecast at the time, there's a very real, palpable chemistry between the two that transcends what roles they may have played before or after. Further complimenting the scene is a dynamite supporting cast, with Rip Torn amplifying all things stoic and ancient about the government, Vincent D'Onofrio stealing every scene as a not-so-subtle wolf in sheep's clothing and a typically dry, sarcastic performance from Linda Fiorentino. The jokes are still funny, even though I remembered most of the punchlines, the adventure is a perfect blend of introduction and elaboration, and the pop culture asides still work fifteen years later. Even the special effects aren't aging badly, which is a rare blessing considering the rapid advances in CGI since it was in theaters. Enthusiastically funny, rambunctiously fast-paced and occasionally genuine, I was surprised to see it's still firing on all cylinders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Round up the weapons! Put on the shades! Strap on the suit! It's alien hunting time! "Men in Black" stars Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith in a science fiction alien comedy about a group of men wearing black suits to protect the galaxy from extra-terrestrials. But here's the one thing you must understand: you won't remember what has happened later! I've always loved this movie as a child, and I still love it as an adult. I've always loved the premise of the movie when these men in black show up, if somebody sees a UFO or an alien encounter, and then they zap your brain, and you forget all about it. Although this movie was incredibly short, I was easily entertained throughout. Director Barry Sonnenfeld delivers a more unique movie that redefines the genre of science-fiction. I also really loved the performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, and they also provided such a pretty great chemistry, which has later been dry in the future movies. Also, all the incredible alien make-up effects by Rick Baker are the best pieces of makeup I have ever seen, and Baker is the best in the make-up business. The visual effects are super challenging, and they are so much fun to watch on screen, when they seem to fit in with the sci-fi genre. I also enjoyed watching the talking pug dog named Frank, and some crack head worm guys which made me laugh a few times. The cast is well-acted, the effects are well-made, the art direction is totally dimensional, and the action in this movie, and the comedy, is a total must-watch to enjoy. If you are a science-fiction/comedy lover like me, you will not be disappointed with "Men in Black". I already seen this movie when I was little, and the thought of seeing it again, like it was for the first time, seemed so fun. This is not only one of the best sci-fi movies ever made, but this is also one of my favorite movies, as in like, ever! "Men in Black", in my review, "an excellent alien movie, with tons of deserving laughs".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The concept and idea of a movie where aliens are on the planet and the Government is doing everything they can to prevent us innocents from finding out. This comical idea was taken further with a comic strip, although it was a bit dark. This idea was finally taken and put into the movie which I am rating. A lot more family friend, although there are a few things I'd like to poke at.I overall enjoyed the movie. I really liked watching the aliens interact with the city and other people, as well as the Government and the things they do.But first things first. The swearing. There was a lot of it, and although I was able to ignore most of it, it was pushing the limits with profanity. Also, there were those jokes that I now understand, but at times I feel they weren't needed.Finally the way the story led to the end could have been more epic, but at the time this film was being made, I don't blame them for not having unlimited technology. Hopefully the sequel will spark my interests! Rated 6/10, 1/10 less for swearing, 1/10 less for sexual content, and 2/10 less for lack of as good of an ending.</fullReview>

Second, let's say, you need a coffee. You go to Starbucks and get one of these plastic cups carrying a paper Banderole where there stands in big letters: CAUTION! CONTAINS HOT LIQUID.

Later, in the taxi, you read in the rear-view mirror: OBJECTS IN THE MIRROR ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR.If you want or not: Coming from a land where neither the coffee-shops nor the cleaning company nor the car-producers are nursing you, you will ask yourself: What is this for a land where the self-evident things are told even to adults, things which are know already by children in the rest of the world? Obviously, you conclude, here there lives a species of beings that MUST be told that, since otherwise nobody would go through all the pain and costs for all those warnings. So, you ask one of the inhabitants of this country, and he tells you that recently a lung cancer patient who had smoked for forty years sued Philips, telling the court-house that this tobacco company did not warn him of the dangers of smoking - and won the process. At that point, as an educated European, you may ask yourself: Are these really humans that inhabit this gigantic country between Montana and Mississippi, California and New England, because both the stupidity of their behavior and the credulity of their court-houses seem to contradict strongly to that assumption. You may also get suspicious when you enter a store and ask a cashier, who is just busy to serve another customer, where the paper products are. Unlike in any other country, she will stay calm, put on her most agreeable smile, show you her Pepsodent teeth and direct you kindly to aisle number eleven. When you then look at the people in queue whose time you have stolen with your stupid question, you will encounter the same artificial and mechanical smile remembering you perhaps of E.T.A. Hoffmann's Olympia and the unhappy Professor Mosh Terpin who invented her. Now you count one and one together, since you feel strongly that you are on a hot trail. Perhaps you remember the people showing up in the famous old American movies of the 30ies or 40ies: Hardly any difference to Europeans (besides the language), educated, cultivated, polite but not automate with a mechanical make-up grinning. Then, the most horrible suspicion comes into your brain: WHAT HAPPENED OUT OF THE Americans OF THE 40IES? -. They are gone! Absolutely for sure the people who nowadays inhabit America are nothing but aliens, placed on both sides of the Apalachians after the original cultivated race has been high-jacked, leaving back a class of low lives who are behind the Central African states in the international PISA evaluation of the world-education, who clothe in jeans, sandals and speak as if they are born with a chewing gum in their mouth, who love to play war, do not speak one foreign language and not even their own in a proper way - and, consistently, as you now start to realize, have to be told that hot stuff can burn, mirrors distort distances, water on soil is slippery, in one word: that one first has to close a door before it can be shut. And then, after a long time, you find this marvelous film: MEN IN BLACK, the title purposely without significance, so that nobody gets suspicious of its content. After having watched this movie, you, who understands, recognize that the crew who made this movie is obviously the last rest of people who could rescue themselves when their relatives had been high-jacked and replaced by the aliens. Working in the underground, they used the genre of comedy, again, in order to avoid suspects, because the low lives' Gestapo is everywhere! Even worse: In the film they abuse the Mexican minority in the southern rim of the US for suspect of being aliens, for example in the famous truck-scene where the two MIB search the trunk and find these aliens disguised as Mexicans. So, the message of this movie is clear enough: The few Mexicans in the trunk are the real Americans, while the majority around, the alleged Americans, are the aliens. IF SOMEONE INVITES YOU TO THE US, STAY AWAY, RUN AWAY AND HIDE YOURSELF.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the good summer blockbusters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I was taken along by a friend to see Men In Black on original release, I did not expect to enjoy it very much. I had the misfortune of being taken along by the same friend to see Independence Day, a film that truly appalled me. I just couldn't help but think that this new Will Smith sci-fi blockbuster was going to be as annoying. But being the good friend I was, I accompanied him, albeit with admittedly little enthusiasm. Imagine my surprise when I had a really good time in the company of the Men In Black. Mainly this was because the jokes worked. The story about the evil aliens was strictly forgettable; it was the chemistry between the two leads and the various funny moments that made the film. I guess it's an example of what a summer blockbuster should be, i.e. it might be effects-laden but at least they are used inventively and at the heart of it all there's something genuinely amusing that doesn't take itself very seriously. I'm not exactly the world's greatest fan of these kinds of movies but the Men In Black was a pleasant surprise. And, that's it.</fullReview>

It received an overwhelmingly positive response from critics, and was followed by a 2002 sequel, Men In Black II. Following the film's release, Ray-Ban stated sales of their Predator 2 sunglasses (worn by the organization to deflect neuralyzers) tripled to $5 million.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith saves the planet again ... this time in a good film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the horribly cheesy "Independence Day" of the previous year, it was great to see the actor that saved that movie from being completely unwatchable - Will Smith - get a chance to save the planet in a quality film. From the opening of the film where "Mikey", an illegal alien from another planet is disguised as an illegal alien from another country, to the end when we see the earth just as a marble in a pouch of many belonging to an extraterrestrial being, I found this film to be thought provoking, original, and very funny.Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K) and Will Smith (Agent J) are perfect in their roles. Not since Lenny Briscoe and Mike Logan were partners on "Law and Order" has the young cop/old cop routine been done so well with such great chemistry and deadpan humor. All of the supporting roles work too. Rip Torn is great as Zed, the head of the secret government organization - the "Men In Black" - who are in charge of overseeing the visits of extraterrestrials who have chosen to establish contact with earth and in some cases become semi-permanent residents of this planet. His great one-liners include telling a group of rejected job applicants - who really don't know what kind of job they've applied for - "Congratulations gentlemen. You are all we've come to expect from years of government training".Some of the rank and file employees of the agency are aliens themselves. Unmotivated and not particularly loyal, they enjoy hanging out in the break room drinking coffee, smoking heavily, and collecting cheap miniatures of the Statue of Liberty. Vincent D'Onofrio is also outstanding in the dual role of Edgar, a human who gets eaten by a malicious alien cockroach, and also as the cockroach himself as he tools around New York City in his "brand new Edgar suit" - Edgar's skin - in an attempt to appear human while trying to start an intergalactic war.Any human who happens to encounter an alien won't remember it thanks to the neuralizer - a device the size of a fountain pen - that the "Men In Black" administer to erase any resulting memories. This includes employees of the agency themselves, should they choose to quit or retire. The underlying purpose of all of this covering up makes sense when Smith's character, during his orientation session, tells Tommy Lee Jones that he thinks that people could handle the truth about aliens living among them. Jones' (Agent K's) response is: "A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky animals and you know it." This is hard to argue with when you think about the acts that people throughout history have performed as a mob that they would never have done as individuals. I really enjoyed this film, and its smart humor has held up over the years. I think in the future many will wonder, as I still do, why this film didn't get a nod at the Academy Awards other than its award for best makeup, at the very least for the screenplay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Men In Black one of the best examples of how to make a perfect movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men In Black is the citizen Kane of the Sci-Fi world and maybe one of the best examples of how to make a movie. The Story is simple There is a Agency which does not exist called MIB (Men In Black) They monitor any and all alien activity on Earth. The movie starts off with two MIB agents stopping an illegal alien from coming into the USA when the alien gets a little angry Agent Jay has to kill him. His partner feeling he's too old for this retires and Jay begins to look for a new partner which happens to be Police Detective James Darrell Edwards. Will Smith delivers the movie's maniacal energy whereas Tommy Lee Jones gives a remarkable deadpan performance that drives the movie forward. Without Mister Jones and Mister Smith it's safe to say There would not be a movie. Anyways back to the story. When Agent K played by MR.Jones trains the rookie agent J played by MR.Smith a intergalactic situation occurs. the Prince of a planet who hid out on earth is assassinated by a Bug the Prince's planet demands the return of a galaxy or earth will be destroyed and MIB is held responsible. MIB sends J and K down to retrieve the galaxy and stop the bug from escaping with the galaxy. The climax mixes horror comedy and suspense beautifully. My only complaint is the running time is too short I could have easily enjoyed another hour of Men In Black.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good sci-fi action comedy with two charismatic leads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This summer blockbuster was a big hit when it was shown on the silver screen in 1997, and while I never saw it in the 90's, I can't forget how much I saw it advertised, seeing the cover image with Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. I saw some of it in 2000, and I think I saw the rest in 2002, the year the less popular sequel, "Men in Black II", was released. I think I was reasonably impressed with the original "Men in Black" at the time, and definitely was when I revisited it around Christmas in 2006. This was just a little less than a year after I had seen the sequel for the first time, which I didn't think much of, and knew I wasn't alone. I watched the original again last night, and have never thought of it as an amazing film, but can understand why it was such a big hit.The MIB (Men in Black) is a top secret U.S. agency that monitors and polices extraterrestrial activity on Earth and has nothing to do with the government. The planet's general population is unaware of alien life on Earth, and whenever someone outside the agency witnesses alien activity, an MIB agent erases their memory of it and replaces it! One of the top agents in this organization is Agent K. When an N.Y.P.D. officer named James Darrell Edwards III encounters a being he thinks is a human criminal but is actually extraterrestrial, Agent K is impressed by the way he handles it, and offers him to join the MIB. The catch is that in order to do so, the officer will have to give up his identity and all records of his existence! After thinking about it for a long time, he decides to take Agent K's offer. He joins the MIB and becomes Agent J! Together, K and J must track down a member of the "Bug" race, who has disguised himself with the body of a farmer he killed and is searching for "The Galaxy", a small but very powerful energy source!Tommy Lee Jones comes in around the beginning, in the role of Agent K, and it doesn't take long for him to show his charisma. When Will Smith comes into the picture, in the role of Officer Edwards (eventually Agent J), he proves to be very charismatic as well. These co-stars make a memorable team, both playing cool guys. "Men in Black" is billed as a sci-fi action comedy, and it really does give us all three of those genres, with interesting extraterrestrial beings, some good fight and chase scenes (making for good suspense), and such comical moments as the outcome of an alien birth in a car and the new memories the farmer's wife is given. The car speeding upside down in a tunnel is both adrenaline-inducing and humorous, and it's not the only part like that. This movie also has great visuals, with the special effects, high-budget sets, and gadgets. Sure, there may be some fairly dull parts of "MIB", but for the most part, it's a strong film of its genre, and very enjoyable for many of those who like modern action blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moderately entertaining, mega-budgeted, Far Side style, Sci-Fi Farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea for "Men in Black," the latest alien opus about cracking down on extraterrestrials hiding out on earth, conjures up a galaxy of surreal comic potential. If you're looking for a moderately entertaining, mega-budgeted, "Far Side" farce that vapor locks just shy of "Ghostbusters," "Men in Black" is your ticket. Even if this uneven outer limits comedy doesn't beam you up, its alleged million-dollar-per-minute special effects that infest the plot with a spawn of dorky aliens should impress you. Despite its abundant sight-gags and eye-popping aliens, "Men in Black" frizzles because it relies on the familiar 'oxidize the earth' plot."Men-In-Black" is a great looking movie hampered by a lame plot. Based on Lowell Cunningham's obscure but sensational Marvel comic from the early 1990s, the story sounds like "Dragnet" meets "Ghostbusters." The subversive but inventive Ed Solomon script struggles to keep a deadpan lid on its diabolical lunacy so its gags will appear twice as funny. Basically, it's the old idea of getting more mileage out of a joke by telling it as if you weren't aware of the humor.The irreverent "Men in Black" humor is so dry and sporadic that it sometimes fails to enthrall. You know you're watching a comedy, and you even laugh at what you see. After all, you know these guys are straining to be hilarious. But they're not funny enough all the time to make you forget they're struggling so hard to make you laugh. Solomon wastes too much time integrating Will Smith's character into the action and not enough time incorporating Linda Fiorentino's character. The story never generates any suspense, just a lot of pastel slime. The ending is outrageously implausible even by the wacky elastic standards of this fantasy.Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith impersonate a couple of laced-strait Federal agents who work for a ultra-hush, hush agency known only as INS Division 6. Headquartered out of sight in Manhattan, INS 6 licenses, monitors, and polices all alien activity on Earth. According to the movie, about fifteen-hundred aliens reside on the planet in a state of apolitical harmony. Any alien critter that goes AWOL gets busted by these INS 6 dudes.When we first meet J (Will Smith), he is a fleet-footed NYPD detective who's been close-encountered. INS 6 recruits him because he nearly caught the alien. (If Will Smith doesn't watch out, he is going to be type-cast as the John Wayne of alien butt kickers.) INS 6 Chief Zed (Rip Torn) teams J with veteran alien buster K (Tommy Lee Jones). Even if you can tolerate the long expository build up, the story suffers again because these characters never develop the camaraderie of the "Ghostbusters." After a UFO crashes into his pick-up truck, a creepy redneck farmer, Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio), goes gunning for the aliens. They're a bunch of murderously mutant cockroaches. They zap Edgar instead and take control of his body. (This scene recalls the Stephen King episode in the 1982 movie "Creepshow.") Edgar stumbles through the rest of the movie like a zombie. He's on a weird quest to kill two Arkillian aliens disguised as human and pinch a trinket hanging around a cat's neck that contains the galaxy. When he gets it, the Arkillian threat to atomize the planet unless our heroes can recover the bauble.What we don't learn about the aliens, the filmmakers are happy to show us. Aliens galore infest "Men in Black." They resemble mutants sprung from the island of Dr. Seuss. None are particularly threatening, but some are ugly and squid-like. The scene where J assists a mother alien in birth is pretty funny, but it doesn't match the impact of the Billy Crystal calf delivery in "City Slickers." Juveniles will drool over the flashy gadgets. One device called a "neuralyzer" resembles a tire gauge crossed with a pin-light. Our heroes use it to erase the short term memory of any spectators that they encounter in the line of duty. Remember, we're not supposed to know that the aliens walk among us. Our heroes don their cool looking Ray Bans to dampen the effect on them. The Ray Bans are already available in stores, but you'll probably have to wait for the chrome plated guns. Judging from its opening weekend haul of $50 million plus dollars, "Men in Black" should at least inspire a sequel as well as merchandising out the universe. There's a cartoon series already in the works.Director Barry Sonnenfeld pulls out all stops. The hokey dragon-fly in the opening scene sets the smart aleck tone for the movie. One of the best scenes is the jewelry store confrontation which the movie makers have already given up in the previews of "Men in Black." The witty use of tabloid newspapers to tell the real truth is ironic, and the real story behind the New York's World Fair is a hoot! Sonnenfeld keeps the light weight action moving at light speed. Sometimes the movie zips by so quickly they you have trouble keeping up with it. But "Men in Black" lacks the bizarre finesse of Sonnenfeld's two "Adams Family" movies. No complaints about the casting. Tom Lee Jones of "The Fugitive" delivers the kind of stoic performance that would put Jack Webb to shame. Jones's grim-faced, buttoned-down expressions would be the envy of Detective Sergeant Friday. Jones proves himself a master comedian with impeccable timing again and again in "Men in Black." William Smith of "Independence Day" blends his streetwise, Ebonic, home boy charm with the sartorial elegance of his character as an interesting contrast to Jones' tight-lipped stooge. These co-stars work well together, except that their cardboard characters never evolve in the two frantic days covered in the movie."Men in Black" misfires more often than hits. You exit the movie theatre dazzled by the seamless special effects, but you may find that the dry, off-beat humor as memorable as a flash of light from a neutralizer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All in Good Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I'll agree with David a few reviews up in that they've stuffed up the concept of what the Men In Black are supposed to be. I too in my days of reading constantly about alien abductions and the like would always find that the MIB were alien life forms, not humans. But all I could do was sit back and say "That's Hollywood for you" and try to enjoy it for what it was. When I saw this in the cinema I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have as I went with someone who was not enthused to see it. Don't ever do that! Go alone if you have to. It's amazing how much that, even in a darkened room, a disenchanted person next to you can alter the atmosphere. That being said, since I've bought it on DVD and watched it many times since, it's got to be a favourite. My kids like watching it with me, which is great as it means we can sit down together to watch something and I don't have to be suffering through some kiddie stuff. Sonnenfeld seems to have found his niche of material with this sci-fi/comedy stuff, and he's hilarious on the commentary, and very insightful compared to a lot of other commentaries I've heard. The effects are great - Stan Winston is undoubtedly a master at big screen make up, and the cgi work wasn't overdone to the point where it bugged you, like a lot of films are getting to these days. I thought the pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was pretty inspired - I'm a big fan of Tommy and it was good to see him have some fun (or as much as he can) for a change. Vincent rocked as the bug, he's so over the top he's hilarious! And so gross!!! LOL Look, it's Hollywood, so you can never expect too much. Enjoy it for what it is, and it's a movie where you can laugh, go "oh man, gross!" on occasion, and then have a sing to a Will Smith song at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Sci-Fi Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mixing Science Fiction with comedy is a risky proposition, unless the film in question is a sendup of Sci-Fi films (I still can't decide if "Mars Attacks" was worth the matinée price I paid to see it almost a decade ago). "Men in Black", however, is a near perfect blend of Science Fiction and comedy. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are two of the most watchable actors out there, and the pairing of the two in this film is ingenious. The supporting cast,from Linda Fiorentino to Tony Shaloub, is top notch. The special effects, from the dragonfly flight during the opening credits to the spaceship crash near the finale are excellent. The writing is also much more clever than one might expect from a Sci-Fi picture - the film has to be viewed several times to catch all the barbs and asides Smith and Lee throw at each other. All in all, one of the most entertaining Sci-Fi films to come along in quite a while.</fullReview>

There is just something about being a bungling new employee that makes for a great movie and add aliens, guns and killer actors and you have a hit. The supporting cast does a superb job of playing off Smith and Jones. I believe they were born to play this role. Its great to see Jones in such a light hearted movie. Special effects in this movie are spectacular yet subtle. With todays computer generated worlds, its easy to distinguish between real and CG. The team that worked on this movie makes it hard to tell the difference between reality and non. I could actually believe the explosions in the movie really happened. That makes for happy movie goers. And I don't know what person went to see the movie that didn't go out in search of sunglasses and a "flashie thing" after watching this movie. Burger King had us covered quite nicely in that area.</fullReview>

There couldn't be a better match for alien exterminators.Vincent D'Onfrio is so hilarious and creepy as the alien threatening the safety of Earth. His performance is really great.It's serious moments are even more effective than its comedic ones because they are so well-written and there aren't too many of them. Ed Solomon knew exactly what he was doing when he wrote the script and couldn't have done a better job.The plot itself is timed and explained really well. The two MIB agents are working together to solve a mystery surrounding the ferocious bug. It isn't very complicated but not so simplistic either.Almost everything works in the film. But I do have to stress "almost". The attraction type thing going on between Will Smith and Linda what's-her-last-name is a bore, but is only brief. Plus, some scenes seem to be more filler than actual plot (Will Smith delivering a baby alien), but the movie still never loses steam. 7.9/10.</fullReview>

This has got to be one of the best Tommy Lee Jones films of all time and just another in a string of hits for Wil Smith. Topping it off is the acerbic characterization of Zed, performed with Panache by actor Rip Torn, who I have come to really admire. This film has everything, a total spoof of alien landings, lots of double meanings, plenty of action, and laughs a minute. Some of the funniest lines in the film were improvised, but the script is just a work of art. I could go on all day, but why.

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of hers since I saw her in Dogma. Now I wonder why I never noticed her before. Here she teams up with Oscar Winner Tommy Lee Jones and Oscar Nominee Will Smith as government agents to stop aliens from ruining our planet. First, the film is quite smart, witty, and works well. My favorite scenes are with Linda though not because I'm a fan of hers but she really steals the thunder and knows how to make a comeback whether verbal or physical. I don't know what happened on the set to make her the pariah of the film but she did deserve to return for the sequel. But for whatever reasons whether it was fate or her destiny, she was not and her performance in this film really shows that she can play Dr. Laurel Weaver as a smart, sensual, sexual, intelligent woman. We need more women like that and more actresses like that. She's approaching fifty now and it's not hard to believe that she wasn't even forty but she knows how to be equal with Smith and Jones. The problem might have been that it said men in black and not woman in black. I wish the best for Linda though where ever she is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining performances in energetic Sci-Fi adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite not being a big fan of the Sci-Fi genre I did find this 1997 hit very enjoyable.One of Will Smith's earlier films shows him star alongside renowned actor Tommy Lee Jones as a pair of secret agents who are on a chase of a dangerous alien.The simplicity behind the story is fantastic with Smith being recruited into the service and dealing with all new situations to him.Combining the Sci-Fi genre with comedic elements makes this film what it is and differs from other original adventures such as E.T. The graphics to construct the aliens and MIB headquarters are great and fully sufficient to justify the genre.Smith and Jones form a great partnership as the alien detecting duo. Jones' serious tone is juxtaposed with Smith's laid back ass kicking attitude, giving the audience different aspects of characters and therefore a more in-depth coverage of the business they are involved in. Both actors are acting their hearts out and are both serious as well as funny.Through cohesion are we able to see how well this short story links together. Perhaps the film was too short but all of the many story lines combine together to add to an energetic plot involving mystery inside the lives of aliens, agents, and normal people who are humorously zapped with the nurolizer, an ingenious invention, greatly used throughout.One of the main reasons I was able to appreciate the ideologies of this film was through the sense of mystery. Jones is a veteran in the business and Smith is just coming in, therefore the audience is taken through step by step of new aspects through Smith learning all about the world we really live in.It's different and energetic throughout with director Barry Sonnenfeld leading an all star cast through their paces and will keep audiences hooked throughout.This film is a must watch but don't bother with the sequel which fails miserably at every corner and cannot match up to the sheer brilliant physical and talking humour in this with its energetic mysterious storylineA great film for Sci-Fi fans and also for the whole family</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stars: Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Rip Torn, Vincent D'Orfornio and Tony Shaloub.This is a good example of many things. One is a great science fiction alien movie. This is probably the best alien film I've seen since Aliens. It's a good example of physical comedy. Will Smith was excellent doing physical comedy in this and Tommy Lee Jones meanwhile plays the straight man, which was just as funny as the comedy. Barry Sonnenfeld has great style which shows in all of his films, and this is no exception.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 97 mins. PG-13 for violence and language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another quirky but fun sci-fi adventure film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men In Black was a fun goofy film. Using Will Smith's stardom, which he got from Independence Day the year before, and adding another interesting character played by Tommy Lee Jones, we end up with a hilarious spoof on all sci-fi films.The Men In Black are a secret government agency that watches over extra terrestrial activity. Both agent J (Smith) and agent K (Jones) are like a dynamic duo who must work together to stop a monstrous bug from stealing something called a Galaxy. They are given one hour, an intergalactic week, to return it to the Arquillian's or earth will face destruction.This movie had me cracking up. Will Smith was hysterical as the obnoxious J and Tommy Lee Jones was even better as K. His deadpan style of acting was just perfect for this movie, and both him and Smith have great chemistry as partners in fighting alien crime. Linda Fiorentino and Rip Torn were also very good.Men In Black does not have the greatest special effects, but the characters are so fun to watch, that you don't even care how cheesy the special effects are. In fact the characters alone put this far above many of the other trashy films of the same genre.The story was also very creative in coming up with an idea to explain why there are some unusual people in the world. I know it's only fiction, but it made me wonder still. In fact if it was true, it sure would explain a lot.This movie offers spoof after spoof, and it does so in such a deadpan style that you can't help but break out in laughter upon viewing it. I mean all of this in a good way. It never takes itself seriously, and neither do the characters. Everybody involved seemed to enjoy making this movie. Thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1961, Earth made first contact with an alien race. Problem was, no one in the general population knew anything about it. How is that possible? Welcome to the world of the "Men in Black".They are above and beyond every legal system on Earth, and yet no one but their own knows they exist. They license, monitor, and police alien activity. They have done so in secret for over thirty-five years......until New York cop James Darrell Edwards (Will Smith) enters their world. Chasing a seemingly-human perpetrator, Edwards discovers the existence of aliens, and is soon sought out by the MIB's best agent, known only as "K" (Tommy Lee Jones). The older man is impressed by James' work, and convinces MIB chief operative Zed (Rip Torn) to bring him on board as the unit's newest member.One catch: James Edwards ceases to exist, his identity erased from the memory of anyone aware of him, his very existence denied and hidden from the law. In his place stands new recruit "J", who soon makes it his personal duty to annoy "K" at every turn, even while helping him to thwart an impending invasion over a tiny galaxial jewel hidden from extra-terrestrial forces. In the way is Edgar, once a man, but now a mere host for a deadly alien "bug" that plans to steal this jewel in order to prolong a war that is feeding his vengeful race...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this film very much, which made how much some other people hated it surprising. Those people probably didn't understand many key elements in the movie. Part of the humor does require thought, which could be a turn off for people who don't like to think. The tie ins of the history of UFO's in US culture, the MIB, the 1964 World's fair, illegal aliens, NYC cab drivers, and particularly having the tabloids serve as the hot sheets and models of investigative journalism were hilarious. People who take those tabloids seriously might be the ones offended by this movie. The cover stories used after neuralyzing people sounded like garbled versions of the explanations given in the TV series "Project UFO" which dealt with the USAF's "Project Blue Book". K's indifference to the point of suffering from the relentless monotony of it all, taking everything in stride as an every day event, and casually, lazily, and callously treating his neuralyzed victims struck me as funny, though admittedly somewhat sadistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strictly entertainment, and pretty good too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mid 90's sci-fi/action flick that asks, "How does humanity deal with the common alien invasions of Earth?" MIB is a comical romp through the worlds of science fiction, aliens, invasions, and the secret society that protects the Earth from extraterrestrial threats. The film does a good job of creating and maintaining this top-secret culture throughout, giving it life with "standard issue neuralizers," various high-tech weapons (the "noisy cricket," for one), code names, a special Batmobile like vehicle in which the MIB travel, and much much more. Though nothing here is realistic, that has never been criteria for successful movie content. The believability factor is zero, but it is easy to fit one's mind into the culture of the film. This is to director Sonnenfeld's credit, as his choice of cinematographic sequences eases the moviegoer into the traditions and methods of the MIB (much as character Jay - played by Will Smith - is eased into said traditions and methods by his partner Kay - played by Tommy Lee Jones).The problem central to Men In Black revolves around a "bug" that has landed on Earth to capture "the galaxy." The MIB are charged with protecting "the galaxy" from the "bug" at all costs. The plot widens to include a developing love interest between Jay and Dr. Laurel Weaver (Linda Fiorentino), and tackles the age-old secret serviceman's dilemma - withholding information from a loved one. And will the MIB save the Earth from certain destruction by rescuing the "galaxy?" What will become of Jay, Kay, and Dr. Weaver? The special effects ride is nonstop entertainment all the way to a comically thrilling conclusion.The doses of humor throughout help add to the movie's action romp flavor. Casting Will Smith for the role of Jay was definitely a good choice, as he brings a life and a humor to the role that is unique to him and certainly welcome. Tommy Lee Jones plays perfectly opposite him as the grizzled veteran of many MIB campaigns. In fact, all the acting performances fit their roles, and contribute to the experience Sonnenfeld wants you to leave the theater with.So, in short, this film is strictly entertainment. It won't leave you with any deeper understanding of life, but at the end of the 98 minutes, you will have enjoyed yourself straight through. And that's not a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MEN IN BLACKStarring: Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Linda Fiorentinto, Vincent D'Onofrio and Rip TornGenre: Action/Comedy/Sci-FiRated PG-13 for Language and Sci-Fi ViolenceStar Rating: *** out of 5When there is alien scum in New York City you don't call Ghostbusters you call the MIB (Men In Black). The Men In Black is an organization that has been keeping track of aliens on Earth for over 40 years! Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to find himself a new partner because his old partner I think retired or something. So then he gets himself a new gets himself a new young gun partner named James Edwards/Agent Jay (Will Smith) and together Kay and Jay most stop an evil intergalactic terrorist (Vincent D'Onofrio) who has arrived on Earth to assassinate two ambassadors from opposing galaxies. In order to prevent worlds from colliding, the MIB must track down the terrorist and prevent the destruction of Earth. One of most favorite parts is when Kay and Jay are getting their weapons and Jay gets this little gun and then he says, "Ah dang! I get the little gun." and then he shoots it and then he goes flying back. If you like this movie I would recommend Ghost Busters, Ghost Busters 2 and Men In Black 2! This movie was a great Action/Comedy and plus I remember that this movie came out on VHS a month after when the Men In Black: The Animated Series first aired on Kids WB.BOTTOM LINE: VERY COOL SCI-FI FLICK!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the success of "Independence Day", Will Smith tackled another science fiction film though less serious than the previous one. Will is Agent Jay, recruited by Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) to be his partner and replacement from the NYPD and in their first adventure together they smite an evil, annoying alien bug played by Vincent D'Onofrio. Based on a cult comic book, "Men In Black" was followed by an animated series and a sequel which brought back Agent Kay but used a terrible story to do it. The big reason this movie works is because Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones work so well together as the cocky youth and the experienced veteran, and they're chemistry is what made this film a hit. Some of the gags are great, others a tad predictable. Sadly, the sequel allowed them to slack and did not push them hard enough to actually work. Linda Fiorentino is nice eye candy, but Vincent D'Onofrio is never really evil or menacing as the obnoxious alien man bug Edgar, just annoying and smug. As a result of D'Onofrio's undisciplined performance, the film is mildly irritating whenever he's on screen, sucking the joy out of it. But all in all, this one's pretty good. Will's song is actually rather catchy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not being a big fan of the science fiction movie genre I wouldn't have picked this as a movie to see myself but it happened to be on at a friend's house so I saw most of it. This wasn't bad for a scifi-I think, judging by the comments on here most either love it or hate it and I happen to be somewhere in between.I didn't NOT like it and I could easily see someone else loving it. But wouldn't many agree one really has to like the science fiction genre to like this? The plot is so pure scifi you can't even pretend it's anything else and although the special affects were great and I could appreciate them, I am not a major scifi fan and as such, wasn't that into this movie. I will say, though, that even though this isn't really my thing, this always remained watchable and I managed to get through it and even be mildly into it at parts, which is more then I can say for a lot of there similar movies. I guess that shows this was well made, in it's way. But the fact remains this just isn't my type of movie and it didn't make much of a lasting impression on me. Parts of it I thought were just silly and the parts of the movie I REALLY liked were the more dialog driven scenes rather then the action. It's a movie I could see science fiction lovers going crazy for, and as mentioned It WAS better then a few other scifis I have seen.While I probably would not have ever seen this, other then the fact my friend happened to have it on, it wasn't a bad way to spend a few hours. The movie as a whole rates to me about a 5.5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the director of "Addams Family" and "Addams Family Values," comes a dark comedy/sci-fi featuring two of America's most loved actors.This movie is anything but a let down. The intelligent darkly comedic aspects of this movie are both clever and witty. While the science in this movie is a little lacking, the action and comedic elements are highly effective. I found the performances to be solid and well-delivered. Tommy Lee Jones could not give a bad performance, even if his director was Mick Garris! It simply is not IN him to do so. Will Smith...well, I'm not really a fan of Mr. Smith. In my opinion, he is the single-most over-rated, ego-inflated figure in the industry. I'm neither a fan of his work, nor his over-inflated pay checks. That not withstanding, his performance in this movie was quite good, and even I could enjoy it.The direction was wonderful, the creativity of the aliens was imaginative and astounding, and the plot was quite inspired. We found the finished product to be an instant and welcome addition to our "comic book" collection.PLOT: A new "bug" has come to town, and it's terrorizing Manhattan in a brand new Edgar suit. It is up to K and his unseasoned partner J to determine why he is here on Earth, and to foil his evil plan.It sounds far more campy than it is. The superior direction and ultimate polished execution never allowed this work to cross that line. And while it is delivered with tongue-in-cheek humor, the darker aspects cloak the levity in a fine darkling gossamer shroud.I highly enjoy this production, from all angles of a critical eye.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

I can't recall a summer movie I enjoyed as much as this one when it came out in 1997, or a sequel I found as disappointing. The charm of the film is its originality and freshness in its execution. Nobody takes themselves too seriously. The affection everyone on the creative team has is evident. In the sequel, everything is taken too seriously.One of the best ensemble casts in memory. I hate big budget action/sci-fi movies. This one is aces.Oh, and for the IMDB poster who commented "What was the deal with the bag of marbles at the end". It isn't a literal bag of marbles. It's a bag of galaxies. It shows how small and insignificant we are, and how our existence is totally out of our control. I think it's the most charming and deepest moment in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sequel, in my opinion, being the worst movie ever made it's only natural for me to come back and review the first one. The concept isn't hard to grasp, there are actual aliens all over the world and in New York, there is a building which houses the "Men in Black". What ends up happening is an interesting blend of humor and science fiction. Will Smith plays the loud- mouth and immature Agent J with some good intensity, but he just feels to over- the- top in himself. As Agent K, Tommy Lee Jones shows a more serious side then a comic side, and he pulls off his role of a harsh but fair agent well. In support is Vincent D. as the alien they are hunting down and Rip Torn as the head of the agency. The cast isn't exactly amazing, but they do the job. The writing and direction aren't very good, the script tries to fill the movie with one- liners that are supposed to be basically a parody of anything or everything. Barry Sonnenfeld has a tough time making just a normal movie, he always seems to like going over- the- top but it drastically hurts the movie (e.g. Wild Wild West). The visual effects are quite good, with some nice attention to the little details (weapons and such). Men in Black is what'd you expect from any summer block buster, some laughs and good action. It's a solid movie, but doesn't add up too well as other movies around. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about the Men in Black, a top secret government agency specializing in dealing with alien visitors and relations and keeping them a secret from the general public. We see the film mainly from the point of view of Agent J (Will Smith), a new recruit brought up to speed by Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). Together, the two of them must track down an intergalactic terrorist hiding in a human body (Vincent D'Onofrio).Yeah, it sounds really stupid. And technically, it is, and also completely implausible. But so what? This is the kind of movie you need after a 40 hour week of work to relax. You can just watch it and not think about anything else. These types really aren't very deep and from a critical standpoint severely lacking in the script department, but they're fun and you can actually watch it with your kids without being embarassed.Jones and Smith totally own this movie. It's rare to see two guys who can work so well together. And Vincent D'Onofrio steals every scene he's in as the towering zombie-like creature. Linda Fiorentino also rocks as Dr. Weaver. I wonder why she had to win this role in a game of poker with the director, it's not like she couldn't pull it off. A fun, light-hearted flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(8 out of 10) 'Men in Black' is a too-cool-for-you science fiction epic! Based upon a cult comic book, it presents aliens as real (as real as Tony Robbins!), and the government as secretive as some of our paranoid citizens think they are.The movie keeps pulling surprises out of its bag of tricks, from regrowing alien heads to a giant cockroach alien! And it does so with a good plot with a funny twist end!Smith and Jones are a great team. Most movie buddy movies where they pit opposite types against each other fail because it's so obvious. This works because Smith and Jones are so damn cool! They seem to be trying to outdo each other with their coolness, and we get to benefit. Best of all, we CARE about these two lead characters, how they got where they are, and what happens to them. In science fiction films, often the effects overwhelm the characters, but not here.I absolutely LOVE Vincent D'Onofrio in this! When I watch him on Law and Order, sometimes he says things a bit like the alien in this movie!The special effects are great, the storyline is fascinating, the jokes are great, and the cast is perfect! A fun film to watch over and over!</fullReview>

One of the funniest parts to me was when the MIB pulled Reggie and his wife over and Tommy Lee Jones was asking him to see his *other* license and registration and Reggie's wife was having a baby and Will had to deliver it and the "baby" wrapped itself around Will and was banging him down on top of the car and everything. I thought that part was hilarious. I also liked Edgar and the way he walked and ran into things. I loved the part where he comes back inside the house just after the bug stole his body and his wife says "Edgar you're skin is hanging off your bones" and he looks in the mirror and he says "oh, yeah," and he pulls his skin back on his face and he says "there, is that better!" and his wife passes out!!! Most people think that movies have to have jokes about sex and violence to have a good humorous movie but this movie doesn't and it's still worth watching. I bought the sequel a couple of days ago and I still have yet to watch it! I hope it's as good as the first one. Anyways. Men In Black is a great family movie and it deserves good comments.

		<fullReview>Men In Black is an excellent film, if only for its subtle exploration of our society's paranoid alien folklore. Every conceived alien conspiracy theory is covered (with the exception of crop designs) and handled creatively, often tying into several neighboring conspiracy theories. For years, America has murmured quietly about UFO/FBI cover-ups, alien life and the mysterious `Men In Black' who show up asking questions after every unnatural phenomenon ? finally Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones give us the answers!An action-comedy, Men In Black accosts the highly-funded yet unofficial government agency, Division 6, headed by Zed (Rip Torn). There Agents K (Jones) and J (Smith) keep tabs on the sizable alien population of the US and investigate and regulate all alien entities that enter the planet's NYC port, many of which are completely harmless. Apparently, aliens have lived among us for some time (a wall chart shows a picture of every alien on Earth ? among them: Sylvester Stallone, Newt Gingrich and Dionne Warwick). Anyway, while on the job, the MIB agents uncover the deadly plot of an intergalactic terrorist named Edgar (Vincent D' Onofrio) who's on a mission to assassinate two ambassadors from opposing galaxies currently residing in New York City. Thus, in order to prevent imminent doom, K and J must track down the terrorist.Director Barry Sonnenfeld (The Addams Family and its sequel) isn't over-excessive with special-effects, chase-scenes or unnecessary explosions ? in fact, everything is skillfully placed for a purpose (what a concept!). As aforementioned, the film plays with some pretty ridiculous notions, producing some wicked little witticism (tabloid newspapers are the best source of reporting as far as Jones' character is concerned, while the exhibit at the 1964 World's Fair was nothing more than a flying saucer cover-up). Just remember, reality is often times more weirder that science fiction ? Men In Black inclines viewers to side with the conspiracy version of history in a most entertaining way. Frighteningly enough, some of the scenarios and theories presented in the film can actually be backed up by facts, which could prove a bit much for those already a bit unhinged. I say see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] It's true what they say: aliens live among us. But there's no need to fear, because the Men in Black (MIB) are here to save us. Agents Kay and Dee come to the scene of importing illegal aliens. One of them was a real alien. That same night, a young NYPD detective was chasing a man through the streets. His name, James Edwards. James notices something very weird about this man. This was quite an eventful night because not too far away at a farmhouse, a spaceship crashes onto a farmer's truck then steals the farmer, Edgar's skin and wears it like a suit. Kay meets with James and tells him to come to a building where they would do...something to him. It was headed by Chief Z (Zed). James passed all the tests and Kay told him he was ready to get it on-- the last suit he'll ever wear. A black suit and tie. He is now Agent Jay of the Men in Black. The alien in Edgar's body was looking for something. He killed two people (aliens in disguise) looking for it. One of the men had a cat, Orion with him. Something very spectacular hung from his collar. Kay and Jay investigate weird goings-on and get information from Frank the pug; appparently the thing on Orion's collar, or belt, was a galaxy that Edgar was looking for. He took it and the mortician, Dr. Laurel Weaver. He was going to leave the planet with them, and as if that weren't bad enough, the Arquillians threatened to destroy earth unless the galaxy was delivered to them. Kay and Jay rushed to Queens where two flying saucers from the Worlds Fair still existed. The two agents use all their flashy gadgetry and defeat Edgar. In the end, Jay get's a new partner, Elle (L; Laurel) and Kay regains his previous identity. A pretty good movie. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are good. Though I was quite disappointed with Men in Black II, it wasn't as good as the first, but then again I guess no sequel is. If you're in to sci-fi/comedy fares, then I recommend Men in Black!-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be very highly enjoyable and very well worth the time spent watching it. It has a lot of good, edge of your seat action, splendid special effects and terrific laughs throughout. I also think that Will Smith &amp; Tommy Lee Jones work so very well together. If you're a fan of science fiction and you, by chance, still haven't seen this movie, I really think you ought to give this one a try. You're in for a real treat if you do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superior special effects and a high irreverence make this a surprisingly easy way to spend a couple of hours. The concept is inspired: the world is populated by aliens disguised as ordinary folk and there's a secret branch of the INS designed to monitor them and protect us; and some of the gags in Ed Solomon's script (based on Lowell Cunningham's comic) border on genius (tabloids are telling the truth, the New York World's Fair statues are really spaceships). The film views aliens pretty much as we view foreigners, with a mixture of wary acceptance and trepidation but that high irreverence helps us get past the barebones intimations of xenophobia. And there's a real chemistry between the two perfectly cast principals, the smooth Tommy Lee Jones and entertaining Will Smith. Smith is especially endearing: he's at ease with the mild racial quips that go hand in hand with the film's themes and proves to be a good sport. Invisibly directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, whose lack of personality is a plus: he stays out of the way of the action and lets the story and visuals unfold cleanly.</fullReview>

I would say rent it first just to see if you like it.I rate 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with a lot of style, and very little substance. But you know what? Doesn't matter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of aliens trying to either take over or destroy the earth has been done almost to death in recent memory. Some good (Independence Day), and some bad (Mars Attacks!). But Men in Black has something most movies don't, and that's style. This movie is just oozing with style. First of all, yes, aliens are trying to destroy the Earth, the Galaxy, whatever. The difference here is that it's not a bunch of earthlings coming together in a time of need to defend the planet from unknown life-forms. Here, aliens live among us (including Sylvester Stallone, New York weatherman Al Roker, and of course Dennis Rodman). But there are only a select group of men and women who know all about the aliens, and the rest of the planet is kept in the dark, to protect us. One of the funniest scenes is the airport-like terminal where the aliens come into the country (of course they come through New York), sometimes just for lunch. The ones sent out to protect us from the bad aliens, and to make sure the aliens conform to the alien-earthling treaties, are known as the Men in Black. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith play K and J, two of the Men in Black. When a "bug" falls to Earth and wants to take over the galaxy, it's up to those two to save the day. It's the look and feel of the movie that sets it apart from the rest. It's a comedy, so the laughs are intentional, and not accidental. And surprisingly enough, it's not Smith who turns out to be the funniest one. Jones has one-liners that sound twice as funny because he's so damn serious all the time. The interaction between the two in wonderful, with Jones being the older, wiser one who knows all the tricks of the trade, and Smith being the newcomer, brash and invincible, ready to take on whatever comes his way. The special effects are actually some of the best I've seen in that they're completely seamless. Danny Elfman provides another terrific score, reminiscent of Beetlejuice and The Addams Family. One of the most entertaining films you can see. Got it Slick?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what it is, but the first time I saw this film I was expecting more of a serious sci-fi movie. But after a few repeat viewings I came to realize this is a comedy with sci-fi in it, not a sci-fi movie with comedy in it.The story is quite interesting, and very smart. I love that the tabloids are best place to do research for MIB agents. That's great! There are a number of things like this that really got me laughing. The comedy in the film is great from start to finish. There's a few bad jokes, but the bulk of them are really good.The characters are just incredible in the film. The interaction between Tommy Lee Jones (K) and Will Smith (J) is perfect (and hilarious), they're complete opposites, which makes them so great! Another great addition to the film is Vincent D'Onofrio (Edgar), his acting in the film was just perfect! And let's not forget the beautiful Linda Fiorentino (Dr. Weaver), she did a great job in the film too. I think Rip Torn and Tony Shaloub deserve some honorable mentions as well.The special effects in the film are absolutely mind-blowing! The scene where the Bug's ship is crash landing on earth and hits Edgar's truck is superb! Then the entire end scene where J and K shoot down Edgar Bug's ship and then Edgar tears off his skin and becomes the bug...AMAZING! Nearly flawless special effects!If you're in the mood for a good comedy/sci-fi movie, you should definitely watch this film! There are so many good things about this film, you really ought to give it a shot. I deeply hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do, but remember it may take a few repeat viewings.

Soon, circumstances force them to try and thwart an infamously violent alien whose very presence could bring about the destruction of the planet. Wacky, laugh-out loud funny take on the alien invasion saga is slickly plotted, with clever ideas and nifty special effects. The combination of Smith's impulsive rookie and Jones' stiff veteran works to perfection, and the two leads have plenty of fine comedic moments. ***</fullReview>

As MiB Agent J, Edwards and his partner, K, are after a deadly alien bug that threatens the existence of our planet and has come to earth to assassin the ambassadors of another alien race, the Arquillans. Can the MiB stop the giant bug before the Arquillans declare war on our planet?I usually don't expect very much from Hollywood anymore, but "Men in Black" was a big surprise. It's an intelligent and VERY funny movie, featuring perfect CGI and special effects and Tommy Lee Jones at his best. The story is original too, something very rare nowadays. My only big complaint is Will Smith's annoying rap music that definitely doesn't belong to a sci-fi movie. Danny Elfman's soundtrack however is great as (almost) always. This is one of the funniest movies ever in the SF genre. And I especially liked the last scene...</fullReview>

This film combines two unlikley talents, that of Will Smith (Bad Boys) and Tommy Lee Jones (Lonesome Dove). It's hard to contemplate but after you've seen the film you'll see that they're great together as partners. Director Barry Sonnenfeld (The Addams Family, Get Shorty) is most notably compared to Tim Burton in the way in which he shot this movie. Some of the ways in which he captured a shot haven't really ever been done before. The soundtrack is also to boast. Will Smith's single 'Men In Black' got great publicity for the picture and Danny Elfman's 'Cool' score is even better.

		<shortDescription>A treat for both eyes and brain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MIB is a rare thing: a Hollywood action comedy that actually has brains as well as laughs. Even rarer, the laughs are frequently unforced and underplayed (especially by Tommy Lee Jones) - which of course is much funnier. Script, direction and performances are all sharp, funny and intelligent. Special mention to Vincent D'Onofrio, whose physical performance (as a dead man's skin inhabited by a giant cockroach!) must have been extremely uncomfortable to sustain.The greatest compliment I can pay to the FX teams is to point out that the alien characters frequently switch from being Rick Baker's animatronic creations to CGI and back again within a single scene - and the two are generally indistinguishable. Great stunt work too, particularly by Keith Campbell in a stunning shot filmed on the roof of the Guggenheim Museum.Lesser directors/producers would probably have been tempted to add pointless additional action sequences that didn't serve the story, just to pad it out to the expected blockbuster length of two hours plus. Full marks to Sonnenfeld, Spielberg et al for knowing just when to end this movie and leaving the audience wanting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable Sci-Fi romp that is over all too soon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how simple it is to make a really good comedy without having to try too hard with a busy script.Men In Black is just such a comedy, played very firmly with tongue-in-cheek and not to be taken at all seriously. The story is simple yet very rich &amp; entertaining (although it also received a lot of bad press from some quarters because it was seen as racist - an allegory for repatriating illegal immigrants from the US!)The two lead stars, Smith &amp; Jones, don't have to stretch themselves too much, acting wise, since they're both on familiar ground, especially from wise-cracking Will Smith who was really only continuing his character mannerisms from where Independence Day left off.I was quite surprised with TLJ, I've never really thought of him as being the comedy-film-type, but he plays his role with a great deal of mellowed drollery, not letting Smith's antics wind him up too much, which is typical of most buddy partnerships in comedy movies (Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hours etc)The support from Rip Torn &amp; Vincent D'onofrio was good but patchy, they weren't given enough material from the script to make us really care for them. Similarly with Linda Fioretino, she is a very attractive lady but wasn't really allowed to have enough dialogue to make us appreciate her more. She would have made a good foil/romantic link for Smith, but this was never allowed to even develop, just like the character she portrayed.The CGI sfx, although not particularly overwhelming were generally quite good, and the music really helped pace the film and I loved the upbeat &amp; funky Will Smith music video clip straight after the movie.I enjoyed MIB far more than the over-rated, over-hyped IE4. The only problem was that it only lasts about 90 minutes, which is quite short for a Hollywood movie these days where most stretch to at least two hours.I hope the original cast &amp; main characters are brought together again for the impending sequel. There's plenty of material to go round and perhaps on this occasion more attention can be paid to a more indepth characterisation of both K &amp; J (and hopefully Linda too), because we hardly get to know anything about these dudes from this movie.***/*****</fullReview>

I basically caught it on HBO when I had nothing better to do and was pleasantly surprised.It's just a really fun movie. I like SFX films like this that present something close to reality, but just twist it a little bit to give us something a bit perculiar. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make the perfect pair, it's easily Smith's best vehicle yet. Right before his ego got TOO big. Linda Fiorentino makes the most of her role too.The visual effects are original and fun, and the story has enough momentum and impact to keep you interested for it's length, but at the same time doesn't take itself seriously at all. Men in Black is one of the few big budget Hollywood movies that I'd actually look forward to a sequel from.- 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here I thought Men In Black would be a serious look into all the UFOology, the cover-ups, the abductions, Area 51, you know, X-Files kind of stuff. Instead, we get what is nothing more than a Saturday morning cartoon. Oh, it was entertaining all right, with some funny scenes, and goofy aliens, but it was too much like Ghostbusters or even Independence Day in its lightweightedness. It was like eating cotton candy when I wanted a steak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not as funny as we are to supposed to assume. It has weaker special effects than we are led to believe. And, it has a story line that fails to hold up under scrutiny.Nevertheless, it was entertaining. Not overly so, but for an hour and a half (Thank God it wasn't longer.), it was reasonably enjoyable. This is a classic movie that I'm glad I saw - so that I can say I saw it - but would never watch again, despite having it on tape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Men in Black, I still enjoyed Will Smith as an actor. After seeing this film, I have hated him ever since. I still haven't seen another movie with Will Smith after seeing this one. "Enemy of the State" probably is a good film (because of Gene Hackman), but I'll never watch "Wild Wild West" (not even because of the extremely beautiful Salma Hayek) because it's made by the same director as of this movie. There was absolutely no chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, they were never funny. The story (plot) was so very thin and very very bad. Still, the special effects were great and there were a few good moments. Therefor I'll give this one a 6 out of a ten. But for all you guys who thought that this movie was worth more than a six, to hell with all of you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So after the average Independance Day, Will Smith returns yet again to kick some alien ass and do it with style. Well that was the aim. Unfortunately, Mr.Smith once again signs on to a film that goes nowhere what so ever. His co star Tommy Lee Jones(Volcano) does well to keep up with his active partner but after watching the film, I was left with the question-what was it all about? The answer was nothing really. The duo were faced with the task of tracking down an illegal alien-bug-thing before it wreaks havoc on our unaware planet. Both leads do fairly well considering the nowhere plot, and support comes from Rip Torn and Linda Florentino. The special effects are decent enough but nothing we haven't seen before. In summary, the actors did well in a flawed story. Rating=3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this funny flick! The combination of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was great, I found their jokes and one-liners hilirous, especially Will Smiths "wait a minute, that was on Final Jeapardy".The concept of aliens living on Earth is definitely not new, or the fact they were congregated in NYC, but I did like the way they had to go through customs and carry licences, very kewl.The bug alien dude was idiotic, he was actually better in his human form than the computer animated giant alien bug form. The variety of aliens of all sizes was very interesting, even a bit more varied than Star Wars!I enjoyed watching Wills efforts in getting to be a MIB agent, the part where he drags the table across the room during the exam was quite funny.Although the flick didnt have the most original plot, it is still definitely worth seeing, at least it doesn't take itself seriously like some flicks (ID4)I recommend everyone should see it!I give this 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who cares about a plot?? The plot is the only thing that actually slows this joyride down a bit halfway through. MiB is laugh aloud funny, packed with whiz-bang one-liners, pokes at everyone from Elvis to Newt Gingrich, and much charm from the stars, Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. Smith is extremely enjoyable as the New Guy, employed to help save Earth from aliens, all in a day's work. His swaggering confidence and sass are an amusing contrast to Jone's delightfully deadpanned agent K.The wise-cracking humor here is great, as evidenced in one of my favorite exchanges: Jones claims to be from the FBI and asks a woman to discuss her husband's transformation into an alien. The wife sullenly retorts, "Is this some kinda joke?" TO which Jones solemnly replies, "No, ma'am, we at the FBI do not have a sense of humor we are aware of."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People have strange attractions. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I don't know why. I saw it twice at the cinema and I am one of those crazy people who owns this movie. I must have seen it about thirty to forty times and I still can't get to the bottom of it. It's just one of those movies that you can analyse until the cows come home but in the end it's just a very enjoyable experience. The acting was mediocre, I thought. Of course, Will Smith is hilarious in his role. I think he should take up full-time acting and leave his singing career behind. The special effects were convincing enough, nothing unique or stunning. The plot was simple yet complex enough to keep us going and the costumes were just...BLACK!! What gets me about this movie is that it doesn't try to be something special. It doesn't try to break new ground with special effects and it doesn't deliberately draw us in with moving moments and touching scenes. It just gives us a general piece of entertainment. I got the impression that I was just watching funny-guy Will Smith acting in a low-budget foreign movie with a heap of special effects. Speaking of funny, the movie was just that. That was what was also good about it. Comedy was not what I expected from this movie and I was utterly surprised when I laughed my head off in the cinema. Not something one does normally when watching a movie that has been advertised since the beginning of the year. I still don't know what it is with this movie. Maybe I'm just a sucker for Spielberg(did I mention him at all???)...</fullReview>

That kept the movie from really rising to the top of any of my lists. Just about all his scenes were plagued with dumb dialog and stupid movement. It even got a little annoying at times.

		<fullReview>I had reservations about this, since I didn't like Will Smith's last alien movie, INDEPENDENCE DAY, but then I saw part of a rough cut and became interested. Seeing it in theaters, I liked it, though with some reservations. Vincent D'Onofrio is a good actor, but all the scenes with him when he became the alien felt like they were dragging down the movie, and the alien didn't look very good either. And Linda Fiorentino was wasted on her role, except for the scene where Smith thinks she's coming on to him, and the last scene.Still, this was fun. I liked all the satirical pieces and the New York jokes, and I liked the way Smith and Tommy Lee Jones worked together. As he proved with the two ADDAMS FAMILY movies, Barry Sonnenfeld knows that wacky humor comes off best when it's played as completely normal (especially Jones' reaction when Smith tells him the suspect he chased said the world was coming to an end; "Did he say when?"). Overall, I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Sci-Fi/Comedy Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that some of you will be against me claiming that this is the best sci-fi/comedy ever by saying Back to the Future is better. Yes, Back to the Future is better, but Men In Black is funnier and has a more typical and stronger sci-fi direction. Back to the Future is hilarious and the whole deal with time travel and the science behind it is good, but Men In Black is funnier and actually has more alien creatures throughout it. Therefore, Men in Black is more worthy of the title I'm giving.Aside from me saying this is better than Back to the Future in some respect, this is definitely superior to the sequels and cartoon made about this. The sequels spawned from this featured more aliens and tried to make everything funnier. All that happened was the movies became sillier with less belly-laughs that this one had. This was more serious with funnier stuff. Since the series started with actual hilarity and not just silliness, they should have kept it that way.Men In Black tells the story of a top secret organization that monitor extraterrestrials on Earth. Agent K (Jones) is in need of a new partner, and quickly recruits streetwise cop, James Edwards (Smith) who unknowingly encountered an alien that committed suicide. When a spaceship crash- lands on Earth and the alien takes the body of a farmer (D'Onofrio), both men must thwart the alien and seek "The Galaxy."What makes this movie so hilarious and awesome is Will Smith. Having just finished The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and action-buddy-comedy, Bad Boys, Smith breaks out in his funniest and best role. His character is like the Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) from Beverly Hills Cop of the 90s. All of his jokes and honest opinions are side-splitting. What makes him the perfect candidate for the MIB program is how open-minded he is. There is one scene where he and other potential candidates from the likes of Navy SEALS and Army Rangers take a series of standard tests they are used to so the company can pick a successor and he is the only what that questions orders and analyzes certain situations. They take a written test and nobody can write well because there's no flat surface, so he pulls the table in the middle of the room close to him. The scene is funny as hell, but also shows that he doesn't always wait for instructions.The rest of the cast is fabulous too. D'Onofrio is unrecognizable after the alien takes over his body. That is just what makes his character funny as Smith. Check out this brilliant and hilarious science-fiction classic!</fullReview>

But thats for another discussion.What we have here is the Will Smith movie where her had self realisation of being the biggest star on the planet, and boy does it show.He is just on the wrong side of irritating, and if it wasn't for Jones acting him off the screen, it would have been a problematic move for the studio.The plot is simple but effective, and the effects are groundbreaking for the time. It's nice to see Hollywood taking a gamble for once on a big film that didn't have anything to do with a sequel and was highly original.And considering Hollywood released one of the worst sequels ever in 1997, the gamble paid off.it's a fun movie, made even more watchable by the two leads chemistry, Rip Torn, and the fact that it's only just over 90 minutes long.A nice movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon when it's raining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific sci-fi comedy with stylish special effects stealing the show...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For sheer entertainment, MEN IN BLACK hits the jackpot with its stylish and startling CGI effects--and is no slouch in the acting department either, with TOMMY LEE JONES and WILL SMITH making a great buddy team.Based on a Marvel comic book, it's really a series of well staged encounters with aliens as Jones and Smith attempt to save the galaxy from extinction by being able to cope with alien terrorists in our midst. No easy matter, since Smith is a rookie on the job, stumbling onto it by accident after his stunning chase scene wherein he has a brief encounter with a thing he recognizes has super capabilities. He's soon being groomed for the job of sidekick to Jones, having proved his mettle in that chase.The wisecracks back and forth never stop, the gadgets are fascinating, the plot wildly improbable--but most of it is enough to cause more than a few chuckles of laughter, if not hilarity. LINDA FIORENTINO does nicely as a sassy morgue doctor exchanging some double entendre quips with Smith as they examine one of the aliens.Aside from all the sight gags and some inside jokes at the expense of some well-known celebs, the visual splendor of the film and its New York City settings will grab your attention. A nifty score by Danny Elfman provides some appropriately zestful background music and it's all meant to be nothing more than pop culture entertainment for the masses--which it is.WILL SMITH gets to do most of the physical stunts in what has to be one of his most strenuous roles among all the action films he's done. Jones has his share of derring do--and the scene where he gets gulped down the gullet of a giant bug is quite a sight--and, of course, he lives to tell about it.The comic book capers of the MEN IN BLACK should please most fans of sci-fi fiction tinged with outrageous humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about Men in Black? Well it has Will Smith in it. Need I say more? Will Smith made that movie a splash hit, with a lot of help from his Co Stars of course! Every single movie that Will Smith has made I have seen. The movies have great story lines, great plots, but Will just puts the icing on the cake for every movie he does. He adds a sense of real life to every movie he makes, and every girl swoons if they see he has a new movie out. I will be walking back to class and see lockers and lockers full of Will Smiths pictures! I see binders and binders filled with his pictures. He makes movies big hits. Every movie he does, never goes down the drain, and is one of those classic movies over and over again. I hope that he stays in movie business for a very long time. My teacher was one of the marines in the beginning of the movie, he said Will was like a normal guy. He was a excellent actor, remember everything, but a normal guy. He even played with Will's son. He's not one of those snotty actors living in billion dollar mansions, but a real guy. Some people don't like him, say he should stick to singing or playing small roles in tiny episodes. Well those people are idiots. He definitely is a great singer and absolutely, he he is a great actor. If they learn to see what I see then they will realize at last that Will Smith has got great potential and talent. I know he has been in tons of movies. But he could triple that by ten. I hope he never stops. Even in his old age he will be funny and make people grabbing there sides not to laugh. I just love Will Smith and hope on one day actually being able to meet him and tell him what a great idol he has been for me. If he can come up from the hood, and become rich and famous. A geeky girl from a small hick school could become a singer, or a actress. But only will I dream. LOL.</fullReview>

Notice the lack of knowledge of how Men in Black actors use high technology themselves, but are highly aware of it. These are the government's most versatile, and competitive agents.When the tough gets going they seek to eliminate. They like to have time for morning lattes and an afternoon espresso or tea. Especially when the mission involves some punk ass alien who thinks they either know more about the technology or politics. The legal platform to launch normal events exists for a reason. To avoid chaos and keep legal disputes at a level capable of being efficiently processed. Again some punk ass alien thinks they can do whatever and whenever they like.Men in Black seems to be a more than colorful way of how aliens try to exploit the secrets of the government.</fullReview>

It is rare that we see an African-American not playing a gangster become popular but Smith acts in mostly family friendly films. He had a very good couple of years, first with the all-star spectacle "Independence Day" and shortly after this less overblown showcase. Too bad that he has stumbled (not counting his Oscar nomination for Ali) with such boring films as I, Robot and Wild, Wild West.The rest of the cast is also superb with Rip Torn as the rather stuffy chief of the MiB and Linda Fiorentino as a coroner who seems to enjoy her work a little too much. It is strange to think that she and Smith both being attractive people don't seem to have any social life. The K character had a lost love but the movie luckily sticks to the main plot and doesn't give us that much of a back story to it's demise.As for Vincent D'Onofrio, he must have had a terrible time doing this in the rather disgusting make-up job he is given but he was never much of a glamour boy to begin with (Smith jokes about this in one scene as well). He must have done this for the money.To sum up, this is a treat and repeated viewings doesn't make this any less of a good time.</fullReview>

I thought the writing was so good and not at all what I expected, especially having seen the lamely directed and totally unoriginal second one just recently.

		<fullReview>This is one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. It is worthy enough to be compared to INDEPENDENCE DAY and was evidently good enough that many movies would come to rip-off this film's alien invasion plot. The later EVOLUTION was better in creating humor and this movie was better in creating elaborate and exciting action sequences. The sequel MEN IN BLACK II was pretty sucky, but this movie still lives up to being the original franchise.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are perfectly cast as the two guys to eliminate the alien scum. This movie is destined to become a classic as it was good enough to give birth to a crap sequel and several movies that try to be just like it.If you enjoy this movie, which most people do, you would probably be interested in seeing INDEPENDENCE DAY, EVOLUTION, and MEN IN BLACK II.MEN IN BLACK gets 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your average comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones team up along side Vincent D' Onfrio and Rip Torn for the 1997 hit MEN IN BLACK. Smith is agent J. Just recruited to a top secret government organization MIB that monitors extra-terrestrial life on Earth. Jones is K. The man who recruits J. and who is a long time member of the MIB. Together they must team up to stop a bug in a human's body (Vincent D' Onfrio) under the guidance of Rip Torn. MIB never let's in on the laughs, and is nothing like your average comedy. It's worthy of the success it's had, but I hear the sequel stinks. Too bad. Maybe in MIIIB (MIB 3) they should come up with some original plot lines and jokes like MIB 1. Because even if the sequel's horrible, MIB is a great blend of comedy, action, and sc-fi. 3.5/5 starsJOHN ULMER</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No chemistry? To me they mark the most inspired cinematic double-act since Gibson 'n' Glover...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILERS)  It's happened with all the great double-acts, both cinematic and otherwise, one is zany and madcap whilst the other acts as a foil for his more expressive partner. So it is here. Tommy Lee Jones underplays almost every line given to him here and allows Smith to act it up in his role. Both are marvellous. Of course it helps that the script is achingly sharp, with scarcely a line wasted, but Jones interpretation of the part is so perfect that he invests even seemingly unimportant lines with just the right amounts of lightness and gravitas. Witness as evidence his opening line: "We'll take it from here...". It truly has to be seen to be appreciated just how gut-bustingly funny Jones makes these words seem with his deadpan delivery. In my opinion, the finest comedy debut by a 'serious' actor since Jeff Daniels gave his hilarious turn in "Dumb &amp; Dumber. We all know Smith can do comedy. Even those of you who don't like his brand of humour can probably appreciate why some people find him funny. Put simply, if you like his style, you'll like this, since he doesn't change much from the characters we found in ID4, "The Fresh Prince..." et al. Hey, I'm not complaining though, he's perfectly suited to the style of movie that MIB is. There are very few easy laughs in MIB's script, which is probably why I think it's one of the funniest comedies in years. You have to listen to the dialogue and delivery to extract maximum amusement from the situation. Classic example: Smith is talking to K in the elevator before he becomes a recruit: J: "I don't wanna be known as 'kid', 'sport', 'son', 'junior'..." K: "Sure, whatever you say Slick". There could have been a temptation in a comedy such as this to let the effects get the laughs and to neglect the script. Thankfully, this wasn't done. The effects are there to augment the comedy, not provide it. (Kudos to Rick Baker by the way, for his stunning creations.) I have to conclude that the majority of people who didn't find this funny probably weren't paying enough attention! View again carefully and see if I'm right, if you still don't like it, then I've obviously just got a totally different sense of humour to you! To sum up, I think this is a fantastic film in all departments that showed us just how funny the Smith/Jones partnership could be when given the opportunity to work together on such quality material. I said in my summary the best screen pairing since Gibson 'n' Glover. That double-act also conforms to the expectations given at the start of the review. I would have mentioned Carrey 'n' Daniels instead, except I feel that Jim's performance was ever so slightly overdone in that movie. Ah well. that's a whole 'nother subject! Roll on MIB2!</fullReview>

It definitely wouldn't get made based on the popularity of the comic books, there were only 6 comics in total that were made (except for the 3 comics that either were based on the movie or were one-shots).I never even knew that it was originally a comic book series until after I saw the movie. This movie is funny and, at some points, action-packed. This is the best Will Smith movie out there, this a great movie to see if you like Tommy Lee Jones or Will Smith. This is a great movie even if you don't like the two. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. You may disagree, but I thought that this movie was fabulous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men in Black is a really funny movie. The plot is about two agents in a top secret government agency named the Men In Black which is so top secret that not even the government knows it exists. It focuses on two agents in this agency and their efforts to bring down an intergalactic terrorist named Edgar the Bug (Vincent D'Nofrio). The Agents are Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) a fast talking serious man who is not at all phased by the fact that he deals with aliens everyday. The other character agent is Police Officer James Edwards (Will Smith) who later becomes Agent J when he joins the Men in Black. The conversation between Agent K and Agent J is hilarious and really keeps the movie going strong with the laughs. Edgar is also a particular source of amusement. Overall the movie is very good so if you like either science fiction or comedies you'll like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all honesty, I have never been a too big fan of the Men in Black franchise. It's good entertainment all but nothing too great.And that is basically all this movie is; some good, simple entertainment. It's fun all but at the same time also rather simplistic. This especially goes for its story, which really is the foremost thing that is keeping the movie down and preventing it from ever becoming a true classic, or absolute must-see.I mean, I love the Edgar bug and Vincent D'Onofrio's performance but the whole villainous plot is kind of standard and shaky and also seems to be completely secondary for the movie as well. Really, the movie and its story are in its core all incredibly standard.Yet the movie still works out as good entertainment, which for most part is due to its two main characters and their dynamics. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are total opposites of each other, in about every way imaginable, which is the reason why their interactions work out as something great and amusing. Besides, they have some great chemistry together and play surprisingly well off each other. Surprising, since Tommy Lee Jones normally isn't the comedy type of guy and Will Smith at the time still had to somewhat proof and establish himself as a leading man in movies.Yes, as a comedy, or buddy flick if you will, this movie does not disappoint. It will make you laugh and keep you entertained, pretty much throughout its entire running time. It lets the time fly by really and the movie is over before you know it. It is a good thing that the movie doesn't waste any time on anything and keeps a fast pace throughout. It still has some distractions it it, which were unnecessary in my opinion, such as everything involving the Linda Fiorentino character.The special effects are all pretty good, especially also for 1997 standards. After all, it's also really still a science-fiction flick so its effects and look were also important for the movie. The movie besides uses some absolutely great makeup effects and creature design, by Rick Baker. Another thing that I'm really fond of is the musical score by Danny Elfman. It's some typical Elfman stuff, that suits the overall style and atmosphere of the movie very well. It also sadly is one of his last true great scores.All in all, really not a perfect movie but it still remains some good entertainment to watch.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny/Imaginative Sci-Fi Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the beginning of this film, the story grabs the viewer's attention because the audience will have no idea to what is going on. It is not until minutes later when everything is revealed. Even then, the audience will have questions galore. No problem folks, all your personal questions will be answered when Will Smith enters the equation. Once that happens, things speed up real fast.Starring as the attractive lead in this film is Will Smith. Smith is New York cop who does his best to be the cop that he is. He's much better than his fellow officers, that's for sure. I love the way Smith talks. It seems very natural for him to talk the way he did. This is funny to watch because Smith's character has a wisecrack for almost any comment or explanation. Tommy Lee Jones plays the mentor of Smith. What makes Jones a good teacher is how he describes things, how he reacts to things, and how he handles things. It's all very serious but in a way, Jones is always goofing around. I really don't think he intends to, but that's how he comes off; as a joker. For example when he hands out the hand guns to Smith, he says "Series 4 De-atomizer". Smith's response, "Now that's what I'm talking about", but instead Smith is handed the "Noisy Cricket" which is not even big enough for a hand, more like your ring finger. Is Jones being serious, absolutely, but Smith doesn't know that! I was amazed that in the script they didn't have Smith go crazy trying to understand the logic behind every reason that was given. Playing the villain, Edgar, is Vincent D'Onofrio. Really though he's not a villain, he's just one ugly bug-like alien. He's my favorite character in this film. The reason behind this is how his character is in general. The personality of Edgar is just plain rude. A rudeness where he just wants to get what he needs in a very cumbersome fashion. One of the best characteristics I like about Edgar is the way he walks. It's a very choppy walk, almost like he has ants in his pants (pardon the pun). Edgar too, has some really funny lines. And that's is just three characters! There is so much to see here, it is unbelievable. So many aliens, so many weapons, so much fun. To wrap things up, this movie does have action, but it heavily relies on science related material. So the viewer will see a lot of explosions but that's because the Men in Black always have little trinkets up their sleeves that's not done the old fashion way. It's almost like they make reference to Inspector Gadget (1999) with all the tools they have at their disposal. The difference is that none of those things come flying out of their hats or something like that. The other great thing is the music, provided by the talented Danny Elfman. The main title itself is very catchy. The music has a very science fiction tone to it, which is good, because that magnified the feeling of it.Men In Black has witty humor and great characters that can make all the scenes a blast (sometimes literally). As for the special effects, they have their own uniqueness that makes it irresistible to only see one at a time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men In Black, adapted from a relatively low-profile comic, works perfectly in almost every way.It tells of how gung-ho policeman Will Smith is recruited by cynical, weary Tommy Lee Jones to join the select band of top secret operatives who are tasked with the job of maintaining public order over the large number of aliens who, unbeknownst to the general public, live on earth.These two parts perfectly suit Smith's and Jones' screen personae, but they also enjoy sterling support from Linda Fiorentino, Rip Torn, Tony Shalhoub and, especially, Vincent D'Onofrio, not normally known for his comedy chops, in a performance which is screamingly funny.But equally impressive are the host of aliens, good, bad or just plain everyday going about their business, who populate this world. And the special effects, both physical and visual, are terrific.The film works well both as comedy and as science fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Happy Commercial Film, Maybe Too Mainstream For Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call me an elitist, or a movie snob or whatever... but when films are as big as "Men in Black" and are popular for no other reason than because they were marketed to death... I'm not going to run to my theater or video store. I think the fact it took me nine years to see this film would probably suggest that.The film stars Tommy Lee Jones as a man-in-black and Will Smith as a New York policeman who is MIB-in-training. Their boss? Rip Torn (who was outstanding in "Dodgeball"). Their mission: to save a galaxy from an insect race of aliens.Most of the film is Hollywood excitement with very little substance. Some gun blasts, explosions and alien special effects. Not that it's bad or anything, but the actual story is fairly thin and the "twist" is obvious. So this is therefore the perfect date movie, especially if you're a high school kid or trying to date one.Aside from Smith and Jones, the real credit goes to Vincent D'Onofrio in his strangest role ever. He has always played a good villain, but I doubt we'll ever see him like this again. Linda Florentino (???) was also excellent, and Tony Shalhoub was decent, though he needed a bigger part.I enjoyed the opening with the Mexicans (get it? Aliens!) sneaking into America. After that, it was all pretty much what you'd expect. Nothing memorable, nothing extremely clever. Just a fun movie, something that will be replayed on TNT for years to come. (Oh, and great product placement with the Marlboro cigarettes and New Your Post. I guess the aliens are from flavor country.) I wouldn't have watched this if I hadn't been told to, and I probably never will again. I'd rather watch "Maniac Cop 3".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best science fiction comedies in years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are the two most aptly named actors (Mr. Jones and Mr. Smith) to play the intensely secretive secret agents J and K, of the Men In Black, a secret organization that protects humankind from the threat of aliens, which are a lot closer to us than we realize. The premise of the film leaves open enormous opportunities for comic relief, and they wisely make use of this, not only with Smith's seemingly endless talents (`It just be rainin' black people in New York.') but also with the ironic humor that Jones is so good at. He has developed one of the most rigid iconographies in Hollywood, but still manages to take on a wide variety of roles in more serious movies like The Fugitive and entertaining comedies like Men In Black with equal effectiveness.As is most often the case with fantastic movies like this, the thing that makes it the most interesting and believable is that it makes itself so compatible with reality. The reason that The Matrix was so good is because it left open a lot of questions that were not immediately dismissible, which is often something that brings down even the best science fiction movies. Who is to say that what The Matrix suggests, that we are all a lot of lifepods supports by machines for their own nutrition, is not true, and that we are not really only living in a reality created and implanted into our heads? Sure, it's not very likely, but it's definitely possible, which is certainly refreshing for the science fiction genre itself, which is mostly populated with laughable tales of aliens and space ships and lazer guns and whatnot.Similar to The Matrix, Men In Black suggests that the human population is heavily infiltrated with aliens that disguise themselves as humans and have a relationship with the Men In Black not too different from that that we so often see in gang movies between the police and regular criminals. Almost a teacher/pupil relationship, the aliens treat the Men In Black as obvious authority figures despite quite often being enormously superior in size.Will Smith is able to milk his part for all it's worth as the New York police officer who is a little too good for his own good, as he rushes into the Men In Black outfit, thinking that he is such a good cop that he has seen it all and can handle anything that comes his way. There are several delightful scenes that make up his introduction to the truly weird world of the Men In Black and their duties, and it comes around full circle (as usual) with Smith taking Jones's role and inserting Jones back into the normal human race with a quick flash of the deneuralyzer.Anytime civilians are exposed to the aliens or the Men In Black in the performance of their duties, they are flashed with a deneuralyzer and new memories are inserted into their heads, keeping them safely ignorant to the things that go on around them, which seems to be the way most people in this country prefer it anyway. The gadgets in the movie are some of the most interesting things in the movie, much like just about any James Bond film. The Men In Black of course have access to some truly space-age weaponry and the cars they drive are not that special looking but have some serious accessories, making them able to handle just about any alien-emergency.This is a classy, stylish science fiction movie that sets itself apart from other science fiction movies by being believable enough so that the audience doesn't sit there and try to count the times that it parts from reality. It presents some creative aliens, plenty of amusing and exciting situations, and a variety of one-liners that makes you believe that the James Bond series has miraculously not been able to pound this precious screenwriting trick into ridiculous oblivion. Entertainment for all ages. Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the best UFO/alien movies I have ever seen. It has great acting, wonderful special effects, great cast, very funny and a lot of action. With the story, while being traditional, it adds a few twists. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are a great team. Linda Fiorentino is REALLY hot, and Vincent D'Onofrio is a great "villain". With lines like, "NYPD, means I will knock yo punk-a** down" - Will Smith and "Let me tell you something about all of your skills... as of precisely now, they mean absolutely... d**k - Tommy Lee Jones. With PLENTY of other classic funny and cool lines, this is automatically a film classic, recorded in movie history as being the highest grossing picture in the history of Columbia Pictures. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect ten is that the last line by Fiorentino is kinda pathetic. Other than that, a great movie for ALL movie-viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>based on black magic myths a movie which takes a science ficition interpretation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE REAL "men in black" are usually associated with black magic and so called white magic and tied to police or federal agent imposterism. this old wives tale legend is tied to people suing false credentials or peopel who believe they are in a secret order or unit fighting demons or aliens. During the era of the reformation and the legends of the southern united states these are likend to highway men or robbers. Many people who cling to this truth are mentally ill or are into a extreme and dangerous form of john birch occultism. This film uses the motif from the post 1947 space aliens "men in black" fable for the basis of a family science fiction film. In this film the heros are part of a alien busting super crime/off world immigration unit complete with electronic spy gimzos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Commercial Will Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following on the success of 'Independence Day', Will Smith went on to make a series of summer blockbuster films. The following year, he did 'Men in Black' with Tommy Lee Jones (who appeared in serious films with Wesley Snipes and Samuel L. Jackson) which both increased his marketing and commercial value, as well as giving credibility to the urban home boy image. It was cool to wear booggers and baggy trousers on the streets after 'Men in Black', and even more so if it was worn by men who were black. The urban black man across the globe was now a credible commodity to be seen with, and it wouldn't surprise me if there was a new phase of middle class white women forming alliances with urban black men beyond the success of this film. Apart from Smith, Tommy Lee Jones did bring some character and an added dimension to the film which was much needed in 'Independence Day'. His approach to his character portrayals made both 'US Marshalls' and 'Rules of Engagement' highly entertaining projects.</fullReview>

With all the fear and heart-stopping pace in Alien, Ridley Scott found time to deal with the cat; he even made its fate part of the suspense. So, what, is Barry Sonnenfeld in too much of a hurry to stop and let us know what happened to the cat in this light comedy? Geez.

		<fullReview>I rewatched this recently with "Ghostbusters." This did not age well, while the other did.I think the reason has something to do with how it was targeted. In projects like this, you have to decide the lever that is first, with others in support. That primary level is playing with the notion of cool. Its fairly reliable, easy to do and rich with comic possibilities. The monsters and story and all that are merely support. The problem is that coolness gets stale quickly. So while all the secondary machinery here is still working, the core that this depends on has disappeared. The interesting thing in watching this now, is wondering about what has changed. It is that 9-11 has transformed these "alien threat ? government watchdog" has ruined this topic for humor? Torture colors everything.Is it because these two actors have ruined their brand, drifted away from what we need for this?Is it because the expectations for what works is such a quickly evolving target that all the films that have mined this since have made this obsolete?Probably its all of these.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After his malefic, stereotypical performance in "Independence Day", it's a good thing that Will Smith then starred in the farce "Men in Black". Every part of this movie is just so cool, with Tommy Lee Jones as the straightforward government agent recruiting hip Smith to be his partner keeping aliens in line. It's hard to believe that it's already been nearly a decade since this movie first wowed us, but I guess that we should have seen it coming. As it was, it was thanks to "MIB" that I realized that Barry Sonnenfeld is a different person from Barry Levinson.Anyway, this is just a really neat movie. Too bad that Sonnenfeld followed it up with "Wild Wild West". Vincent D'Onofrio looks hilariously grotesque here as the alien masquerading as a human. Also starring Linda Fiorentino, Rip Torn, Tony Shalhoub and Carl Struycken (Lurch in the "Addams Family" movies, also directed by Sonnenfeld).</fullReview>

Thus each year, dozens of films with awesome special effects accompany scripts that are exceptionally unsatisfying."MIB" is one such film and I haven't bothered seeing it again and probably won't. It even made me decide to avoid going to the cinema to see Science Fiction; I am never seeing another Will Smith star-vehicle movie again. I've realised he has no talent.I strongly believe that computer technology is great for film. However, we're still finding ourselves more likely to be subjected to stuff like "MIB" than quality stories and endearing characterisations such as in "Toy Story" or quality black-comedy scifi like "Starship Troopers".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can guarantee that there will no spoilers in these comments, for there is no story to spoil. Superb special effects, very noisy soundtrack, excellent acting, a couple of cute lines and sight gags, no story at all. Normally, I would respond to so boring a movie by pressing stop and rewind after 20 minutes or so, but the visuals were so good I watched till the end. Then I was really sorry for wasting so much time. Where have all the writers gone?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything thats bad about summer blockbusters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awful money making junk aimed at kids so they can pressure parents into buying them the over priced merchandising tat. Boring and hollow, this sci fi comedy was somehow a massive hit, (nothing to do with bored Kids on their summer holidays of course!!). Apparently a sequel is in the pipeline, God help us. When will Hollywood stop serving up these dreadful plastic summer blockbusters and give us something decent to watch in the warmer months. Godzilla, Independence Day and Lost in Space etc. ? yes, this falls well into the bottom of the barrel of that category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was all the hype for?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly don't know what all the hype was for. This was a terrible movie. There was absolutely no plot; even "Twister" had a deeper story line. It is truly sad when we rely solely on special effects to entertain us. Yes it had some funny parts and some of the aliens were pretty cool, but 49 cents is all I'd pay to see this one. And of course, they're making a sequel. I can't even imagine what that'll be like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great but worth a few laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Men In Black' is a science-fiction/comedy film involving a branch of the FBI responsible for dealing with aliens on Earth (I'm sure this involves a few people that I have met over the years.). Will Smith's character falls into a position with this department of the FBI and helps to add the comical element of the film, which is annoying at times and funny at others. If you enjoy science-fiction but are not particularly into watching a serious film, then this film is enjoyable. Do not expect it to be a great film, but expect it to be one in which you can watch and laugh with and then forget about. I would not bother with the sequel as it is not very funny and rates much lower than this film, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men In Black is one of the worst films I saw in 1997. Yeah the film has some funny one-liners and a nice theme song. But I wanted action and not comedy. To me the film was billed as a action film and not a comedy. Skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I sat in the cinema watching this way back in 1997, I couldn't believe what I was watching...If it wasn't for the girl I was with, I would have left the movie almost immediately. I was very very unimpressed with this film to say the least!If you wanna see Will Smith kicking alien ass, go check Independence Day out, as its a much better film in my opinion.The humour in MIB wasn't to my liking and Will Smith has been better, same for Tommy Lee Jones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I simply must disagree with John Ulmer. I found this movie to be basically a mindless morass of stunts and special effects barely joined together by a threadbare semblance of a plot. It's a real shame to see Tommy Lee Jones underselling himself again by appearing in this. 'Nuff said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a terrible waste of celluloid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another movie that sounds far better than it is. This movie wastes both the talents of the cast and the viewers time. I don't know what Barry Sonnenfeld was thinking but it didn't come out on film. There wasn't a laugh to be found, and the action was so cartoonish that even the people who decry any violence in the media would have a hard time moaning about what was here. A very big stinkbomb of a movie. Too bad I can't rate lower than a one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Men in Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Barry Sonnenfeld (The Addams Family, Addams Family Values) this a great science fiction action comedy. Basically Agent K/Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) of a secret organisation, is in need of a new partner, and he thinks he has found it in witness of alien activity, brash NYPD detective James Edwards (Will Smith). So after some training deleting of identity and dressing, he is then part of the force monitoring extra-terrestrial on the planet Earth, the Men in Black (MIB). Meanwhile, an alien has landed near the house of Edgar (Full Metal Jacket's Vincent D'Onofrio), and his body skin stolen by an unknown creature. J and K are assigned to find this alien that is searching for a special object, called the Galaxy (because that's what's in it) on the collar of cat, Orion, who belonged to an Arquillian prince. Also starring The Last Seduction's Linda Fiorentino as Dr. Laurel Weaver and eventually Agent L (Elle), Rip Torn as Zed, Tony Shalhoub as Jack Jeebs, Forrest Gump's Siobhan Fallon as Beatrice, Edgar's Wife, Mike Nussbaum as Gentle Rosenburg the Arquillian Jeweler, David Cross as Newton the Morgue Attendant, Verne Troyer as an Alien Son and Tim Blaney as the voice of Frank the Pug. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Music for Danny Elfman, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Will Smith was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 57 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 27 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Either you love it or you hate it. K(Tommy Lee Jones) and J(Will Smith)are top-secret government agents, investigating alien visitations on Earth, who must stop an alien terrorist(Vincent D'Onofrio)from causing an intergalactic disaster. Witty and amazing insect-type aliens steal the show. F/X are superb. Also in the cast are Rip Torn, Tony Shaloub and the alluring Linda Fiorentino. Sci-Fi takes on a different look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated garbage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strike one for Will Smith (Strikes two, three, four, and five being WILD WILD WEST.) Okay, the premise isn't too hot, but it has a little potential. The actors are gold, and the director is good, but the movie falls flat on it's face. The jokes fail miserably, and thus the film goes down in flames. Will Smith has awful lines, and Tommy's deadpan doesn't work. The non-cgi effects are good, but this movie sports some of the most god-awful computer imagery in major motion picture history. The lack-luster premise, the dull performances, the poor sfx, the misfired jokes (BLANKMAN at least made me laugh at one point, this movie did not) and the unusual directing style meld together to make a big pile of c**p. Someone call Will Smith's agent, and someone get a pooper-scooper. This cinematic abomination is without a doubt the most overrated movie of all time. It would have failed at the box office had it not had Will Smith's name on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had a vaudevillian,somehow tedious yet raucous mindlessness to it so powerful,that even though the sound was up to about 90 db's in the theatre,I still managed to catch some much needed shut-eye.Because of all the ensuing buzz surrounding this film,I thought it only fair to give it another crack at a 2nd run theatre,and lo and behold,it still sucked.The broad,techno-slapstick stuff runs so empty,at least it reminded me to go get my free refill of pop up at the snack counter.I think maybe the bottom line is that Barry Sonnenfeld isn't funny,and that the film is aimed at the 7-15 year old market.Sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the worst pieces of garbage I have ever seen. I find it insulting that someone would actually consider this "sci-fi."Terrible story with bad acting, bad dialog, and bad directing. This movie is WAAAAYYYYY over rated. The only reason it did so well at the box office is because people wanted to know what it was all about. Call me psychic but somehow I just knew Men in Black 2 would be a bomb! Just like I predict Charlies Angels 2 will be a bomb.**Potential Spoiler**What was up with the cockroach thing? Did that make sense to anyone? A dead guy being guided by alien cockroaches, puleeeze. Not to mention he gains 50 times more mass than the body could hold after becoming super cockroach at the end.Just an all around terrible piece of garbage that I recommend everyone avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw MEN IN BLACK about 4 years ago and wasn`t too taken with it thinking it was just a FX laden blockbuster with a shallow script and after seeing it again earlier tonight my opinion hasn`t changed much . For a movie based upon a comic strip it felt too much like a ...eh well a comic strip . There`s no tightly plotted story , instead we`re treated to a script that seems to have been written to show off some special effects to the pop corn munching audience which is a pity because Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones do make a very good double act , the humour hits the right spot ( Sly Stallone is an alien ! ) and the effects are actually quite good - It`s just a pity the plot is vague and meandering</fullReview>
