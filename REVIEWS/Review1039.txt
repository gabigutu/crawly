		<shortDescription>A love story ~</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cast chosen are all well suited to the characters; they performed as if the story was theirs to share ~ A love story that will test the assumptions of viewers. Enjoyable, well acted, well done. A plausible plot supported by characters and settings that make plausible more than probable. Our preview audience appeared surprised at the chance to see a great cast in a simple story of love. Laughter because Harrison Ford holds a mirror to the lives of the audience, and we see ourselves. Blake Lively never gives us a hint of deviation from her assumed promise. Lots of historical fact that interests rather than bores the mind, and never obscures the journey we're following with the characters. Michiel Huisman plays innocence with persistence, grace, and a smile; we laugh and cheer him on. Ellen Burstyn plays a subtle catalyst role. Kathy Baker always seems to pull the characters together, and none of the cast can take away our interest from the science and character of Adaline. I'll see it again, in the theater for the larger than life characters. Thanks crew, staff, and actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surpassed Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Already drawn to the premise of this film, I had high expectations of it, and was particularly interested in seeing Blake Lively in the lead role as a 107 year old eternally young woman. From only seeing her work in Gossip Girl, which was adequate but not particularly memorable, I was keen to see what her acting range was like. Not only did Lively impress me, but the film did also, surpassing my expectations. The Age of Adaline is not only visually beautiful, (props to cinematographer David Lanzenberg) but the story is also. Yes, this is a romance film, but the evocative story raises questions from the viewer about life, death, and love. Michiel Huisman is great in his role as a sensitive romantic who yearns to be close to and understand Adaline - well done to the writers for creating a male romantic lead who isn't unrealistically perfect and cliché. Harrison Ford impressed me greatly, especially in his scenes with Lively, so much so that I was brought to tears through a mere look. Ellen Burstyn as Flemming provided a charming voice of reason for the protagonist. The score was also wonderfully done, making the emotional scenes all the more powerful, and the costume designer did very well in allowing the audience to fill in the time blanks without knowing the era through the narrated dates. Overall, a beautifully crafted film with a wonderful story and powerful performances that will completely captivate the viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting in this I cannot fault, though Adeline has a very low range of emotions given the material, her demure persona is a sign of the times in which she was raised. Perhaps it was the stiff upper lip if the early 20th century? I have never seen the male lead and he suited his part well.I watched this with my mother and daughters ( sobbing continued on both sides with both generations for different reasons, but both centred around loss). I felt torn, suitably watching this with both generations, as to what part of the film affected me most. Those with children and aging parents will understand when viewing this. The soundtrack was beautiful and the song played during the most emotive scenes is both beautiful and haunting enough for me to seek it out. A beautiful movie, which is a little in the fantasy realm in its explanation behind the mortality/immortality aspect which makes it almost fairy tale like, but beautifully executed, and gorgeously told. See it with your mother or daughter, or like I did, both! Take your tissues!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been looking forward to this film because of the story line. There are so many things to like about it - the flashbacks are well done and so believable. The costumes are so fun to watch. I do not think I have seen Blake Lively act before and I was clearly entranced by her performance. She carries the film so well and is so quiet and well done. I liked the actors - Michaeil Haisman is gorgeous and believable. Harrison Ford - so happy to see him in a movie again - and he is also believable as the father of Ellis. Elen Burnstyn is delightful. This story could have been presented in such a different manner - director Lee Toland Kreiger got it, and it is beautiful story-telling. I love the last scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would you want to be forever young?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No wise man ever wished to be younger." Jonathan Swift Walking into the cinema... Intrigueing is the word that comes to mind with The Age of Adaline. It is hard to categorise this film. Is it fantasy, a romance, a philosophical exercise, or a combination of them all? Overall rating: 3.5 stars Cinematic value: 3 stars Big Questions value: 4 stars What would you do if you were to remain 29 years of age for the rest of your life? Some might think that this would be ideal, while others would consider this to be a horrifying experience. This is the life of Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively). Through a series of fantastic phenomena, she has remained as a 29 year old for eight decades. She has to experience a life of solitude and separation, because she cannot age with those that she is closest to in her life. Her life is veiled in secrecy, until she meets Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman), a philanthropist who ignites her passion for life and unknowingly he is a link to her past. What seems to be an innocent weekend away, becomes a crossroads for the truth and a chance for her to decide what she will do with the rest of her life. I will admit it, a good romance is a joy to experience. Romances may not be my favourite genre, but they have their place in cinematic history. The Age of Adeline will not win awards for groundbreaking film making, but it does fill a void in this year's celluloid offerings. It is a good, straight forward, romantic journey. Even with the fantasy element of eternal youth, this was a good film for the romantic at heart. It can get a bit sappy, but it is a satisfying tale. Indie director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste and Jesse Forever) is able to incorporate a level of geekiness to satisfy any male audience members without sacrificing the primary storyline. His measured style develops a believability of this inventive story. Kreiger hearkens back to the beautiful romances of bygone eras, where subtlety and magnificent cinematography aid in delivering a beautiful romance. With the same level of measured performance, Blake Lively is excellent as the lead. She portrays the melancholy of a woman who lives with the mind of an elderly woman trapped in a perpetually young body. She allows herself to fall for Ellis, who is an old soul in a young man's body. Huisman brings a depth of character that makes this relationship right for both of them. One of the challenges of decade jumping films is the ageing of key characters, but Kreiger manages to make this element convincing. From the excellent supporting performances from Harrison Ford and Ellen Burstyn to the young actors that portrayed them in earlier decades, these characters were convincing and do not cause any distraction. Admittedly, the unfortunate component of watching this genre is the anticipation of sappiness or the inevitable tragedy. The Age of Adaline is a romance and contains some of these inevitable trappings, but due to the melancholy of the lead character and the control she has to shoulder for eight decades, this tale contains the bitter sweetness needed to move beyond the syrupy elements of many good hearted romances. Which leaves the verdict that Kreiger delivers an appealing and enjoyable romance. Before the opening sequence, this romantic adventure provides some of the best discussion points in recent cinema. In our era of desired eternal youth or the desire to merely appearing young, The Age of Adaline allows the audience to see the curse that this gift can be on anyone's life. It helps that Blake Lively is an attractive woman and manages to not experience any disfiguring accidents in her one-hundred and seven years. Which could cause a level of disbelief in the story, but does not become a consideration. Her pain seems to come from being attractive to most men, but she cannot allow herself to respond to their advances and she is only is allowed to be close with her dog, Reggie. Thoughts move from eternal youth to eternal life. Her melancholic spirit is shown in her awareness of this life that she remains trapped in. There has to be more as death occurs all around her, but she seems to be eternally trapped. She maintains a mental strength to not seek death as the answer to her pain, but death does add to the shadow that envelops her life. If that is not enough, Adaline has to lie and say farewell to all who come into her life. Her life is a moral conundrum and explains why she seems to be a shell of a woman throughout much of the film, until she is eventually allowed to tell the truth and live the life she never thought she could live. The Age of Adaline proves to be more than a romance. It is a philosophical journey packaged as this year's romance. Leaving the cinema: Is it ironic that a film of ageless beauty would be packaged in the film making style of yesteryear? This felt like a romance from the past, but will meet modern audiences with a fresh view on romance. This is a film that can bring out the romantic in anyone. It may have a sappy element, but it is satisfying and may make the date night dinner conversation deeper and more meaningful. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Would you want to be forever young? (Ecclesiastes 12:1, 2 Timothy 2:22) 2. Is an eternal soul better off being in heaven than on earth? (John 14:2, Philippians 3:20) Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent performances, a truly poignant story. See it, you won't be disappointed.Director Lee Toland Krieger wisely speeds through the scientific mumbo-jumbo, treating it as the least-interesting aspect of this tale. Instead, he focuses on the relationship fallout of Adaline's predicament. It's a disarmingly affecting film, and very sad at points. A rumination on loneliness. Cinematically, Krieger serves up numerous arching, overhead shots and slow-motion sequences. This coupled with the various time periods tackled gives the picture a buoyant sense of scope.Particularly memorable in this is Harrison Ford. After stiff and stagey efforts in movies such as "42," Ford delivers a beautifully conflicted performance as a man trying to reconcile his past.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable romantic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My initial interest in the movie wasn't very high from the previews but the offer of a free screening lead me to study the preview a little more. I decided to order the free tickets if they were still available in my area. I was blessed to get 2 tickets. I was pleasantly surprised with the film throughout and my friend enjoyed it also. I liked it so well that I plan to buy the bluray when it comes out. I like to collect nice romances for future reviewing. I initially thought a few characters didn't look much like their parents but as the movie played out it was not a problem for me. Their acting was so good I could over look that. Blake Lively did an excellent acting job in the movie. I was impressed with Harrison Ford's acting in the movie. In summary I enjoyed the movie very much. I enjoyed the clean crisp time period photography. I would consider this a good date movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie touched me personally at a number of levels, because I lived in San Francisco, "the one that got away" looked a lot like B.L. and my (very happy) marriage is like the one H.F. portrays. I found B.L. hauntingly beautiful, and this story a tapestry of feelings unfolding; especially her surrender versus flight. Her encounter with H.F. from out of her past is powerful for both characters. And I thought the resolution of her immortality was quite a pleasant surprise that made me smile after being teary-eyed most of the movie. The last few minutes of the movie are especially beautiful if you are a romantic like me. This is a sweet movie that you will really enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All these years she's lived, but she's never had a life...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Age of Adaline isn't the first movie to tackle the subject of immortality, nor will it be the last, but what it does is offer something a bit different to your typical movie about immortals. For one thing, no vampires here. For another, while most of these types of films are seen through the eyes of a male character, it's a woman by the name of Adaline Bowman (her birth name, although she goes by many others) who is the focus this time around, which allows for a unique spin on things. Time and again we've heard from broody vampires and such how much of a "curse" immortality is, but here it's applied to what is essentially a real life scenario - albeit with one slight supernatural element. It poses the question that if you were just a regular human being, except you outlived everyone, what would your life be like? Here we see that it would be a life on the run, leaving everyone you know/may get to know behind for fear of them finding out your secret or becoming a specimen in experiments. You'd never be able to settle anywhere - which is exactly Adaline's dilemma. Portraying the central character is Blake Lively, who most would know mainly from Gossip Girl, but has actually been very good in a number of films which I feel she hasn't gotten enough credit for. Dismissing her based on her role in the show (or Green Lantern) would be doing her quite the disservice, as she has shown that she is capable of much more than those two roles allowed her. Apart from having a classical look that allows her to fit the different eras her character lives through and makes her physically perfect for the role, she also conveys an old soul inside a body that's forever youthful. The character of Adaline dresses, wears her hair and speaks like someone from a different time, but it's Lively who makes this believable. She feels like someone who has become tired of running and having to give up the life she wants because of something she never asked for. She requires new fake IDs from Tony (Richard Harmon - who seems to be in *everything* I watch nowadays), her constant companion is a King Charles Spaniel (who does the cutest little slide EVER), and apart from having the time to learn braille and many different languages, there seems to be very few upsides to her situation. Thanks to a rather intrusive - and, quite frankly, unnecessary - voice-over, we learn that Adaline's first husband died - which is rather sped through via narration so we can get to what caused her condition - namely that, like cough syrup is to the Flaming Moe in The Simpsons, the secret ingredient here is...car accident + electricity (combined with snowfall, apparently). We experience first-hand what it's like to be in a car accident as she's driving, which is a very effective way of having it play out.Adaline's daughter, Flemming (played as a young woman by Cate Richardson, and then later/for the bulk of the movie by Ellen Burstyn), is the only person in her mother's life to know her secret. Their exchanges are quite entertaining but at the same time very emotional, as is Adaline's close friendship with her dog. Let no one ever accuse Blake Lively of not being able to generate emotion, as her scenes with her best friend certainly require a tissue/hankie/snot-rag handy. One day she catches the eye of Ellis (Michiel Huisman, from Game of Thrones and Orphan Black) when he sees her reading braille (but knows she's not actually blind). The two develop a nice chemistry when he pursues her in an elevator on New Year's Eve. For the most most, Ellis is likable enough (though does walk that fine line between persistent and stalker). We see why she tries to keep her distance via flashback to meeting a young man named William (Anthony Ingruber) - who, it turns out, happens to be Ellis' father in the present (Harrison Ford, in one of his less gruff/grumpy roles of recent memory). The resemblance between the two actors playing William in different stages of his life is uncanny, and kudos to the younger for being able to mimic the older's facial expressions and voice. We also meet the rest of Ellis' family, who soon realise something is up with the new girl he's brought home thanks to William's reaction to her. Despite trying to throw him off, he - like his son - is persistent and Adaline has to come to terms with whether she will stay or reluctantly do what she's always done: run away. It's to Lively's credit that the character's actions/motivations remain clear and she never comes across as a bad person for what she does. The costumes, sets and everything that goes into bringing the past eras to life is done with precise detail. The score is effective but subtle, much like the humour. It's not in-your-face, but there are a few laughs to be had sprinkled throughout which lighten the mood and prevent proceedings from becoming too gloomy. If there's any negatives to the movie, it's firstly the rather annoying voice-over. Yes, it's there to help explain things, but I think we could have figured it out for ourselves/drawn own conclusions. Secondly, the attempt to explain what in one breath is described as "magical" and in the next is a bunch of science babble seems rather contradictory. Not only will most probably tune out during the attempt to explain the pseudoscience involved, but it feels somewhat out of place here. There's no need for it, it's not going to make the concept any more believable. They could've just left the premise as it was, asked us to suspend disbelief and I'm sure most would've gladly done so. Still, I enjoyed this throwback to the earlier era style of Hollywood movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute Love Story Detracted By Hasty Developed Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever wonder what its like not to age? I know I have, but I never can grasp all the factors that come about with immortality, especially in terms of love and relationships. Well my friends, we have the good fortune to get movies to give us a glimpse, and this weekend it is in the form of the Age of Adaline. This romantic drama has some potential to be an interesting romance story, but one must heed caution when watching trailers. So let's get started on this review shall we. When I said interesting, I really meant it, as Age of Adaline is a unique story that centers on immortality. Our heroine doesn't drink some mystical potion, or undergoes some futuristic operation, but is somehow mutated by a rogue lightning bolt striking the river. All of this is explained in the first 10 minutes, in a hasty montage that sums up her life, which while time efficient left me a little robbed. I didn't want them to take forever, but a gradual build up of her life pre accident would have given this tale some more depth. Oh well it means we get to the romance aspect of the story faster. This film's relationships were a bit awkward for me, and a bit hastily developed at first. Her main romance goes nowhere due to fear, and only a few cute dates give us any hope something will happen. But then movie magic hits like lightning and expedites the romance to warp speed. Regardless of how fast we get to it though, the romance in this movie is not the greatest. Sure it has its cute moments, emphasizing creativity and thoughtfulness in dating, with a little historical twist in it. There is some heartfelt, overemotional dialogue thrown in to feign love, but this movie didn't sell me in their relationship. However, Adaline's past runs interference into the relationship, and takes precedence over her life at hand. Fortunately what love we did see was not portrayed as superficial sex that many modern movies like to show. The movie's main focus instead is about living life and pushing past your fears, especially ones addressing the concept of life. Age of Adaline has some really depressing moments and left me feeling down in the dumps. Many of the problems she flees from may get in your head, but do provide some good food for thought and philosophical discussions. Yet you will see some overdramatic, spanned out plot lines in this movie that start to grow stale. Story aside, the editing of this movie is decent. Despite the 100 minute running tme, they still had some issues in terms of pacing and extra scenes. I felt the film cuts through a lot of Adaline's history, choosing to relive her moments via hastily done flashbacks and narrator monologues. Other times it drags on an issue, moving like molasses down a hill to get to the conclusion. As for extra scenes, well a few morbid parts could have been snipped out of the final cut, or at least replaced with some happier moments in the grand scheme of things. Despite all the extra fluff, one consistency is the camera work, which captures the emotion of our characters to illicit the intended response. Each age is well designed, makeup, costumes, and scenery all well combined to bring the world to life. However the acting may be the component that this movie relies on the most. Blake Lovely, I'm sorry, Lively was indeed a beautiful addition to this movie in both acting and physical qualities. She carried a pristine poise that mimicked the personalities of the attitudes back then, and yet she was somehow humble. Lively shed a good amount of tears in this installment and put her somber emotions to good use, though I do wish they had given her character a broader emotional spectrum. Her beauty helps complete the picture and the outfits her wardrobe department designed will distract many from her monotone character. As for the other actors they do their parts well, but they are primarily supportive roles surrounding Adaline's story. Michiel Huisman does the job of a persistent romantic well. He's got that nice guys charm and humor that makes him likable, but he is a bit of a bore in terms of romantic interests. His backstory is flatter than a sheet of paper, and his struggles are practically absent in this tale, overshadowed by another relationship stuck in Adaline's head. As for Ford, his acting is just as strong as ever, but his role was limited in this tale, again constantly interrupted by chaotic slew of Adaline's mess. Age of Adaline is a good drama that has a nice change of pace from the sea of mundane plots this genre has recently taken. Adaline's journey is interesting and emotional, but the romance aspect fell through for me. In addition the tale wasn't the most exciting thing, and combined with a depressing plot, was not a fun trip for me this weekend. Is it worth a trip to theater? Can't say it was, but might be good for a girl's night out soiree. My scores for Age of Adaline are: Drama/Romance: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor written love story with boring characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning the movie seemed quite interesting, but then the plot happened. It's not that i expected the most beautiful love story of all time, but at least something decent. The "scientific explanation" was silly and unnecessary. I mean lightning- how original, nobody ever explained super powers with lightning. A magical potion or door would have been more believable. Then- the police officer who calls the FBI immediately, just because a 45 year old women looks like 30-35?! I mean come on.. It's not like she was 70 at the time. Even without plastic surgery, there are people who look younger. And even then, nobody thought, that it could be a typo or something? Then, the love story with the long- hair- guy. It's just stupid. I can't even say it's clishee, because clishee would have been better. They tried to make the characters seem interesting and their dates so original, but the lack of chemistry, emotions and a normal human conversation made those scenes look completely implausible. I would rather see them go to a date to a fast food restaurant and talk about politics and the weather than this. What do we know about the guy? He's a stalker, he likes unusual girls, because- omg, she's reading braille and isn't blind, that's so cool! And he's rich, of course. His lines to hit on her were like he found them by googling "interesting facts to say on a date". It seemed like they didn't talk about anything personal, anyone's life, world views, likes and dislikes, but about random knowledge you find at the end of the newspaper. And she..after living for such a long time, it would be nice to see, not just how much random stuff she learned, but to see her wisdom or the typical old people's grumpiness, but no. She acts like she's 20 and just started her life and didn't figure out how to live with someone- not because she will loose him, but because the FBI scared her with their unsuccessful one time visit. And after a week or a month she loves the stalker guy?! The love story with her father was way better and had some real potential. I mean the guy named a comet after her! If that's not romantic..no. I would have rather seen her run away with him. But the young looking pretty girl can't ditch the young pretty guy for an old guy. And then, the electricity undoing her super power just because electricity is magical- what to say?! The last scene was hilarious- the narrator really had to explain to us, that a grey hair means she's getting old :D Just in case stupid people won't get how brilliant the movie really is. As far as the lines and chemistry goes, the narrator could have talked through the whole movie and explain to us how they loved each other and how touching everything is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(First of all, let me add that there is a minor plot-spoiler in this review, which I have left 'til the penultimate paragraph: I point that out since I normally try to avoid spoilers in my reviews, but this was a significant (but personal) contributor to the overall enjoyment of the film).The Age of Adaline tells the bizarre and very much untrue story of Adaline Bowman ("Gossip Girl's" Blake Lively) who after a freak and catastrophic car crash emerges with a body that never ages (and presumably as a result) has immortality). "Great!..." (you might think) "?where do I sign?". But the obvious blessings of looking in your late 20's (and being a bit of a looker to start with) has a darker side: being regarded as a freak; being constantly pursued by 'government men' in dark suits wanting to prod and probe you; having to shift from place to place under multiple aliases to keep your secret; not being able to maintain a relationship for more than a year or so; and having children that call you "mom" when they look like your granny.Having dodged the bullet of love nearly all her life, Adaline eventually succumbs to the winsome charms of Ellis Jones (great name) played by Michiel Huisman ("World War Z" and now in "Game of Thrones").Things come to a dramatic head when Ellis takes her home to meet his parents William and Flemming (played by Harrison Ford and Ellen Burstyn).On the plus side, Blake Lively actually does a star turn in the film and is by far the best thing in it. With a string of past "B"-movies to her name, I would like to see her starring in a vehicle that is worthy of her talents.It's also great to see Harrison Ford pre- this year's Star Wars smash, and also great to see the hard-working Ellen Burnstyn ("Interstellar"; "W"; "Same Time Next Year") back on the screen. Also, I must call-out the impersonation talents of Anthony Ingruber, who does the best young Harrison Ford impersonation imaginable (see at 1:26 in the trailer): if they ever wanted to remake "Hanover Street", the first call should go out to Anthony! Whilst the undemanding love story that weaves its way through the film will appeal to a Sunday-afternoon audience that wants to curl up on a sofa and watch a 'slushy DVD' on a rainy afternoon, this is fundamentally a very silly story, laced as it is with cod-science and coincidence.... although I guess this is no more so than similar films such as "Forever Young", "The Time Traveller's Wife" or "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button". You actually have to admire the cojones of the screenwriters (J. Mills Goodloe and Salvador Paskowitz) for the 'science' behind the key event: basically they say "don't worry about how this happened, because the reason behind it won't be discovered for another 20 years"! (i.e. "YOUR NOT QUALIFIED DEAR!!").Where I have more objection with the film is in its sonorous and self-important narration, of the "Desperate Housewives" variety, which drones on and on at you when pictorial hints and clues would have provided more than enough to allow the intelligent viewer to pin the story together themselves. The narration blissfully disappears through all the middle part of the film, but then pops up again at the end (I audibly groaned in my seat) to destroy the mood.In many places the story is paint-by-numbers stuff, and you just KNOW what's going to happen way before it actually does. Whilst I have to admit that a key meeting in the film was well done and generated goose-bumps when it happened, elsewhere there is a mass of unnecessary exposition that obstructs and frustrates. And having suspended your belief once with the car crash at the beginning of the film, it is again called on (in spades) for the finale to allow the story to be rounded out. (No spoilers, but I would have preferred to flash forwards 300 years to see Adaline as a crazy-eyed 20-something woman in a mental institution: but then, I am just a heartless brute!).And so to that *spoiler*, which might not affect everyone but left my wife distraught for most of the second half of the film. If you had a Cavalier King Charles (as Adaline does) and if it had trouble eating (due to kidney failure) and if you had to then take it on a 'last trip' to the vet, then let's just say that this is perhaps not the film for you! In summary, an undemanding love story if you can suspend your disbelief sufficiently - - personal canine trauma aside, if you liked "The Time Traveller's Wife" you will probably warm to this.(If you enjoyed this review, please see the graphical version at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to receive future reviews.

		<shortDescription>A stunning storyline!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely stunning in every way! Blake Lively does a fantastic job of portraying the main character with how she talks, her body language, her responses to things/situations while also having a slight essence of a modern woman as well. How it would feel if a person had to go through life, constantly lying to people she cared about, not getting too close to people, running away from relationships, seeing her own Daughter grow older. Basically never being able to fully enjoy her life, just existing! I've watched Blake Lively in other movies, TV shows and I have to say her performance in this role is by far her best. I was totally fascinated by this storyline, especially with the flashbacks (anyone who's a lover of history will enjoy that part) and although it has been criticized that it had narration, I actually thought that was a good idea-the narration part is what helped viewers understand her life, otherwise we'd be guessing and drawing our own conclusions or wondering. Most of us go through life, occasionally wishing for some years back...this movie does a great job at getting it across that it would not necessarily be better to go through life, never ageing. All the people you care about that would outlive you, it would be heartbreaking and is ultimately no life to live, if you can never get close to anyone. It is far better to live a life that can be fully enjoyed and appreciated, without ever having to hold back...and of course to grow old with the ones you love. Michiel Huisman also played his part very well too, the part where he just accepts the news near the end is as it should be from someone who truly loves a person, accept them for who they are. In all honesty, I cannot fault this movie in any way, brilliant storyline, amazing cast and a perfect ending! All in all, very touching and heartwarming 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh so predictable !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of reviewers seem to have found some meaning, purpose, and message in the story. To me it flat lined right after the first auto accident and read like a low end novel. The characters never seem solid or fully developed, Adaline's background is just suggested in flashbacks, and the majority of the story takes place in the here and now. And then every major turn in her life is so predictable you want to just laugh when it happens.But I watch and after the first hour I decided to just finish the movie as I had invested one hour into it. If anyone wants a hint on how to enjoy this movie here is what I suggest: Start the movie at the one hour mark and you'll be better off as after the first hour you'll know exactly whats going on and you won't have to suffer the first hour. Does that make sense?The production is lavish, it's beautifully photographed, and nicely edited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great idea, LOUSY execution...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were a young woman called Adaline and had eternal life, would you give it all up for 'twue lurve'? The answer would be a resounding 'NO' from my quarters, but what with it being a sappy dappy romance, I think you know what answer you can expect from this increasingly dreary piece of corn.It doesn't help that the guy who you sacrifice an infinite existence for is a bearded part-time artist who stalks you EVERYWHERE, and his defining feature is his non-stop niceness. In other words, NOT a person, just a conglomerate of what Hollywood' screen writers think is the 'perfect man'. No quirks or surprises here... We've created... FRANKENHUNK!! I've seen this type of bland-beyond-belief Mr-Perfect in FAR too many films... And the next one I spot where I get even a whiff of such a character, the movie goes off. Along with my foot through the screen (hey, I can afford it).In terms of how she ended up in this state, there was an incident involving a car crash at night, a lot of water and a lightning bolt. Not important. What IS is the fact you were born in 1908, and you start to look just as old as your daughter as she grows up... But you don't. So, here's the plan: You change your identity every ten years, move to a new state, sever all ties from the last decade, and repeat. Better than ending up as a lab experiment, I'm sure you agree.Until, she meets HIM at a party. You know it's HIM because the action slows down as everyone else blurs into the background, and a cheesy ballad is heard. His actions, which involve following you around everywhere, refusing to take no for an answer, obtaining your home address illegally and making HORRIBLE looking dinners, eventually break down your emotional barriers, and you end up falling head over heels for this Weirdo.Can I just state for the record that I'm fed up with being told borderline psychopaths and dull-as-ditchwater characters in media are somehow 'charming' and 'desirable'. Not to mention, people in movies acting completely contrary to the way I would in real life (and all other sane viewers) so the next time I have to suffer through one or the other, my television goes out of the window (as you can tell, I get through a LOT of TV's). Meanwhile, around an hour of cutesy poo romantic nonsense ensues.Things FINALLY pick up again when 'the loving couple' visits The Weirdo's family, and Adaline is remembered by a cameoing Harrison Ford, playing the Weirdo's father, who had a fling with her around the Second World War. Only problem is... He's aged, and she hasn't. Hmm. The scenes where he realises the truth about her, and his heart-to-heart talk with the panicked girl are the best bits of the movie. Why couldn't we have had more interaction with these two instead of... Well, almost everything else?Alas, the good stuff can't last... there's a car chase in the rain, a serious accident, a teeth rotting declaration of love, and a saw-it-from-a-mile-away twist ending. HOW DARE they take such an interesting concept and balls it up in such a momentous way. HOW DARE they have such a fascinating lead actress, and pair her up with the human equivalent of a freshly painted park seat. And HOW DARE they waste 110 minutes of so many people's lives.We haven't all got as much time as Adaline, ya know. So do yourself a favour, and skip this unholy mix of genericity, mediocrity and (most of all) wasted potential... 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story sounds interesting ? but bear in mind it is not. It's a sh*t but the beauty of the protagonist made it a good sh*t. How do they fall in love? a 100 year old person is THAT easy to be moved? Assume she is, how is it possible to remain calm and peace when found out the father of whom she is dating to is the guy with whom she had a close relationship and who even attempted to propose.She just revealed her identity so easily without hesitation. The only evidence the father had is the scar, and he didn't even have the photo of the scar. All he know is Adaline had a scar on her hand! I was thinking he is finding something to perform a blood test or something more convincing. But as a 100 year old women, she gave in so quickly without any attempt to make further excuse.In addition, director tried to make it scientific by describing the process of becoming unconscious and approaching death. But the explanation of how she stop aging ruined the effort: unaging by electric shock is by far the most ridiculous explanation I even heard. Consider agents of shield an example of how to explain the impossibles: quantum bridge for teleport and vibrates with interior rate sounds a lot more convincing All in all, if you ask me one story I got from this movie, that's WATCH THE ROAD AND SLOW DOWN WHEN YOU CANNOT SEE CLEAR</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I went to this movie with no expectations. The first two minutes seems interesting. Adaline seems like she is going to use her years of living to provide some wisdom to the young man making her IDs. Then it takes a nose dive from there. For someone that has lived 107 years, she never truly experienced loss. Of course she loses her first husband but you see that in a brief flashback that had an unnecessary narration added to it. Then you meet the creepy stalker type Ellis. Not only can the actor not give a believable performance, but there was absolutely no chemistry between the two main characters. Another flashback happens to the 1960s and we find out that Adaline loved someone else and I thought well maybe that's what they are building too that she is still holding on to that love. Spoiler, No that's not the case. I was really disappointed with Harrison Ford's performance also. The whole movie reminded me of bad SyFy flick that is aired on a Saturday afternoon. Save yourself some money because you won't lose yourself in any performance of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*minor spoiler regarding the introduction of the movie*I wouldn't consider myself to be the target audience for this "epic love drama", and had heard about it but never had any intentions of viewing it. My sister watched it, and loved it. Of course she would, she loves these kinds of films and books. She told mum about it and then me and dad, I thought it wouldn't hurt to step away from Game of Thrones for one night to sit in with the family and watch this romance movie. From the start, it had a good intro. The narrator had the perfect voice. The cinematography and score was excellent, but I wasn't quite gripped yet. Her apparent death at the start and rebirth into life with plausible scientific explanation (which is quite rare in movies nowadays) allowed me to believe this story and delve into it.It takes a while to get kick-started from then on, but once it gets good, it gets real good. The story, the characters, the direction, the dialogue and the connection between Blake Lively and Michiel Huisman (who I instantly recognised from Game of Thrones) is amazing, and feels real. The scene with her dog's euthanasia I can relate and feel sorry for her. As the love evolves and the story unfolds, even more complicated than before, I felt more and more absorbed and willing to see the end of the movie. Ultimately, I'm happy I watched this even though it wasn't on my movie bucket list. A surprising entry into my liked movie list. I would recommend this film to my friends and other family members, even if romance isn't their thing. Because it sure ain't mine, and here I am giving this movie a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reason for why I gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because I find the movie so amazing that I felt the ending didn't satisfy me enough. I had to see more. I want to know how the life of Adaline would have turned out even later in the future. I have read many reviews where people complain that Blake's character was too emotionless. Let me reassure you that that isn't the case. You have to keep in mind that Adaline is 107 years old and at that age, even though you have the body of a 25 year old, you learn to contain your excitement. Adaline was born in the 1900's where discipline was strong and parents were severe, therefor off-springs grew up to be very well behaved compared to the young people of our current generation. Which is why I come back to my point which is that Adaline is not emotionless, she is well mannered and sophisticated. A lady simply behaves that way.Anyways, I fully enjoyed this movie with tears in my eyes and I recommend it to everybody.</fullReview>

The love story still lives on and this movie underscored the fulfillment of a life worth living and the thrill of rekindling love, a powerful human desire.I kept looking at that "familiar" face, Adaline's daughter, who turned out to be Ellen Burstyn. Who woulda thunk it after all these years, still having images of youthful beauty develop into aging gracefully? And, still acting.The ending was grand.

		<shortDescription>No spoiler review - One of the best of 2015</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note : of course I didn't see every movie of 2015, but from what I've seen... This is in my top 3 if not the best I've seen. Of course : you have to like a certain genre to like this. But this is kinda everything, If you like anything you probably would like this movie. But, an issue of course is... It is more one thing than another. It is mainly a romance. But, I feel it has something for everyone. It is SORT OF a thriller. (The whole concept is very creepy. Very intense.) drama (well, it IS a romance, and in every romance there is bound to be drama), a sci-fi (see : the plot. Plus, a lot of space info. As one of the mains is an astronomer), and basically everything. It is appropriate for all ages (maybe not 11 and under. It is kinda intense for some 12 year old kids, but it's okay for teenagers I'd say.) But, I can stress enough that THIS IS MORE OF A ROMANCE, if you don't like romance AT ALL, don't see it. Like, if you can't tolerate then. I WILL say it is for everyone, but I also have to say IT IS A ROMANTIC movie. It is basically like a Nicholas Sparks movie, with a HUGEEE twist. It isn't a TYPICAL Nicholas Sparks movie, I'll say. It has great acting, a great plot, a great script, I only gave it a 9 because it is a TAD BIT predictable around the ending. I won't spoil, but if you like to be surprised, the ending will disappoint. But still... This movie will be good for you unless you like surprises and hate romance. OVERALL. ; Acting - 9/10 *cant complain. Really great. Plot - 10/10 Script - 9/10 *again, very romantic. 2 great love stories (3 if you count one they didn't focus on AT ALL) Ending - 9/10 *besides the predictability it was great.* Overall - 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not fond of fantasies--which seem to be all the rage in film these days, but this one is different, because aside from the eternal-life premise, the rest is very believable. Two romances are intertwined artistically and the acting is very good.An acquaintance had the same reaction I did--where is Harrison Ford? And when he appears, you will be pleasantly surprised.I was also pleasantly surprised that there was little or no profanity or gratuitous nudity and sex, proving that good movies can be made without those inclusions that so many producers these days seem to feel is necessary, and add nothing to the story, and actually turn some of us off. Maybe they are finally getting the message.While the premise is "out-of-this-world," the love stories are down-to-earth, and something all of us (hopefully) can relate to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, Intriguing film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film a week after release, after seeing the trailer on the TV. I thought it looked like an interesting plot, holding a mesmerizing love story. And thats exactly what it was. This film, draws you in, making links between the past and present. It was put together with great thought. I expected it to be too unrealistic, yet the narrator explains the phenomenon as if it has happened many times before, giving a fairly believable explanation, causing doubt in the watcher, as if it could actually happen. My only problem with this film is that, the love story, although cute, just it not believable. They go on about two dates and suddenly, she's doubting everything she ever thought and believed in, resulting in her revealing everything to him. However, this film was intriguing, unusual and completely draws in all your emotions, also, maybe bring some hankies (my friend was totally broken down, crying an one scene in particular).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is romantic fantasy, it's upbeat nature and theme reminds of It's A Wonderful Life, although this is more a case of an unfulfilled never-ending life. It's gentle, well-acted and enjoyable. It's a tad old-fashioned, but that adds to its charm. It's the sort of film you could happily watch again, especially if you like fundamentally positive themes. Blake Lively is excellent. Its method of using a 'newsreel narrator' to explain the story is contrived and its least effective element, but then a method to explain it all had to be found somehow. Overall good fun; you engage with the characters, and it leaves you thoughtful about the issues raised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Way to Escape The Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What would your life be like if you knew it would never end? People have yearned for eternal life forever and fear death because it means the end to something. In "Adelaine" the question is posed to see what one could expect if you had no option but keep going and going, leaving behind people and things you treasure, trying to find the best in what life offers, and reinventing ways to give logical meaning to one's existence.Our Adelaine is special from the beginning. She is born as a new year is born, marries, has a child and loses her husband too early, as if this foreshadows her future experiences. One night, a cosmic combination of science and luck transforms her into a person who is guaranteed eternal life. It's an interesting twist, but is it the best one for her. As we soon realize, she must change her lifestyle and abandon her loved ones. Her new "lives" takes her all over the world, as her spirit keeps her going, and she comes to realize that it is going to be pretty lonely for her as there is no other one like her, and as if that is not enough trouble, finding company is not an easy proposition for regular folks.Adelaine eventually meets the love of her life and makes a decision that will have interesting repercussions. As she begins a new phase and meets her boyfriend's parents, she's about to confront her past again and take steps to find a final solution to her dilemma. Will she face reality or will she continue creating lies in order to survive?"Adelaine" is a thoughtful film, exploring the best and worst moments in life and the relationships that give it meaning. Being in a special situation might not be the best deal. Also, there are more ways to die and kill yourself that facing physical death. It's a fantasy that feels real because it relates to us, to our dreams, and the meaning of happiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable dramatic romance with a measure of Nicholas Sparks to keep it from being better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Egads! I'm reluctant to tell you I enjoyed The Age of Adeline, a dramatic romance that reeks of Nicholas Sparks except when it doesn't. Adaline (Blake Lively) is 29 years old forever due to a freak occurrence of nature. As poets have always predicted, such a blessing has some regret as the ones she loves pass away and as she dare not commit to anyone because of her curse.Much of this fantasy depends on the sentimental lingering of Adaline as she reviews her more than century of life without permanent love. Where I found a core of true humanity without sentimentality is in the latter half of the film as Adaline faces committing to an attractive, intelligent, and charitable philanthropist, Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman). Once again she faces the urge to leave because of her curse, but he and his family, notably the excellent Harrison Ford as his father, William, make her pause to consider letting go of her agelessness.And so must we pause to consider how poets like Browning opined that the gods were jealous of mankind because of our ability to love and suffer, at, of course, the cost of our lives. But then Jesus Christ chose the imperfect route to redeem our sins. Not a bad reason yet it still holds the pain of death. This film at least makes us consider whether or not we would wish to live like Adeline, constantly running from reality unable to hold anyone but her aging daughter, Flemming (always excellent Ellen Burstyn), and Adaline's dog. Watch out for Harrison Ford's best performance ever as a father caught in the web of time and a Trivial Pursuit game that shows us all how it should be played.Realists might better stay home than face the usual romantic absurdities like how the substantial Ellis could so quickly fall in love with Adaline (called Jenny at this time in her life) or how the sentimental ending could have sunk a less intelligent film. Yet, the Twilight Zone could have produced such a fantasy, and I never complained about Rod Serling's manipulations.While at the end the film gives in to sap of the usual romance kind, it regularly rises above the trite to tackle the eternal puzzle of life, love, and romance. Besides, who doesn't want to consider embracing the joys of aging, wrinkles and death?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, it's a love story only. Anyone hoping for a little bit of an interesting twist on the 'living forever' aspect will be disappointed. They didn't even try to make that part interesting. I don't even consider this a spoiler because it's so lame - it was just a random lightning strike. So she doesn't age....and in 70 years or so she just becomes preposterously intelligent and experienced in everything. So basically she's the 'perfect' woman....but she runs away from every relationship because she fears being 'found out'. The flatness of the character, combined with this story, failed to draw me in. It's fine that the movie was solely a love story. But it's overrated. My guess is that it will end-up at around a 6.2 rating when it's all said and done. When more people see it on rentals and stuff. It was okay. Everyone saying how great Harrison Ford was....he was alright, but nothing special. Yes that was the best part of the movie....but only because the rest of it was rather dull. The movie got somewhat interesting with about 30 minutes to go.The main character, Adaline, was flat. Quite dull. Her love-interest was a very nice guy; I guess he was okay. There were no tear-jerk moments. Definitely nothing I haven't seen before a dozen times. I guess it's a standard average love-story that is watchable on a rainy day. But don't go in expecting much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I wasn't really intrigued with the outline of the story so it was not my first choice to watch. The unrealistic plot of a woman not aging didn't appeal to me. So I was pleasantly surprised at how the movie started, the beautiful narrators voice in the beginning and especially Blake Lively mastering classic American silhouette when knocking on the door of a young man who has new papers for her. Beautiful! I do not know who coached Lively in her very stylish performance, but it was such a joy to watch. The New Years lunch with her daughter Flemming was done absolutely awesome. Although the age of mother and daughter was reversed, it was absolutely stunning to watch Lively rocking a classic, perfectly groomed look that wouldn't have been so out of place in the 1930s, mothering over her daughter, almost admonishing her how to hold her cutlery properly ... amazing, stunning and absolute perfection. The love story however lacked some intensity and left some questions open in the end. Heartbreaking was the anniversary speech of Ellis father. Truth or etiquette?Anyway, a surprisingly elegant and beautiful movie perfect for a date night with much to talk about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lovely film on how love is ageless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie The Age of Adaline is a good film overall. It is about A woman Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively) who becomes fundamentally ageless around the end of the 19th century due to a horrific incident. The casting was spot on and Blake Lively not only showed her acting abilities in this role, but also her potential I believe she could grow into a huge Hollywood actress with a big role. Harrison Ford had an enjoyable role as the father of In the movie I really enjoyed the decision director Lee Toland Kreiger made of having narration in the film which provided us with every statistic necessary this gave us points which you could argue weren't pertinent but they were good reminders of where we are up to in the plot. I also enjoyed the little twist with how Harrison Ford's character William having been a previous lover of Adaline's, decades before she met his son's character Ellis. Adaline were once lovers when William was a young man and he was ready to propose, but reluctantly Adaline stood him up to save him of distress. The director managed to make us feel sympathy for William's character, since he had to let his long lost love Adaline go for his son.Having said this what I disliked was how when all is revealed that Adaline hadn't aged for generations and Harrison Ford's character asked his son how did he know he loved Adaline he said: "because it doesn't feel right without her". To me personally that wasn't a strong enough reason for why a man, who has loved this woman for decades and thought he had lost her, should sacrifice her. I also didn't like the fact that for Adaline to continue to age all it took was one measly shock from a defibrillator, because the reason she stopped ageing was because she was strook by lightning. A defibrillator in no way can equal to the voltage of a lightning bolt. Another problem I had was that the ending seemed rushed all we saw was Adaline losing a strand of hair and it ended shortly after. I would have appreciated if the director could have let some more time pass and we see her die. I know a little bit gritty but that would be a happy ending for Adaline.Overall I feel this was a great film and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a dramatic romance film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Romantic story in time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 'Age of Adaline' movie is as sweet romantic story of Adaline Bowman who stops aging after a life threatening accident making her immortal to the ravages of time but not invincible.The storyline is not very strong but you might enjoy it once you start feeling it.Over the years, Adaline changed her name and place to survive but also came into contact with (as we see in the movie) at least two men where we can see true heart-throbbing romance. But she couldn't bear the pain of not being able to enjoy her life with her partner and has to leave them. The story goes that a young man Ellie falls for Jenny(Adaline) and so does she. One day when both of then goes to Ellie's house, Jenny meets Ellie's father(Harrison Ford) who confronts her as Adaline Bowman and the rest is play of how both Ellie and Adaline finally meet and the curse over Adaline is lifted.The characters were beautiful and well portrayed. Not much of action in the movie but even with this beautiful storyline there was some creepiness in the story. Adaline's daughter was more aged than her and even after suffering for over a century she never once gives up.If you feel O.k, you will not find this movie boring and would not even care for the direction, music, cast, acting etc.. Just simply amused by the events. The cast was fabulous accept the younger version of Harrison Ford who overacted and Blake Lively's speech which was overly polite and indigestible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than you typical romantic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was one of the surprise hit of this spring, a surprise? I'm not sure so sure. From the day I saw the first footage I knew that this Lee Toland Krieger directed film had the potential to be special. The cast among which Harrison Ford, Kathy Baker, Ellen Burstyn &amp; Michiel Huisman helped in raising the bar of the level of acting to be expected. I know didn't mention Blake Lively but if I'm honest her name did little to peak my interest in this film.Despite the fact that The Age of Adaline sounds like a syrupy romantic movie, it has its charms. The film is a straight up romance but it has all these interesting elements, such as the fantasy of eternal youth, the "science" behind her condition, but also the philosophical questions this movie conjures up that makes it a good cinematic experience. The film is so subtle and measured that the story is easy to believe and get into. Blake Lively may not have been a draw for me but she did a hell of good job in portraying the young-looking old woman that is Adaline. Ellen Burstyn &amp; Harrison Ford were, as expected, totally convincing in their roles. I bought their relationship to Adaline in the film, I did not question it I just reveled in the beauty of their performances. Michiel Huisman is steadily coming up in this world and this another performance that will bring him on step closer to become the A-lister he could be.The story and the performances in the film made it a remarkable film but cinematography &amp; the production design really helped the movie. It gave the movie a timeless aspect, as if it was made a few years back while looking fresh and brand new. It was subtle yet noticeable, in other word they did an amazing job.The Age of Adaline is more than your average romance, it makes you dream, question but more importantly it entertains.

		<shortDescription>A beautiful glimpse into eternity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Age of Adaline if not great, is a good movie that skims romance gorgeously. The concept though a mere fantasy is brought to life with a scientific outlook and a background narration that doesn't properly explore the how. The theme of the movie is romance and it tries to stay on it with Lee Toland Krieger's beautiful direction. The drama is great to watch owing to exceptional performances packed in by Harrison Ford and Blake Lively.In the beginning things are a little mediocre, with the far-fetched concept and the narration that often returns at unwanted moments, where the director tries to show the past through a black and white film Adaline is looking at and tries to milk the resemblance. However, it becomes an exercise in futility and you wish the narration to just stop as it skims unnecessarily into the diegetic territory. But soon the story resumes its right course with the introduction of Ellis Jones played by Michiel Huisman. The spark that he brings with him complements Adaline well and the story gallops into something from nothing.The moment Harrison Ford is introduced into the story the flick's luster refurbishes itself completely. Melodrama becomes grave and the tale becomes a tad dark. However, it soon gets wobbled up by mediocrity once again and Fordism disappears eventually.What stops this movie from being great is its screenplay. There aren't many lines that explore profundity. Also, unlike David Fincher's dark aftermath, this movie doesn't explore the many phases of time. There is so much poetry to a woman that cannot age, and all goes to waste since Krieger was too busy exploring romance, and fails to milk the concept enough. What could have been a literally orgastic flick drenched in poetry, dies down into a bleak love story confined to a woman quandary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I'm the romantic type, it would be hard for me to keep being objective. I will also avoid peeling some onions to not make this any harder.Of course it's not the first time a movie is focused on the forever young theme. It's actually becoming redundant and to be frank not always beautifully used as it should be.But Adaline is a good exception and this beautiful story will let you shed some tears and give you a warm feeling that life has many beautiful things to offer so we have to enjoy every opportunity given to our eyes. Of course it's not as powerful as Titanic or Gone with the Wind but it is without a doubt one of the best movies I've seen this year.The main reason is probably Blake Lively. She is illuminating in this movie and we could feel that she owns Adaline throughout the story. She's always in the right tone, the right emotion and she transported me throughout the movie. The rest of the cast is doing great too especially Harrison Ford who I was surprised to see in that kind of movie. This is proving me how great and talented this actor is. He gave to this old man haunted by his past a real deal of emotions. So here it is. Now let me empty that brand new tissue box next to me and wish you a nice ride in Adaline Land.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a very nice and entertaining romantic fantasy. Ah, to be 29 forever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A romantic fantasy because what we witness, as far as modern science and medicine can tell us, is impossible. But some of my favorite movies over the years have an impossible theme. That's why I watch movies, to be fascinated and entertained.Blake Lively is Adaline Bowman. She is born in 1908, she gets married, and because of some atmospheric disturbances that happened years ago half-way across the globe, it is snowing in California when her "incident" happens. She accidentally runs off the road, into cold water which puts her into a suspended state for a few minutes, then when lightning strikes she is revived. All is well.Yes, all is well but not normal. Her "incident" was in 1937, when she was 29, and it rearranged her biology in a way that she no longer aged. As she lived and moved forward to present time she still always looked 29. And presumably she would never develop a serious illness. But living as a perpetual 29-yr-old has it benefits and its disadvantages. Particularly it is hard for her to commit to any serious relationship, and she doesn't want her secret to be known to the curiosity seekers.So the movie is really about her life with this "burden" and how she lives it. Plus a curious case of meeting up with a long-ago lover. It is a good movie, it gets you to think while it entertains. And the acting is first-rate.SPOILERS follow: In present time (she is over 100 years old) she meets a very nice man who is enchanted with her, Ellis Jones played by Michiel Huisman. She wants to run off but she doesn't. She agrees to go with him to a family event and there she meets his dad, Harrison Ford as William Jones. It turns out she and William were lovers back in the 1960s, almost engaged but she didn't show up back then. He recognizes her and is shocked, but she lies, tells him Adaline was her mother and she resembles her strongly. But William finds a scar on her hand from back then when she cut herself and he sewed her up, he knew it was her. She had to tell him the whole story. Of course it was too late, he now in his 70s and she still 29, plus he was happily married. But it is fitting that she loves his son. The problem is "fixed" when she has another "incident" while driving away, this time it cancels the former effect, now she will age normally. She knows this when a year later we see her noticing a gray hair. Ellen Burstyn has an interesting role as Adaline's daughter Flemming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine romantic story movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As always the scientific explanation of the phenomenon presented in this film is weak, although at least the dates suggested that we should not yet understand it. The film itself is pretty well defined if you read the storyline beforehand, at least in the beginning. Later on it doesn't require preliminary knowledge about the plot. Wrapping all things up I can definitely recommend this motion picture for all people looking for a good romance themed one. What I have to point out is that Harrison Ford played a very interesting part here, that disproves the suggestion that he's bored with his work and doesn't care about anything, as one might conclude from his previous appearances. To be honest the thing that most stood out for me is how much Blake Lively resembles Ben Affleck. I mean the chin, the nose the eyes, the looks they make, seems to me like twins. Compare these two: http://www.imdb.com/media/rm849648384/nm0515116?ref_=nmmd_md_nxt http://www.imdb.com/media/rm647596800/nm0000255?ref_=nm_ov_ph</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a ludicrous love tale. But we buy it nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's fair to say that Blake Lively steals the show. Not just only for her natural beauty that fits the role for reminding us of cinema's most iconic blonde actresses. No. She drives the movie forward with elegance and wit, just as a lead actress should do.It's a strange tale this 'Age of Adaline'. Instead of a Benjamin Button aging backwards, we get a woman that stopped getting old - at least from the outside - for more than 50 years. And, afraid of becoming a 'curiosity', she never stops running away and changing her identity, leaving her daughter behind and putting love on the sidelines. Until she meets Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman).We know from the beginning of the movie we're being fooled by a plot that, when you think about it, seems ludicrous, narrowly shallow and sometimes bold. But we buy it and the secret is that it's purely, almost innocently, charming.Moreover, having Harrison Ford's contribution of an old man still heart broken because of that 'one girl who got away', is a genuine performance which also makes this worth watching.Your mind will make you skeptical to the plot line but your eyes won't leave the screen. So hey, what can you do? Sometimes movies are about that too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Throwback to the 1940s ... and some (bonus) good news</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The job of the critic is call em as he sees em.There are a considerable number of people who are going to enjoy the heck of this film; and, out of respect for those individuals, I not criticize this by modern standards.Because at its heart, in its core, this is not a modern film.This is a 1940s fantasy film genre (there were dozens and dozens in that period) re-imagined and brought to the screen in the new millennium.Many of the odd script twists here -- which those of the current generation might consider hokey, silly, and contrived -- were perfectly acceptable in the 1940s.And in the 1940s this would possibly have been a "5 hankie" special. And women in particular would have gone nuts for it.The good news? It appears that Blake Lively's agent is ready to look at scripts. This is a breakout performance for the artist who has clearly shown she can carry an entire production on her back, with charm and poise and charisma.Rachel McAdams watch out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, the deceit!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adaline Bowman, born in 1908, had an accident when she was 29 which stopped her ageing. And now in 2014, after a lifetime of changing identity regularly in order to avoid the unwelcome curiosity of the authorities, watching her daughter become an old woman, and running away from relationships, she is unexpectedly put in a position where she has to make some hard choices.First things first ? like The Time Traveller's Wife, this is another romance deceitfully pretending to be a science fiction story. It was all lies, folks ? the science fiction/fantasy element is merely a feeble maguffin explained away with a bit of mumbo jumbo along the lines of the midichlorians in the Star Wars prequels. And, given that Blake Lively, an actress whose previous work had left me feeling that she was a less than compelling screen presence, was playing Adaline, I was already predisposed towards an uncharitable mindset. Oh well, given the location filming in San Francisco, perhaps I would recognise some locations from the single day I had spent there a couple of years ago.And I did, which cheered me up. Also, I found things to enjoy in the film. These did not include the structure, which I found muddy and with emphases which seemed out of place, nor the male romantic lead ? Michiel Huisman ? who didn't strike me as particularly well written or performed, and definitely not the narrative voice-over which was mind-numbingly annoying.But the ending, though obvious, was pleasing, Ellen Burstyn (as Adaline's daughter) was touching, Harrison Ford gave his best performance for years, and I am delighted to report that Blake Lively was excellent: her performance was understated and subtle, full of gentle nuance reflecting someone who has, of necessity, learnt to keep a careful step back from emotional commitment. I particularly liked her voice, which carried an attractive honeyed tone to it.I wouldn't say this is a great film, but it was quite a bit better than I anticipated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I've read the critics reviews and have come to the conclusion that critics have no special talent for assessing movies than any of us. They all go into a movie somewhat biased by their personal genre favorites, their tolerance for character development, their previous opinions on actors, etc. When critics are split 50/50 that's when this becomes very clear. For example, how can Blake Lively be both fantastic and utterly horrible in a movie? How can some critics praise Harrison Ford's delivery while others thought it laughable? And how can some adore the chemistry between Blake Lively and Michiel Huisman while others felt it didn't exist? So approaching this movie with that in mind, I ignored the critics and sat down to watch what ended up being one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in ages. First, it is stunningly shot. It feels very rich and well made from the beginning to the end - with a genuine warmth that just draws you right in. Second, the acting is so good - all of the roles are well-played and genuine. Blake and Michiel were adorable together and his role as the effervescent Ellis gave the movie a younger feel needed un-age Adaline. Third, it easily makes us feel a wide range of emotions - it has truly funny and sad parts - the audience laughed and sniffled collectively. And finally, its a nice "what if" story that feels magical. The references to tragic historical events and lost loves and opportunities made it all fit together.Take all movies for what they were meant to be (i.e. see action movies for the action etc.). Take this one for the bittersweet romance it is and enjoy the ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding performance by Blake Lively.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is categorically impossible to dislike either Blake Lively or her character Adaline Bowman in this movie. Lively and Bowman were meant for each other. This movie is about them. It is both Lively's movie, she carries it successfully, and Bowman's movie because the story is about her. As for the story, it is wonderful. Although a fantasy, the story has enough plausibility to make it watchable and enjoyable. Adaline has cause to stay within herself, and those who discover who she is has cause to be shocked. The cast is excellent. Harrison Ford delivers a stellar performance as the man who loved Adaline in the past and becomes the catalyst for a lot of the action in the story, which builds in intensity. There are also some amusing scenes involving Adaline and her daughter, excellently played by Ellen Burstyn, who engage in role reversal. This movie has everything a movie should have - solid acting, an engaging story, wonderful cinematography - and for this reason is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a 45 yr old male I have seen a multitude of movies in my life. From A to Z (affair to Zombies). Even tough horror is my typical genre I do love the well written, well acted and well narrated LOVE story.I watched "The Age of Adaline" tonight not expecting much but within the first 20 minutes I put down my iPhone and could not stop watching the cast and story develop.The writers were able to make you feel the love and sorrow for life that Adaline had to deal with throughout her many years on Earth.Blake Lively's performance in my opinion easily deserved an Oscar nominee along with the amazing performance of Ellen Burstyn as Adaline's elderly daughter. ( I will also say Adaline's elderly Prince Charles was amazing too lol) The only miscast in my opinion was Michiel Huisman, not because his acting abilities but in my honest opinion Adeline during this time period would have not fallen for a man with facial hair... I know I know reaching but keeping with the times I believe she has already went through the days of major facial hair and would have been attracted to more of a clean cut guyWith that said the cast, direction and narrative was excellent from beginning to end. I can not express how much I enjoyed and was moved by this movie.Congrats to Blake for the best performance of her life! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit that although the previews made it look appealing, I wasn't expecting much. Was I ever wrong and gladly so. This is the first major role i've seen Blake Lively in and she was fantastic as Adaline Bowman, who, after a freak accident at age 29 in 1937, ceases aging. Michael Huisman, who I've never seen did a very good job as Ellis, who falls in love with Adaline. And how can I not mention Harrison Ford, one of my all time favorites. I have never seen him give a bad performance and he gives a good one here, understated as it is as Ellis' father. So many little things make this movie enjoyable: Adaline's daughter Flemming, her dog Reggie, the fact that she has a very old-fashioned persona, the use of car accidents to bookend the film, the fact that Blake Lively is a very beautiful woman period, and of course the ending(although I WON'T spoil it. If you are hesitant, do yourself a favor and watch this. It is WELL worth the time and I enjoyed it so much that I plan to purchase it on DVD to watch. My Grade: A-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Yes, this review definitely contains spoilers!)Any fan of the show "Forever" or perhaps even the 90s show "Forever Knight" or the Twilight series will understand the concept of extreme longevity explored in "Age of Adaline," and I'm a very big fan of both those shows and the concept, so I was eager to see this.Blake Lively was amazing as Adaline, and Harrison Ford performed well, too, in all his flustered brilliance. His character here has great depth, as I think only he could pull off.In a minor but amazing role, newcomer Anthony Ingruber plays Ford in a flashback as a youth and just NAILS his looks and mannerisms (which he's actually done for years on YouTube before being discovered by the director!)In Ford's great film "Blade Runner," the original, theater release had a voice-over, which was later cut by the director on DVDs. There, it was an under-appreciated homage to 1940s Film Noir movies. In Age of Adaline, however, the ever-present narration seems pointless at best, demeaning and overly expository at worst. And while it may have seemed necessary to fill out the story's scientific details, it's often talking down to the audience in a way that's unnecessary. Verbal exposition often took the place of something that would have been better acted. And everyone who saw the previews already knew she lived a long time. It should be cut in the DVD.That said, the story progresses well, though I wished for more flashbacks and more rye indications that she had acquired vast knowledge of her hometown - elements that add charm and a bit of humor. A date at an old movie theater, for example, was a charming scene.It's beautifully filmed, and Lively's wardrobe is a reminder that women used to dress elegantly in their daily lives. I wish they still did (Adaline never gave up dressing well for 100 years and it added to Lively's already stunning looks.) I could have done without the pet storyline, but only because it struck a personal chord, as it will for any pet owner. It illustrated her sense of loss quite beautifully, and asked, without actually asking: How would it feel if everyone you had ever known had died, decades ago, and you were afraid to get close to, or even date anyone, as a consequence? Great post- date or dorm room discussion material here!Very few flaws or goofs to note here. Some include: Why did Ford's character need that photo - it didn't prove anything. She seems to remember an event in 1906 but she wasn't even born until 1908. Why did she keep going back to that same city, where she would risk being recognized by people just 25 years older than she had been on a previous sojourn there? And wait - wouldn't her new man be grossed out knowing what he finally learned about the Ford character, to whom he was RELATED?The very end (comet) is deeply flawed and confusing, leaving the audience with a big "huh?" (I suspect that a 2031 scene was cut, or was never filmed) and the narration during the "accident" before it that changes her physical situation is again unnecessary. It's as if people are so dumb they'd miss what was happening.Overall, a worthy film about an interesting topic, filmed beautifully. Go see this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE AGE OF ADALINE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Romance flick, which spans 107 years, and tells the story of a woman who can not age. It stars Blake Lively in the title role; and it also costars Michiel Huisman, Harrison Ford, Ellen Burstyn, Amanda Crew and Kathy Baker. The film was directed by Lee Toland Krieger (who also helmed the 2012 romcom 'CELESTE &amp; JESSE FOREVER') and it was written by J. Mills Goodloe and Salvador Paskowitz. It's an interesting, and somewhat involving, tale; but it's also pretty drawn-out, in places. Adaline Bowman (Lively) was born on New Years Day, in 1908. She was married, widowed and had a daughter; by the age of 29. That's the same year Adaline died, in a freak accident, and came back to life; due to unusual snow, freezing waters and lightning. After that Adaline never aged another day; which made it very hard for her to engage in long lasting relationships. Nevertheless she attempts a romance with a man she meets at a New Years Party (Huisman). Things become especially complicated when she realizes she also knew his father (Ford). The whole time her daughter, Flemming (Burstyn), stays by her side. The movie is beautifully shot, and I like the concept (a lot), I wish they would have done a little more with it though. It's actually quite dull, at first, but once Harrison Ford enters the film (in one of his best recent performances), the movie really gets a lot more involving, and moving. Lively is good in the lead as well, and the supporting cast is definitely adequate enough. I'm glad I watched it, but it's not one I'd hurry to watch again, anytime soon.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/N95IMM6Vork</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blake Lively is stunning in "The Age Adaline"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In her new film "The Age of Adaline", Blake Lively has been gorgeous for centuries. The actress stars as Adaline Bowman, a young and mysterious young woman who hides her true identity. Why? Because Adaline never ages. To protect herself and her daughter, Flemming, Adaline lives a sheltered life - until she meets Ellis (Michiel Huisman). At first, Adaline has her reservations about him, how can she lie about her identity and still be in an honest relationship with Ellis? But with some encouragement from Flemming, Adaline decides to let go. She and Ellis fall in love, but when Adaline joins him for a weekend at his parents' house, her past catches up with her in ways she could never have imagined and might alter the course of her eternal life, forever.One of the things I love most about "The Age of Adeline", are the costumes. They are absolutely, undeniably perfect. They match perfectly with everything: the storyline, the characters, the actors and the look of the film. From the flapper dress in the 1920s to the head scarfs in the 1960s and the red lipstick in the 1990s - everything is spot on and creates the illusion of Lively's character living in all these different ages. Fashion should emphasize one's personality and in the case of "The Age of Adaline", it absolutely does. Adaline is regal and poised, reserved yet world-wise. Her costumes bring out these aspects, as they are sharply cut, made out of rich fabrics and have small, yet classy and elegant details.Another aspect of "The Age of Adaline" that really struck me, were the performances and especially those by Blake Lively and Harrison Ford. Lively is best known for portraying Serena van der Woodsen in the hit series "Gossip Girl", but with her role as Adaline, she proves that she has outgrown the Upper East Side. She portrays the character of Adaline with such elegance and such understanding of the character. Both Lively's look and acting are stunning.Harrison Ford, who portrays Ellis' father, is amazing. Known for his role as Han Solo in the "Star Wars" franchise, Ford shows a different side of his acting palette with "The Age of Adaline". His character creates a second layer to Adaline's love story with Ellis and twists the plot in a both excruciating and fascinating way. With this film, Ford takes on an entirely different character than he usually portrays and apart from this being very refreshing, the actor's performance was also very touching and heartfelt."The Age of Adaline" beautifully and elegantly portrays what it must feel like to never age, to see those you love grow up, grow old and to be the only one to be left behind. It is a heartwarming and stunning love story, that will last in your memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie but a Little Draw Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the movie, but they took too long to get to where they wanted to go. It would have been a better movie if they would have made the stories stronger and shorter.The idea of never growing old is not a new one. In the Man from Earth with David Lee Smith, Tuck Everlasting, and Forever young with Mel Gibson, we see what could happen if a person remains at the same age through years or centuries. All movies agree on one thing, it is a lonely life and you can never settle permanently anywhere, for fear of discovery. The only difference in this movie is at the end, through an accident, her body returns to its normalcy and she, like all of us, will eventually age and die and she discovers at the end, she has a gray hair for the very first time.What I did like about this movie is that she takes responsibility for not leading people on, knowing she can only maintain any relationship for less than 10 years, or she will be discovered. The movie was acted with class and style, and yes, it was not based on sex, foul language, and idiotic nonsense. I just wish they would have left out so much useless dialogue and detail.In in all, it is entertaining and safe for anyone over 18 years old, as there are several short bedroom scenes, but tastefully displayed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lee Toland Kriger's The Age of Adaline is a superb romantic thanks to its lead duo. Blake Lively is Adaline, the fair immortal who hasn't aged for several decades due to a severe car crash. She goes from relationship to relationship, from town to town, never settling down. A risky chance comes in the form of Ellis (Huisman), a stylish man whose intellect almost matches Adaline's own. Their encounters are warm, humorous and touching. Great support comes from Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker as Ellis' parents. Nudges of surrealism make TAoA vary from the usual romantic stories. Its voice-over, telling Adaline's 'miraculous' tale, is its only downfall. The unknown storyteller attempts to justify Adaline's conditions, but it comes across as a magnificent coincidence instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but the plot felt rushed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was definitely well-directed, with clever dialogue and excellent acting. But a couple of things would have made it better. First of all, the narration was annoying. The narration is obnoxious and pretentious, and I think it would have been nicer if Adaline had narrated her own story. Also, some parts happen too fast, especially the romance. It seems to take no more than two weeks for the two main characters to fall in love. I also feel like the writers created too interesting a character, with too amazing a story, for one movie to do her justice. It would have been cool to have a trilogy about this character to give us more background on the decades of her life that are missing from this movie. All in all, still a decent movie with some great scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed storyline but very easy watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blake Lively hasn't done a great deal of acting in high class movies however, this didn't show. She portrays her character, a lady who has been in an accident and no longer ages but still looking for everyday luxuries, such as a companion. I still feel that despite the good performance the pedant inside of me can't quite get a grip of the storyline and the twists and turns throughout the film. From this though there is analysis of positives of what comes with a lack of aging as well as the negatives which are much more greatly emphasized.In summary a great late night movie and an easy watch with a story in which no thought is required, not quite up to the standard of the Curious Case of Benjamin Button though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something New But Could Have Been Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, to begin with was totally interested to watch something new. The movie is decently paced and well directed. Blake Lively as Adeline Bowman has done justification to her role. She is kind, sophisticated, urban and bears a lovely gesture throughout the movie. The story on the other hand could have been better with some more scenes showing Adeline's past and could have helped more during the end scenes. I am rating this 7,10 since its definitely not your money waste as a one time watch. The movie is clean and doesn't have any violence. The direction is at par and its nice to see Lee Toland proving himself again after "December Ends".To summarise, its a feel good movie but not to be kept in your favourites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the movie was good, but there was a lot more potential.First off, there's got to be a better way of telling the background story than the stupid narration. It's 2015, nobody does that anymore.Secondly, the romance was unconvincing. Blake Lively showed me that she has evolved from eye candy for Gossip Girl to an actor who can actually act, but the chemistry was absent. Ellis's character was creepy. I'm just not convinced that a beautiful woman who have seen 80+ years of all sorts of flirting would fall that easily for something not that special.Also, it's good plot that they designed Ellis's father to be another man Adaline loved, but it turned out to be very cheesy and unrealistic. William has been married for 40 years and he still can't forget the girl who stood up his proposal-date. And then in the end he celebrates his anniversary with his wife like nothing happened. He finds out that Jenny is indeed Adaline and wouldn't a normal person be much more shocked than he was? He was a medical student for Christ's sake. No way a medical student doesn't get at least curious about how the hell this was possible. He must have wanted more answers from Adaline about their relationship. And heck, your son is going to marry a 107 year old lady who will never age. Aren't you at all concerned that if your son gets the life with Adaline that you never had, his life will never be normal? And does it not bother you at all that your son is dating (possibly marrying) your ex-girlfriend? He came to the conclusion "you lived your life like you never lived" way too fast.And the daughter was also kind of too supportive to be true. It must be hard to have a mother that could never age, and hence could not be there in your life, but the daughter barely cared. I know she's also lived a lifetime, so she's at the age where people start to forgive everything, but it's still kind of a stretch to hope for your 107 year old mother to go out and date 30 year olds.Anyway, it's still a good movie, but there should have been much more conflicts and struggles than what was presented.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Romantic comedies are not my thing, but this one did have a "Sci-Fi" element to it so I checked it out.I went in hoping to see Highlander, which I did get elements of as Adeline would have flashbacks of her very long life.The whole thing was much formulated. They take no chances with the movie it was very upbeat and happy and hit all the marks perfectly.When movies get like this it's really up to the actors to shine to prevent staleness.Blake Lively was good, but felt stiff compared to her male lead who took the Romanic film stereotype down a different road by being not so over the top, handsome, and very down to Earth, using his sense of humor to win Adeline, cause he did not have much of anything else (well?he did have money but..)Harrison ford kinda sucked, But I did like the strange Harrison ford look a like they used for the flash back of his younger self. So, while not my cup of tea, overall the movie was very entertaining to sit through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that I was steadying myself for another romance film and being let down with an empty, and "rushed to conclusion" feel good ending judging by the movie poster. I was very mistaken. From the start of this film you're drawn in, and never let down. I can't remember any films right off that Blake Lively has been in so I haven't seen her act before. I was stunned to find myself captivated by her performance. Blake's character dialogue was thoughtful, concise, delicate, and distinctly refined. Blake Lively carries this film very well, and one cannot help but empathize with her character facing a very unique situation. It was a wonderful surprise to see Harrison Ford in action again. Ellen Burstyn gave a delightful performance, and was very believable in her role. I recall at the half-way part of the film thinking "please don't let the ending suck". Refreshingly the end of this film was not rushed, and the last scene was simply fabulous!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love movies that make me think for a few minutes after the movie ends. I love sitting there stunned in silence, considering what I just saw. This movie left me with that feeling. Now don't get me wrong, this movie isn't some master piece. The whole not aging thing was a bit silly at times and obviously unrealistic, but the point behind it is what makes this movie so special to me. What if you could live forever? This movie really explores the cost of living forever and what you're forced to do and give up. The acting was fantastic in my opinion and the glances into the past were so much fun to watch, as a history enthusiast I wish there had of been more of that. Overall this is a nice movie to watch and it will make you consider life and how growing old is a beautiful thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a beautiful woman who does not age after an accident. Her eternal beauty and eternal life becomes a curse, and she has to severe ties with people around her to avoid suspicion. She's at a difficult crossroad when he encounters a striking man."The Age of Adaline" is such a beautiful film. I thought it would be a boring clichéd film, but I was completely blown away by it. Adaline is a beautiful woman who is elegant, knowledgeable and radiates a classic quality. I haven't noticed much about Blake Lively before, but I'm very impressed by the classic elegance she radiates.The plot is very touching. It brings tears to my eyes many times. I was particularly touched by the scene about Adaline's dog in the vet's office. What the vet said is very relevant to life itself, framing a difficult situation very positively while breaking a terribly sad news. Meeting Harrison Ford for the first time is also a very powerful scene. On fact there are so many emotional and breathtaking scenes that "The Age of Adaline" literally captured my heart. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is the question the main protagonist played by Blake Lively seems to be asking. As an accident at the beginning of the movie renders her forever ageless and young for up to 107 years old, as she has to move to state to state in order to conceal her secret.Along with purchasing fake ID's and being on the run. Like a fugitive. As she has a "daughter" played by the great Ellen Burstyn who ages but Adaline does not and continues to stay young. But in the present day in San Francisco, she meets a man named Ellis played by Michiel Huisman of Games of Thornes and Nashville fame in his leading man debut and quite a great one I might add.As she must decide between love with Ellis or run again. As she is getting tired of running and lying. But there is a twist in the movie over Ellis and his family as they celebrate their forty years of wedded bliss you have to see. Won't spoil it for you all.It would be nice to stay young but at what expense? Yours or those whom you love and hurt possibly along the way?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Age of Adaline: How will you live a life that is ageless?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Age of Adaline was a refreshing take on the question most people ask their selves, "If you are given a chance to stay young forever, what will you do?" I've asked myself that question before and Adaline somehow gave me the idea on what will mostly happen if it ever does. The first time I watched the trailer of the movie, I was already intrigued by the narration and the science that is intertwined with it. I was giddy to watch it due to the fact that science, history and romance (which are my favorite topics) got into the plot, which I hoped to be a nice combination and The Age of Adaline didn't disappoint me. Adaline Marie Bowman had lived a normal life until that night wherein something "almost magical" happened, after that said phenomena, her life became a constant mystery to people around her which affected her living and might take her freedom away. So in the following years, Adaline chose to keep her true identity and moved to different places every decade. Not until she met this man who made her feel like there is still a chance to have romance in her life again, but one moment of weakness years ago will be the turning point of everything for Adaline. Blake Lively (Adaline) was a good choice for the lead character, she carried it very well, from the way she talks to the way she walks to her demure smiles, she was the perfect Adaline Bowman for me. Her love interest, Michiel Huisman (Ellis Jones), was an added joy for me in the movie, the mystery and those genuine facial expressions he did was absolutely great to look at and the way he gave this "rich-smart-humble-guy" vibe just embraced the role very well. When it comes to the supporting actors, of course, who wouldn't want a Harrison Ford (William Jones) in the cast, he was impressive as he always is, though he was only present on the turning point part of the movie yet he proved that he completes it, no doubt about it. Ellen Burstyn was a burst of energy in the film, being the daughter that looks older than her mom, she just made it so real. The rest of the cast were great choices from the young ones to the aged actors, it was a great line up. I can't complain about anything in terms with the cast. Lee Toland Krieger did another great job for the film, Krieger is actually one of the reasons why I watched the movie as I have seen his previous work before (Celeste and Jess) and it was a movie to remember for me, and again he did really well with this time. I find the movie really smart to have science be incorporated with romance, I know there had been tons of movies made before, that involved the same topics, yet, Age of Adaline stood out by putting in a twist of fantasy on it. Opening the movie was the typical mysterious kind of approach any fantasy-related film gives off, the music on the background and the narration was good, even the first few lines that the narrator said was notable, the scoring in the movie moving forward was perfectly placed in each emotional scenes. Usage of old songs and celebrities as references were present to make it more relatable to the audience. Shots of San Francisco was beautiful, from the Golden Gate Bridge construction to the roads, establishments and even on the tiny details of the stairs in the library, it was a gorgeous sight to look at. What I appreciated more in the movie is the fact that Adaline has this taxi ride scene, photo flashbacks which takes her down to memory lane, the fluidity of the transition from one decade to another gives you the nostalgic feeling Adaline also felt. Historical and scientific references were brilliantly inserted in each important scenes that marked how Adaline became who she was and how she was with Ellis as well. The Age of Adaline will open your eyes to the reality of what ageless beauty/body can have and not have at the same time, Adaline was a prisoner of the future and is a living evidence of the past, she could not commit to anyone for the same reason she could not stay in one place. Hers was a life we people of the new age always dreamed of, staying young forever, the movie will give you a glimpse to that kind of life and will let you think twice about it. It won't blow your mind away with how great the drama was or how the plot twist happened, but it will give you the "feel-good" feels that we usually want with a romantic film, that happy ending stuff we always expect, its a beautiful tale of two lovers hindered by a past without knowing if they'll have a future or just a present enough to last a lifetime for her. And you'll be amazed how they were able to formulate the science behind why she isn't growing old at all (Its a killer formula I tell you). Yes, you will also hear romantic lines that has been used over and over again, which makes some of the scenes sound sappy but the whole movie itself just serves you the right amount of science and romance, a balance of everything. Isn't that what we need?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love of an Eternal Lifetime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adaline Bowman was an ordinary woman born on New Year's Eve 1908. When she was 29 years old, her DNA was altered by a combination of hypothermia and electrical shock, freezing her at that age for the rest of her life (a scientific phenomenon yet to be explained in the year 2035). Fearing discovery by authorities, Adaline was forced to live on the run, changing identities and residences every ten years. She shunned all forms of human relationships as much she could avoid, with only her daughter Flemming knowing her secret.However, on New Year's Eve 2014, under her current name of Jennifer Larson, Adaline meets the charismatic young man named Ellis Jones. As Adaline falls for his charms, her deep-seated fears once again surface. Will she abandon Ellis again as she did several other men in her past and deny herself happiness? Or will she finally abandon her apprehensions and settle down with a man she loves?This is a film about a woman with eternal youth. Thankfully, this is NOT about a vampire again. The approach of this very charming film is dramatic romance, with fantasy as its fanciful embellishment. The production design, costume and hair/makeup people have their work cut out for them as they had to painstakingly recreate each and every decade in Adaline's life. Their meticulous work deserve awards consideration as these were of excellent quality, enhancing this film's timeless theme. Blake Lively portrayed Adaline Bowman as a strong, refined, dignified lady, not prone to hysterics. She has to convey all her inner turmoil with her eyes and her beautiful face. I believe she pulled it off very well, and she brings us along with her charmed life with its difficult decisions. This film rides on her shoulders and she carries it with grace and confidence. It also helps that she has a timeless beauty that fit in any of the time periods her character was in. She must have been a dream-come-true for those costume and makeup guys as she can carry any look gorgeously.Playing the wealthy and cultured philanthropist Ellis Jones is Dutch actor Michiel Huisman. I know this actor as the new Daario Naharis, the Khaleesi's consort on Season 4 of "Game of Thrones." He projects a goofy charm about him. His chemistry with Blake Lively was not immediately electric, but it steadily developed as the film went along. When he gratuitously appeared on screen only clad in a towel with his chest and abs exposed, you knew that this film was primarily targeted for the ladies. Harrison Ford plays Ellis' father William, an astronomer who is celebrating his 40th wedding anniversary with his wife Kathy (Kathy Baker). Ellis brought Adaline (as Jennifer) home with him to celebrate his parents' life milestone. But when William sees Adaline, ... I will not say more. Suffice it to say that Harrison Ford gives the best and most memorable performance of his recent career in this film since his star dimmed in the past two decades. I hope his work here will not be forgotten come awards season.Ellen Burstyn is delightful as Adaline's daughter Flemming in her senior years. When daughter began to look older than mother, they were forced to live apart. Her best scene was that when Adaline introduces her to Ellis for the first time. Her face spoke volumes of emotion pent up through the years and it was so beautiful to witness. As told by director Lee Toland Krieger, Adaline's story was shown as a series of flashbacks intercutting with present-day scenes when memories were triggered by current situations. It employs a voice-over narration which sounded very much like what you would hear on an old documentary film reel. The effect was a bit confusing at first, but you would get used to this voice as it interjects itself to explain odd circumstances. I liked how it mixed in historical facts and places in San Francisco to drive the story along. The pseudo-scientific jargon explanations were inventive, fanciful as they were. There are some funny lines subtly delivered here and there to lighten up the mood. Best of these was when Flemming was commenting how very few photographs Adaline had, and Adaline quipped, "You've seen one, you've seen them all." I am not really a fan of romance films. However, this one caught my attention because of its time-bending theme and historical touches in its storytelling. Ladies will like this love story and its heroine quite instinctively. Their dates will also have interesting things to see, the lovely face and striking silhouette of Blake Lively not being the least of them. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll be pleasantly satisfied with this little romantic film with a sci-fi element.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's rare these days where we get a genuine romantic film with a big science-fiction aspect. You either get one or the other and seldom do the two ever mix. That's not the case with 'Age of Adaline' though. Writers J. Mills Goodloe and Salvadore Paskowitz have brilliantly weaved both genres into a cohesive narrative with strong characters and an easy enough plot without having to explaining the sci-fi aspects throughout the film. In fact, the first several minutes of the movie has a narrator explain why this young woman in the early 1900s named Adaline (Blake Lively) has not aged past her mid-20s.It's a fairly interesting and scientific explanation too, one that doesn't seem to far fetched. So instead of the film taking an entire two hours to tell us why she doesn't age, it's over and done with in the first few minutes of the film, and we get to focus on her life through the years to present day in 2015. So in present day, we see Adaline working in a library as she has kept on the movie as to not alert anyone to her "condition".Even her own daughter (Ellen Burstyn), doesn't always know where her much younger looking mother is half the time. On the eve of her next move to a different life somewhere, Adaline meets Ellis (Michiel Huisman), a young, charismatic, wealthy man who immediately takes a liking to Adaline. The two hit it off slowly as he is impressed with her wealth of detailed knowledge on just about everything and her unique wit.Begrudgingly, she begins to fall for him too, but when she come with him to meet his parents (Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker), someone from her past recognizes her. 'Age of Adaline' is not so much a story of someone who doesn't age or the science behind it, but rather a true love story between two people who are meant to be together and Adaline's struggle and fear of letting go and following her heart. It sounds all sorts of mushy and sentimental, but it's surprisingly not.It's a very charming story with some genuine and funny moments throughout, such as Adaline knowing every single answer to Trivial Pursuit and Ellis being floored by each answer. It's those little moments that make 'Age of Adaline' worth sticking around for as well as Blake Lively and Michiel Huisman's performances. You'll be pleasantly satisfied with this little romantic film with a sci-fi element.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Agreeable Tale of Years and Tears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Age of Adaline" is a disposable but entertaining chick flick with a fantasy premise reminiscent of "The Twilight Zone." Adaline Bowman, our lovely, lithesome, long-haired heroine, would qualify as just another colorless female protagonist were it not for an accident that altered her life. Basically, she nearly died in a horrific, single-car crash. She smashed her automobile through a bridge railing during a snowstorm, and her vehicle plunged headlong into a frigid river. Miraculously, an inexplicable supernatural event occurred that saved her life. Lightning struck at a propitious moment, and the explosive electrical charge revived her like a pair of defibrillator paddles. As a result, our 29-year old heroine spends the rest of your life without physical change either to her face or her features. Nevertheless, she discovers that her immortality that makes her so singular forces her to maintain a never-ending masquerade to avoid arousing suspicion. Imagine a tragic Nicholas Sparks weepie crossed with an H.G. Wells sci-fi saga and you'll have a clue what to expect from "Celeste &amp; Jesse Forever" director Lee Toland Krieger and his two scenarists "The Best of Me's" J. Mills Goodloe and "Nic &amp; Tristan Go Mega Dega's" Salvador Paskowitz.Aside from our heroine's bizarre misfortune, "The Age of Adaline" amounts to a routine melodrama about a female fugitive on the lam from reality. Our eponymous heroine denies herself love until she decides that she can live no longer without it. Other than movies such as "Green Lantern," "Savages," and "The Town," most of Blake Lively's fans remember her from her five-year stint on The CW Television Network's series "Gossip Girl" between 2007 and 2012. Tall, dark, and handsome "World War Z" actor Michiel Huisman, who also appears in the HBO mini-series "Game of Thrones," co-stars as Lively's principal love interest. Harrison Ford of "Star Wars," Ellen Burstyn of "The Exorcist," and "Jesse Stone" actress Katy Bates round out an attractive as well as appealing cast. Of course, all tearjerkers ladle out heaps of hokum, but the supernatural element of temporary immortality adds a luster of curiosity to this otherwise lightweight, 112-minute, PG-13 rated theatrical release. Basically, you're going to cry no matter what happens, while director Lee Toland Krieger generates ample suspense about Adaline's predicament despite the encumbrance of Hugh Ross's loquacious narrator. You'll wish this guy would shut up because he takes the mystery out of the narrative.Initially, Adaline Bowman's live began without an anomaly. She grew up, got married, and raised a daughter. For the record, Adaline was born on New Year's Eve in 1908. She exchanged vows with an architect designing San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. In some fascinating flashbacks, we see what San Francisco looked like before the bridge opened. Sadly for Adaline, her architect husband dies tragically during construction of the bridge. Afterward, in 1937, Adaline's life changes inextricably when she is driving home to see her young daughter Flemming. Our heroine experiences a close brush with death, but she survives the ordeal. Everybody at one time or another has been stopped by an overzealous cop for some minor infraction. The gimlet-eyed guardian of law and order who pulls Adaline over doesn't think she is old enough to fit her driver's license description. This skeptical traffic cop asks her to bring her birth certificate to police headquarters. As a plot complication, this encounter is relatively minor. Nevertheless, it serves as the first loose pebble that precipitates an avalanche. Eventually, J. Edgar Hoover's Communistic-sniffing FBI agents get wind of Adaline. Two agents confront her in public and take her in for questioning. Our resourceful heroine manages to escape from them while they are away from their car. Adaline crawls out of the locked car by exiting through the trunk. Incredibly, she eludes Hoover's men. It is difficult to believe the otherwise tenacious FBI would allow Adaline to get away scot-free, but then this is a love story rather than a thriller.Adaline's biggest problem occurs when she travels to England. She involves herself with an attractive young man, William Jones (Anthony Ingruber of "Avatar"), who later grows up to become a bespectacled Harrison Ford. Ingruber is a dead ringer for Ford as a twentysomething Lothario. Later, when Adaline is supposed to meet William for a date, her sharp eyes spot a box containing what she suspects is an engagement ring. Not only does she order her cabbie to keep on driving, but she also returns to America without a word to poor William. Adaline manages to hop, skip, and jump through the 1940s, 1950s, and the 1960s without reacting to any of the events during those tumultuous decades. Interestingly, she remains aloof from World War II, Vietnam, and the Kennedy Assassination. Indeed, the first time we see her, she is paying for fake identity papers. She gives the bright young man who forged her papers a heart-stopping moment when she tells him about the penalties for such felonious shenanigans. At first, he thinks she is an undercover cop, but she allays his anxiety. Finally, when she is working as a library archivist in San Francisco, Adaline encounters Ellis (Michiel Huisman) who is smitten by her beauty. Eventually, Ellis convinces Adaline to go out on a date. Afterward, Adaline lowers her guard and accompanies him on an outing in the country where Ellis' parents live. Suddenly, she discovers that her past has caught up with her again. Predictably, she takes flight, but Ellis careens off in ruthless hot pursuit.Doesn't everybody dream about finding that special person who will complete their life? Adaline is understandably reluctant to commit herself to anybody. She is more than content to live alone in her apartment with her pet cocker spaniel. Her grown-up daughter Flemming (Ellen Burstyn of "Resurrection") struggles desperately to get her mother to take a chance on love. Although it isn't a four hankie classic, "The Age of Adaline" delivers more than enough lachrymose moments for ladies to quench their tears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . whether it comes at age 30 or age 108. In THE AGE OF ADALINE, "Jenny" gets hers during her 30th year (or tenth, depending upon how you count), while the title character's initial silver thread gets plucked out at five score and eight. ADALINE is a retelling of the Greek tragedy, Oedipus. Though all the elements of the original remain (a woman doing a father and son, a blind person, secret identities, astronomical abnormalities), a few of the trivial details are mixed around so that Euripides' estate cannot launch a plagiarism suit in the United States (which, thanks to copious Congressional bribe-taking from the Disney MegaCorp and Steamboat Willie, enjoys copyright laws which are due to be extended back to God and His Ten Commandments thing on July 1 of this year). Though ADALINE's story is as old as the hills, Blake Lively's trademark mole is mesmerizing enough to detract one's attention from the scientific-sounding malarkey spouted by the strangely omniscient voice-over guy at the beginning and the end of her tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic story with some interesting twists - one of my favorites to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been fascinated with the issues possibly facing someone with an unusually long lifespan ever since I read Lazarus Long by the science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein. This is in part what drew me to want to see this film. However her lifespan is not the central focus but rather provides an interesting backdrop for the romance of the story. I'm a guy and although I will admit I am a romantic, I am not overly a fan of chick flicks although I have gone to many with my wife to accompany her. That said I myself very much liked this movie. The science behind the character's unusual long life was plausible enough not to be distracting and to it's credit added an epic nature to the film due to her extended lifespan there were scenes covering this period and flash backs and such. The whole cast was nicely chosen and did an excellent job. As far as acting highlights, Blake Lively is captivating to watch (guy's perspective of course) and Harrison Ford is just as good in his role here as I've seen him in any of his dramatic roles. So in short whether you're drawn in from the science angle or the romantic you won't be disappointed. It was definitely the one of the most enjoyable couple hours I've spent at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Age of Adaline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of aging, whether it be in reverse, or too fast, or too slow, or perhaps not at all is a theme that has been tried in numerous films over the years and still seems to be an idea that fascinates Hollywood filmmakers and screenwriters. The most recent example, I can think of is The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, which I thought could have been an excellent film and had a really interesting premise, but I felt that the filmmakers did nothing with this unique idea, but instead did two and a half hours of melodrama and flashbacks that felt like any number of movies that we have seen countless times before. The Age of Adaline, while I feel it is a much stronger film than Benjamin Button overall, still has moments and even sections of the film that prevent it from being great and that hinders one's own appreciation and thoughts of the film, although it does improve as it goes along. I will explain more. The Age of Adaline, deals again with aging, in an interesting concept and I think some of the film's audience would argue that this film, much like Benjamin Button, takes a very interesting concept, but instead really goes nowhere with it and turns it into a melodrama which is more, or less a romance that we have seen countless times before. The thing here is that, part of that assessment is correct and part of it is not. I felt that there were parts of The Age of Adaline, that more, or less played out like any number of big screen romances with attractive young leads and things that further complicate the romance. For the first half of the film, I did feel myself becoming increasingly more restless and bored because I found that this film had nothing new, or important to say and was playing out fairly normally, or like any number of films I have seen before. I felt that the film was flat and uninspired as well as the performances, which I was really not getting much out of either. I have never walked out of a film at the theatre before, so sticking with tradition, I stayed with this film and much to both my surprise and delight, I found the last half of The Age of Adaline, to drastically improve on it's first parts and become an altogether better film which saved it from becoming a total write off. The first half was sappy and melodramatic and I found no real chemistry between the leads and even with an interesting premise in the background, I found that the film had nothing interesting to say and was more, or less like a Hollywood soap opera on the big screen. The last half while it still has elements that one could relate to a soap opera, or a more melodramatic film, improves on the first half because that is where the film becomes more complex in the sense that things become more interesting and we actually start to get interested in what is going on and how the film will end. I can not go into too many, if any details on this because it would ultimately spoil the film, but it comes to a point where the big unique premise of the film comes into play and I think it is handled in such a way that it takes what was an interesting premise and uses human melodrama in a way that allows us to connect in a sense emotionally with what is going on, but also at the same time be riveted and fascinated by it and like any good soap opera, you really do want to see how it ends up altogether, much like we do here as well. The last half had me forget the sappiness of the first part and I could get over the flat and uninspired performances because this time around the film actually gives these actors and characters something interesting to say and do. Perhaps it was not the case that the acting was so bad in the beginning, but rather the film and script itself were so dull that it didn't allow these actors, try as they might, to do anything interesting, or compelling because the script itself wasn't calling for it, but when we finally do get to the interesting and juicy parts of this film, everything from the writing, acting and direction all seems to improve and get much better. In conclusion, I think that this could have been a great film if the first half was as compelling, or interesting as the second, but as it stands we have a good film with a very weak beginning that turns into a much better film. So your money at the box office is not wasted after all, but you do have to be a little patient with the film and let the magic happen, because it does eventually, you just have to be patient. On final notes, the film did have excellent cinematography and the last half's performances, script and direction did vastly improve which does lead me to recommend the film overall and give it a fairly decent rating, but it would have been much higher if the writers and crew had been this good from the beginning, but alas this is how the film stands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-crafted, creative and beautifully acted movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have been busy lately, and I have been watching a fair amount of sports, so my wife and I have not been to as many flicks as we usually go to: so, I wanted to take her to one that she would enjoy tonight, with me as a secondary factor.I read a few reviews this morning and it sounded like my wife would love it; well, she did, and while I didn't necessarily *love* it, I thoroughly enjoyed it.One way I judge a movie is how each scene stands alone, i.e., if any scene was extracted and shown with no context, is it worth watching? Well, the scenes in this flick pass this test. The art direction, cinematography, costumes, and most of all, the directing and acting made it all work beautifully. A word about Blake Lively: she is in every scene, and because of the plot and structure of this movie, she must carry it. And she does-- she is completely believable in this fantasy story. Harrison Ford-- though he makes a late appearance--takes over all of his scenes. The man is a presence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was first invited to a screening of this film I almost turned it down. But then I thought to myself, "Harrison Ford, for the most part, doesn't pick bad movies." and decided to accept the invitation. I'm glad I gave it a chance because this film exceed my expectations. This is a love story for old souls and the trailers don't do it justice. This film isn't outstanding and it probably won't be winning any awards, but that doesn't mean it lacks character and depth. Give it a chance.Advice for practical people like me: Don't get hung up about the technicalities of why she doesn't age and just let yourself get lost in the story.</fullReview>

It didn't seem that anyone would just drive off after doing that, but I guess there are people in the world like that.I did like the way the story of Ellis and his father were linked, and the way William immediately recognised her when he first saw her.

Use this movie as a barometer to see if you are normal, or need help.Very clean film with little to no vulgarity or sexual nonsense. No F bombs, no discussion of private parts and no 'something about Mary' crap. No politically correct character's thrown in just to satisfy everyone and no gimmicks.

		<fullReview>I had a lot of expectations for this movie because the promo trailer was so good and....it was more than I hoped for. A perfect movie for all romance and drama lovers. A great story about love, lost, future and a person's life. The time we have, sometimes we don't appreciate it enough. Of course living forever has its benefits, but this film shows how much is sacrificed, that's my favorite part about this movie. The message and a happy ending. I liked the flashbacks and the fact that the accident was explained scientifically. It made the plot more realistic. I would also like to compliment the actress who played the main character, she did an amazing job with the emotions and her performance made the story so believable. As I said at the beginning, a good movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a real stinker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite possibly the stupidest movie I have seen in a long time, if not ever. It is also among the most tediously boring I have seen. I was attracted to it for two reasons: the plot premise - a woman who never ages - was rife with possibilities, and it had Harrison Ford, one of my favorites. As far as the possibilities of the plot premise, fuggedaboutit. We might have had some considerations of the meaning of mortality, but no. What we wind up with is a warmed over soap opera plot centering on mundane romantic issues. Vast stretches of the movie are taken up with vacuous and empty dialogue. I have never seen Blake Lively before and I certainly in future will avoid any movie starring her; her acting, as Dorothy Parker said, "runs the emotional gamut from A to B." Then we have the portentous voice-over explaining the Deus ex machina events that bookmark the story. As someone once said, if you need a voice-over, your script is inadequate. As far as those two "miraculous" events, we might have accepted the first one if there had been some serious content in the movie. As it is, with all the vapidity we have seen, the second "miraculous event" seems simply ridiculous. This is a pretentious and boring movie on which you should not waste your time. For a far superior - and riotously comedic - take on the issue of mortality, watch "Death Becomes Her." At least you'll have a few laughs, unlike this dog, which leaves you with nothing,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's look at the criticisms.It's unoriginal. Seriously, when was the last time you saw an original film? There are only about 6 themes possible.Lack of emotional range of the main character. She is from a by-gone age and she is emotionally mature. As you age, you stop acting like a hysteronic teenager. Predictable? Not so much.Adeline suffers the emotional losses of aging while not getting to look forward to the peace that mature adults know will eventually come our way. She is forced, by her chromosomes, to survive but not to enjoy life. She is stuck with the inability to have a relationship that enjoys the journey from youth and vitality to age and the mutual fade to black. She benefits from the gift of perspective that comes only with age. She also suffers from the gift of perspective in that she knows what will happen in the lives of others.As they say in Texas, this isn't her first rodeo. And it's a rodeo that lacks an ending.Until.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie all the way to the end. Blake Lively was great and the story was very much along the lines of a TV show that sadly was canceled, namely Forever. I marked it down to a 6 because of the way it ended (would have given it an 8 if the ending was better). It took millions of volts of lightening and special circumstances to make her what she was and in the end after all the years of her searching for a way to reverse it, and not finding a way to do so mind you, turns out she only needed a defibrillator. I believe it would have been better to let it end with her still being immortal and getting happiness too, but thats just me. Great movie but bad ending, imho.Thanks, Wes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Career Best Performance by Blake Lively</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Age of Adaline was not something I expected to love so much. The idea of tampered aging wasn't anything new to me and I wasn't excited to see another modern love story. But I found myself severely invested in this movie. There were times I completely forgot to jot notes down in my notebook...for there weren't any. This film is one of the best American romantic dramas to come along in a while. Starring Blake Lively, in a career best performance, The Age of Adaline is a beautiful movie in all aspects. It is Shakespearean in nature. It deals with love in a supernatural context, of which the inexplicable remains unexplained, for its outcome is all that matters to us.The movie is about a woman who develops the ability to never age. The film focuses on her, almost as a metaphorical character study, on how the major events and emotions of her life are stifled and affected by her condition. Her daughter grows older than her. She avoids love for fear of loss. And, she's always on the move. Attachment is her fear, yet one day, a man comes around and things start to change.In a wonderful and scene stealing performance, Harrison Ford gives his best and most inspired performance since 42. For some, it may be strange seeing Ford not in his typical action-star tough guy. But, his acting in this film is nonetheless affecting, subtle, and impressive. Alongside him, stealing the show is my beloved Ellen Burstyn. She is simply sublime in everything she does and nothing changes here. She steals every scene she's in, even getting me to choke up in the final scene, as her ability to pass along emotion with a look of the eyes is an unmatched ability amongst this generation of film actors. I am also impressed with Lee Toland Kreiger's direction and story- telling ability. He doesn't fall into any clichés with flashback storytelling in a romantic drama. He doesn't present us with every explanation in the beginning. Instead, he associates certain memories with the situation presented so that Adaline's character is presented as the film goes on. As a result, we learn more about her and get to know her better over time.The opening exposition montage is most impressive as well. The voice-over of Hugh Ross provides an objective, controlled, and undistilled narration of Adaline's early life and events leading up to the film. He comes in throughout the film as well, providing a nostalgic overtone that comforts us in a way, communicating objectivity so that we understand essential events and plot points.Lastly, and most importantly, this film, like any film, is geared towards a certain audience. Someone who's into Rambo and Terminator may not like this film as much as someone into The Notebook or Blue Valentine. So if you're reading this wondering if you'll like it or not, I tell you the kind of taste for a film like this is unique and not for everyone. And with that, I happily award this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18. It is playing in theaters now. Enjoy.Reviewed by Willie J., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

		<fullReview>I didn't like it the way i wanted to. The premise is there. The idea is good. I just didn't find it very entertaining. At certain point, i was about to quit watching it, but because a friend told me the movie was very good and one of the best he had seen this year, i didn't. I'm not sorry for that, but i won't see it again. It's a bit too slow, and nothing really interesting happens. There are no scenes that mesmerize or even to memorize. The love story is not that good also... not very convincing and it all happens too fast. I didn't like the jokes (the horse joke is very bad) and the first dialogues between the two main protagonist are laughable. I also think that the main idea is really poorly explored. They centered the entire movie around the love thing, but the perspective of life, time, lifetime and immortality are barely explained; just like her inner thoughts and feelings about it. If I could direct a movie like this I would make it very differently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively) was born on New Years Day, the year after the great San Francisco earthquake and fire. In due time, this lovely lady meets her first great love, they marry, and they have a little girl, Fleming (Ellen Burstyn as an adult). Yet, things start to unravel. Her husband is killed in an industrial accident, leaving her a young widow with a child. But, worse still, on a day of a freak snowstorm with lightning, Adaline's car slides off the road, hits water, and is struck by a bolt. She lives through the episode but a strange scientific result of the cold and electricity makes her stop aging. She is 29 for the next year and the next EIGHT DECADES. At first, folks just comment on how great she looks for her age and requests her secrets. But, soon, it is a liability to her existence. She is pulled over by police, who question the age on her license, and the FBI is interested in her, too. A life on the road begins, up and down the west coast of the USA, with new identities. Fleming grows older than her mother and moves away to Arizona. Then, too, Adaline has shunned personal relationships for the unfairness she believes the partner would endure. Nevertheless, a handsome young tech guru, Ellis (Michiel Huisman) pursues her after getting a glimpse of the fair lady named Jenny. She tries very hard to discourage him, every day, but soon he is taking her home to meet his folks. Mother Kathy (Kathy Baker) welcomes her warmly. But, in comes father William (Harrison Ford) who is stunned and exclaims Adaline! No, she says, I am Jenny, Adaline's daughter. This uncovers a second story, where, back in time, William and Adaline were also in love, but she ran away when marriage was proposed. Yet, William is transfixed and still wants to pursue who she really is. How will this play out? Will Adaline/Jenny go on the run again? Will Ellis and William both endure heartbreak and confusion? This ageless, beautiful, elegant, romantic film is everything one would want in a film. Lively is magnificent as the title character while Huisman, Ford, Baker, Burstyn, and all of the others are excellent, too. One would be hard pressed to find a better looking film, as the art direction, costumes, and sets are the finest. As for the story, it is imaginative, touching and heartbreaking. Don't, don't wait to view this near-perfect film. You, dear viewer, will not stay 29 forever so hop to it while you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies known as "chick flicks" come in a variety of actual types of movies. There are the comedies that revolve around the trials and tribulations of being a woman (think BRIDESMAIDS), there are the women seeking something more out of their lives type (think THELMA AND LOUISE) and there are what was once just called romantic movies. The thing is that most of these movies aren't limited in enjoyment by women alone. Guys like some of them as well. I have a feeling that will be the case with THE AGE OF ADALINE, and not just because guys are in love with Blake Lively.Born in 1908, Adaline Bowman (Lively) lives a normal life. She grows up, she gets married, she has a child and becomes widow. And then one fateful night it snows in California, Adaline crashes off the road ending up freezing underwater and having her car struck by lightning at the same time. The end result is that Adaline suddenly stops aging as we know it. This sets a stream of events moving forward that form the basis of our story.Years go by. Adaline continues not to age whereas her daughter (Ellen Burstyn) does. They meet often, remain close and as each decade passes Adaline changes her name and identity. She's currently Jennifer, living in San Francisco and working for a historical society. She lives with no one but her dog and avoids contact with most people having few friends. She spends New Year's Eve with one of these friends and as she leaves the party a young man jump into the elevator with her. Adaline has caught his eye and he's determined to get to know her better. Unfortunately she rebuffs his advances knowing full well where this will end.But the young man isn't that easily pushed aside. It turns out that he's a wealthy philanthropist named Ellis (Michiel Huisman) and he's about to donate some historical books where she works. IF she'll go out with him. He slowly breaks down her barriers and the two get involved, but in Adaline's mind for just a short time. She has plans on moving to start a new life, her new identity. Again, things never seem to go as planned.As the two begin to fall in love, Ellis invites Adaline aka Jennifer, to the home of his parents, William and Kathy (Harrison Ford and Katy Baker). A shock is in store for all as William immediately recognizes Adaline. It turns out that back in the sixties the two of them were involved to the point that he was about to propose to her. Passing herself off as the daughter of Adaline she calms things down. But through William's eyes the resemblance is uncanny. Can Adaline move past the problems she knows she will face should she get involved with someone? Will William's thinking he knows who she is complicate matters? And will Ellis be able to convince her to find love, be able to accept her if he learns of her problem? The movie unfolds at an even pace, never rushing things and allowing the viewer to watch learn more and more about this wonderfully complicated woman who has suffered severe pain and loneliness in a world filled with people. And that's to the benefit of the story. Various moments in the film move back and forth through time, allowing us to see the things that happened in Adaline's life that formed her into the woman she is today. While she may look 29 she's actually 107 in her mind.Director Lee Toland Krieger does a magnificent job here on several levels. To begin with his method of storytelling is superb, bringing us the bits and pieces we need to know to move the tale forward and allowing us to develop feelings for the characters. At the same time his visual styling here is wonderful to behold almost turning the film into art rather than just a movie in the way it is framed and put together. It's rare that I find movies to touch me this way and this one does it well. You want to watch not just to get the story but to just watch the images as they appear on screen.All of the actors involved here turn in great performances but Lively must be singled out. I've seen her in a few things and have never noticed her this controlled and perfect in her performances. She carries herself with an air of elegance in this role as if it were made for her, never hitting a false note from start to finish. While watching I couldn't help but think of Grace Kelly and the way she acted with that air about her that made you feel she was special.THE AGE OF ADALINE is a movie that will touch your heart. It will make you either long for a love that was lost or appreciate the one that you have, realizing that each and every moment you spend with someone is special. It's not a fluff piece of romance but a deeply felt one that will capture you in its story and hold you there until the end. In the end while some will call this a chick flick I think of it more as a movie to be enjoyed more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Escapism through film can be enjoyed through Adaline's longevity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mrs. Shullivan and I sat down to relax and watch a film that would allow us to escape the tragedies of the world events, U.S.A. political campaigning and the high cost of living. Our choice of film for this afternoon was the Age of Adaline. We were not disappointed. The fantasy/romance film Age of Adaline stars Blake Lively as Adaline who was perfect as the ageless 29 year old beauty who through what is described as a scientific phenomena combined with a horrific car accident survives what would otherwise have lead to her sudden death. Adaline realizes that she has miraculously been frozen in time at the age of 29 and through the forthcoming decades she will remain ageless to the point that her only child a daughter named Flemming, will continue to age to the point where daughter must introduce herself as Adaline's grandmother to the current love of her life in the 21st century.Adaline eventually lets down her guard when she runs in to her lovers parents and this light hearted family exchange of past events through a board game of Trivial Pursuit rekindles old memories of an earlier romance that occurred four decades earlier. Of course we the audience have to let our imagination run wild and give praise to both the screenwriter and director who pull off this chain of events in a most intriguing movie experience.Adaline's most current love Ellis Jones is played by Michiel Huisman who when approached by his father William Jones played by the legendary actor Harrison Ford with the question "Why do you love her?" Ellis responds with something like this "because I just don't understand who she is". Father William then throws the keys to his car to his son Ellis and acknowledges that his son's love is true and he needs to go after her before he loses her as other past lovers have lost her over the decades.Adaline has been running from her past for several decades and has been successful in keeping her secret life of longevity between herself and her aging daughter Flemming played by Ellen Burstyn. The ending of some other interesting fantasy films fall flat in the films ending, but such is not the case with this film. Mrs. Shullivan and I really enjoyed the film and we were happy with the way the film ended. I give the film an 8 out of 10 rating and have already queued this film in to my "Must Watch Again" bin. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

Generally speaking the actors involved are phenomenal. It's a joy to watch them. Even if some situations seem a bit sugar coated (not too much though) and there is the occasional cliché in it, the science fiction element of it, still makes this very interesting.You have a lot of things that are being "told" by looks. Which again is a big part of the acting talent at hand. You may be able to see where this is going (a few indicators early on, but even without them), but it's still a fun ride to have</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An unusual mix of science fiction and romance which should satisfy any couple looking for something to mutually enjoy on the couch - as long as neither gets too pedantic about how things work 'in the real world'. Though the science is deeply flawed it is mostly as irrelevant as it is fantastic in this contrived but likable humanistic fantasy based on a real world reflection of an impossible reality. Watch for and appreciate the Hollywood production levels without that Hollywood gloss. The acting across the board is very good - though Harrison Ford does over do it just a little! For the boys, Blake Lively, the female lead, is certainly not hard to look at - and Michiel Huisman her male counterpart apparently does something for the ladies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. The acting is top class all way around, especially from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford. A real power performance from the old man himself. The movie has a narrator which is good at times, yet confusing and unneeded for most parts.A movie from which you can tell most of the events by the summary and trailer, but thats not a bad thing. They come around the different dilemmas and emotions very well, and it is so well written that you can hardly complaint of having a general idea of the events. The reason the movie only receives a six starred rating from me, is the ending. All to often in these modern days the endings are poor and this is no exception. I don't know if the directors or writers are afraid to make the unexpected endings or the unhappy endings, but it has become a problem. Take the ending away and make a new one, i'd probably have rated it eight.This being said, i am high likely overreacting a bit because of my general disappointment in endings. This is a movie worth watching and it does make an emotional impact. Well written and well performed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was take with this film for the most part. Of course, we have to suspend big time belief to accept the foundation of the thing. The question is "What would you do with over a hundred years of youth?" The woman in this film lays low. At first she is a curiosity, and, fearing the invasion of the fascist scientists and investigators, she has to go into hiding. She begins a life with another person, but because he dies young, he is never made privy to her amazing story. After one guarded moment after another (and a series of cocker spaniels) she develops a cocoon. She is pretty and smart, so eventually, along comes a guy who won't say no. He literally stalks her despite her intense efforts to avoid him. He is really handsome and incredibly rich and talented. He's every guy's worst nightmare. She parries his moves but is truly lonely. She has a ten year plan which she follows religiously, moving to new locations at intervals. Everything comes undone when she visits the guy's family. Who should be there but the much older version of a man who fell in love with her many years before. He is played by Harrison Ford. He becomes even spookier than she is. He is dumbfounded when he sees her. She uses the lame excuse that he had actually met her mother, who is now deceased. Of course, she knows the whole story. Anyway, this has to end somehow and the solution and ultimate resolution are pretty clever. A good movie and love story. Like time travel movies, you just shouldn't think too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want more time with Adaline - Flemming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively) was born in 1908 San Francisco. Her engineer husband dies in an accident building the Golden Gate Bridge. One snowy night, she crashes her car into a cold river. A lightning strike brings her back to life and stops her aging process. Her daughter Flemming starts aging past her and people starts questioning. The FBI takes her into custody but she escapes. She starts living a nomadic life taking on new identities. In the present day, her daughter Flemming (Ellen Burstyn) is moving away to Arizona. Lovelorn Ellis Jones is relentless in his pursuit of her. Ellis' father William (Harrison Ford) recognizes her as Adaline but she explains that Adaline is her mother.Ellis isn't my kind of romantic lead. He's a bit too stalkery for me although I get his appeal. The spiritual leading man in this movie is actually Harrison Ford. He is way more charismatic than Michiel Huisman. Blake Lively is perfect to be put on a pedestal. She fits this role very well. I love that she has acquired so much knowledge. The best scenes come from Ellen Burstyn with Blake. Ellen has to play the daughter. It is such a refreshing relationship. Their simple scene of eating lunch is more electric than most of the movie. I don't completely buy the romance but I am interested in Adaline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi there, I saw this movie two days ago and I was very impressed by the masterpiece of the director, at first maybe I had my doubts on whether this was just one of those futuristic nonsenses that came to be in this day and age, but fortunately I was wrong about a lot of things, the scenery in the movie was stunning, the Golden Gate Bridge spanning through time, the woman Adaline, showing no aging at all, yet despite all her mysteries and circumstances, she's fallen in love once more in a different time period, so many years in the future.The story had also its darker moments, the pursuit of Adaline by the government to try to learn her secret of eternal youth or to study her DNA sequence to determine how to mimic her condition in other people, but those darker moments didn't stop me from watching the whole story from beginning to the end and last but not least, the soundtrack was amazing, it reminded me of another masterpiece from 1999, Bicentennial Man.This movie truly deserves 10 stars or more, I hope that more movies like this one will appear in the not so distant future.To conclude my review, the decision to include Kathy Baker, Harrison Ford, Blake Lively and others, was the right one, I thought that he would not have appeared again in a timeless romance with dark edges around but, after seeing his performance as Han Solo again in the latest Star Wars movie, there were no doubts at all, he lived up to my expectations and showed me that he can still surprise audiences.I keep my fingers crossed for his new performance as Indiana Jones 5, should he decide to reappear there soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Age of Adeline has a superb cast; in particular Blake Lively performs her role elegantly and exudes wisdom beyond her years throughout. The fantasy story-line is told with a scientific, amid imaginary, explanation for how a being can stop aging. Aside from predictable moments, The Age of Adeline satisfies those of us who are inclined to like a bit of magic, romance and a strong female lead.A good choice to watch on your own or with like-minded people. Do not expect to be put through a world-wind of emotions, nonetheless, there are moments where excitement and shock prevail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adaline, a widowed young woman and mother of one, officially born in 1908, remains miraculously youthful her entire life following a freak auto accident--to the point where her now-elderly daughter has to introduce herself as her mother's grandmother. This bizarre occurrence, which took place after Adaline was submerged--deceased--in freezing water, but revived by lightning, has the girl constantly changing her address and identity...and running from any man who falls in love with her. Extremely well-made romantic drama, one with a new story wrinkle which isn't quite as gimmicky as one might initially think. Lovers Blake Lively and Michiel Huisman are easily outshone by their on-screen elders (Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker as Huisman's folks, and Ellen Burstyn as Lively's daughter), and events in the film's final third follow an amusingly predictable pattern. Nevertheless, an engrossing, entertaining weeper for its target audience. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Age of Adaline's story isn't for everyone. I know a lot of people who aren't a fan of romantic films, especially ones that can be a bit cheesy. But the reality is that The Age of Adaline is a pretty solid film. It definitely has it's sappy moments, but the film turns out to be very satisfying. It's rare to have a love story that actually feels real these days, so I think we should cherish them when we get them.Starring the gorgeous Blake Lively, Michiel Huisman from Game of Thrones, Ellen Burstyn, and of course, Harrison Ford rounds out the ensemble cast. All of the performances are really really good. I was surprised at just how well Lively and Huisman's chemistry played out on screen, even if at first Huisman comes off a little bit creepy towards Adaline. Credit should also be given to Ford, who I wrongfully thought would have phoned in a role like this, but he gave quite the emotional performance.If you can get past the absurdity of the premise of the film and look at it more like a Forrest Gump or Big Fish, I think it's an easier watch. With that said, the narration for the film is extremely unnecessary and actually weakens the experience a bit. That part of the film feels more pretentious than anything else.There are a few silly moments that exude plenty of clichéd cheesy moments, but there's more good than bad here. The relationships and performances are undeniably well realized, especially Ford. The Age of Adaline isn't perfect, but it's one of the most surprisingly pleasant films to come out this year.+Ford is great+Chemistry between Lively and Huisman+For a far-fetched story, it's surprisingly grounded in realism-Annoying narration7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a great romantic movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely adored 'The Age Of Adaline'. I don't understand why it didn't seem to get a lot of buzz when it came out. Blake Lively is mesmerising as Adaline and Michiel Huisman is handsome as Ellis Jones. Although Ellis Jones could have done with a little more character development.I loved how 'The Age Of Adaline' made me think about passing time and lives regrets. Especially Adaline's relationship with her daughter Flemming made me think how views of life and experience can differ. Blake Lively really made me believe she was eternally young, her wardrobe, hairstyle and posture reflected the grace and wisdom of a woman who has seen the world change. She had something timeless, like the brilliant vintage dresses she wore.This movie might be geared more towards women, with the hairstyles, makeup and dresses of the different time periods Adaline lives in. I actually appreciate that this movie embraces a female audience. I don't understand, as a woman who likes cinema, why 'chick-flick' is a derogatory term. What's wrong with a movie that's geared towards woman? But still I don't actually think that this movie is a typical 'chick-flick'. I think many men will also appreciate this movie for it's originality and visual beauty.This movie is visually gorgeous. It almost looks like a photo-shoot for a glossy fashion magazine, this fits the tone and style of the film. The beautiful colours are a breath of fresh air since the recent trend of grey tones in Hollywood movies.So as you've probably guessed from this review, I absolutely adored this movie. The story was believable even through it's fantastical elements. Visually it was breathtaking and the acting was great. This movie was original and well developed. Truly a great romantic movie that i'll surely rewatch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really found myself drawn into this unusual movie. A slice of everyday life it isn't. But for entertainment value, I feel as if I lucked into this one. If you're looking for an escape at the end of the day, this could be it.The plot is totally implausible but it does make a great story. The movie deals with how Adaline's life is transformed by one supernatural event and how she manages this occurrence with the people she encounters during her life on the fringes of a changing society, where she lives as something of a recluse. I liked the performance of Blake Lively whose low key and secretive life was neatly combined with the compelling and confident personality we see on screen. Ellis Jones, Adaline's romantic interest, played by Michiel Huisman, is the one man who cracks the code of secrecy some 80 years after Adaline begins to assume a series of separate personas. There were strong supporting performances by Harrison Ford, as Ellis's father William Jones, who had an earlier relationship with Blake, and Ellen Burstyn as the aging daughter of Adaline. The changing period sets were well coordinated and added a satisfying contrast between the modern and vintage backgrounds. Recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A perfectly harmless and well intentioned drama, The Age of Adaline is one of those films that never once threatens to become something more than expected but it reaches all its goals none the less thanks to Blake Lively (not so much her acting but her melt a thousand hearts smile), an intriguing story and a nice production design that helps the film overcome its Hallmark movie pedigree.While comparisons where originally made to the somewhat similar The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, it becomes quite clear after 30 or so minutes that Adaline is a different beast to David Fincher's polarizing classic of a man aging in reverse. Whilst there's a narrator who occasionally pops up to give some explanation on why things are the way they are (Lively's Adaline Bowman stops aging thanks to some pesky lightning) this is eventually a much more simple story of love and regret and in many ways Adaline's condition takes a back seat to some more conventional dramatic romance arcs that keep the film ticking alone without ever becoming overly involving.It's hard to feel as though Adaline got the most out of its set up by the films end, the idea of someone watching on as their friends, lovers, children and countless pets age and pass on is ripe for both emotional resonance and tension yet the film seems somewhat afraid to go all out and plays things pretty straight considering the implausibility of its main foundation.Some of the films lesser qualities can be traced back to the central romance of Adaline and Ellis her new found love. Ellis as played by Michiel Huisman is never really charismatic enough to make the viewer feel like Adaline would all of a sudden change her ways and Lively and Huisman share a somewhat uneasy chemistry that never truly sparks. By the films later stages when the older than ever looking Harrison Ford shows up as Ellis's father, you wish that the film focused a little more on his side of the story.A film that is exactly what you expected it to be, Age of Adaline could've most certainly become something much more had it nailed stronger casting decisions and made some bolder plot choices but overall this is a well-produced and well intentioned drama that's easy on the eyes and easy to enjoy.3 pet photo albums out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A most unusual, original and wonderful love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a wonderful love story based on an original story. I've never seen a dramatic fantasy love story told in this way before and this one I found captivating. Soon after Adaline Bowman becomes a mother and then, tragically, a widow, a freak San Francisco snow storm in 1935 causes her to crash into a lake and drown. She is age 27. When a lightning strike to the car revives her, she is unaware that it mysteriously halted her aging process. In order for Adaline to live life without being questioned by inquisitive friends, relatives and authorities, every ten years she changes her name, her residence to another state and her job, essentially becoming an entirely new person. The knowledge she gains from living so long she uses to her advantage to make wise investments that pay off over decades. This enables her to live a life of leisure. This blessing of eternal youth has a curse. Because she cannot allow anyone to learn the truth of her real age, she must live away from her beloved daughter (only reached by phone) and she can never fall in love again. But she does in the 1960's with an astronomy major (Harrison Ford) and she knows how this will end. From then on Adaline constantly dismisses would be male suitors with charm and quick wit. Her only real friend is a blind lady who is years Adaline's senior. She must live a life of heartache and loneliness. Aside from the paradox of her looking age 27 but being 107, there is the one of avoiding acquaintances from the past. Despite her intelligence and resourcefulness, Adaline is unable to provide a logical explanation for her youth and vows not to cause men heartbreak when she must leave them unexpectedly. Just as nature is unpredictable so can be human destiny. Little does Adaline realize in present day when she meets her equal, a young intelligent college graduate, whom she allows to befriend her and develop a relationship with, that she has opened Pandora's box. That first fleeting moment of eye contact between the two across a crowded room foreshadowed their destiny for a reason. Her simple life becomes inextricably complicated. The unpredictable climax between Lively and Ford centers on whether she will again flee an impossible circumstance or fight for her feelings of unconditional love. The irony is brilliantly directed. The film moves along through decades seamlessly. The script is tightly written and the beautiful Blake Lively does a masterful acting job with sincere cunning dialogue, refined inflections of her voice and nuances of her facial expressions that elicit empathy. The writing and directing are so good here that I was pleased by this film's lack of love-hate relationships and violins in the background that have traditionally enhanced romantic films. "Age of Adaline" is now on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Age of Adaline" is Timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adaline Bowman was born in the early 1900s, and around the age of 30, after crashing her car into water, lightning strikes and the narrator explains how that lightning strike somehow changed her cells or something and made it to where her body stopped aging. Miraculously impossible but this movie presents it in a way where it seems remarkably believable. Maybe it's because of all the uber-scientific words the narrator spouts out. After all, when someone starts to use words like that that I don't understand, I tend to just take them at their word. No, it's not because I'm extremely gullible, it's just that by that point I don't care. Anyway, she tries to keep it a secret, but when the police start investigating and then arrest her, she immediately changes identity and moves to a new place. Her daughter ages while she doesn't, and when people start seeing how close in age she looks to her daughter, or how people Adaline's age appear remarkably older than she, she starts changing identity and moving to a new place each ten years. Once we know her past, the film takes us to modern day, January, 2015. With technology the way it is these days, it would seem that the government would have easily tracked her down by now, but no, it's still a secret known only to her and her daughter.Then things start to change. At a New Year's Eve party, Ellis Jones sees her and immediately decides he wants to meet her. He chases her down, sticking his hand in the elevator door before it closes so he can get in with her and meet her. By this time we're thinking, "Man, he must be desperate," and maybe he is because he doesn't stop going after her. They go on a date or two, and she's made it pretty clear that she doesn't want this relationship to develop, but he's made up his mind that he does. Adaline's been trying to avoid relationships because she knows she will age and they won't. After a date he tells her a joke, and if she laughs, he gets to take her on another date, but if she doesn't she won't have to. The joke is horrible, and she even says so herself. Whether because a deep part of her wants to fall in love again, or she doesn't want to disappoint him, or whatever the reason she forces a laugh. And they fall in love. Anyway, he invites her to go with him to celebrate his parents' anniversary, but when she gets there, and she meets his parents, things go horribly wrong. His father, Michael Jones (Harrison Ford) recognizes her, and she immediately recognizes him too. He and she had been in a previous relationship, and he balks as soon as he sees her. She gets away by telling him that Adaline was her mother, who is now dead. With old memories rekindled, he rambles on about her, embarrassing everyone in the vicinity by calling her "sophisticated" with a huge, nostalgic sigh."The Age of Adaline" is an enormously intriguing and engaging film. Director Lee Toland Krieger and Blake Lively do a wonderful job in capturing Adaline's "sophistication" and old-fashionedness, even putting a dimple on her cheek for emphasis. "The Age of Adaline" is timeless.85/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."The Age of Adaline" (2015) is a fantasy romance drama. The plot wasn't really fresh, but the story is intriguing. As much as it was intriguing, equally it was manipulative. Manipulative - that word came to my mind lots of time when watching this story, because this is a very manipulative plot line - sometimes you can see it coming by a mile, and plausibility is minimum - there coincidences in this story that are NOT believable, but they looks nice and watchable. Acting was uniformly good by all involved. Script is involving although like i mentioned it is way to manipulative and predictable - but this doesn't mean it's bad. I liked this movie, it was very involving from beginning till end. Pacing of this picture is very good, at running time 1 h 45 min it never drags. Overall, "The Age of Adaline" is a guilty pleasure. The story is involving but way to manipulative and predictable. But acting and directors good sense for pacing makes this movie very watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time when I saw the trailer, I thought it might be a female version or a close kind of 'Winter's Tale'. Though this is not a fairy tale, but a heartwarming sci-fantasy romedy. For every action in the movie they explained it very clearly, that's the indication of the involvement of the science, but mostly bogus for the present era. So that is where fantasy steps in.A beautiful concept with the wonderful cast. And again they did not make full use of it, lacked a deep exploration into the theme they have created for this movie. Blake Lively solely handled the movie and none others were up to the expectation, expect Harrison Ford in his about 5% of the screen presence.Like most of the guys, I am displeased with the ending. Till then I was enjoying the film, but later it ruined my mood. Because humans are always desiring for things which are out of his league and I'm human too. Since I'm not Adaline I was rooting her and I was disappointed once the twist at the end came. Later I accepted that, because it was a perfect conclusion regarding whatever I wanted.In an entertainment movie, sometime we won't care about what's good and bad, but need some good pleasure for the time we spend for it. Especially in this kind of theme, which are out of reality, we usually love a happy ending. Because families want to leave the cinema hall with a good mood as it is indeed targeted for family audiences. So I am not going to spoil you by revealing facts about the movie, but I think you should watch it if you like modern world fantasy.6?/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Rating: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606; out of 4)This film is recommended. In brief: A entertaining, if uneven, romantic story with no age spots in sight.GRADE: BThe Age of Adaline is pure unadulterated soap opera. Well done, but still a product of that genre. It spins its romantic tale of time travel with a high fetched premise of the perils of immortality and love. The plot is this: Through a series of miraculous events, Adaline Bowman (a fetching Blake Lively) no longer ages and continues to live a productive, if lonely, life. She becomes a fugitive from the FBI who want to investigate her never-ending youthful appearance. (It is at this point I began to question why executives from Maybelline and Estee Lauder were not in on this conspiracy also.) Forsaking her daughter and other lovers, she is forced on the run, leading a solitary existence, that is, until a handsome and rich CEO (Michiel Huisman) comes into her life.&#xfffc;Director Lee Toland Krieger brings enough style and polish to disguise this sudsy story and keeps the action moving as more and more complications ensue. The surprising twists never really surprise but they do hold one's interest. The film's script by J. Mills Goodloe and Salvador Paskowitz sidesteps much of the melodramatic nonsense and establishes characters and relationships well.All of the characters are dressed to the nines and look gorgeous, nary a blemish in sight, especially for the ageless Miss A. (This has to be the most attractive cast ever assembled...no homely actors need apply.) The actors bring overdue credibility to the film. In the lead role, Blake Lively gives a fine performance as does the charming as Mr. Huisman, her love interest. Both actor exude the necessary chemistry to solidify their relationship on screen. Strong support is given by Ellen Burstyn as Adaline's daughter, Fleming, and Harrison Ford as William, a rejected lover from the past life. Kathy Baker has some strong scenes as William's wife.&#xfffc;Romance novelist Barbara Cartland would surely have given her stamp of approval on this love story. The Age of Adaline remains highly enjoyable lightweight hokum, particularly for those romantics among us.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Writers J.

It works on many levels ? a fine romance in a Dorian Gray sort of manner ? largely due to a very competent and engaging cast. The film is directed by Lee Toland Krieger ? a new, young director with talent.Though the film is rather long, the plot can be summarized as follows without giving away the ending which would be considered a spoiler: 'After miraculously remaining 29 years old for almost eight decades, Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively in a strong role) has lived a solitary existence, never allowing herself to get close to anyone who might reveal her secret. But a chance encounter with charismatic philanthropist Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman, the Dutch actor best known for this Game Of Thrones exposure) reignites her passion for life and romance. When a weekend with his parents threatens to uncover the truth, Adaline makes a decision that will change her life forever.'The supporting cast includes Harrison Ford ? in fine fettle as an older father -, Ellen Burstyn as Adaline's daughter (a true stretch of the imagination but carried off very well), Kathy Baker, and Amanda Crew.

		<fullReview>This is a poignant film about a beautiful young woman doomed by her gift of agelessness that reminds one of Francis Ford Coppola's Youth Without Youth. The movie's voice-over narration bears a striking resemblance with that of Andrew Dominik's "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford". Blake Lively as Adaline is a sight to behold. Adaline is a kind of a woman any man would fall for (her beauty coupled with her intelligence makes her irresistible). We can't help but laugh when she laughs and cry when she cries. Michiel Huisman (Daario Naharis from GoT) is quite charming in the role of a foolhardy lover. The rest of the cast puts up a wonderful show with a special mention of Harrison Ford. Barring a rather expected twist towards the end of the film, The Age of Adaline proves to be a delectable watch.

		<shortDescription>Simply beautiful!... Especially for a non-lover of the romance genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply a beautiful love story. They don't do love stories like how they used to anymore. Supposed romantic movies are filled with gratuitous sex, and lack the sophistication and intrigue that occurs when potential lovers truly court each other. This movie is filled with discourse and emotion that evokes feelings deep within. I don't really like love stories because of the nonsense that is around, but this is one that I must have to watch when I need to reassure myself that there are still good writers and actors out there. I was never a Blake Lively fan, but she has made me see what she is capable of if given the right role. Thank you writers and actors for such an amazing story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent mixture of excellent performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I greatly enjoyed "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," and it struck me that this movie had the potential to be another Benjamin-Button-type story - trying to get into the head of someone whose journey through life is anomalous."The Age of Adeline" excels.Key to the whole movie is Blake Lively's interpretation of the title character, Adeline - a woman who, as a result of an accident, remains physiologically at the age of 29. For 80 years. The role requires a balance of youthful energy and aged wisdom; the performance, to really work, has to carry with everything Adeline does a sense of someone who has already experienced everything. Very little can be "new" to Adeline, and there would have to be a sense of fatigue in the character.Ms. Lively does it all, and does it nearly perfectly. In every scene we get the sense that Adeline is hesitant to connect with anything, because nothing could be as permanent as she. Lively's eyes convey an excellent sense of fatigue, wariness, anxiety and wisdom - but most of all, a feeling of abiding loneliness - that made me feel that she had made Adeline real. Her performance demands an Oscar nomination, at the very least.Of course, her performance would have gone nowhere without an excellent cast ti support her. Michiel Huisman is perfect as Ellis, the young man who falls in love with Adeline, and patiently nurtures a relationship with a woman who believes that a long-term relationship is impossible. Harrison Ford is outstanding as Ellis' father, and Kathy Baker compliments Ford as his wife, Kathy. And Ellen Burstyn is excellent - and an anchoring presence - as Flemming, Adeline's (80-year-old) daughter. We don't get to see enough of older actresses like Burstyn, who adds tremendous depth to this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does a good job of staying away from cookie cutter ideas &amp; actually seemed like a fresh take on the genre. My wife loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Adaline will be immune from the ravages of time. She will never age another day." Adaline (Lively) has the perfect life. She has a perfect daughter and a husband she loves more than anything. While driving home one night she has a terrible accident, but then something strange happens. From that day on Adaline will not age. 107 years later she has accepted her fate and is trying to live her life. When she meets Ellis (Huisman) she begins to rethink how she feels about love. This is actually not a bad movie. That said, I am a guy and this is a very hardcore romance movie. My wife and daughter loved it. I thought it was OK but this is not my type of movie. The movie itself does a very good job of staying away from the cookie cutter romance movie and actually had some pretty original ideas that made it seem fresh. The movie, like most movies like this, is a little predictable. On the other hand though, you don't watch this type of film to be surprised and for a ton of twists. Overall, a very good date movie that my wife and daughter loved and I thought was OK. I give this a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Age of AdalineThe easiest way to tell someone's real age is by looking at his or hers liver-spotted hands.Fortunately, every body-part of the immortal in this love story is rejuvenated regularly.After a series of unfortunate events leaves her with eternal youth, recently widowed single-mother Adaline (Blake Lively) makes her way through the decades, unaltered in her appearance or her age.Fearful of being dissected for scientific study, she avoids detection by playing granddaughter to her elderly daughter (Ellen Burstyn).It's not until a new love interest (Michiel Huisman) introduces her to an old flame (Harrison Ford) that Adaline's ageless secret is compromised.Despite its shaky science and predictable outcome, The Age of Adaline is a textured romance that takes a realistic view of life everlasting, particularly its unending complications involving love.What's more, Adeline gets to experience all that immortality has to offer without having to eat any small children.

The fears of falling in love and attachment, are well signified.There is an important message at about 1:42:00 run time...for those in love and even those not. We seldom value what we have, or what comes as gift of life to us.H Ford adds the flashback to the character's life and just when the script seems so predictable, it takes you by surprise, to spring a new turn.

		<shortDescription>High concept, low returns.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wasn't so much that this movie was bad, as it was pointless. The concept was interesting, even if their attempts to explain Adaline's agelessness were bizarre, however the plot never took it anywhere. And any conflict the film introduced was quickly brushed aside with little fanfare. Even so much as Adaline explaining her true identity to Ellis ended up happening off-screen. When Adaline's daughter shows up and introduces herself to him as her grandmother, Adaline just says, "Oh he knows the truth." And they never even then say what that truth is, or revise the introduction. Nothing about this movie stands out, and I'll forget it as quickly as I watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes You Wonder What You Would Do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, this movie had an involving story that was tough to put down, and I don't have many love stories in my big DVD collection....but this kept my attention.The two leads - "Adaline," played by Blake Lively and "Ellis," played by Michiel Huisman - were fine. I thought Lively was a very, very pretty woman and I enjoyed looking at her throughout the movie. Her boyfriend, played by Huisman, was a little too bold at first but likable from that point.....a genuinely nice guy. The movie was beautifully directed and filmed, filled good shots and very pretty photography. I watched it on Blu-Ray) on a 50-inch set and it looked magnificent. They definitely were careful to show each generation accurately (clothing, hair, cars, etc.). A couple of random thoughts: If this was a real story, it would be interesting (and totally freaky) to look as good as "Adaline" and see your daughter now as an old woman (Ellen Burstyn, who is 82 years old as I type this). That would be too weird to even think about. One part of the movie that hit me was thinking how I'd react being in Harrison Ford's shoes, to see the woman he was going to marry but left him holding the ring, suddenly appear 40-50 years later and still look the same! Wow, that would be shock, to say the least!!Anyway, the movie really got me thinking and daydreaming about life and how fast times goes. Movies like this can do that, leaving you to ask yourself, "Could I have gone that long and not told anyone this huge secret?" My answer is, "No, I couldn't." Two movies reminiscent of this come to mind: TOMORROW IS FOREVER (1946) with Orson Welles and Claudette Colbert, where Welles has a big dilemma, and SOMEWHERE IN TIME (1980) with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, in which Reeves travels back in time. Both are heart-rendering love stories that can be frustrating at times, with people who hold secrets - as this "Adaline" story is.Lastly: I wonder why they spelled "Adeline" with an "a." Never seen that before and I'm more- than-familiar with the name. It was my mother's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best drama-fiction movie I've ever seen in this year. Blake Lively takes her character to another level, if we get in mind the old ones of her. THe history is full of mystery, and you feel like you are on the screen when you see her past and how it affects her. I personally cried when she meets her daughter at the restaurant already older than herself. I recommend this movie that is a perfect story to watch and reflect about dying, getting old e living. When you stop and think about the end of the film, you see that her's biggest dream is to die, and she gets it when she almost die, just like how she get immortality. See the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely give a movie a perfect 10, but this one deserves it. The acting was brilliant. The pace and imagery, fantastic. The dialog and plot were outstanding. This was a very emotional story and it was so well done, I watched it twice in a row, which I never ever do with any movies because then they are spoiled for me. This movie was even better the second time, because I watched it with my wife and she really liked it, which makes my experience better too. My kids (ages 11 &amp; 13) even liked the movie, which is a feat in itself. Blake Lively did a real professional acting job in this film. She was so very convincing, and was so perfect as the love interest for the two male characters, that I could see myself falling for this woman. If this film can accomplish that, it was extremely well done. Blake Lively is not only beautiful, but had a class and sophistication, mannerisms and even her walk was attractive.The story was very complex, deep, historical, and very emotional because you can feel the pain bottled up in the main character (Blake Lively).Don't miss this one. They don't make them like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are little things that can actually surprise. Life itself is one of them. When you are part of life you know you cannot have any regrets. Only one could arise... and that is just not sharing the joy of life. Throughout our brief existence we search endlessly for a moment that we can forever carry within ourselves and never forget. What if we cannot find that moment and we are stuck in an endless loop of self oblivion? Life itself can be summarized as a moment; an endless moment. All we need to do is to allow ourselves to see past that limitation that us humans have when we come in contact with greatness. Life is nothing but a moment. A moment that we actually have to live. Living that moment to the fullest will just make us become part of greatness, part of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An instant classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start with praising the lead actress: Blake Lively was portraying the character with such perfection and delicacy which you can rarely see in movies. Of course it helped a lot that the character was a deep, lyric and full-of-emotion woman which gave space for a good actor to show their skills. And Lively definitely nailed it.The story is clever and very well written. The looks of the movie is amazing. The love line is nicely built up and is something that most of us can relate to. All of us has a person in our life who we couldn't get and forget.(((There's maybe one momentum in the movie that I found weird and stupid, when Adaline says:"Tell me something I can hold onto forever and never let go." - I cannot really explain why I found it wrong but had to mention it. And of course this little sentence doesn't make the movie less a bit.)))</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The relevance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to say that this film was something I have been looking up for a long time. Even if it says that genre of this movie is drama, but I totally believe that movie contains a psychological plot as well. The writers of this movie pointed out one extremely relevant issue of these days. How can we trust other people? Do we have to flee and hide every time we feel the danger? Do we have to stop ourselves from falling in love and being happy just because of our secrets? What kind of life is that? To my mind, it is vital for everyone to overcome their fears and let themselves to experience the life. The life that will make them feel alive. "The Age of Adeline" is a perfect reminder for us of this topic. Another important problem reflected in the movie is getting old. In the world where many people would like to stay young for as long as they can seeing how much trouble young beauty can make might be shocking. But it is important to understand, how amazing it is to get old with the people one love - friends, one's children or the loved ones. This movie might cause a revolution in many people's lives and this is what I love about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Girl's movie but done well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Involving metaphysical romantic drama doesn't emotionally combine together in its final 30 minutes as much as it implies but actress Blake Lively's and the cast's sensitive, low-key performances illuminates the picture's larger ideas well. A kind of simpler TREE OF LIFE for the love-story crowd, Lively portrays resistant time traveler Adaline Bowman, an intelligent young single mother whose DNA was rendered frozen by an freak electrical accident during the 1930s and must now live in constant anonymity lest arousing suspicion from authorities. Finally safe in a San Francisco library job while her now-elderly daughter (Ellen Burstyn) encourages her to settle down, Bowman meets free-sprited accomplished artist Ellis Jones (Michael Huisman) who falls in love with her and while taking her to meet his family, inadvertently causes a traumatic meeting between his own happily-married father/astronomer William (Harrison Ford) and Adaline, who strongly had an affair decades before and forcing a literally-cosmic dilemma where Adaline must choose to expose herself and remain with Ellis or destroy her own future. Appropriately, the film has an excessively dark, muted look throughout, accepting more exterior &amp; time-lapse shots and close-ups as it progresses, and the subtle use of songs and musical score don't hype or interfere much with the emotionally brittle dramatics. Director Lee Toland Krieger (who appears to have worked mostly in shorts and indie films) doesn't really seem to want to apply the deepest level of artistic/historic/romantic cruelty that would make him more deliberately comparable here to the early work of Brian De Palma or Roman Polanski but I did like his very naturalistic staging and use of time progression. Overall, THE AGE OF ADALINE comes off a very sweet, modest, well-acted love story with limited literary pursuit of its own abstract potential but is also a very fine new cinematic credit for its director and star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool concept with great acting and cinematography but horrible narration.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll just start off with the things I did like. The acting was really great in this. Lively encaptures her character so well that her mannerism and speech is so believably that of someone with a lot of experience. Not to mention that she looks stunning all the time, but of course she has too, because that is what women are pretty much reduced to in (most parts of) the world. Huisman does a good job too, and of course his character has to be the wealthy young man who gets what he wants. Plus there is a short shirtless scene which just makes everything right. I really like the addition of Regan (Lynda Boyd) who is one of Adaline's friend from one of her aliases, and because Regan is blind, she is able to stay friends with her. Boyd brings some charisma and comedy into the film and their friendship is really something special and I wished it could have been explored more.The whole setting and atmosphere was something-else I really liked. The cinematography and editing really helps to bring the time periods to life, and the flashbacks especially were well done. The costumes too helped tremendously, and they looked really great. The blending of the old clothing in the new age really helps to bring Adaline's character to light and reminds the audience that she is actually almost a century old.OK, on to the things that made this disappointing. First off, the narration almost made this a comedy. Right from the beginning of the film, the narration comes across as corny and really fake. The disembodied voice totally detracts itself from the film and though Hugh Ross does sound very omniscient and serious, it doesn't come across like that. The narration pretty much ruins the atmosphere, but luckily there isn't very much of it. For scenes with the accident they should have just left it alone, and not added a voice- over to explain things. Perhaps it seemed very childish or unnecessary, but near the end with the narration (around the same time that there was also a very corny close-up of Huisman) I could barely stop myself from bursting out that I had to pinch my nose. It probably didn't help that a few girls behind me were snorting. You know that feeling you get when nothing funny is actually happening but you feel the urge to laugh randomly when everything is silent? That was me.That was my main issue with the film. The rest doesn't impact the film as much as the narration does, but I have a small problem with the timeline and the events that happened in her past. Like I said, the flashbacks were well done, but I am confused when I try to piece some of the past together ? especially her leaving London. Adding to that, the story could have been better developed in the sense of character development. The audience just sees Adaline a bit lonely and nostalgic before falling in love and that's basically it. If there was more of a struggle and a depiction of why she struggled in the first place (this can not be the first time she was tempted in her whole life) it would have added more depth to the story.So even though this is a pretty good concept and touches on the issue of how everyone is obsessed with youth, the narration just killed it for me. Furthermore, the acting, setting, atmosphere and costumes were great, but a clearer explanation of past events would help as well as more character development.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

(the remake) as I found Audrey's portrayal of Sabrina weak. I loved her interaction with her past, and the telling of the tale. I don't think a better cast could have been found. To the cast I say Well done, I was mesmerized and entertained which is what I go to the movies for. Not to be lectured or to try and find a hidden meaning.

		<shortDescription>A Mature Romanticist Depiction of Immortality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not your everyday romance film, with a premise revolving around immortality and not being able to form relationships at its core which may be deemed far-fetched but instead it produces an aura of classic Hollywood magic.Lively is beautiful in this role and gives the film its emotional strength, further reinforcing her talent as a leading actress; her performance is also aided by the excellent supporting cast featuring Harrison Ford and Ellen Burstyn who's characters further reflect the themes of aging.David Lanzenburg's cinematography has a golden nostalgic feel as the camera sweeps throughout San Francisco and captures the intimacy between characters. My only flaw with this film is that I wanted Lively's character of Adaline to be fleshed out further by depicting more aspects of her past, such as the hardships of hiding her condition as well as living through key historical moments, i.e. Forrest Gump, and slowly adapt to the constantly changing world. Which could have been an additional 20 minutes or so.Regardless though, I loved this film for it was a mature and slowly-paced romance film that doesn't shove clichés down your throat and instead allows us to slowly understand her ordeal as well as her relationships with those around her. Rarely do I enjoy or even pay to go see a romance film on screen but this proves a standout in my opinion as it evoked a strong emotional response from me. 4/5</fullReview>

Blake Lively lacks the maturity to be believable. Should have chosen an actress with more depth. Lively's portrayal was unconvincing and completely distracted me from the whole movie. Is it just me or did anyone find the movie's narrator extremely annoying? I mean, come on, trust the audience to watch and understand what's going on. Don't spell everything out to us. Relationship between Adaline and Ellis lacked any real development and progressed unbelievably quick. Also, no real chemistry between the two actors and the film lacked any significant scenes that proved they were really 'in love' other than verbally saying so. Premise was good but execution was awfully lacking. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

Blake Lively was great here, she being in her late twenties, manages to convince me that she has seen a lot of years. She and Huisman have great chemistry, the love they share you instantly buy.

(Thank you very much, Mister Narrator, but I have eyes so I can see someone is driving a car, is having an accident, etc.) And from there the condescending force-feeding just doesn't let up. This movie is a great example of a creative team telegraphing to you exactly what you're supposed to feel every second, instead of letting you discover what a movie's about by yourself. After about 20 minutes, I figured the people behind this movie must be rookies, so I looked up on IMDb and saw their list of credits is pretty thin. This movie may have been OK if there had been a LOT more re-writes and a creative consultant was hired.

		<shortDescription>An unoriginal concept spun into a slow-paced but nonetheless charming tale of romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Age of Adaline explores the theme of immortality while also directing flows of romance into the story, featuring Blake Lively (Gossip Girl, Green Lantern ) as the title character that could never age and have lived for more than a century, MichielHuisman (Game of Thrones, Wild) as the 'slightly' less mature new love and Harrison Ford as an old man reminiscing about his past.Dark lighting sets up the mood of Adaline as she goes through life tranquilised with frustration of helplessness and fatigue, we follow through ancient film reels which Adaline plays in the library, setting up the story nicely alongside the adequate narration; which could have started a bit later to let us sink in more of the setting ourselves, but nonetheless does its job of supporting an unrealistic opening and cause of Adaline's conditions. Couple of scenes features wonderful scenery portrayal which relaxes the audiences from lengthy conversations and many jokes in the first hour that fell flat due to slight overacting resulting in cheapness;early on, regarding the aspect of cinematography there could have been more close ups to demonstrate the more delicate expressions Lively was able to convey. Pacing was slightly off at the beginning, with a somewhat sluggish rhythm the story proceeded through some scenes that weren't essential in the build up of the relationships between the leads, however they may be enjoyable from a romcom perspective but unsuited in this more complex production. Slow original scores composed for the soundtrack also didn't help the pacing problem, it rather slowed the story down by being over- conservatively smooth. The flashbacks were done quite well in general using theme colour variations which distinguished the better and 'brighter' past from the present, though such variations could have been emphasized more to ensure the differentiation; even though some of the flashbacks were a bit sudden, but they still foreshadowed the plot perfectly, and in the later scenes wrap the whole film up nicely with quick repetitions. In the same visual aspect, the home decorations of the Jones family illustrates exceptionally the warmth and familial centred impression of William Jones.Soft comedic elements were added in the later phase, bringing laughers which mostly focuses on William Jones to complement the slightly more cheesy comedy early on. On the makeup and costume aspect, both were done well to show the maturity of Adaline, a crucial element which distinguishes her from other characters, by at times bringing clothes with patterns that may seem odd and at times with heavy makeup. Acting wise, Blake Lively handles her character and the emotional scenes surprisingly well, given that this is her first dramatic lead other than Gossip Girl; same goes with TV star Huisman, portraying a young, kind hearted gentleman; Harrison Ford, as always seems filled with wisdom but in this particular film he portrays a rather vulnerable character, not unlike George Clooney in Up In The Air. Satisfactory chemistries were developed between the leads, and though the ending came a bit sudden, it does effectively utilise this to tie up the knot. All in all, though the theory behind Adaline's condition seems outlandish and far-fetched, the down to earth charms and romance of leads covers the flaws well enough to attract and appeal to the general audiences.

		<shortDescription>"The Age of Adaline" is one for the ages.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of us dream about the future. "What will they think of next?", we wonder as we marvel at the technological innovations of the present and try to imagine what could be on the other side of the horizon. We're curious to see how society will change with the times as we reflect back on everything we've seen already. We want the best for our children and we hope to live long enough to see them reach their goals and find happiness. Most of us wish for a long and healthy life, and would consider that a tremendous blessing. But can there really be too much of a good thing? Is it possible that longevity could, at some point, become a curse? In "The Age of Adaline" (PG-13, 1:50), one woman finds out that joy and pain can both increase with time."Adaline Bowman lived a normal life," the film's narrator tells us. Adaline (Blake Lively) grows up, marries and has a child. When Adaline's daughter, Flemming, is an old woman (and is played by Ellen Burstyn), Adaline looks like she's still in her late 20s. But that's only because she is. On an unusually cold California night, the young mother's car slid off a country road and into a stream. The combination of the frigid water and a lightning strike had a unique effect on Adaline's body. She stopped aging.A condition that some would kill for creates a very unusual problem for Adaline. An acquaintance who hasn't seen her in years expresses shock when she remarks that Adaline hasn't changed a bit. A cop who pulls Adaline over for speeding becomes suspicious of the age on her driver's license. When the attention that is attracted by her unchanging looks starts to become threatening, Adaline feels that she has no choice but to run.Eventually, she decides that she even has to start living separately from her then high school-aged daughter. The two maintain their relationship over the years with phone calls and they occasionally meet, but that is the only close relationship that Adaline allows herself. When she realizes that someone is becoming too big a part of her life, she pulls back. Everyone must be kept at arm's length. And every ten years or so, Adaline establishes a new identity and moves to a new location. No one can ever know her secret. It's better this way, she tells herself.Flemming wishes her mother could find happiness, and Adaline is tired of running, but it's all she knows? and then she meets Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman). He's young, handsome, charming, wealthy and very interested in Adaline. He senses that she's special, although he has no idea just how special. She tries to resist his attempts at starting a relationship, but (in case I didn't mention it already), he's young, handsome, charming, wealthy and very interested in Adaline. And Adaline is indeed lonely. She hesitates, but accepts his invitation to spend a weekend with his parents (Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker) to help celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary. On that trip, she encounters someone who knew her many years before. Adaline does her best to explain it all away, but her secret life is dangerously close to unraveling, just as her relationship with Ellis is getting more serious."The Age of Adaline" is wonderfully original and well-executed. The plot begs comparison to the 2008 Brad Pitt movie "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button", but this film is much smarter and more touching. This script does a good job of making what is basically a fantasy film scenario seem almost plausible, but that's beside the point. The story is so involving that it really doesn't matter how Adaline ended up in her predicament. Lively plays her as a beautiful young woman with an old soul. It's a very effective and sympathetic portrayal. We feel Adaline's heartache; we admire her intelligence, determination and resourcefulness and we wish right along with her daughter that Adaline could just be happy. The script also resists the temptation of putting too many verbal winks to Adaline's condition into the dialog. The story is very grounded for a fantasy and the plot unfolds organically, without pretense or any more artifice than is necessary for the film's premise. Most importantly, in Adaline's struggles, we see reflected the power and the many facets of love.As much as I happen to love this movie, I have to remain objective enough to point out what I saw as some minor flaws in its execution. The narration, while helping the audience understand what is happening to this woman, sometimes gets a little too wordy for its own good. The method used to fill us in about Adaline's backstory is creative, but not very well edited. Lastly, Huisman's acting is serviceable, but is a bit of a weak link in an otherwise strong chain of performances. But at the end of the day, these really are minor criticisms of what I consider to be one of the best movies I have seen this year. "The Age of Adaline" is basically a well written, terrifically acted, beautifully shot movie that tells a fascinating and original story that will tickle your brain and touch your heart. What (or maybe I should ask "when") IS the Age of Adaline? It is now. Go see this movie, before you get another day older. "A"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and Implausible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are just looking for a modern fairy tale and don't mind gliding over a barrage of constructions that are both incoherent and distracting, then by all means see this movie. But if your mind is not totally asleep by the time the movie starts and you expect some interesting story, well, don't. The cheap tricks abound in this movie: aside from the fantastic invention of a woman who stops aging because of a freak accident, the fact that same woman will do all sort of things that are just unlikely to happen to women anywhere, from escaping the FBI's custody to accidentally meeting and falling in love with the son of her former greatest love (no physical resemblance, though), to accidentally having an accident as she has decided that her new man is indeed the love of her life and, again by accident, becoming mortal again just at the right time. But what is most annoying is the psychological implausibility. Leaving aside other characters, here you have a woman that, at 107, retains all of her drive ? as if being widowed for over 70 years, living a life on the run for decades, dumping great loves, dealing with a daughter that is considering moving to a nursing home, working as a librarian, etc. over the course of all those years were not enough to sap some of her energy. I don't think many twenty-something women have that sort of positive outlook towards life these days, but perhaps you do, and you do see them going strong for another 80 years, were it not for the physical damages of time. And then the distracting bits: for example, why does her new boyfriend have to be an unwilling (and unlikely) self-made billionaire, actively engaged in doing good and nothing else, probably the best catch in San Francisco, good-looking, socially active, unquestionably heterosexual and yet totally single? I could go on, but you probably got it. This film, despite some good actors, is nowhere near the film it could have been. The implications of being stuck in time and seeing the people you love age and die are the stuff of movies that speak to your soul, like Interstellar, or Highlander, for example. Adaline is just a compromise that tries to work at a much less ambitious level, with unconvincing results.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to enjoying this movie, after reading the plot summary. Unfortunately, my hopes were not realized. The movie turned out to be a cliché ridden, "seen that a million times", Hallmark special quality number. I was intrigued by the first 5-10 minutes while the story had settled in. In that short period of time, Blake Lively seemed engaging and mysterious. After that, she continued using the same facial expressions for the remainder of the movie, delivering a wooden performance, in spite of all the obstacles, challenges, and losses that her character had to experience. She failed to deliver an emotional state of mind of her heroine. Another huge disappointment was the lead character. Saying that he delivered a wooden performance could be considered a compliment. He sleep walked through the role. There was zero chemistry between him and the female lead. I kept thinking what Bradley Cooper might have done with this role. I believe that the root of the failed opportunities is the weak script that failed to show character development and an emotional growth of the main character, considering her unique circumstances. Bottom Line: Find something better to do with your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Age of Adaline is a flat nondenominational film. I went to see this film to compare to the film Highlander. I want curious to compare Adaline's character development to that of Connor MacLeod. Highlander (1986). There is no character development. Adaline was cold, impersonal, uncaring and uninteresting. The story is predictable and the out come easily surmised shortly into the film. The main 'love interest' or relationship the film depicts, in a word - predictable. On the plus side - filmed on location. Although traveling through the city, the director, took the 'scenic route' to travel 2 and a half blocks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow and sentimentally but quietly satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a whole sub-genre of movies which 'play' with time and this film falls firmly in that category. Most of such movies are science fiction (such as "Twelve Monkeys" or "Edge Of Tomorrow") or thrillers (such as "Source Code" or "Looper") or romances (such as "Groundhog Day" or "The Time Traveler's Wife"). "The Age Of Adaline" is a romance between the eponymous young woman who, thanks to some mysterious science, is 'fixed' at just 29 for almost eight decades (played by Blake Lively) and San Francisco philanthropist Ellis (Dutch actor Michiel Huisman). Like all stories that mess about with time, one has to suspend belief and, in this case, the narrative is rather slow and sentimental but its main attraction is Lively who performs the central role in an understated but charming manner. Do Adaline and Ellis manage to break the time barrier and forge a life together? Let's just say that this is a love story with a time-honoured ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but doesn't transcend the genre by any means.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the outside, The Age of Adaline looks like a typical sappy romance that is purely made just so guys can take their girlfriends to see it and have a nice time. However, I had been seeing higher reviews than your typical Nicholas Sparks adaptation, so I decided to give it a try. After viewing it I realized that I never should have raised my expectations.Now is this a bad film? Definitely not. There are plenty of good things I have to say before I start nitpicking. One of which is the acting, especially by Harrison Ford. I got some raw emotion from him that I really liked, and every scene he was in felt authentic. Blake Lively was also very good in a role that is hard to pull off. I believed that she was over one hundred years old throughout the movie which is in thanks to that performance. One person I found myself in the middle on was Michiel Huisman. I felt like he was just there, and near the end I wanted to see more emotion from him but I didn't get it.I also loved the look and feel of this film. At times it felt like a love letter to San Francisco, which is definitely not a flaw. I have not seen any other of Lee Toland Krieger's movies, but I liked the direction in this film, so it's disappointing that he will move on to helm the final chapter of the Divergent series. Ugh.On that note, let's get into the nitpicking portion of the review. The majority of the problems I have with this film are with the screenplay. There were times where it seriously dragged on, and I found my mind wandering during the middle of the movie. I also found myself getting sick of the main romance about a third of the way through the movie. The saving grace for me was the plot line involving Harrison Ford's character which made me care a lot more about what was going on.The one HUGE complaint I have involves the explanation of why Adaline can't age. I won't give anything away, but I will say that it is the most cliché route that they could have possibly taken. I groaned at the resolution of this film. That's how bad it was.However, if you don't look for that stuff in movies, than don't let this review stop you from seeing this if you are a fan of the genre. If you are looking for an intricately woven plot line and an original, transcendent storyline, than this may not be the one for you. But if you are looking for a nice, cozy film to sit down with your boyfriend/girlfriend and enjoy than The Age of Adaline is definitely a perfect choice.I give The Age of Adaline 5/10 stars.</fullReview>

The acting and even the dialogue was excellent. there was just one nagging problem them kept me wondering and thinking throughout the film. and that is quite simply how would someone act that never aged. Since it's never happened it is an intriguing question. Would a 90 yr old woman act like a 30 yr old if she looked like a 30 yr. old or would she act like a 90 yr old that just happens to look 30? It made for a curious film that was a little predictable considering its target demographic, but entertaining nonetheless The entire cast made an unlikely situation plausible despite the pseudo science.</fullReview>

It's a simple plot with a happy ending.The cinematography and soundtrack beautifully brought the movie into a past era. The way the story unfolds is through a narrative voice-over. The cast fitted their characters very well. Lively really fit the role of Adaline, having a sense of old-fashioned elegance in modern times. She was able to portray the emotional maturity of an elderly woman trapped in a young body. And why does she look so perfect all the time? My favorite scene has to be when William meets Adaline. It must be really weird for the William when he sees his son dating his ex-girlfriend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully romantic and romanticized, whatever the impossibilities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Age of Adaline (2015)Like the Christopher Reeves quasi-classic "What Time Forgot" or the more inventive and well made "Benjamin Button," we have here an improbable and completely romantic and compelling love story. If the movie is imperfect in little ways, the love story holds together.It's no secret that the key here is that the leading actress, a fabulous Blake Lively, never ages. And so she has seen decades go by and has a wisdom and caution you might expect in a much older person. When someone falls in love with her she has learned to run away because the relationship, unlike herself, has no future. Not together.But of course she does fall in love herself and so doom of some kind awaits.Which is what we all want. The leading man is a charming (overly-charming, actually, especially compared to the wonderfully restrained acting of Lively) young man who is secretly well to do (lucky her) and who won't take no for an answer. The actor, Michiel Huisman, grows into into his part and holds it up. Even better, however, is the appearance of his father, with a bizarre (improbable) twist, played by Harrison Ford, who is terrific.At first the movie and the audience is distracted with the quirks of living forever?like being able to buy stocks "for the long term." And the sadness of not quite being able to partake in life in the usual way creeps in. But finally what matters is her wanting to really be in love, regardless, and to follow through. You'll have to see how the movie takes care of that.Not a classic, I don't suppose, but if you like romantic, moody movies this is a must. I really enjoyed it?though Brad Pitt in "Benjamin Button" is on another level altogether. And for sheer impossible romance over time the weepy "The Notebook" is to be recommended. That's the company "Age of Adaline" keeps. Give it a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful story with a fantastic premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I let this movie sit on my watch-list for far too long.Initially I was drawn to it both by the premise and Michiel Huisman, who I have seen in the last few seasons of Game of Thrones. There's just something that appeals to me about characters with unexplained abilities (not superpowers mind you, minor or almost inconsequential abilities) and this movie makes that the centre piece. I was worried that the premise would be ditched as soon as the romance began. Luckily, this movie is a true work of fantasy as well.The acting was superb, both from the main cast as well as the supporting in providing an experience that just felt feasible. I was stunned by Harrison Ford's performance in particular, he portrays the conflict his character faces perfectly. I had never heard of Blake Lively before this film, but I'll definitely check into her filmography now - a beautiful woman not just in appearance, but also in acting ability.The camera work was, for the most part, on point. The plot resolved in a way that was cliché, but yet lovingly so and I did have to force myself to remember that this was a romance, and that it would all work out in the end at some point.I did have problems with the film, however. The narration for a start I believe to have been completely unnecessary. I feel that without it it could've been truly a fantasy romance, but that the addition of this (sometimes overly-specific) voice over ruined that feel by interjecting a touch of documentary - something I was not fond of.A couple of shots also took me out of the movie. For instance, in a scene Harrison Ford throws his son a set of car keys. A small moment that is meant to signify his character letting go of Adeline instead remains in my head as 'that bit where the camera did a action-style follow shot for some reason' and it made the whole third act suddenly feel rushed to me. These are minor drawbacks though, and I would readily suggest this film to anyone looking for a heartwarming and interesting watch. The slights affect the tone, but in the end I really did enjoy The Age of Adeline.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ageless is not evergreen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether living forever through magical waters, aging backwards, living life over and over again or being reincarnated and reunited with the love of your life, the whole idea of going against the natural order of nature and the way that God sets up our life is a scary concept. You are born, you learn about life, go through a variety of experiences, and then you age and die. To have anything beyond that always brings on consequences either tragic or painful, and how the human mind can't fathom surviving decades past all these losses just gives me chills.I have seen so many of these sagas of fantasy and science fiction and I thank God that I am a mere mortal. In the case of beautiful Blake Lively, her story is beyond the realms of sadness. A young widow with a young daughter, she goes through a scary accident where the laws of nature go haywire and make her seemingly immortal. Looking 30 but having a daughter in her late '70s, Lively ends up running away every time she either gets too close with a man or when the law begins to become suspicious of her. Daughter Ellen Burstyn urges her to give love another chance, and with the perfect man, Michael Huisman, her dreams seem to be coming true, that is until she meets his father, Harrison Ford.The suspension of belief as you watch this movie takes you into Lively's troubled world that reality tends to bring on the message of the real world, but the message of the desire for immortality causes and reality is bravely explained. Lively gives a remarkably touching performance, and there is humor added in the scenes with a delightful Burstyn where the young woman still continues to act like a mother to her daughter, play by Burstyn when she was 80. Slow moving at times, it takes much concentration to put all of the pieces of this complicated puzzle together. It is not for the non-romantic or the severely cynical, and an abundance of similarly themed films might make this a "pass" for others. Still, it is often touching and profound, and somewhere, you may find a serious moral to bring on a conclusion to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admission, I had no intention of watching this film but upon the recommendation of my sister I am so glad that i did.Romantic films for the most part are not for me but there are exceptions (Steven Spielberg's 'ALWAYS' is just about as damned near perfect as you can get and is an under-appreciated American Gem) It may well be that Blake Lively looks back on this film in many many years to come and thinks...Yes that was my best film &amp; performance, most actors &amp; actresses realise a moment in time in which they're at their best and this might be hers.No question about it, this is schmaltzy (but wonderfully so) there's plenty of sentiment here but why not? these kind of films demand it, done wrong they can be awful to sit through, done right (as here) they can work wonderfully and send you to bed happy and feeling GOOD with the World.The set designs are superb (the Drive-In scene is exquisite) the acting is spot on with Harrison Ford as one reviewer remarked back on form, Michael Huisman as Ellis is terrific, i wasn't sure i was going to like him for the first few minutes but you realise he's a good guy and he reacts lovingly to Adaline (Blake is both beautiful and in the Zone here) It has some similarities with 'Somewhere in Time' and the said 'Always' but it holds it's own with these and is a nice addition to the Fantasy Romantic Film Category.The film is wonderfully bookended with the story about the comet.</fullReview>

Only that here the age remains the same instead of increase and decrease in a weird way. I guess some peoples will dislike it because of the nonsense involving the characters but for those with imaginative minds will surely like it.For is one of the best movies I've seen in months and these days is hard to find a movie good like this one that has a lot of elements in it.

		<fullReview>After an accident in 1937 magically makes Adaline Bowman ageless, she never allows herself to get close to anyone who might reveal her secret. In the years to come, a chance encounter with charismatic philanthropist Ellis Jones reignites her passion for life and romance. When a weekend with his parents threatens to uncover the truth, Adaline makes a decision that will change her life forever........The concept of the film is bonkers, someone dropping their core temperature until their heart stops, and then a lightning bolt acts as a defibrillator to being them back to life and bless them with eternal youth, but, it works, and despite some really sickly sweet moments, it's a real pleasure to watch.But after watching and enjoying it, I was so thankful that the titular character was female, because one of the major plot points of the film could have become really weird on the verge of Lynchian. Below be spoilers..........The film really comes into fruition when we meet Fords character (and believe me, Ford is wonderful in this), and he realises that the titular character was his long lost love from 50 years ago, and she's with his son.Now imagine that the titular character was a man, and the situation was the same, the potential is there for the main character to be dating his own daughter. Thinking of this in hindsight really makes you look at the film in a different light, and makes the whole thing a little darker.But as it stands, it's a very clever film, Lively is perfunctory as Adaline, but she doesn't really add a lot to what could have been a wonderfully colourful character. But as I've said before, the film really comes to life when Ford comes into the picture, and really puts a spin on the picture.Worth watching, it takes a while to get going, and would make a really bizarre double bill with A New York Winters Tale.</fullReview>

Especially, when one can guess the ending from 15 minutes into the start.On a practical note, how is one supposed to know which time period we are viewing, when Adeline chooses not to dress with the times. Surely fashions change?To summarise, one experienced a rather lacklustre performance.

		<shortDescription>Had potential to be outstanding, but a certain flaw made it fall short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Age of Adaline" (2015) is one of the top drama and romance driven films I've seen in the last few years. It honestly had the makings to become one of the greatest dramatic films this year, but sadly one major error made it fall short. Let me start by saying what I think this film did right.The plot in "Age of Adaline" is perfectly fine. No, it doesn't win any original points for using the story of someone who doesn't age (Of course it's very hard to find something that is totally original nowadays). The plot plays out, however, in a romantic and somewhat mysterious way, while also being very scientific in its explanations (which is also its major flaw... but more on that later).Though many like to rip apart Blake Lively and her acting range, she was very good in the role of Adaline. This film proved to be her best work to date. She captures the emotional range that a woman growing up in the early 1900's would have. She is never ditsy or a loud mouth American, and uses facial expressions that are totally the opposite of women in our "instagram" culture today. Lively holds herself up with class, humility, and maturity throughout the whole film.It is clear that Lively wasn't trying to win an Oscar for this film, but she accomplished exactly what the character needed to be successful. Any other actress would have pushed this role into something more dramatic and over the top, but Lively keeps the character subtle and real throughout.Most of the cast in "Age of Adaline" work together well. I was amazed at how outstanding Harrison Ford and Blake Lively were on screen together. The emotional impact in their shared scenes was a great highlight.Now that I have given my praises, I do have a big criticism of this almost great film.The issue that bothered me most was narration by an unknown male narrator. At the beginning of the film, this wasn't too annoying because it gave a scientific explanation as to why Adaline doesn't age. This explanation, while somewhat needed, eventually comes across as an insult to the audiences intelligence, especially at the end of the film. As a viewer, I do not need to know every little detail and I want to be able to think for myself.Not only does this narration take away intellectual value, it also ruins the emotional impact this film is trying to deliver. When I want to worry about Adaline, or what is going to happen next, the narrator comes in and kills any suspense that was built. If good cinema has taught us anything, it is that you should always try to first explain things through actions and dialogue. This is where "Age of Adaline" clearly fails, and makes me wonder how this narration got past the editing floor."Age of Adaline" is still entertaining and romantic despite that huge flaws, however, it never reaches its full potential. The performances, romance, and mysteries of how Adaline's life played out make this a fun watch. Just don't go into it expecting to learn something profound or figure things out for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply a beautiful love story. They don't do love stories like how they used to anymore. Supposed romantic movies are filled with gratuitous sex, and lack the sophistication and intrigue that occurs when potential lovers truly court each other. This movie is filled with discourse and emotion that evokes feelings deep within. I don't really like love stories because of the nonsense that is around, but this is one that I must have to watch when I need to reassure myself that there are still good writers and actors out there. I was never a Blake Lively fan, but she has made me see what she is capable of if given the right role. I also liked the presence of the narrator in the movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit I didn't want to see this movie because I don't see Blake Lively as much more than Ryan Renyolds's arm candy wife. I have seen her in other movies and she really isn't all that WOW of an actress. Not even really all that stunning as everyone claims her to be. She's pretty yes and for the parts she's played, she's OK run of the mill, nothing special actress. All that said, I think she played this role very well. The storyline sounded a bit lame and done many times before but this was done beautifully. Not just a beautiful wardrobe, which it was, but just beautiful. It was very entertaining and kept me interested through the entire film. Well casted and very well written. It was a treat to see Harrison Ford, who wasn't in any of the previews I have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay. I'm all ready to get into this crazy love story with Blake being hot, playing the lead as she always does. The story starts, a few tear jerks here and there, nothing severe yet. Then I see Dave Grohl come into frame! WTF? Yeah, Story ruined for me. NO chemistry between Blake and Game of Thrones boy at ALL. She had more chemistry with Harrison Ford then that guy. It would have been better to get the guy who played the younger Harrison Ford to play his son then the Dave Grohl clone.I love Blake and will always support her in anything she does and that is why I gave this flick an 8. Harrison 1&amp;2, Ellen and Blake were all great actors in this. The only thing that killed it for me was the hippie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic fantasy at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every generation needs a romantic love story that has an element of magical fantasy and a beautiful lead. In the 80s there was 'Somewhere in Time' and now there is 'the Age of Adaline' about a lovely woman in San Francisco who after an accident stops aging at 29. The story is well written enjoyable logical, complete and clear without being confusing or old fashioned. It's much better to see Blake Lively cast in the role of a romantic lead instead of the druggie or criminal roles she has been in on the big screen (The Town and Savages). This movie makes use of her special quality and loveliness that sets her apart from other actresses to full effect. Her love interest Huisman while not the most good looking actor out there, he has a kind face and they look right together. Harrison Ford is well cast as an older professor and father of the boyfriend. This is a role to which he is suited and doesn't look too old to handle like in some of his recent movies. His passion reminds one he can still act. Clever casting of an actor who looks and sounds like him to play his younger version. Ellen Burstyn plays her daughter and is quite amusing in her own way. It's been a long time since there was a feel good movie that is beautiful in style and story and there needs to be more of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was an okay movie. It kept me reasonably entertained for the two hours it lasted and, on the whole, it didn't leave me with a "Oh man, I wasted my time!" feeling by the end of it.I liked the costumes, they made the period parts authentic and I could really get a "feel" of them. The cinematography was also good. The performances were decent.My favourite part about the movie was definitely Adaline and William's story-line. I found their love story much more compelling, for all that it was told in somewhat brief flashbacks. Harrison Ford's scenes with Blake Lively were touching and I could really feel their emotions for each other. Anthony Ingruber was also GREAT as young Harrison Ford. Now on what I didn't like: Ellis. He was supposed to be this nice and romantic guy, but I personally found him creepy. I get being attracted to a girl and trying to get with her, but pretty much stalking her, using your power to find where she lives and blackmailing her into going on a date with you is just what a creeper would do. Blake Lively and Michiel Huisman also didn't have that much chemistry. Their romance was just plain boring when Ellis wasn't being a creeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-crafted story with a few flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is obviously targets a particular demographic, so I can understand the choices made in creating it, but cannot forgive them.While the premise is good and the story is well thought-out, this is an entirely spoon-fed film for the audience. Narration was placed in spots that could have been explained by showing rather than telling. The titular character's background could have been told in a better way, but the director decided to make it as easy as possible for the audience, a poor decision in my opinion.Anyways, enough complaining about what could have been. Even with its flaws, this was an enjoyable film. I was able to spot a few well chosen symbolic moments that may have been for the more well-versed, critical thinking viewers. As for Blake Lively, this was the first acting performance of hers that I have seen, and I was surprised by what a talented actress she is. Every scene was very believable.I give Age of Adaline a 7/10, it was a very good film just with poor judgment. I recommend it to anyone looking for a charming fantasy story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and superficial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided writing my first review here about this movie because I'm really confused about the positive impressions I've just read.The Age of Adaline is a romantic fable, and that's fine. My problem, though, is that it suggests an interesting theme -- being young forever -- but gives very little insight in this regard.For instance, Blake Lively is beautiful and wears vintage very well. But why does the character only wear vintage clothes? At first, I thought they were all clothes from when she "freezed" in time. But, no: she wears styles from different decades -- 40s, 50s, 60s. Did she like those decades better than the later ones? If so, why? Is she nostalgic? In what ways? Isn't she able to update herself to new times? Those could be interesting questions. Her wardrobe is one of those story-telling devices that seem obvious, but, if you look closely, they don't really make sense. For all I know, the only purpose of her wearing those dresses was to be stylish, just like the fashionista Lively is real life.I came out of this movie without imagining any great difficulties of never aging. The narrator and Adaline talk about them (loneliness; being persecuted by the FBI; being parted from your child; in love, "it's all heartbreak"), but do we actually feel them watching her? Well, I didn't, quite the opposite.For me it seemed impressively easy to live like she did, specially because the main love story in the movie is ridiculously smooth: the guy is handsome, rich, caring and loves her to death without even knowing her. The only conflict (I won't spoil)is solved in the most unrealistic (in respect to human emotions, not scientific facts)possible way. If she was lonely, she seemed to be so for 5 minutes. The rest of the time she was either dressing herself in beautiful gowns, getting along fine with her mature daughter and looking at the stars with her lover.Highlander might have given us more food for thought. For fashion ideas, though, it's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love story that needs a shot of adrenaline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adeline doesn't age, perhaps the director thought the audience has all the time in the world because the movie moves like molasses. Blake Lively, isn't, as she exhibits a very limited range. Things perk up when Harrison Ford shows up as the older version of a previous love and the father of the current love interest. What are those odds?Even if you go with the premise of the heroine not aging you still must deal with the lack of chemistry between Lively and Huisman. The music score matches the lack of pace of the movie. Nice array of King Charles Spaniels.No need to see this on the big screen, it will have a good run on platforms coming your way. Don't watch it late while on the sofa, as you might dose. A couple of cat naps might actually improve the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow Burn Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was privileged with seeing a free pre-screening of this film, so I went in with low expectations. Now maybe it's just because I don't regularly watch romantic films, but this film didn't draw me into the storyline very well. The plot was unoriginal(but interesting!), but the film was much longer than it should have been. The film could have easily been cut around 30-40 minutes and still have filled all the plot holes, but instead half an hour of slow, unneeded dialogue was added. While the film starts off interesting, it really slows down after around the first half hour. The science that the film went by was also extremely unrealistic(however most films are these days). However, I'm not trying bash the film as a whole. The acting was wonderful; Blake Lively was superb as Adaline(very well into character). The film also had beautiful scenery, and it had a few funny one-line jokes(even though it wasn't a comedy). It wasn't a terrible film, just overly slow and sort of dragged on. I'd recommend waiting for Redbox for this film though, or at least until the theater tickets are on sale. However, if you're a large fan of romance films, I do believe this will beat a Nicholas Sparks movie any day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is gorgeous. Blake Lively and all of her outfits are gorgeous, her character itself is gorgeous, and so is her love interest, Ellis. While watching this film I found it to be disappointingly predictable and an explanation or build up to the relationships between characters were non-existent. Lively's performance felt extremely dull and flat. I did not see any relationship development between her and Ellis, let alone her and her daughter. She seemed distant from the film, as if she weren't really in it. The only sad part of this movie is when the dog died. When Adeline crashed her car again and when she was leaving Ellis and his father, I felt no emotion because I had no love for any of the characters. It could have been great if I would have felt something from Lively. I felt nothing. As gorgeous as she is and as good as she was in Gossip Girl and I thought her performance in The Town to be great, she is overrated as an actress and this film is overrated. It was a mediocre film with dull characters and forced relationships between characters. Could have been so much better, very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I look at the reviews on here for this Movie and wonder if any are actually from Movie Goers.This Movie is in no way or ever could be a 10.I really wanted to like this one. It had been marketed really well throughout the middle of Last year to its eventual release. Almost every Movie I seen carried the trailer for this one. it looked like a good solid Movie.As I said, I really wanted to like it. Blake Lively seems like a lovely Young Lady and although I've never seen Gossip Girl, I have seen her in Green Lantern and The Town. She came across well in both.Alas This Role was just too big for The Lovely Blake. She was on screen for most of the Movie and although she had a strong supporting cast including Harrison Ford, she just didn't pull it off. Rumour has it that Natalie Portman turned down the role.Its not all Blake's fault though. The story is rushed at the start. What I found to be the most interesting part of the tale was raced along so we could get to a place where nothing happens for what seems like hours. My wife was with me watching the Movie and asked several times at the start " What's Happening ".We are rushed to a place where nothing happens and then we go at a snails place to a middle and an eventual end. To be honest, at the end I no longer cared what happened. I just wanted to get out of the Cinema.In the end, just what you'd expect happens and you still wont care.As I said in my title. This is at best and OK TV Movie.A 10 it is not.</fullReview>

All the actors were well cast. What a surprise turn in a fine performance for Harrison Ford. Blake Lively also turned in a sparkling, yet somber performance. Michiel Huisman was very convincing as her smitten suitor. They made an attractive couple, and displayed credible personal chemistry. Also, I found Ellen Burstyn compelling to watch. The dynamics between her character, and Blake Lively's character was very credible. Kathy Baker displayed depth and range, in her role as Harrison Ford character's, wife. She was great to watch. Consider this movie one of the best that I've seen in the past year. It was worth the price of admission. This movie will be on my list to see again.</fullReview>

I wasn't able to relate to the main love story, I had no idea why they loved each other, but of course I'm not into men who are like puppies in the first place. :) I liked the other romance more than this.

		<fullReview>While the Age of Adaline boasts an intriguing idea and an A list cast (for the most part) the movie just doesn't seem to make you believe in the love that the two leads are supposed to share.Adaline is blessed (or cursed) with "immortality" and has to live life on the run so as not to draw attention to that fact. As everyone she grows to love will eventually grow old she keeps herself distant from any emotional ties. That is until she 'tsings' (or zings) with Micheil Huisman's character. Through a crazy twist of fate (or coincidence) she finds that she is now in love with the son of a man she was in love with fifty years before. This should be the set up for a great and enthralling love drama, but it isn't. Blake Lively and Micheil Huisman have no chemistry and you just don't believe in their love, you do however, believe that she and Harrison Ford were in the deepest love possible. The way he emotes when he sees her, the way she reacts when he touches her, all the small shivers and glances make you sorry that they could not be together once upon a time. The story just makes you uncomfortable and you're hoping for an outcome that you know is not possible. When the resolution finally appears you're not relieved or happy. You're just kind of there. You'll wonder how the movie makers let such vast potential slip through their fingers but there you have it. Adaline just isn't worth the aging it'll put you through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting concept, but a cliché love story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Age of Adeline is an interesting story of a woman that cannot age. She has been suspended in eternal youth and is now living in the present and she seems to have settled into her immortal life but then enter a man and you know the rest.The movie ends up being a bit of a cliché love story if you take away the main story. It just feels like the whole "catch" of the movie is used to hide another love drama with its usual 1 2 3 rule. 1 something wrong with one of the parties involved. 2 they fall in love and then 3 the usual assortment of drama and exposed secrets and lo and behold a complicated love drama. It's almost like you could write any kind of love story using the same ingredients but then just change the plot a bit.The flick is by no means putrid and I think I added the extra star to 6 because I think Blake Lively, who plays Adeline, was a good choice. She has a silent charm to her character and a type on natural beauty I like. Harrison Ford who plays a late middle aged, long lost love of the ageless Adeline, William Jones is also a nice little additive I guess.So all and all not the best movie of the year but it is a watchable pseudo love drama with some twists and believable characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A woman becomes un-age-able after an accident, and he results into living in secrecy in fear that she will become and experiment. For me the narration made it to look like a fairy tale and too childish. Of course the way Adeline couldn't age and the reason why she had that condition were a super simplified. But that's not what was annoying about the film. The way everyone described her had almost nothing to do with the way she was presented. Not that Blake didn't perform well. I think she actually had the best performance of her life. And for that, the movie gains some points, even though you couldn't get the motherly feeling from her towards her daughter. And even though the ending is far from original and unpredictable, the movie is somehow enjoyable, so 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thematically this movie is a romantic tall-tale, taps into the same territory of immorality like Richard Schenkman's inventive indie Sci-Fi THE MAN FROM EARTH (2007, 7/10), Adaline Bowman (Lively), a woman stuck at the age of 29 forever thanks to a miracle happened when an car accident incurred on her, which an omniscient voice-over laboriously tries to explain from a scientific angle, as if today's technology has completely solved the mystery of living forever, even only superficially, we don't buy it for a minute, instead of justifying the unjustifiable, why not just leave it open? Uncanny things happen all the time. So, since 1930s, the non-aging Adaline has led a solitary life and moves away after a period of time in order not to arouse suspicion, which means she cannot develop a long- term relationship with anyone, save the blind, and the only person knows her secret is her daughter Flemming (Burstyn), already an old woman at present. Eight decades have passed, her secret has never been disclosed, just when Adaline decides to move onto her next destination under a different identity, she meets Ellis Jones (Huisman), a philanthropist destined to win her over with his gorgeous appeal and devoted affection, persuaded by Flemming and also jaded with all the loneliness she has endured, being a sexy woman who is as hot as Blake Lively, Adaline decides for once, engages into this passionate romance. Until she meets Ellis' parents, she suddenly recognises that William (Ford), Ellis' father, is one of her lovers, whom she jilted in the 60s when he prepared to propose to her. How far- fetched is that? Although firstly Adaline explains away the uncanny resemble by claiming she is Adaline, the woman William dated, is her deceased mother, but sooner or later, the truth will be uncovered, and running away again, yes, another car accident dutifully deployed to turn everything back on track. I hope I am not nitpicking, but this plot is too conveniently whimsical, not helped by the voice-over struggles to connect the phenomenon with a more macroscopic view, when the entire scenario is based on an illogical fantasy, making it sound logical is the worst move to manoeuvre. Blake Lively is demure and fabulous to behold, the most fitting role for her to date, as she dons haute couture of different decades as the perfect mannequin, and headlining the soppy romance with a slow-burning pace, but her emotional range is rather limited considering her prolonged presence over a century, wisdom doesn't come with ages for Adaline, maybe her mental capacity is also stuck in the age of 29 too. The heartthrob Huisman finally is offered a leading role, his Ellis is plain perfect as well, a default in the genre. Hollywood has its tradition to invite exotic stunners, but rarely they stay long- standing, especially for male. Ford is granted the most juicy part since he is the one who would be struck by the revelation, but his William takes it pretty well, no further questions apart from imploring Adaline not to give up on Ellis, hey! old man, you and your son both sleep with the same woman, that doesn't bother you for a minute? Alas, one bonus point is the cinematography, quaintly alluring in both texture and palette, DP David Lanzenberg definitely should be recruited to some more ambitious projects, let's wait and see, the same wish to the young director Lee Toland Krieger, rom-com rarely shines if there is no humour spiked, choose your next film cautiously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quickie Reiview:After an accident, Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively) gains the gift of endless youth and eternal life. Unable to age Adaline was forced to live a solitary life for decades. Everything changes when she meets a charismatic man, Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman), complicating the life she had accepted. The Age of Adaline overall is a decent film, with good acting that make the relationships and the inherent conflict feel real. However, the story mechanic of agelessness is at times mishandled and hence ends up feeling like a gimmick. Though this is not a perfect film, The Age of Adaline gives a respectable effort in delivering a believable love story without becoming cheesy.Full Review:Romance movies is usually not my thing. Not because I'm a heartless guy, but because most of the time the stories tend to be overly simplistic depiction of love *cough* Nicholas Sparks movies *cough*. Excuse me. Though The Age of Adaline did have the potential to be exactly that, I was curious as to how agelessness would be used in the context of a romantic film.Blake Lively surprised me in this film. Sure, she may be one of the most gorgeous actresses in Hollywood (well done Ryan Reynolds), but I was never impressed by her acting chops. This movie has changed my opinion on Lively considerably. She played the character in a way that despite the 29 year old look there is an air of sophistication about her that has developed through years of wisdom. So the fact that she was able to make us believe that mentally she is a much older woman is definitely commendable. The chemistry she had with rest of the cast also added a lot of history to their relationships without always depending on flashbacks. Apart from the performances, the film looked great. The cinematography of the different ages brought a lot of character to the movie, transporting you through the different decades Adaline lived through.The problem the movie has is that the agelessness story mechanic feels under-used. Of course there are multiple flashbacks and there are hints at why she chose the way she lives her life. Yet, I can think of multiple way similar relationship conflicts could've been explored without the need for that mechanic. That's why I wanted the movie to spend more screen time in the past, to really show the transitions that Adaline went through. The way the flashbacks work here is that they are always used when it is most convenient to explain her relationship with another character. Her past is never used to show her transform as a person over the years, so the agelessness becomes just means to add drama to a love story. Also I must mention, I absolutely hated the narration in the movie. It's not very often but every time the narrator spoke it pulled me out of the movie, because for some reason they felt the need to explain her condition scientifically. Uh? nobody cares how this miracle works in terms of fake science. Let the audience just accept it and move on with the story.It's a pity that the one thing that made The Age of Adaline unique was not fully taken advantage off. Nevertheless, the solid performances from Blake Lively and the rest of the cast helped the movie to not completely disappear into the noise of generic romantic movies. While there are noticeable flaws, there are certainly also some redeemable qualities to this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film of otherworldly beauty but unfortunately that is not enough.The fact that The Age of Adaline is not a film adaptation of a novel is baffling, given the whimsical and romanticized subject matter. The final product created for audiences shows an overly simplistic story lacking robust characters and complex subplots.Adaline Bowman, played by the breathtaking Blake Lively, is a wife, mother at the brink of experiencing all life has to offer. She survives a miraculous accident that leaves her frozen in time at the youthfully tender age of 29. Through the decades she maneuvers with ease, avoiding detection, by keeping herself at a distance from everyone but her daughter. That is, until she meets a philanthropically and complex man who penetrates her distant exterior and unleashes her dormant capacity for love. A weekend with his parents, however, has unforeseen but potentially devastating effects to her camouflage and threatens to expose the truth of her life and history.Audience members are to believe that Adaline, who goes by several names as she journeys agelessly through the substantial years, has lived for near a century. Not only are we to believe it, but director Lee Toland Krieger literally shows us this very fact through dreary exposition within twenty minutes of the film. This rudimentary story telling, which may also be attributed to the screenwriters of the film, yields a painfully boring and lifeless core plot that does nothing to engage viewers' attentions.Krieger's previous films had a gritty realness and dark subplot to the narratives. Perhaps that is why he fails to connect with the subject matter and adds little to the dialogue in the form of substantial story telling through a vision. Alternatively, perhaps he was so captivated by the actress playing the wondrous muse worthy of adoration across a century that he felt there needn't be more to show.Lively truly is beautiful in the film, but a mere mannequin to bring to life the talents of the costume and make up designers associated with the project. The production and costume design is a bit literal at times, overly vintage-inspired in a completely implausible manner, as is her hair. It makes her garb strikingly dated looking and more inspired by than a reflection of the time periods they are to represent.Slow, dreary and lifeless, basically you just watch for the beauty of Blake Lively in all facets. She has a wonderful composure throughout the film where you do believe her to be learned in an old soul kind of way, but perhaps that is simply due to her character's reticence. Unfortunately, rudimentary story telling through voice over exposition and montages yields a tedious narrative.There are parts of The Age of Adaline that is reminiscent of other romantic films, like Big Fish or Across the Universe or One Day or The Time Traveler's Wife, but in more ways it reminds Archon Cinema Reviews of last year's Winter's Tale. Both films have potential through rich wonder, fantasy and romanticism, but the final product falls so short of its potential that the film is disappointing and a missed opportunity.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much on the fantasy part, but a very nice attempt at the drama point.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is basically a drama, which tried to put extra something to itself by incorporating the fantasy part of immortality and its effects to contemporary daily life. Yet it seems that the movie lacks quite a lot in balance and realization. The beginning parts relied too heavily on the narration then it's left alone to build on itself only to be revisited by the narration, looking as though as the movie sees the cognitive capabilities of the viewers as very much lacking. It feels strange also in the story buildup as the part with Ellis feels very much at a slow and steady pace, only to be abruptly forced to go at running pace once William enters the screen. The acting overall really needs tweaking here and there. Blake Lively's performance feels awkward and not flowing. Harrison Ford's appearance didn't really help to showcase his character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The excessively science-fiction-steeped setup only undermines the parts that work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adaline Marie Bowman (Blake Lively) grew up in San Francisco during the early 1900s, leading a rather unexceptional life. She married Clarence James Prescott and had a baby girl, but soon lost her husband during the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge. Ten months later, she was involved in a car crash that induced an anoxic reflex and shock as her vehicle plunged into an icy lake. As if by divine intervention, a lightning bolt struck the water, defibrillating her heart and reviving her for a swift, full recovery. However, the incident also curiously affected her metabolism and cell behaviors, completely preventing her from aging.After much research, Adaline comes to the conclusion that there is no scientific explanation for her condition. Her only hope for survival, as well as a somewhat normal life for her daughter, is to elude the authorities, keep moving around, and to change her name, residence, and appearance every decade. She succeeds for approximately 60 years, exhausting the use of alias Jennifer Larsen ? a library archivist at the San Francisco Heritage Society ? and planning for her new identity as Susan Fleischer at the very end of 2014. But a chance meeting with Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman), a software developer and philanthropist, during a New Year's party, stirs her innermost desire to form a meaningful, lasting relationship with someone capable of understanding and perhaps coping with her agelessness.The wealthy bachelor scenario paired with Adaline's own prosperous dealings and identity mysteriousness throughout the years imparts a decidedly teen-oriented vampire movie premise, adorned with a differentiating tone of old-fashioned sensibilities and maturer personas. In many ways, "The Age of Adaline" feels like a romantic drama from the '90s. With all its unusual sanitation towards more commonplace, edgy eroticism, the result is entirely the typical love banter and comedic flirtations that unfold in overly sentimental, boilerplate ensemble pieces.Although there is plenty of footage to establish Adaline's lengthy interactions with historical elements, flashbacks still annoyingly work their way into the picture, fleshing out notions just after they're introduced - like plot twists that are immediately clarified for viewers incapable of remembering the start of the film. This makes the story very disjointed and clunky, which certainly doesn't help the sauntering pace. It's never boring, but many of the events muster little enthusiasm or impact. "The Age of Adaline" is more than halfway over before Harrison Ford finally shows up, creating a vital boost in melodrama and a push toward forcing the characters to react to more harrowing mental predicaments. But by the end, the most emotional moment still comes from a briefly ailing Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.The romance is effective and the actors are all routinely amusing. But the excessively science-fiction-steeped setup only undermines the parts that work. The gimmick, elucidated by a narrator's mumbo-jumbo that continually chimes in at the worst moments and in the most abrasive fashion, raises more questions than it could possibly be worth to create a unique filmic environment. Is Adaline invincible? Can she get sick? Can she gain weight? Can she die? These curiosities are mostly ignored, but the disorder's general limitations and definitions regularly crop up. At least, it provides an opportunity for creative jokes and poetic repetitions in the dialogue ? before the solution to Adaline's "curse" utterly destroys any of the entertaining bits that preceded it (deteriorating into a serious take on the undoing of the phenomenon in "What Women Want," which only marginally succeeded because of its chiefly comedic approach).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Production Value But Emotionally Unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is certainly beautiful to look at, from the costumes to the settings to the cinematography. However, to me, it lacked emotional depth. I didn't really care that much about the characters, certainly not to the extent that I would be rooting for Adaline to find true love. In fact, I found the quickie relationship between Adaline and Ellis to be contrived and not believable. The only relationships in the film that resonated with me were those between Adaline and her dogs, and, to a lesser degree, Adaline and Flemming. I couldn't say whether it was the script or the acting that fell flat. Lively did a nice job portraying a refined, educated woman from another time. I enjoyed her diction and the way she carried herself. But nothing about the movie cut to my core or stayed with me after the closing credits, which I believe is essential for a film to be considered great. I think perhaps the writer/director tried too hard to pay homage to (or, to be less generous, rip off) the masterful "Benjamin Button." The latter was superb in acting, script, and emotional range, while "Adaline" was merely adequate. Don't get me wrong - this was a pleasant film, but nothing spectacular or extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a nice fairytale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of The Age of Adeline sounds interesting when you hear it for the first time, but also like a story you shouldn't take too seriously. That's precisely what's gone wrong with this movie. They tried to make a fairytale-like story into a serious romantic drama. It's not impossible to make such a movie, take for example The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. That's also a movie about someone with a strange ageing problem, but there are some very important differences in the way they made these movies. First of all, in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button there is no weird scientific explanation for why Benjamin Button ages differently. It's just fantasy. In The Age of Adeline they tried too hard to find a scientific way to explain Adeline's situation and that just backfired. It just made it very unbelievable and ridiculous. Second of all, The Age of Adeline doesn't have the same eye for detail as Benjamin Button. If you want to make a story like this believable, then you'll have to make sure that the details are right so it feels like real life. And lastly, the characters in this movie are just too perfect to feel real. Take Ellis for instance. He's handsome, smart, rich, funny, kind, just the perfect man. Adeline is way too smart and has done and seen so much in her life that it doesn't seem possible anymore, even for a person who's 107 and always had the body of a 29 year old. All the characters are too understanding and forgiving, just not how real people are in situations like these. These points and some other small things, like an inconsistent narrator throughout the movie and some very unlikely coincidences, make that the movie just feels far-fetched and fake for most of the time. The sad thing is that none of these points would have mattered if they took a different approach to the story. If they made it into a less serious, fairytale-like movie, they wouldn't have to find a ridiculous way to explain why Adeline doesn't age. They wouldn't have to make every detail right to make it feel like real life. And there wouldn't be a problem with the characters, you can have a perfect prince charming for example. In a fairytale everything is possible because it isn't like real life.Despite all of this, it's not the worst movie you'll ever see. There are some good things in the movie, especially Harrison Ford, who gives a great performance. And if you're just looking for a romantic movie to dream away with without thinking too much, this is certainly a qualifying option. It's in many ways a very average romantic movie. It has the same structure as most of them and never really does something unexpected. But if you're looking for more, you'll be disappointed. For this kind of movie the same thing goes as Adeline told her daughter about a picture of herself; Well, you've seen one, you've seen 'em all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film, shame about the narration..????.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, let me get the bad out of the way with this film. I would have given this film 10 stars if it wasn't for the god AWFUL narration at the beginning and end of this film. It is TERRIBLE!! I don't have a problem with what was said, it's just the narrators voice. This guy sounds like he should have been narrating a Civil War Documentary!!! It is completely wrong and out of place for the film and it sounds really cheesy. With what happens to Adaline involving the comet, it should have been Harrison Fords voice doing the voice over as he knew about the comet due to his job. Here's hoping it will be removed from the blu-ray, but I'm guessing it won't. Shame.Anyway, other than the above, this film is brilliant and I loved the story to it. A lot of comparisons made with the movie Highlander, but other than the flashbacks to years gone by, that's where the similarities end. A really good cast and Blake Lively is excellent as Adaline as you really do feel she has lived nearly 100 years after a car accident means she doesn't age past the age of 29. But the real star of the show here is Harrison Ford. I am being biased here as he is my favourite actor of all time, and although Age Of Adaline isn't his best film, it is without a doubt his best acting outside of the movie '42'. He really is amazing in this and you feel for his character as he is the only one of Adalines love interests who doesn't have a happy ending with her. On a side note, Anthony Ingruber who plays a young Harrison Ford is just inspired casting and it is incredible how much he looks (and sounds) just like Harrison Ford. If the rumours are true and there is a standalone Star Wars movie being made about a young Han Solo, then filmmakers could do a lot worse than give this guy the job!!! You would get no complaints from me, that's for sure.If you like the movies Somewhere In Time and The Time Travellers Wife, then Age Of Adaline will appeal to you no end. A definite purchase for me though when its released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Date Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Age of Adaline", starring Blake Lively-Gossip Girl_tv, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants; Michiel Huisman-Game of Thrones_tv, World War Z; Ellen Burstyn-Interstellar, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood and Harrison Ford-the Indiana Jones movies, the Star Wars movies. This is a romantic movie with a little sci-fi thrown in for good measure. Blake plays a woman that was born in the early 1900's. In the 1930's, she is in a car accident and dies in a frozen lake but is revived by a freak lightening strike that grants her the ability to never age anymore than her current 29 years of age. She soon discovers that she must change her identity and relocate every ten years or so or people become suspicious. Ellen plays Blakes' daughter that soon looks like she could be Blakes' grandmother. Then, Michiel shows up, falls hard for Blake, and makes Blake change her thinking on relationships. She decides to enjoy what little she can with Michiel but after she meets his father, played by Harrison, there are some new problems to sort out. It seems that Harrison recognizes Blake as an old girlfriend he had, years ago. I'm not usually a romantic movie fan-I prefer action movies-but this one has a good story line and I liked the actors. It is rated "PG-13" for language, intense scenes-a couple of car crashes- and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 52 minutes. I enjoyed this enough that I would probably buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Casting: What Were They Thinking??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing The Age of Adaline since I saw the review a couple of months ago. April seemed very far away then, but here we are. Blake Lively was perfectly cast, did a fine job, and is stunning to watch. The story is interesting and the San Francisco backdrop is lovely to look at. But what were they thinking casting Michiel Huisman in the role of Ellis? He kind of ruined the movie for me. While Harrison Ford and Blake Lively have a natural chemistry, there was none with Michiel Huisman. Also, it you pay attention, you can hear his accent, so it becomes highly improbable that he grew up in San Francisco. When we compared notes after the movie, I found I was not alone in my discomfort with the casting choices. And Ellen Burstyn....well, maybe not pretty enough for this role. Could've done better there too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I personally found it quite boring in places! 3/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: The concept of this movie was brilliant but I found it quite boring. The director failed to do anything with the whole non-aging part of the film because he just stuck to one period, which was a bit of a waste. Anyway, the movie is based around a woman, Adaline (Blake Lively) who is rendered ageless after a fatal car accident. Every 10 years she has to leave were she is living so people don't get suspicious about her not aging. She then sets home in San Francisco and builds a life for herself, without being close to anyone but her dog and her daughter, played by Ellen Burtsyn. She soon gets fed up with running and she falls for a dashing man, Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman) who she falls head over heels in love with. She is in two minds about staying in the relationship because of her unique ability of not aging, so she decides to keep her distance from the man that she loves because she doesn't want to hurt him. After running away from many of her past loves, her daughter convinces her to pursue the relationship with Michiel but a chain of events puts a strain on there relationship. I don't want to say too much because it will spoil the movie for people who haven't seen it before. Personally I think that the director wasted to much time on the Adaline and Michiel's relationship and he should have concentrated on the whole non-aging concept a bit more. When Harrison Ford comes into the movie, it all just seems a bit too unrealistic and extremely coincidental in my opinion. For someone who had lived for over 100 years and still looked like a super model, she didn't really do anything with her knowledge which just made the film feel like an everyday love story. There are some little touches of genius, like the Trivia Pursuit questions and the fact that her daughter was so old but that was about it. Anyway, the main reason why I rented this movie was because Harrison Ford was in it and the concept sounded quite original but I must admit, I am quite disappointed with the execution of the project. Disappointing!Round-Up: Although I didn't really like the pace and the way that the director put this movie together, it did get a big distribution campaign which made it quite a hefty profit at the box office. Having Harrison Ford in your movie also helps! Anyway Blake Lively, 28, hasn't starred in that many movies but she has had some major roles in Oliver Stones Savages, Green Lantern, The Town and Hick but she mostly known for her role in the Gossip Girl series. Personally, I can't remember her in any of her previous movies which tells me that she didn't put in a outstanding performance which sticks out in my mind. I can't blame her for her performance in this movie because the director chose to stick with the love element, which was a bad choice, so she didn't do too bad with the mediocre script. This is the first major release for director Lee Toland Krieger, who also made Celeste &amp; Jesse Forever, so I have to commend him for getting Harrison Ford on board. Apart from that, I personally found the movie to be quite boring and it really did drag in places. &nbsp;Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $54.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/romance movies about a woman who is unable to age after a car accident that she had in the 20 Century at 29 years old. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would usually love this type of film, but I was so disappointed in this story. What I found really frustrating was that it could have been so much better. This story would sit well in a romance novel for teenage girls. If you love romance stories go for it. If you are looking for an interesting plot that takes advantage of an 'eternal youth' scenario you will be disappointed.The plot is predictable; the lead character is annoyingly serene. That is all I have to say really but I need to write ten lines.On the plus side I recommended this to my sister, as she would love it. But she has a terrible taste in movies and loves predictable romance, happy and saccharine type stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this one, despite not being a Blake Lively fan. While it is a watchable film, I'm sad to say it's nothing better than that. It's a pretty boring story that drags on, especially in the middle. It also has an annoying and cheesy narration. Lively is an unimpressive and wooden actress lacking any real charm or sensitivity in her performance. Michiel Huisman tries his best but can't force a chemistry with Lively that just isn't there. The supporting cast is solid, with vets Harrison Ford, Kathy Baker, and Ellen Burstyn all doing fine. Special mention to Anthony Ingruber for his portrayal of a younger version of Harrison Ford's character. He does a great job of mimicking Ford. He was probably the highlight of the movie for me. I also liked the costumes, vintage cars, etc. The aesthetics of the movie were nice. If you're interested in this movie because you're a sci-fi or fantasy fan, don't bother. The premise of a woman who never ages is just a means to an end for the weak romantic plot. Unfortunately this is not the film it could have potentially been. It's predictable and cliché-ridden with cardboard characters and a story that has no real point. Avoid unless you have low expectations and want something to kill a couple of hours with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's the deal with this movie? Why is everyone so excited about it? Nothing worth spending your money or time. You know exactly what will happen and how it will end by looking at the poster. There's no action and I didn't feel sorry for the main character, because her choices were unreasonable. The love story was a bit cheesy and unrealistic mainly because it all happened very fast even though the movie itself was quite slow. I don't know if it was Blake Lively or Adaline, but I didn't feel any emotions coming from her. It could have been done much better. Maybe it would be a better story if it had been a book, because the script was so primitive and boring, nothing to hold on to. The narrator was completely unnecessarry and annoying at all times. Silence is gold. No need to interrupt with a "book" version of what's happening. And please don't explain how immortality is possible if it's not a superhero movie. The supernatural part for me wasn't the fact that she couldn't ever die, but that she didn't marry the guy who looked like Han Solo. The only exciting thing about it was Harrison Ford and the guy who played a younger version of Harrison Ford(Anthony Ingruber). Overall, this is a chick flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, i walked into this theater with low expectations? and i walked out with, well low expectations. Although i did enjoy a scene here and there and the bleak color and the camera shots were very well done, this movie just didn't do it for me. Seeing the trailer i assumed it would focus more on her life in the past, and jump to the future every now to give us a hint at what would happen but, sadly, it didn't. It was really neat to see her in each time period (for about 1 minute each) but thats all i have to say was good about it. This story had no direction at all! Yeah i guess you could say it was mainly about her not being able to have a real life, even though she can live forever, but it was just all over the place. As i watched i wondered if certain things would ever become important, but nothing ever did. Yeah, i guess it could be considered romantic, but it never really pulled anything out of me. Some scenes were narrated by some random dude, who i thought would have some significance in the ending, but he didn't. He over explained and analyzed everything way to much and gave us too much detail, which made the story less believable.. well as believable as a woman who doesn't age can get. There was also one scene (might have been the more interesting parts of the movie) when she gets caught by her ex lover.. but it led no where. It went sorta like, "Oh, Adeline? You haven't aged one day for 40 years? Okay whatever." There were no plot twists, or anything all that interesting really. I felt as if things were just thrown in at the wrong time and didn't give the story any momentum. And the ending before the ending.. (You'll know what i mean if you saw it) was so tasteless and cliché. I did think the real ending was pretty decent, and had a cool subliminal meaning to it, but everything in the center fell flat. This movie, with pun intended, will not live forever? like Adeline :PPS. Did anyone else feel as the narrator spoke, you felt like you were watching a documentary on the discovery channel?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought-provoking story ruined by second-rate acting and a disappointing script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This science fiction romance had lots of potential. The story is interesting. The production values are outstanding. The cinematography is gorgeous. But the two leads, Blake Lively and Michiel Huisman, ruined it for me. Lively is not known as a great actress, and she's not going to improve her reputation with this film. She has a wooden delivery, and what little inflection she does have sounds unnatural, at least to my ears. Another problem is that her cool persona isn't a good fit for a romance. Huisman does a better job of acting than Lively, but he still comes across like a bad actor in a Lifetime movie. The two of them can barely manage any chemistry on screen. I cringed every time Huisman leaned in for a kiss. Harrison Ford and Cathy Baker, on the other hand, are convincing as Huisman's parents. The script is about what you would expect from a Lifetime movie or an adaptation of a Harlequin romance. If you were hoping for something like a Nicholas Sparks movie, you may be disappointed. Even though Sparks' movies can be corny, at least the scripts are well-written and the acting is usually pretty decent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Loveless Romance (Raging Film Reviews)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The curse of immorality is not that you grow restless and run out of things to do; it is that those close to you come and go with the passing years, and experiencing heartbreak becomes commonplace as the one you want to grow old with does?but you don't. This intriguing trope would be a brilliant one to explore, but in the entirety of The Age of Adaline, it is completely forgotten in its nonsensical storyline and passionless, flawed characters who never truly feel in love.After a freak accident in the late 1920s, Adaline finds herself permanently stuck in her young body up into the 21st century. The only person who knows her secret is her daughter (Ellen Burstyn), and she purposefully avoids love at all costs?not because she's afraid of heartbreak, that would be silly, but rather she is actually terrified of being experimented on and used for science. Most of this information comes to us in flashbacks topped-off with an annoying Benjamin Button-esque narrator giving us more detail than we need or want.For a movie thats tagline is, "Love is Timeless," there sure is not a whole lot of loving going around. At a New Years Eve party, Adaline finds Ellis?er, maybe he "finds" her?as he appears to have been a major fan of the "Christian Grey's Tips for Being a Crazy Stalker" book. After consistently pestering Adaline until she finally gives in, Ellis further strengthens the idea that being completely and utterly creepy is always successful in getting the girl (as long as you are attractive), but he also opens her eyes to the possibility of love. Michiel Huisman (Daario from Game of Thrones), cannot seem to rid Ellis of his stalker qualities, but at times he is charming, yet there is a hint of chemistry that never gets completely flushed out.Blake Lively, for as good as she is at brushing off every man in the movie with a haughty coolness, does not give nearly enough depth to Adaline's character for her to be at least mildly believable in the sense that she has weathered years of painful losses from constant departures and name-changes. What we do know of her life--like the dead husband who bore her a child--hardly has any apparent effect on her character at all. In a rather awkward and possibly creepier role, Harrison Ford literally appears on screen as Ellis' father, and proceeds to make countless cringe-worthy advances towards Adaline whom he thinks is someone from his past. It is bizarre and a bit uncomfortable as we come to learn the extent of this relationship. Ford's character also forces an unnatural tonal shift towards something more of a comedy which severely detracts from what had been built in terms of a somber atmosphere up until that point thanks to its elegiac score by Rob Simonsen.Perhaps it says something that the most emotional part of the film is when we find out Adaline's dog has failing kidneys. With a wealth of potential to hit hard with heartbreak and loss, The Age of Adaline carelessly ignores these elements for something that ultimately ends up as a mess of a film that is devoid of any sort of moments that would illicit an emotional response. Love might be timeless, but it is invisible in this "romance."for more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when I saw the trailer I knew that it was going to be just romantic movie, and I am not very into this genre, but what I saw was complete insult to audience. in difference with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button there was no background story for Adaline, only thing I knew about her was she was 107, not her emotions, not how dramatic is to lose someone, except her erudition she acted like young woman, it would be better if directors had shown to us how person's character is changing by age. We had a few worthless flashbacks of her, this was all that they showed us for her background... Harrison Ford's performance was not on it's best but at last he gave us little emotions... Michiel Huisman's who was love interest to Adaline is complete zero in this movie, not charisma, not emotions, he delivers nothing... in conclusion if you want to see romantic movie with fiction elements see The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, if you already have seen this watch it again, cause this movie doesn't deserve any view... I rated it 4 cause of one of the weakest plots I have ever seen, and did not gave it less cause Blake Lively looks very pretty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOT a love story, as you're expected to believe. Just a patchwork of Hollywood clichés and gender role stereotypes. Dialog started smart but soon dissolved into trivialities. Story and narration likewise lost momentum into ridiculous juvenile Hollywood nonsense. Could have been something wonderful, if the movie had stuck to the initial premise of the supernatural, instead of attempting to evolve into a modern(by conservative standards) love story. Should've been handed to the Brits... Disappointing. And just the more sad to have to witness trivialities coming from the mouth of Harrison Ford! 5/10 is for leaving me indifferent to both story and characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Age of Adaline starts off with heavy narration that explains why Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively) got involved in a car accident on a night lightning struck and somehow she does not age a day.After attracting the attention of the mysterious FBI agents she decides to move town to town every 10 years and constantly change her identity.Her daughter (Ellen Burstyn) is the only one who knows her secret and they keep in touch. As we get to the present day Adaline meets Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman) who is smitten by her and pursues her. They fall in love but Adaline realises that he will age and she will not. Things take a turn when he takes her to meet her parents and his dad (Harrison Ford) recognises Adaline from their past.Given the story going through the decades and not ageing and the changes she has seen in terms of sexual &amp; racial politics, technology, liberation the story we get is less than compelling.The love story was a bit ropey as Ellis Jones comes across as too pushy and I did not sense a romantic connection between the characters not like the one between Jones Sr and Adaline. It is that part of the story which is intriguing.After years of playing almost one note grouchy characters, Ford does some acting and Blake Lively does the best with her character who should had offered more but was let down by undercooked writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great idea, poor acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of the movie is absolutely great, finally there is a character who is not a superhero or a vampire, but an ordinary woman, having to deal with mundane things in life, like a bank account or a new passport/driving license. However, the greatest idea is nothing without an implementation and the implementation here was, hmm, flat. The story has no depth whatsoever, Blake's stiffness doesn't really show her being madly in love with anyone, contrary to her statements, and even Harrison Ford's brilliant acting cannot save the story. I loved Blake as Serena in Gossip Girl, but she doesn't change, and cannot really express emotions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted to love it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw 7.2, and was looking for something that might make a late run for 2015's top-25 list as the list is rounding-out in early 2016.It was near miss. #32 out of the 64 films I've seen from 2015. I'll end up seeing about 100, and this will probably finish in the top half.All that said, this film makes me angry. It's not bad. It's not bad at all, but it could have been so much better.It looks great. The story is great. Harrison Ford is great.SO what didn't I like about it. The hokey narration is just straight outta daytime television. One.Blake Lively took the elegant, wise, sexy-face thing a bit too far. I felt like she was shooting a perfume commercial for 2 hrs. As kids me and my buddy would take pics doing 'polo poses' as a joke, only here it's not funny.She's not a terrible actress, but she's not the right actress for this part. I mean everything about her character seemed too convenient. I said, well she's cold because she knows better, she's quiet because she knows better, she's elegant because she's from an earlier time, she's blah, blah blah... and then I realized... she's all this because there's just no emotion in this performance. I didn't feel her pain.I felt Harrison's.His performance, and the twist centered around that performance, saved this film for me. Well, the last 45 minutes in general took what was a 5.5/10 and took it to 6.5(64/100). Ellis, Lively's love interest in the film, is similarly miscast, and a bit poorly thought-out. The dialog between the two is a bit uneventful. Again, very convenient... one could say, "well, she can't talk about her life", another person could say it's just not very well-written in those parts. The set-up for their 'getting together', overall, is a bit sloppy. Other areas were better. Supporting roles from Ellen Burstyn and Kathy Baker are quite effective.The writing and SOME of the acting is suspect. THe twist, the look(overall grandeur), and Harrison Ford make this film well-worth watching despite my many criticisms. That long list is surely the result of a good film that I know was so amazingly close-to and capable of being fantastic. I guess I might be under-rating it a touch, but write this a little tighter, don't treat the audience like they have a 25IQ and scrap the narration completely, Re-cast the lead, and you have yourself a real winner that probably trumps a similar "Notebook", gets a 8.5 from me, and makes my top 10 for 2015, not misses my top-25.Two days ago I reviewed and rated "Burnt"(68 or 69/100?) with Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller. The film had NO RIGHT to be better than Age of Adaline. The latter has a far more interesting storyline, a bigger budget, a century-spanning epic fantasy, the other, a very small segment of a chef's life with little backstory. IMDb has AOA ranked way ahead of Burnt. I don't see it that way at all. I enjoyed Sienna Miller's performance quite a bit, and Bradley was Harrison only the whole way through the movie, not just for the last 30 minutes. And let's not even start to compare Bradley's performance to Huisman's. Both films looked great. And one film should have been much better than the other. Should have. I'm not in it for 'useful' votes - I'm in it to give you my honest opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer I was so excited about this movie. I was so happy when Adaline was finally in the Cinema. Unfortunately, It did not live up to my expectations. The story-line was weak and predictable. As much as I love the lovely Blake Lively, this was not her greatest performance. I had a few laughs, but that was it. Nothing to great, nothing to special. The idea of the movie was great, but the plot was not to satisfying. I think there could have been done a lot more, and that could have been giving a lot more to the story. I did not feel connected to the characters, I did not wonder what happened to them after the movie ended. Such a shame, this could be a great movie if the story was more developed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opening the movie was the typical mysterious kind of approach any fantasy-related film gives off, the music on the background and the narration was good, even the first few lines that the narrator said was notable, the scoring in the movie moving forward was perfectly placed in each emotional scenes. Usage of old songs and celebrities as references were present to make it more relatable to the audience. Shots of San Francisco was beautiful, from the Golden Gate Bridge construction to the roads, establishments and even on the tiny details of the stairs in the library, it was a gorgeous sight to look at. What I appreciated more in the movie is the fact that Adaline has this taxi ride scene, photo flashbacks which takes her down to memory lane, the fluidity of the transition from one decade to another gives you the nostalgic feeling Adaline also felt. Historical and scientific references were brilliantly inserted in each important scenes that marked how Adaline became who she was and how she was with Ellis as well. The Age of Adaline will open your eyes to the reality of what ageless beauty/body can have and not have at the same time, Adaline was a prisoner of the future and is a living evidence of the past, she could not commit to anyone for the same reason she could not stay in one place. Hers was a life we people of the new age always dreamed of, staying young forever, the movie will give you a glimpse to that kind of life and will let you think twice about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a lightning filled stormy night Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively) is in a car accident. She survives but comes to realize she cannot age. (Whaaaat?) She must keep this secret or be a Ginny pig curiosity. As a result, every 10-years she changes her name and moves so no one will suspect her secret. Her daughter Flemming (Ellen Burstyn) is the only one who knows and apparently she didn't inherit any of Adaline's anti-ageing powers. Bummer and who names a kid Flemming, huh? Later on Adaline meets Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman) and falls in love. Now Adaline has a decision to make. Will she? Inquiring Minds are fidgeting. The real story starts later when Harrison Ford (as William Jones) comes on the scene. Hang in there, you are in for a shock, okay a twist. I had visions of this being a very good love story, but something happened: I just didn't care , the characters didn't involve me in that way. No need for a Kleenex box. What happened? Was there enough eye contact between Adaline and Ellis? What about chemistry? Were they miscast? (well, you didn't care for that awful beard Ellis wore) Was the script at fault? Were the dialogues not good enough to draw me in? All the above seems to cover it. Downside: Two detectives, for some unknown reason need to question Adaline and get her into the back seat of their car. Then they get distracted with something on the street and leave the vehicle. Adaline sees there are no door handles. She pulls down the back seat, crawls into the trunk and escapes. It's possible for a regular cop car to not have door handles, but a detectives car? Also if they were smart enough to not put door handles they would have been smart enough to make sure the back seat couldn't be drawn down, but here's the thing: Adaline somehow gets into the trunk and releases the trunk latch and the trunk opens and she escapes. I don't think a 1930s car would have trunk release from inside the trunk. (you are tough) I'm just saying. There is narration by Hugh Ross and that fills us in on the reasons Adaline cannot age and yes, that was all helpful. Production-wise all is good, the acting is okay in a journeyman kind of way. (so it was the script, eh?)I thought this would all go another way, but all in all a fairly good made-for-TV movie. Near the end Adaline sees something and is pleased, but keep in mind that when we, too, see this "something" we are not too pleased. Can you guess? (5/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The depth of Adaline's generous life experience is not enough depicted. And that's a pity. The love story isn't stolen from fairy tales, but it follows the steps of a normal yet beautiful beginning of a strong relationship from our reality.And that's enough to give you shivers.Blake Lively's performance was fluid and I enjoyed it very much. Nothing seemed fake or discontinued in her acting and I believed her when she told me she is both old and young at the same time. Michiel Huisman is a cute man, but his role was just that of a photo frame for Adelaine. But definitely not a cheap frame. My advice to you: don't start this journey if you want an answer to an existential question, but do it when you want a good time with your friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Purely for Romantics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic tearjerker reminiscent of Hans Christian Anderson's The Little Mermaid - countering immortality against love. It starts very slow. So slow that I was wavering between sleeping and finding something else. But on the whole I am happy I stuck with it. The explanation of how the 'gift' of immortality came to pass was inexplicably ridiculous. But once the premise and characters get established and Adaline is introduced to the boyfriend's family the real story gets underway and gets really interesting. The settlement of the immortality question is another dollop of pseudo-scientific mambo jumbo but it does not spoil the story. The acting is not cheesy at all and all the actors carry this off very well. We all know it is going to end happily ever after but sometimes we do need such stories to balance out the tragedies around us.</fullReview>

There's something bothering me about the narrator, why he explained all about Adaline with scientific terms? This is a romantic movie, we don't need that. We just need like a poetic explanation like a fairly tale.This is not the avengers movie or Hulk where we want to know the birth of our superhero. And one more thing the story lines very predictable (SPOILER) from the accident, the Harrison Ford and back to normal. The good thing is always the lovely Blake Lively (Shes lovely) and Harrison Ford act. Both of them save the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious Love Story for Girls only, I guess...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a made-up fantasy "romantic" melodrama with sole purpose to build up to a few "emotional" so to speak moments.The first minutes remind of "Forever" another TV-series which it has the "immortality" concept but it is misusing and under-using it, make it a secondary plot element.The immortals trusts no one. They just their lives changing identities. Never love again to save themselves from the grief every ...50 years, when their loved-one is passed away. I guess there is a lesson there for all dog-lovers NOT to buy a dog because they would outlive him and feel the ...sorrow. Anyway...The only reason to see this, in my opinion, is Harrison Ford's performance in the second part of the movie. He is really good. His appearance justifies the whole movie although from that point the movie becomes predictable...So, is it worth seeing? Well. I wish it was 20' shorter than its 1h:52', and it is a movie that if you think the "reality" of its emotions, you may find it flimsy, maybe even obscene. You can see it I guess, if you are a girl easily moved by the concept of "destiny-driven-love" and for the "nostalgic" feeling and the mellow music. If you are a man over 30 (and not to accompany any girl to the theater) you are better without it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>82 year old Ellen Burstyn plays the daughter of 28 year old Blake Lively, and then you realize for sure that this is a strange film. It deals with a woman who is hit by lightning after she loses his life in a traffic accident. Not only is she revived. She does not age. This is an imaginative idea, which is not used in this film. The film has a resemblance to Bradbury's story "Hail and Farewell" about a 12 year old boy who did not age in fifty years. Having lived with "parents" some years he has to travel again and befriend new "parents". Adeline must also ceaselessly move.Think of a woman who has experienced the 1910s (World War I and suffragettes), 1920 (charleston and jazz), 1930 (swing), 1940 (World War II), the 1950s (rock and roll ), 1960s (Beatles, Stones and hippies), 1970s (disco wave). Does all this show in this film? No, for although this woman looks youthful, she has experienced all these decades. You would expect that such a woman would be "campy", for people are mostly influenced in their first years of life and never manages entirely to adapt to something new. She never speaks the words "swell", "groovy" or "dame".Blake Lively looks like, behaves and speaks as if she was born in 1987, as she is. A hint of a young Bing Crosby is more or less the only thing that ties her to an eventful past and that she answered correctly on many questions in a quiz, a thing one does not to be 100 years old to achieve. In fact, she makes me grumpy.This is a syrupy love film, and I miss a chemistry between Blake and Huisman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can easily admit some parts of the movie moved me or made me happy, but there is one thing about this movie that makes a heavy impact when compared with the expectations audiences have in this century.The narrator keeps butting in to either (a) to tell us what is obviously going on (b) to tell us something important related to the plot that they were too slack to dramatise, or, (c) something entirely superfluous...Who is this magical narrator that seems to know everything? Maybe if it was a voice-over from the protagonist, with only a few sentences, they might have got away with it.Doing this instead of dramatising it might have been okay to tell us via text in silent movies but, in this day and age, it ruined what could have been a good movie. Yes, it is okay in some fairy tales, but the plot doesn't lead us down the path of thinking that it is one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** This review may contain spoilers ***Have you seen the trailers? To sad. You already saw the only decent parts in the movie.This is one of the worst love-stories ever. Why? Because there is no love story. It is the story of an women which is over a hundred year old and apparently, her brain has not aged either or she always had a perfect memory - but, hey, who knows? However, this one hundred year old woman, falls in love with someone in his mid-20s (30s?), who fell in love with her just as well. He basically has been stalking her, ever since he saw her reading a book on the stairs of a library. Ain't that sweet?However, after having sex with her, he falls in love with her - regardless of the fact that he knows nothing about her (his words, not mine...). She falls in love with him too - against all odds (she already slept with his father in the 60s, who is talking about his former love of his life, in front of his wife, with whom, on the very next day, he will be married for over 40 years. Ain't that romantic?He finds out about it, confronts her and she runs away...driving trough a lonely forest, hitting a truck (which just backs up and drives on...?!). When "the son" finally arrives, she is still laying in the gras, not breathing and not getting CPR (which is wired, because at the time he arrives there are cops standing on the site...just watching her...well...not breathing and you know, all that other stuff that keeps you from dying).Of course they are getting her back to life and she finally tells "the son", the truth, while lying in the hospital. Apparently the love is pretty deep, because he is not shocked or anything at all (which is wired...considering how the father freaked out...)...so basically, he does just see, what her body is, but not that she is a 107 years old woman, which, for some reason, we should find very romantic? Huh. Tough one.But let's be fair: even if this movie actually had a romantic love story (which it doesn't), the moud would always be destryoed by this freakin voice over, which sounds like a freakin answering machine. 200 people in the cinema. Not one couple cuddlying, kissing, getting in any (good) mood at all...some even walked out...nough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The weak script hurts this elegant romantic story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tell me something I can hold on to forever and never let go."At first glance one might assume that The Age of Adaline is a failed adaptation of a romantic novel that tries to cram the different story elements into a two hour film, but in reality the screenplay was written by J. Mills Goodloe and Salvador Paskowitz directly for this movie. Having a narrator explain the reasons for the main character's miraculous secret for not aging enforces even more that intuition that the film is a book adaptation and they're simply trying to summarize as quick as possible the premise for the movie so they can move on to the love story. Unfortunately the screenplay is actually the greatest problem in The Age of Adaline. It seems as if director, Lee Toland Krieger, could've used Rashida Jones's help with the screenplay because this is a step down from his previous collaboration with her in Celeste &amp; Jesse Forever. If you want to watch a unique romantic film, then I'd recommend that movie over this one because The Age of Adaline is full of predictable twists and the romantic story is a bit rushed. The film never really sells the fact that a 100 year old woman should be depressed for having to push away the people she loves because she doesn't age (I'd understand if she were much older, but a hundred years doesn't sell it for me).A narrator (Hugh Ross) introduces us to Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively) who was born at the beginning of the 20th century, but after having experienced an accident doesn't age anymore. After eight decades she remains looking like her 29 year-old self. The only one who knows her secret is her daughter, Flemming (Ellen Burstyn) who by now is an old lady who has to introduce her to everyone else as a friend. Adaline has been changing her identity every ten or so years moving from one place to another never allowing herself to fall in love or tell her secret to anyone, but things change when she meets a young philanthropist named Ellis (Michiel Huisman) who quickly falls for her and relentlessly begins to pursue her with his unique charm. He invites Adaline for his parents' (played by Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker) 40 year anniversary reunion, and that is where Adaline has to decide whether she should reveal her secret to him or continue running like she has been during all these years. If you've seen a decent number of romantic movies in the past, you will probably be able to predict where all this is heading. The reason why I put so much emphasis on the screenplay during the first paragraph of this review is because I actually enjoyed the performances from the cast, but the weak screenplay is what ultimately brought it down for me. Blake Lively and Michiel Huisman deliver believable and charismatic performances and they do have strong chemistry together, but everything seems to be rushed for the purpose of getting to the twist in the story and when it comes you already were expecting it. Lively plays her character with grace and elegance and you can tell time has made her wise. She wouldn't fall in love with a simply charming and good looking guy, and Ellis easily proves there is something more about him. The relationship is believable, but it doesn't take its time to build on it. Harrison Ford is incredibly refreshing in this film and he has some strong scenes with Lively and Baker. There is something quite disturbing about the twist that isn't ever addressed and that is what I found more disappointing than the actual predictability of the story. The performances were all great, but with a better screenplay this could've been a stronger film because it does look beautiful. Overall I had a decent time with The Age of Adaline, but I can't get past some of the flaws so watch this at your own risk. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very interesting and original premise is only half-explored and used to the advantage of the film, especially thanks to some of the cast members, whilst the rest of it gets wasted in a super generic love story that for the major part falls flat.That introduction is a bit too harsh for a movie that is never boring, never doing anything basically wrong and never being annoying, but it pains me to see that with such an interesting plot we ended up having such a mediocre film. I am not talking of the "immortality" premise, that has been explored time and time again. I am talking about a plot point that happens way too late in the movie and that I don't want to spoil. Yet, wow! What a cool, original idea. Up until then I was kind of lost, I didn't understand where the movie was going, yet I wasn't getting bored at all. But after this it really caught fire and I was in. Unfortunately I didn't get much of what I was promised. The film slipped into clichéd territory, but with such an idea I wanted it to be more original, more nasty, more unpredictable. Most importantly yet, the whole ordeal is made possible by an absolutely brilliant performance by one of my personal heroes, Harrison Ford. He disappears in his character and provides him with multiple layers, proving he is one of the greats. He came out of the screen with this performance, lots of what he did was so perfectly palpable, really hats off. Burstyn is good too and steals every scene she isin to a charismatic yet slightly off Blake Lively. Anthony Ingruber is fantastic in the few scenes he is in by the way, looking forward to see more from this guy.As I said, the script is very flat, many lines have been heard too many times already and it just takes a couple too many wrong choices going on favoring a banal and clichéd love story, which I never bought into, instead of the main and most interesting part of the film. You don't really care about the two main characters and many of their scenes are not really any interesting. Michiel Huisman isn't any good here unfortunately and brings down a notch the whole thing because of a very melodramatic performance. The score too is pretty dull and by the books.I had a pleasant watch thanks to Ford and the basic premise, but in the end I didn't get enough out of it and will regretfully forget the majority of the film very soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, if you watched the trailer, you can get a whole feel for the entire movie. Which in some cases, is true for many movies but in this one, the acting and character development and narration was just average at best.I like Blake Lively, but she's just very one dimensional. It's hard to connect with her aside from the sad scenes in the movies where you'd feel bad no matter who is acting.I watched this for free on an airplane where I could have fallen asleep and it wouldn't have been a big deal. Really, I wouldn't recommend this movie but I have seen worse and the overall acting wasn't bad, I think there just wasn't a lot of dimension/depth to the characters given the storyline and Blake Lively seems to always fall short for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a waste of potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was actually looking forward to this film, but I left the theatre really disappointed. This film had so much potential, it could have become a classic. Yet it was messy, undeveloped and predictable. I was hoping to see the protagonist develop, struggle dealing with the pros and cons of her situation. I wanted to become her, to feel what she feels and root for her, forget it wasn't real life, especially when there was so much capacity for making the viewer emotional with the facts that she doesn't age when the rest of the world does, that her daughter will die and she'll have to be there to see it, or that she is torn between the father and the son, or that she has to keep her condition a secret. I didn't have the problem of her vintage clothing, which suited Lively and made her seem kind of nostalgic. The soundtrack was good, it worked well with the film. Now the biggest issue for me was the way they tried to combine the present and the past. It turned out to be a huge mess. Personally I think it would've been better if there were no throwbacks, but we could've seen the development of the character from the loss of her husband till the present times. I kept wondering if Adaline's "Sherlock-ish" deduction skills would come in handy, but that lead nowhere also. Nothing got me emotional as well. The only thing I wanted to cry about was the pain in my jaw from my braces. Even when the protagonist almost died (twice), I felt nothing, there was no suspense, because it was so predictable. Some things didn't make sense. For example, her packing her bags and leaving, or just choosing to be with Ellis with no explanation (because I bet I'd feel in a certain way about someone I loved, even in the past) had no motive at all. These things that happen with no motive make the film seem rushed and incomplete. The relationship between Adaline and Ellis bored me to death. There was no drama, no complexity in it. They just met, fell in love in a few days and got together (like everything else in the film. I like to see people fight for what they want to achieve or get in the way of. Everything seemed to be handed on a plate, if you know what I mean). Some may disagree, saying that there was the factor of her moving or his father being her ex-lover. But it was all so poorly executed, I didn't even care about those. They kept throwing us back and forth within the different times, occurring in the form of memories, but it was a mess and left me unattached. For instance, The Imitation Game had three different time lines, but it all came together solid and made sense. It was smooth to watch. There was no development. Even if you know the destination, you still want to enjoy the journey towards it. There was no journey whatsoever. Even if a change of events occurred, there was no going towards it. If it happened, it just happened. To me, cinema is a lot about the excitement I get when I am watching a film. I wasn't excited once during the Age of Adaline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come on Mr. Narrator, etc.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been known to enjoy a good romance with my girlfriend. I appreciate the emotional connections that directors and screenwriters cultivate between their characters and their viewers and I appreciate complex premises behind stories. So; she can't age because lighting struck and science we won't figure out for another 20 years kicks in? And we are told all this via a very nature-documentary like Hugh Ross narration job which sounds really, really out of place in a sentimental love story.Most of the acting was very, very good; EXCEPT when our hero and heroine are actually interacting. When they first met in that elevator, the dialogue was unnecessarily terse and uncomfortable (of course, trying to establish the sexual tension that is so delicious to watch broken down later in the film) when there were no prior negative feelings between Adaline and any male character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of The Age of Adaline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Brad Pitt's title character ages in reverse. In 2015's The Age of Adaline (my latest review), Blake Lively's title character doesn't well, age at all. There's a resemblance between the two vehicles. Both of them have a gimmick ("Adaline" contains the concept of stasis while "Button" contains the concept of backward countenance), both of them are in a sense, whimsical, and both have an olden-like film score. But "Adaline" is Benjamin Button buttoned down. It contains a story that is discombobulated yet still reeks of obviousness. Pitt's 2008 Oscar nominee also had its share of obvious moments. But at a running time of nearly three hours, it stayed its course. The Age of Adaline (clocking in at about an hour and fifty minutes) turns idle while it slugs its way towards the second half. This isn't quite the fictional, Shaky Town treat if you know what I mean.Now don't get me wrong, "Adaline" renders itself strong in certain areas. You have the perfect casting of Blake Lively, the cinematography channeling elegance to the nth degree, sights and sounds triggering echos from an old ballroom, and effective editing screaming "cut to action." You also sadly, get to experience crocodile trembling from Harrison Ford (overacting is another way of putting it), out of place narration masked as science lecture, and puzzle piece coincidences. The real star of this flick is the city of San Francisco (a locale that is used brilliantly here). Its breathtaking Golden Gate Bridge and hovering downtown however, don't do enough to garner my recommendation.Directed by virtual unknown Lee Toland Krieger and set in present day (despite veritable flashbacks happening throughout), The Age of Adaline chronicles a woman of superior grace named Adaline Bowman (Lively). She's an archivist who works in a library and harbors a secret that only her daughter knows about (Flemming played by Ellen Burstyn). You see Adaline is about 107 years old yet looks as though she's in her late twenties. She's unaware of how this happened but we as the audience have a clue (based on the annoying narration that interrupts the film as though it's an unwanted party guest). A long time ago, this woman was in a brutal car accident. After surviving it, the aspect of aging was something her body refused to do. Lively's character then lives the next eight decades in a lie. She changes her identity, separates herself from her daughter (as mentioned earlier), alludes the FBI who question who she really is (and want to capture her as a specimen), and breaks some hearts along the way (a father fails to propose to her in the 1960's and his son subsequently falls in love with her circa 2014).Now the storytelling from the onset of "Adaline", is of the highest order. However, as its running time dissipates, you start to get into "where is this all heading towards" territory. The film's contrivance carries things for so long until the plot finally runs out of steam. The big reveal comes and Adaline reluctantly gets into another car accident (spoiler alert). As this happens, she begins to age again and finally live a normal life (it would take me another paragraph to explain why so watch the movie and you'll get the gist of what I'm talking about).Dramatic weirdness aside, some critics have noted that the main protagonist featured, is a standoffish principal, a lady who is sort of cold and reserved. They coined this notion as negative meaning that it sort of hurts the film in general. I agreed wholeheartedly until chatting with an audience member via a screening in Rosemont, Illinois. This person made a good point in saying that Adaline had to be this way. She needn't get too close to people or become attached because of her condition. Regardless, Blake Lively plays said centenarian magnificently. It's her look with old world hairstyles and outfits that seems perfected. It's her persona that stands tall with Forest Gumpian flavor. Finally, it's the mannerisms she brings to the role that suggest that she is in fact, a stoic human being (who's lived a long life). With every eye glance, every head turn, and every mild voice alteration, Lively conveys old and wise. Talk about a revelation in genre acting.Note to self: (Spoiler alert number two) I initially thought it was creepy when Adaline slept with her love interest being Ellis Jones (played by Michiel Huisman who looks like a cross between Shia Labeouf and Eric Bana). I mean she obviously looked young but you can't have hormones past the age of 100 right? Again, I was corrected by my knowledgeable audience member from the last paragraph. I was informed that Adaline had stasis issues. Her body was still stuck in the same equilibrium meaning that only time had passed, not the lacking of a sex drive.In conclusion, The Age of Adaline doesn't succeed in getting the tear ducts flowing. It does however, provide the perfect platform to showcase Blake Lively's strengths as an actress. It gives Tarzana's chosen one the chance to let the screen love her and then let her love it right back. In the first hour of the proceedings, she peers into the camera as a blond, starry-eyed starlet. She then says softly, "let go". How can I. This for me, is modernized, Golden Age of Hollywood stuff. Dare I say that it could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Adaline you aged me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw a early screening of this movie last night. I so wanted to love it.This movie had the setup to be great entertainment with drama,romance, a bit of the unbelievable(immortality). Somehow for me it fell flat. I feel like the actors did their parts very well but I just didn't really feel much of a romance, but I think this was more due to the storyline. I wished I could have felt happy for Adaline but I found sadly I just didn't even care.*Spoiler* Really odd baseball joke that Ellis uses to try and get Adaline to laugh so she'll lose a bet and have dinner with him. No one in the theater got it. It was not a short joke either. Waste of time.*Spoiler* Adaline gets in another car accident toward the end of the movie, is thrown out the window is found by bystander who don't start CPR until Ellis does? Then she is the hospital looking good- no worse for the wear.*Spoiler* The comet that William named after Adaline apparently finally arrives and has something to do with her immortality( we don't really know what, very confusing)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tragic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tragedy is not the story's content, but the humdrum mess they made of it. A silly scientific explanation for Adeline's frozen longevity is a promising beginning. Slow shots, an awkward manner and dated dress set us up for what could have been an interesting tale of an identity adrift in time. And then the guy walks in. I'm really at a loss to imagine why anyone thinks these male romantic characters are supposed to be anything we can connect with. Who, in any kind of life, pursues a woman so relentlessly, throwing charm and vulnerability and persistence at their target of affection? He's as one dimensional as the scrap of paper he was imagined on. I know this is fiction, a fantasy, but still, some credibility...Sex in the city did better. Fortunately Harrison Ford does a better job as the long lost love, and the change in tone as he arrives on the scene mitigates to some extend the schmaltz. Predictable, but welcome.The soundtrack was excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The two important love stories don't shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie isn't rated high because of its merits, but because of the popularity of the lead actors. Because the story pretty much falls flat. There were just two important love stories which had to be told, but somehow we as a audience do not get time to get emotionally involved in either of them. But maybe thats because even if you would dive into it you would find that Adeline's motivations don't add up. Because why would it be dangerous to share your secret with the person you love most? That doesn't seem like a realistic fear. And if that is somehow realistic, make us believe that! Show us betrayal, show us the consequences of being found out, show us...well anything!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eternal Youth: A Literally Timeless Theme Revisited Once Again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The quest for eternal youth has a very long history in literature, history and movies, starting with Homer's The Odyssey. When the hero Odysseus is offered eternal youth by Calypso. Unlike the hero of this movie Adeline Bowman, who has this curse thrust on her, Odysseus gets to choose, and opts for mortality. Good choice. Aside from vampire movies that deal with the "undead", the theme of eternal youth has long been a favorite in movies, going right back to the 30's with "Lost Horizon" starring Ronald Colman, wherein the survivors of a plane crash land in Shangra-La, where no one gets older and no one gets out, at least if they want to stay young. In our time, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button released only seven years ago has the same feel as this movie: the theme of eternal youth is the hook on which modern viewer can ponder the more common problem of relationships. In that movie love's tricky path is made harder by the fact that one person is getting older and the other person is getting younger. Not eternal youth exactly, but the same general problem.People spend a lot money and time trying to prolong their youth and look younger than they are, but that impulse is very different from wanting to be immortal. Not surprisingly, all stories about eternal youth seem required to present it as a curse and not a piece of luck, almost as if to reassure ourselves somehow, that though we all fear and are in denial of death, the alternative is even worse.The Age of Adeline upholds this tradition of seeing eternal youth as a curse, not a blessing. When Adeline Bowman (Blake Lively) is 29, she has an accident that effectively (and not so believably) freezes her age. Her way of dealing with this problem is to change her identity and location every ten years, moving around the country with her daughter, who continues to age normally, and avoiding any intimate relationships. When we find her in modern day San Francisco, she maintains a quiet life as a librarian. On one New Years Eve, she meets Ellis, who by habit she politely rebuffs. Eventually he is able to break through her protective shell, though one weakness of the movie is that their interactions are so wooden that it's hard to believe Adeline would risk her hard earned anonymity for a guy who has such a nebbish approach. We never really get a good idea about why she goes for this guy, who offers her quaint book titles or tour or San Francisco's archaeological sites. She finally agrees to go out with him if he can make her laugh, but there is nothing worse than being put on notice for humor. She does laugh at his awful joke, perhaps out of pity. So handsome. So Rich. So Boring. When things move along to a tepid lukewarm romance, he offers a shattering revelation: "I may be in love with you."Later on in the movie when (WARNING: SPOILER ALERT) Adeline meets Ellis's retired scientist Dad played by Harrison Ford, it is revealed that he was romantically involved with her as a young man. Those brief scenes with the Adeline and the younger William Jones (who even sounds like a younger Harrison Ford, played by Anthony Ingruber) have more chemistry than the other 90 minutes of Ellis and Andeline that we are forced to endure.One of the reasons I wanted to see this movie was to see Harrison Ford again, who I have liked best when he has been allowed to play funny even in an adventure role. Remember him in his ill-fitting Amish clothes, or having a forbidden dance with Kelly McGillis in the barn in "Witness"? Or when he whips out his gun as Indiana Jones when the whole rope thing is just too tiresome? In this movie we get none of that old verve, and he is merely a doddering old man whose big moment comes when he throws the car keys to his son and says, "Go get her son!" That can't have been easy for a guy whose once shot across the universe at hyper speed.Speaking of veteran actors, Ellen Burstyn plays Adeline's aging daughter Flemming. At actual age of 83, eleven years older than Ford, she brings more zest to her role than all the other actors combined. That we see her now in the role of someone who must grow old while her own daughter remain frozen in time is a particularly fortuitous casting choice when one considers some of Burstyn's career making roles, such as the single Mom in "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" or the once a year girlfriend of Alan Alda in "Same Time Next Year". Her strength has always been in showing the rest of us how to make lemonade from lemons and this movie is no exception.If you like to think about the question of eternal youth than you might like this movie, but I would suggest seeing it with someone who you can talk about it with, because that conversation will be more interesting than the movie itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of time and money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so excited to watch this film ever since I saw the poster in the shopping mall, it seemed so interesting, like 'classic-to-be' kind of movie. But then, they made a mistake at the very beginning of the film - the narrator. So unnecessary. Also, I think Adaline revealed herself too soon, and although it is said that she doesn't age, it's never mentioned that she's immortal of something. So I think it's a little bit unlikely for 107 years old woman that she doesn't have health problems or that all of a sudden she doesn't get old when that accident happens. Similar to this movie is Forever Young (with Mel Gibson as main character). Those who have watched it will know what I'm talking about - the movie has similar plot, but with more realistic development of a story and ending. Adaline needs more action, it's too monotonous, and it's cliché. I hope I helped (and didn't spoil too much).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I guess I have to mention the narration. I'll never understand why movies have unnecessary narration that is only good for killing the mood. It's hard to enjoy a film when it just spoon feeds you things. That's the one thing that really annoyed me, but beyond that it is just dull. Slow pace should try to compensate with a good plot. Age of Adaline does not have that. It just predictably drags on to an ending you could see from a mile away.The biggest problem is that Adaline just comes on the scene and she is perfect. We don't see her grow as a character, change through the times or have anything that makes her interesting. It might have worked in film that focused on the plot, but a character focused film can't have a main character be this boring.Other characters are okay but they just seem like accessories to show how amazing Adaline is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Century of living barely tapped into.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harrison Ford is the only redeeming quality the film had to offer. Michiel Huisman, the guy that played Ford's son was over the top, his character anyway. He resembled the hero of a classic chick flick. A wealthy philanthropic giving devilishly handsome man who becomes infatuated over a woman he briefly met at a socialite party. After his relentless pursuit to woo her, our main character, Blake Lively, has no choice but to succumb to his charm. Then after an extended 2 week relationship, he decides it's the perfect time to introduce her to the parents. During their weekend visit with the family, our hero falls in love to the point of no return and asks our main character for her hand in marriage. I kept waiting for his character to unveil his true identity as a government agent or something else. Instead it's a story about a fantasy all girls are told at the age of 10. The entire story is written for unsophisticated adults. I was offended with the writer and wanted to walk out. Anyone could have made this story better than it was. This film will go into the Netflix archive and be forever forgotten.</fullReview>
